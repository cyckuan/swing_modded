BRAIN SURGEON DENIES THAT HE MADE MISTAKES WHILE OPERATING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Brandishing medical textbooks and x-rays, his voice
choked with anguish, the Staten Island neurosurgeon accused by the
State Department of Health of operating on the wrong side of a
patient's brain and other medical blunders Wednesday night
vehemently denied nearly every allegation made by the department.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy interview in a Manhattan coffee shop, Dr. Ehud
Arbit, accompanied by his wife and lawyer, categorically denied
that he committed any of the medical errors cited in a State Health
Department report issued on Monday. He contended that he is the
target of a few disgruntled hospital workers who have systemically
tried to destroy his career for reasons he said he cannot fathom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere in our hospital is so poisonous,'' said Arbit,
a thin, soft-spoken man, ``and this kind of malicious behavior has
been exercised not only against me but other doctors as well.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``In my opinion, there were no aberrations in any of
these operations.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the state cited Staten Island University Hospital for
40 violations and fined it $80,000 for failing to monitor Arbit.
The fine was the stiffest imposed on a hospital in the state in 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   The state issued its report after interviewing various hospital
workers, outlining five operations that were performed by Arbit
where its investigators concluded serious medical errors were made.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious case, according to the report, state
investigators found that Arbit failed to take CAT scans into the
operating room where a 54-year-old patient with brain and lung
tumors awaited surgery. The report states that as a result, Arbit
made an incision on the left cerebellum, only to be told by a
physician's assistant that she recalled that the tumor was on the
right side. The report goes on to say that Arbit told the
physician's assistant that he did not see a tumor on the left side,
so he decided to proceed with his work on the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outrageous lie,'' Arbit said, denying any
conversation of the sort with the assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the X-ray of the patient, Johnnie Artis, a Staten
Island security guard who died a few days after his operation,
Arbit said that the tumor area covered both sides of the brain, and
added that he had created a sort of door on the back of the
patient's head in which the point of entry was not relevant. To
buttress his point, he referred to a neurology textbook that shows
the procedure as he says it was performed.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a 21-year-old patient with a brain tumor was
left to bleed excessively, the state said. The doctor switched from
performing a biopsy, which was not proving effective, to brain
surgery, catching other staff members off guard and ill prepared.
Because the anesthesiologist had not anticipated more than a
biopsy, he had not prepared to replace large quantities of blood,
the report said. Arbit countered that he was only an assistant in
the procedure, called in at the last minute by another doctor who
was foundering, and that the bleeding was in fact not excessive.
</P>
<P>
   A third case involved a patient requiring spinal surgery. An
anesthesiologist and a physician's assistant told Health Department
investigators that Arbit's hand slipped and lacerated the patient's
spinal cord, leaving her partly paralyzed, a charge that
particularly outraged Arbit and his wife, Dr. Rose Varon, who put
her head in her hands when discussing the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the patient not paralyzed, but he did not sever her
cord, Arbit said, and had he done so in that particular type of
surgery, it would have been medically impossible for her to be
paralyzed. ``There was some pressure on the spinal cord,'' he said.
``I never slipped. There was no laceration.''
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, the state found that the doctor and his
staff failed to perform the proper follow-up blood work on a
62-year-old patient, which Arbit said was also unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   In the final case, state investigators said that a patient
complained of weakness in her hands after an operation. A CAT scan
revealed loose screws on a plate that had been implanted in the
patient's spine along the back of the neck, the state noted. Arbit
failed to replace the screws properly, the state said, at one point
asking a representative from a medical equipment company his
opinion on whether he thought the plate was positioned correctly.
</P>
<P>
   While Arbit said that a screw had indeed come lose, he insisted
that he corrected the problem easily and that the patient was no
worse for wear. ``I totally deny asking the assistance of this
gentleman,'' he said in reference to the medical representative,
who are commonly present during operations as technical support.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit said Wednesday night that a physician's assistant and at
least one anesthesiologist have been complaining about him, without
merit, to hospital administrators ever since he arrived at the
hospital. One anesthesiologist, who he would not identify, follows
him around with a chart and takes constant notes, he said
</P>
<P>
   These findings are particularly damaging to Arbit, who was chief
of neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center until
1995, when he mistakenly operated on the healthy right side of the
brain of the mother of an Indian movie star. A cancerous tumor had
been found on the left side of her brain. Arbit was fired from
Sloan-Kettering. The state gave him one year's probation in that
case.
</P>
<P>
   Staten Island University Hospital opened its doors to the
doctor, who has written hundreds of articles in peer reviewed
medical journals and is the editor of a textbook on neurosurgery.
His case is being reviewed now by the state's office of
professional conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit's lawyer, Anthony Scher, said Wednesday night: ``The
release by the department of health is ridiculous and distorted and
we believe we will win.'' &QL;

SCHOOLS' REPAIR TAB EXPLODES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER AND ROBBIE SHERWOOD  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - The condition of Arizona's schools is worse than
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The tab to repair dilapidated schools under the court-mandated
Students FIRST program could hit $1.5 billion, a figure more than
10 times higher than initial estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like finding the house you've saved up for your whole
life is built on a toxic waste dump and you have to clean up the
whole site,'' said Senate Appropriations Chairman Randall Gnant,
R-Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have downplayed estimates for school repairs, but many
at the Capitol, including Gnant, have quietly been preparing for a
potential financial crisis. Gnant puts the figure in the $1.5
billion range.
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a leap from Superintendent of Public Instruction
Lisa Graham Keegan's initial $175 million estimate to bring schools
up to minimum standards two years ago. Earlier this year, as
technicians descended on schools to assess the conditions, the
School Facilities Board in charge of the repairs began floating a
projected price tag in the $900 million neighborhood with the
potential to go much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Geiger, executive director of the facilities board,
cautioned that there was no way to tell until the mandated survey
of schools in need comes back, probably in April.
</P>
<P>
   If the price tag is as high as Gnant expects, it will be too
much money to use state-issued revenue bonds, a plan Gov. Jane Hull
favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means we're going to have to seek an additional revenue
source,'' Gnant said. ``I don't think anyone in their right mind
would say we can get that out of normal revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: a tax or some other designated money source.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any other way they're going to meet that challenge
even if our economy continues to do well,'' Gnant said. ``The
problem is no one in government likes to look beyond the next
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the governor's office said they are aware of the
swelling projections and are looking at ways to come up with the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor understands that it's going to take significant
additional resources to get the job done, and we're looking at a
lot of ways to do that,'' said Jaime Molera, the governor's chief
lobbyist. ``But she's not going to back off her commitment to make
Students FIRST work.''
</P>
<P>
   As for borrowing money to build the schools, Hull disagrees with
Gnant's assessment that it can't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonding for long-term debt is a sensible thing to do,'' Molera
said. ``Any form of government and private corporation would do the
same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the money were there next year, there would be no way
logistically to pay for all the fixes at once. Instead, the state
would more likely spread the improvements beyond the negotiated
2003 deadline to fix the schools, Gnant said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Hogan, an attorney for the Center for Law in the Public
Interest who brought the suit that prompted Students FIRST, warned
against watering down the standards or delaying action. Hogan
believes the school construction standards are already too weak and
called the 2003 deadline ``non-negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We negotiated and bargained for 2003 _ that was five years out
at the time,'' Hogan said. ``We always told the Legislature this
would be an expensive proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers chose to ignore school repairs even though Arizona has
been in a state of sustained prosperity, Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like somebody's been trying to conceal this,'' he
said. ``It's been a case of intentionally ignoring it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan said the revenue bonding approach makes ``some sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chris Cummiskey, D-central Phoenix, agreed, saying it may
be the only politically feasible way to come up with the money.
``Even the most ardent opponent of bonding will have to reconsider
his position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger, too, thinks that revenue bonding is an attractive
option. And, despite the potential setbacks, he said Students FIRST
is working better and quicker than the old system.
</P>
<P>
   More than $700 million in new construction has already been
approved through Students FIRST, resulting in 66 schools.
Individual school districts holding bond elections to build the
same number of schools would have taken longer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Geiger said, is the program must be funded. And
lowering standards to build anything less than adequate schools is
not an option, though he does feel the 2003 deadline is
unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to do some later.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE RELIGION WARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 2:
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, having assured Southern Protestants that he would not
take his orders from the Church of Rome, John F. Kennedy became the
country's first Catholic president, and for the next 20 years
Americans comfortably assumed that sectarianism had been taken off
the political table. In the 1976 campaign, Jimmy Carter added
``born again'' to the political lexicon. But it was not until
Ronald Reagan allied himself with the Christian right in 1980 that
religious leaders began to assert a larger role in American
politics in general and the Republican Party in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain has now chosen to attack some of those leaders
as ideological despots. Although he has withdrawn an earlier
characterization of them as ``evil,'' he continues to insist that
they are exerting an unhealthy influence on the GOP. Gov. George W.
Bush has fought back, and the result is that religious skirmishing
has assumed a prominence that many voters find disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   As most people now know, the origins of the fight lie in Bush's
visit to Bob Jones University, a reactionary South Carolina
institution that espouses anti-Catholic views and opposes
interracial dating. In the Michigan primary, McCain's campaign
forces used the visit to suggest that Bush was anti-Catholic. When
McCain then delivered his broadside in Virginia against the
religious right, Bush responded that McCain was pitting one
religion against another.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes it important to keep one's eye on the
essential point _ namely, that McCain is trying to deliver a
message about the religious right that cannot be dismissed, as Bush
is trying to do, as intolerance on McCain's part. The essence of
that message is that the Christian right wing is as much a
political force as a religious movement, and that its leaders have
exercised a bullying influence within the Republican Party. They
also use bloc voting and substantial financial resources to single
out politicians in both parties who do not share their
religion-based views on abortion and school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   In labeling Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell ``agents of
intolerance,'' McCain is accusing them of using their religious
following as a weapon of political intimidation. And he is saying,
in effect, that he is sick of it. He has seen his party and its
platform held hostage to the religious right in two successive
elections, and he has seen it go down to defeat both times.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this bold argument and the harshness of his language
have hurt McCain among the more conservative Republican voters. He
is hoping that it will help him among independents and in the New
York primary. But even if it does not, he will have made a point to
his fellow party members that badly needed making. The emergence of
the religious right as the enforcers of the GOP has skewed the
party's nomination process and its issues base and eroded the
spirit of tolerance that Americans rightly celebrated after the
1960 election.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Under growing fire over his recent attacks on
leaders of the Christian right, Sen. John McCain Wednesay
apologized for remarks he had made the day before in which he
characterized Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell as forces of
evil. He said those remarks were intended as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating that he ``disagrees with the political message and
tactics'' of Robertson and Falwell, McCain added in a prepared
statement, ``I do not consider them evil, and I regret that my flip
remark may have mistakenly created that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my campaign,'' he said, ``I often joke about Luke
Skywalker, evil empires and death stars. It was in that vein that I
used the phrase yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's apology focused on remarks he had made on his campaign
bus that amplified on a speech he gave on Monday, calling Robertson
and Falwell ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking on the bus the next day, he said: ``To stand up to the
forces of evil, that's my job, and I can't steer the Republican
Party if those two individuals have the influence they have on the
party today.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain issued the apology shortly after his most prominent
supporter on the Christian right, Gary L. Bauer, harshly criticized
him for his recent attacks on Falwell and Robertson, and suggested
that the attacks could cost him the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a staunch opponent of abortion who endorsed McCain after
ending his own candidacy for the presidency, insisted that he was
not withdrawing his endorsement. But, he said in an interview
``there is no way that any candidate can get the presidential
nomination if there is a perception that the candidate is hostile
to voters concerned about the breakdown of values.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's apology late Wednesday was a clear reflection of a
campaign suddenly on the defensive after losing three contests the
day before to Gov. George W. Bush. And with the race possibly
hanging on the results of next Tuesday's contests in more than a
dozen states, McCain can ill afford to have his campaign consumed
by controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast Wednesday, was clearly buoyed by his lopsided
victories in Virginia, Washington State and North Dakota, telling
an audience in suburban Atlanta, ``You might notice I walked in
with a little spring in my step.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the results in those states brought him, ``a step
closer to ending the Clinton era in Washington, D.C.'' And through
a cross-country campaign day that brought Bush from Georgia to
Missouri to California, he put a heavy emphasis on his signature
theme of education, an issue with broad appeal to the kinds of
moderate voters who will be important in California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also moved to press his advantage over McCain
in California, announcing that he would participate in a debate
there in person to underscore his commitment to one of the most
critical states in next Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   But as it has for days in the Republican campaign, religion
continued to occupy a central spot in the day of Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   At a town hall meeting in Riverside Wednesday morning McCain
sought to assure voters that his harsh comments recently about both
Robertson and Falwell were not an indictment of all Christian
conservatives in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about a couple of individuals,'' McCain said.
``The overwhelming majority of people who are members of the
Christian right are good and decent people. I think they've been
led astray by a couple of individuals that, very frankly, have done
some things which I find reprehensible in American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush continued to hammer McCain for phone calls the senator's
campaign had made to Catholic voters alerting them to Bush's South
Carolina appearance at Bob Jones University, which forbids
interracial dating and whose leaders have espoused anti-Catholic
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``John ought to be ashamed of running that kind of campaign,''
Bush said. ``It's going to backfire on him.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the Bush campaign is still working to minimize
any damage done with Catholic voters by McCain's broadsides, the
crowd sitting as a backdrop to Bush Wednesday morning near Atlanta
included a woman prominently at the governor's side who held a
placard saying, ``I'm Catholic and I'm for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took the opportunity to criticize the leader of the Nation
of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, but not the leaders of the religious
right whom McCain, in a fiery speech Monday, had branded along with
Farrakhan as ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis Farrakhan preaches hate,'' Bush said. ``Louis Farrakhan
is a hateful person.'' He said Farrakhan preached an ``anti-Semitic
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also talked about Farrakhan in criticizing McCain, saying
it was wrong for the senator to mention him and the Rev. Al
Sharpton in his criticism of Robertson and Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comparison of these respected conservative leaders to the
demagogic race-baiter Al Sharpton and the anti-Semitic Louis
Farrakhan was unfounded and unwise,'' Bauer said. ``Such rhetoric
serves only to divide the party and plays into the hands of the
liberal elite to falsely depict Christian conservatives as
intolerant extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's criticism of McCain Wednesday came as somewhat of a
surprise, given the fact that he stood near McCain in Virginia
Beach on Monday as he delivered the speech in which he attacked
Robertson and Falwell. And he later commented on the speech without
distancing himself from it.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, he explained: ``I didn't get a chance to see that
speech until it was too late to do anything about it. It had
already been passed out to the press.'' McCain's aides challenged
the statement, saying that Bauer not only reviewed the speech in
advance but added a paragraph to it.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he was not pressured by fellow Christian
conservatives to disavow McCain's remarks. ``I just think that
Senator McCain's larger message, which is pro-life and pro-family,
is getting lost in this controversy between him and Robertson.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking with reporters on his campaign bus Wednesday afternoon,
McCain insisted that he stood by the speech he gave on Monday and
that he apologized only for his remarks suggesting that Falwell and
Robertson were having an ``evil influence'' on the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not changing any of my speech,'' he said. ``I'm sure that
Gary and I will have an understanding about the speech and what was
intended and what was intended by my remarks yesterday. It was a
light-hearted attempt at humor and sometimes it isn't interpreted
that way.''

OKLAHOMA STARTS FAST, EASES BY TEXAS A&AMP;M

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION _ Having fallen prey to unforeseen events here
last season, Oklahoma need not have been warned about possible
pitfalls that await the inattentive in the confines of Reed Arena,
the Aggies' January ambush of Oklahoma State notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sooners could have taken Texas A&AMP;M with one eye open
last night.
</P>
<P>
   Holding as much as a 21-point lead in the first half and
surviving a mini-Aggies run in the second by hauling out their
3-point arsenal, the 21st-ranked Sooners (23-5) easily handled A&AMP;M,
77-59. The victory kept them in the running for a first-round bye
in next week's Big 12 tournament at 11-4, a game up on Kansas
(10-5) and Missouri (10-5), who play each other in the league's
last regular-season game in Lawrence, Kan., on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were definitely concerned about this game,'' OU forward
Eduardo Najera said. ``We knew they were going to be ready. But if
we were also ready I knew we would win this game. That's why I
wanted to get us a big lead in the first half so we could relax and
have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Najera was a workhorse in the first half. When coach Kelvin
Sampson called him to the bench for a breather with 1:40 left after
he had hit three consecutive mid-range jump shots, he had 17
points. So did the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eduardo kind of took the game over,'' said A&AMP;M center Aaron
Jack, back in the lineup after missing the Texas game on Saturday
with a viral infection. ``But he's a great player and that's what
great players are supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Najera finished with 20 points. Bernard King led the Aggies
(7-19, 3-12) with 15.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M caused the Sooners some concern, turning up their defensive
pressure and cutting a 40-19 halftime lead to 51-41 when Jerald
Brown hit a 3-pointer with 11:55 to play. But with the Aggies in a
zone, Sampson sent Tim Heskett into the game. He hit a 3-pointer
from the left corner to stop an 8-0 run and after an Aggies bucket,
guard J.R. Raymond followed suit. When Heskett sank his second trey
in less than four minutes, Oklahoma was back up, 60-45, and A&AMP;M
never again threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners now turn their attention to Saturday's Bedlam II
match at Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get back, relax and then get focused because
that's a big game for us,'' Najera said. ``We have to go in there
with a win mentality.''

EDITORIAL: ANOTHER DAY OF GUN VIOLENCE

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 2:
</P>
<P>
   It just keeps getting more senseless. On Tuesday a first grader
in Michigan shot and killed a 6-year-old classmate. On Wednesday an
adult gunman in Pennsylvania shot a worker at his apartment
building, then fired on customers at two fast-food restaurants,
killing two people and wounding three. He fled into a nearby office
building before finally surrendering. These new eruptions of
violence, coming just a day apart, only confirm the urgency of
solving the nation's gun problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gun tragedies have a devastating effect on individuals, families
and communities. But in a larger sense the entire nation is
victimized when parents must fear little children toting revolvers
to elementary school to shoot other children, and a routine lunch
trip to McDonald's can end in bloodshed when a deranged person with
a gun goes on a rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The need for stronger gun control laws has never been plainer.
But as President Clinton aptly said on Wednesday, the nation's
elected leaders have not done all they can ``to keep these guns
away from criminals and children.'' He called on Congress to
approve gun safety legislation languishing in a House-Senate
conference committee before lawmakers begin a long recess at the
end of next week. In light of this week's events, it hardly seems
an unreasonable request.

GORE, BRADLEY TONE DOWN SNIPING IN DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In what was probably the final debate of the fight
for the Democratic presidential nomination, Al Gore and Bill
Bradley adopted a newly conciliatory tone Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   They attempted to paint a bright picture of how they would be a
more tolerant chief executive than either major Republican
contender.
</P>
<P>
   The face-off came as Bradley, winless against Gore, faces
questions about how long he realistically can remain in the race.
Bradley has pledged to stay in the fight at least through the mass
of primaries coming Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Few delegates have been selected so far, Bradley said in the
debate, and Tuesday ``is takeoff day for me.'' Although the two
Democrats in earlier debates had sniped and snapped at each other,
they seemed to find an unusual amount of common ground in support
of gay rights, judicial activism and the need for federal oversight
of police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore dueled briefly again about how conservative the
vice president's record was as a member of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has evolved. I'm glad he has evolved,'' Bradley said of
Gore's move to firmly support abortion rights. But, Bradley said,
Gore's seeming inability to deal with past votes and positions ``is
relevant to consideration'' by voters.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and Gore praised recent criticism from Republican
contender John McCain, a senator from Arizona, of religious right
leaders Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, who are supporters of the
Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The far right has gone too far time after time after time on
social issues and has tried to dominate this country with their
particular viewpoint,'' Bradley said. ``I think it's important to
resist that. I've always resisted that. ... I've never voted in
ways that they wanted. And I would be very emphatic in saying that
religion should not be a part of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he agreed with McCain on issues such as campaign
finance reform and reigning in ``big tobacco,'' but the vice
president noted that McCain and Bush oppose most abortion rights
and ``neither had the guts to speak out against the Confederate
flag'' atop the South Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican party today is in the midst of an identity
crisis,'' Gore said with quiet glee. ``They're trying to figure out
who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately before the debate, Gore won the endorsement of the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, a civil rights leader who twice has sought the
Democratic nomination. Speaking to reporters at the debate media
center, Jackson, with Bradley in mind, said: ``At some point we
have to fold our tents and create a bigger tent.'' Jackson said the
vice president, a Tennessean, had ``steadfastly shunned the
demagoguery in the South'' arising from the flying of the
Confederate flag over South Carolina's capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley lost to the vice president in the Iowa caucuses, New
Hampshire primary and, on Tuesday, in a nonbinding presidential
preference vote in Washington state that the former senator had
hoped would resuscitate his campaign. Instead, he lost to Gore by a
margin of about 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made it clear that he would let Bradley make up his own
mind about leaving the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking to the voters, not to him,'' a sweat-soaked Gore
called out as he jogged along a Pacific Ocean beach in Santa Monica
with daughter Kristin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their belief that the nomination effectively will soon
be Gore's, the vice president's top advisers have cautioned him
against appearing too confident or cocky. Gore and Bradley left
immediately after the debate for overnight flights to New York, the
second-biggest prize in the mass of primaries on Tuesday. Answering
questions from undecided California voters, Internet users and
reporters, the two Democratic contenders covered a range of issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gore said he would nominate Supreme Court justices who see the
Constitution as ``a living and breathing document.'' Bradley said
his nominees could not be ``someone locked into an original
interpretation.'' Both answers would put them far to the left of
either Bush or McCain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Both, although opposing same-sex marriages, criticized a
measure that will be on the California ballot Tuesday to define
marriage as the union of a man and woman. Both Democrats supported
domestic-partnership arrangements in which same-sex couples could
have legal rights of married people. Gore called the initiative
facing voters a ``mean-spirited wedge.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In the wake of police corruption cases in Los Angeles and
brutality incidents in New York, both Democrats expressed support
for an increased federal role in overseeing local law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Bradley's defeat in Washington, a state where he
had put in almost a full week of campaign time and poured tens of
thousands of dollars into television commercials, his aides engaged
in the rankest rationalizations. Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said
that while the campaign was ``a little disappointed,'' he contended
that ``the energy, the enthusiasm'' from Washington state would
``carry us forward very assertively'' into the busiest week of the
primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former professional basketball star, put on his game
face as he prepared for the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Twain put it best when he said, `Reports of my demise are
greatly exaggerated,''' Bradley said. ``We're going on to March 7.
We're moving fast.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised a spirited campaign in several states with primaries
next week, including New York, Massachusetts and Maryland. But Sen.
Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat and one of Bradley's few
congressional supporters, said that beneath the political spin his
former colleague was realistic and ``knows that it's going to take
a miracle for him to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ranking adviser was quoted as saying that Bradley would
withdraw from the race if he fares poorly again Tuesday. Bradley's
outlook for several of those contests, including the biggest, in
California, is not much better. A new Los Angeles Times poll of
likely Democratic voters in the Golden State showed Bradley
trailing not only Gore 54-11 percent but also lagging McCain, who
had 20 percent support in the Democratic sampling, and tied with
Bush, who also drew 11 percent support from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to prove that he was serious about pressing on for at
least another week, Bradley began to air four new television
commercials in a snappier, more urgent black-and-white format. He
also taped a five-minute national spot to air Thursday night on
CBS. A new Spanish-language ad targeted Hispanic voters in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The California debate, broadcast nationally by co-sponsor CNN
and held in an auditorium at the headquarters of co-sponsor Los
Angeles Times, came eight days after Gore and Bradley engaged in
the most raucous face-off of either party during the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   From the stage of the Apollo Theater in New York, the two
Democrats traded political jabs. To a continuing chorus of boos and
catcalls from the audience in the venerable theater in the heart of
Harlem, Bradley said Gore was a conservative when it came to
abortion rights, gun control and federal tax treatment for
segregated private schools, and the vice president responded by
contending Bradley was ``desperate'' and willing to divide the
party for personal political gain.

BRADLEY, GORE HOLD GENTLEMANLY DEBATE IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Bill
Bradley Wednesday night waged their final debate before the crucial
round of Democratic primaries Tuesday with a breezy give-and-take
that belied the underlying tension between them and the enormity of
the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley resisted nearly every opportunity over 90
minutes to criticize each other on the hot-button issues that
sparked fiery skirmishes between them in earlier debates.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout came as Gore entered the forum with a large lead
in the polls after weeks of brutal infighting. The debate's mild
tone denied Bradley the ``miracle'' breakthrough that his top
supporters predicted he would need to help keep his wounded
campaign alive past Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore wary of appearing overconfident or condescending and
Bradley striving not to look desperate or petty, the two spent
almost as much time jabbing themselves as they did each other.
</P>
<P>
   Gore even sought the high ground when confronted with a question
that is reverberating within the Democratic Party: Should Bradley,
winless in the first four contests and apparently fading fast, pull
out of the race?
</P>
<P>
   With apparent disdain, Gore replied, ``One of the things Senator
Bradley and I agree on . . . is that we prefer to get questions on
substance rather than process. The purpose of a campaign is also
for us . . . to have an ennobling, educational, revealing
discussion about all of the problems we face.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, for his part, said only 250,000 voters have
participated in the Democratic contest to date, compared to the 8.5
million who will be eligible to vote next week. And he insisted he
will continue fighting at least through Tuesday, which he called
``the kickoff day for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore scored a coup before the debate when the Rev. Jesse L.
Jackson, entered the media center to announce his endorsement of
the vice president. Jackson called Gore ``the most qualified and
experienced candidate in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's endorsement was another blow to Bradley, who argues he
is more attuned to minority concerns than Gore and better suited to
address them.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, hosted by the Los Angeles Times and CNN, was the
ninth between the candidates and provided viewers who will cast
ballots in 16 Democratic contests Tuesday the last chance to
examine the candidates through an unfiltered lens.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than savaging each other, as they did in their recent
showdown at the Apollo Theater in Harlem and previous forums, the
two devoted considerable time to praising their wives, discussing
Internet technology and teaming up for attacks on the Republican
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the candidates took some of the harshest shots of the
campaign at themselves. Bradley, in describing the role his wife,
Ernestine, would play if he were president, cited her willingness
to challenge him, particulary when he is performing below her
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the one who tells me, you're terrible,'' Bradley said.
``She's told me that a few times in this campaign, I must say.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has been widely ridiculed for once suggesting that he
invented the Internet, poked fun at himself for the misstatement.
And Bradley refrained from piling on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting in the campaign to make that joke about you
inventing the Internet,'' he said. ``I'm glad you did it and not
me.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore and Bradley, time and again, professed their agreement
with each other's positions rather than strive to point out
distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Only near the end of the debate did the two men criticize each
other, and then only after they were pointedly provoked into doing
so by one of the panelists.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his past attacks on Gore's voting record on gun
control and abortion, Bradley took the bait, though he kept his
comments tame.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you run for president, your record is important. And that
is precisely what I was saying when I pointed out those aspects,''
Bradely said. ``He has evolved. I'm glad he has evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``if you are consistent on matters of principle, that is
relevant,'' the former senator added.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has accused Gore of opposing legal abortion, because he
voted as a congressman against Medicaid funding for abortions for
poor women and writing to a local constituent that abortion is
``arguably the taking of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also has gone after Gore for being weaker, in the past,
on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Gore stated simply that he is in favor of abortion rights and
wants to ``take on'' the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley kept going and attacked Gore for voting ``five
times'' for tax-exempt status for schools that discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   That comment made Gore bristle for the first time during the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry you brought that up, because I thought we disposed
of it in the last debate,'' said an irritated Gore. The vice
president insisted he had voted against an amendment that backed
quotas, and ``I oppose quotas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been using the issue of Bob Jones University, which
does not allow interracial dating, to paint the Republican
candidates as weak on civil rights. The vice president was clearly
annoyed that the issue had been turned against him, if only very
briefly.
</P>
<P>
   The two spent most of the debate, however, agreeing with each
others' opinions. Both said they opposed Proposition 22 in
California, a measure that would specifically outlaw gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley said they do not support gay marriage in
the traditional legal sense, but do back a ``domestic partnership''
law.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates expressed some approval of comments made by
Republican contender John McCain, a senator from Arizona, railing
against the preachings of right-wing Christian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The far right has gone too far. Religion should not be part of
politics,'' Bradely said. Gore was more measured in his comments.
``I agree with the speech as far as it went,'' he said of McCain's
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Both debaters voiced concern for the plight of disabled people
and financially strapped members of the military. Both defended
their separate meetings with the Rev. Al Sharpton, noting that the
New York clergyman is seen as a leader by many blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Both men also said they would appoint Supreme Court justices who
would interpret the Constitution as a living, breathing document,
implying that they would name jurists who support the Roe v. Wade
decision legalizing abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pointed out that Kate Michelman, president of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, was in the
audience. The group endorsed Gore, much to the frustration of the
Bradley campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Bradley shrugged off his dismal showing in
the Washington state primary, saying, ``Mark Twain put it best when
he said, `Reports of my demise are greatly exaggerated.' We're
going on to March 7, and we're moving fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had an unusually light schedule, heading to the beach in
the morning for a leisurely jog with his daughter Kristin. Asked if
he thought Bradley should withdraw from the race, Gore said, ``I'm
campaigning in California. I'm talking to voters, not to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley limited his public schedule to a stop at a health center
in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, where he renewed his call
for a comprehensive overhaul of the health care system that would
provide access to coverage for every US citizen. Of the 44 million
Americans without health coverage, he said, 11 million are
Hispanic.

BUSH MUFFS LETTERMAN'S LATE NIGHT OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Gov. George W. Bush showed up by satellite on
``Late Show with David Letterman'' on Wednesday night, he was
smiling, good-natured, prepared to laugh at himself. Imagine, then,
what a comic flop he had to be to elicit groans and boos from the
audience, as he did with jokes about Letterman's recent heart
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   With Letterman sitting on stage in New York and Bush in a
conference room in St. Louis, there was a slight satellite delay
between the questions and answers, which had the effect of making
Bush look a little slow on the uptake. That was the last thing he
needed, since the point of the appearance was to send the message:
I am not a pinhead (to use one of the typical Letterman
descriptions of him).
</P>
<P>
   Late-night shows allow candidates to present their most casual,
engaging guises, and are so important to campaigns that while the
Letterman show had Bush on Wednesday night, Sen. John McCain
appeared on ``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' and both
overshadowed a Democratic debate on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   But the Letterman show offers the biggest risks and rewards,
because appearances are preceded by weeks of barbs, and a guest
shot can be transforming. Bush's job was to make his image seem
smarter than usual. That didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   His approach sometimes eerily echoed that in the early debates.
He was slow to ad-lib; at times he offered one-word answers then
stared blankly into the camera. (Letterman asked if he was tired of
jokes about flunking a pop quiz about world leaders. ``Nah,'' said
the governor, and stared.) He forced in canned lines. He only had
five minutes and obviously had a few jokes he was determined to
cram in.
</P>
<P>
   Other lines sounded as if they came off the top of his head, and
they were scary. When Letterman asked exactly what Bush meant by
his often repeated phrase, ``I'm a uniter not a divider,'' the
governor said, ``That means when it comes time to sew up your chest
cavity, we use stitches as opposed to opening it up.'' The audience
booed; Letterman looked baffled; the camera turned to his producer,
Rob Burnett, who shrugged as if to say, ``I don't know what it
means either.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush understood the ground rules: that he was there to laugh at
himself. So he forced in a self-deprecating gimmick. ``I've morphed
on your show from a boob to a dweeb,'' he said, and created a
priceless photo by holding up a T-shirt that read ``Dweebs for
Bush,'' which he said he would like to give Letterman in person.
</P>
<P>
   A face-to-face showdown would have been better all around. There
was so little dynamism in the satellite conversation that at one
point Letterman was looking down at the desk.
</P>
<P>
   And though you can't blame the satellite for everything, the
delay did almost bury Bush's one sharp comeback. ``Who likes
interns better, you or John McCain?'' Letterman asked. It was hard
to hear Bush answer, ``It's the wrong party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will get some second chances soon. He will appear in person
on some future Letterman show, and is to be on ``The Tonight Show''
on Monday. As McCain's appearance on ``Tonight'' proved, where
Letterman and his audience appreciate self-mockery, Leno helps a
guest puff himself up. He introduced his guest as ``Arizona senator
and a war hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, voters can only hope both candidates get better writers
before a State of the Union address comes their way. McCain did a
bad Leno impression, joked about sleeping in the lucky shoes that
helped him win in New Hampshire, and said he and Jesse Ventura had
something in common because McCain wore a feather boa around the
Senate. He did get in the serious information that he will not join
the Reform Party. And he mentioned the ``iron triangle'' of
Washington power he is fighting. That phrase is familiar from news
coverage, but may be fresh to ``Tonight'' viewers, which is part of
the purpose of such appearances. How well such information
registers is a different question.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Tonight'' manner, McCain was smooth and congenial. The
actress Neve Campbell, the first guest, had talked about her
bunions; McCain expressed concern and plugged universal health
care.
</P>
<P>
   On the riskier Letterman show, Bush went up in flames. But the
important thing was that he showed up at all. He proved he could
take a joke and that he knew, in response to the Letterman pop
quiz, who is president of the hair club for men. With the media
stakes so high, only a loser would have ducked the question.

HOW DO YOU FIX LAPD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT,  
 GREG GITTRICH and RICK ORLOV  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ With the LAPD taking full responsibility for
the Rampart scandal, Chief Bernard Parks won broad support Wednesay
to move forward with reforms, but the debate intensified over
whether he can succeed without an outside commission and expanded
civilian oversight.
</P>
<P>
   A Board of Inquiry report compiled by 300 command officers and
investigators was formally released, putting the official stamp on
its finding that a pervasive culture of ``mediocrity'' had poisoned
the department and given rise to the worst corruption scandal in
its history.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, the police commission and a majority of
City Council members agreed, at least for now, to stand behind the
chief and the department's plan of action, as outlined in 108
recommendations in the board report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall a time in government history when a government
agency has made this kind of comprehensive self-criticism and, in
this case, it is devastating,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   With pressure mounting in the last few weeks for an independent
review of the scandal-plagued department, Parks said credit should
be given to the department's forthrightness in admitting and
exposing the depth of its problems. The chief stressed that LAPD
brass should be given a chance to work in tandem with the civilian
Police Commission to rectify the unprecedented scourge of
incompetence and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a two-sided sword,'' Parks said. ``It's not a proud
moment in the sense of what's in the report. But it is a proud
moment in terms of the clarity of what we can report, and in terms
of what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The 362-page report document describes a litany of supervisorial
breakdowns, system failures and disciplinary flaws that allowed a
handful of dirty officers to commit crimes, defy LAPD policies and
frame dozens of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Parks challenged the Los Angeles County District Attorney's
Office to conduct a similar review of its operations in sending
suspects to prison on falsified evidence. Parks said the entire
criminal justice system broke down, not just the police department.
</P>
<P>
   The devastating LAPD Board of Inquiry report marked a huge
paradigm shift in the way the department is now viewed by both
those within its ranks and the public, said Deputy Chief Michael
Bostic, the department's commanding officer for the Valley who
headed up the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can no longer trust the integrity of every officer in the
Los Angeles Police Department and we now know that,'' Bostic said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Commission also stood squarely behind
Parks' decision to handle the exhaustive review of the department
internally with the only citizens' oversight coming from the five
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will assess the report's conclusions and recommendations
for accuracy, completeness and effectiveness,'' said Gerald L.
Chaleff, president of the Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also prepared to go beyond the scope of the Board of
Inquiry if that is what it takes to hold the Department and the
Commission accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to assure the people of Los Angeles that `Rampart'
never happens again. We intend to thoroughly review the systemic
and supervisory issues to reach this goal. Only then can the
public's confidence in the Department and civilian oversight be
restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he has tremendous faith in the commission and its
judgment in hiring outside expertise it needs to complete the
reforms. Parks has requested about $9.2 million from the council to
begin hiring more Internal Affairs investigators and other staff,
and the council is promising additional resources for the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   However, the margin of confidence in Parks and the department's
capabilities to assess and change itself remains tenuous, with some
City Council members, police representatives, civil rights leaders
and community activists saying there is too much at stake to allow
the police to, in essence, police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Independent oversight is crucial and needed immediately, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Joel Wachs of Studio City, who has pressed for an
independent commission, called LAPD's self-diagnosis a therapeutic
and positive sign, but warned it does not foreclose outside
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should be commended on the report in that it
really takes a giant step in dealing with the worst police scandal
in modern history,'' Wachs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude and seriousness of their own findings underscore
why a broad-based, outside review should be welcome as a helpful
tool in resolving this. This report does not obviate the needs for
an independent review, nor should it be in conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilmember Rita Walter said reform is too important to be
left to insiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that we really must look at independently,''
Walters said. `We have to dig it up, root it out and be certain
that there are no Ramparts in our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the broadbrush indictment by LAPD brass, the
department's rank and file renewed their demand for an independent
review of the Board of Inquiry report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a culture of mediocrity,'' said Los
Angeles Police Protective League President Ted Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that's how they see it, but they're desperately looking
for reasons why this occurred. We believe we have the best police
department in the world that's just been kicked in the shins by
Rafael Perez, who betrayed us and the people of California.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez was sentenced last Friday to five years in prison for
stealing cocaine held as evidence under a plea bargain that got him
to reveal the extent of corruption within the Rampart Division
anti-gang unit.
</P>
<P>
   The skepticism - and in some cases, outright disbelief - that
the LAPD can reform itself is strongest among civil rights groups
and other long-time critics who say the department's record is
dismal when it comes to fixing itself after scandals come to light.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU of Southern California, in particular, rejected
Riordan's contention that an outside review of the LAPD is
unecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the mayor to wake up. This city and its police
department need an independent commission - and we need it now,''
the American Civil Liberties Union argued in a two-page statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relying on the police department to ferret out all of the
underlying problems is like having a cancer patient operate on
himself. Only an independent, blue-ribbon commission with a broad
mandate to examine the entire criminal justice system and then to
ensure that the necessary reforms are implemented by the police
department can do the job the residents of Los Angeles deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU criticized Parks and top commanders for claiming credit
for uncovering the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rafael Perez had not been arrested for theft and copped a
plea following a mistrial in order to gain a lighter sentence, the
structural problems that have been festering for years - shootings,
beatings, cover-ups, perjurous statements
</P>
<P>
   would not have been discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, the department's ongoing criminal investigation has not
turned up widespread corruption. But Parks said that remains a
distinct possibility and noted that the FBI joined the criminal
probe last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remember that although these are tragic and
terrible incidents that we are discussing, that we are talking
about a very small minority of personnel in this department. At
this time, there is only one officer in custody dealing with these
issues,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost nine years since the Christopher Commission
called for reforms following the beating of Rodney King by LAPD
officers, and one of its members on Wednesday said the department's
problems now may be the result of not taking those recommendations
seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Chief Daryl Gates initially rejected the report, and never
did the department embrace it, said Leo Estrada, a University of
California, Los Angeles, urban planning professor who served on the
blue-ribbon commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, because they did not accept the recommendations
and respond to them, it came back full circle,'' Estrada said. ``At
the same time, other departments in California made our report
required reading. Throughout the U.S., the issues we raised were
reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling Wednesday the ``saddest day of my career,'' Bostic said
20 of the report's 108 recommendation were critical to prevent
mediocrity and corruption from overtaking the department.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations singled out by Bostic include a call for
major revisions of state law to allow the department to complete
thorough criminal background checks on all prospective cops, more
intense psychological screening for new recruits, and polygraph and
financial checks of all officers.
</P>
<P>
   Bostic said it is imperative for the police chief to have the
ultimate hiring authority, rather than trusting a citizens
personnel department.
</P>
<P>
   The department's personnel evaluation system needs to be
revamped to more accurately categorize a cop's performance and
departmentwide tracking systems need to be automated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't tell you on any given day where our people are (in
the field),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bostic said, the department needs to conduct more
aggressive audits and rely heavily on a strengthened Internal
Affairs division, recently empowered to conduct spot checks and
sting operations designed to catch bad cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust 99 percent of our employees, but clearly we cannot
rely on the systems we have to catch the other 1 percent.''

 By JAMES DAO and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Meeting in their last debate before more than a
dozen states vote in primaries on Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley appeared uncharacteristically
harmonious together Wednesday night, going out of their way to
agree on virtually every issue and avoiding the kind of attacks
that characterized their raucous debate just over a week ago in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley signaled early that he would not be too critical of Gore
when he passed up a chance to fault the vice president, as he
usually does, as failing to do more to combat racial profiling, and
they both then talked about their own proposals, forgoing their
usual potshots at each other.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wednesday night's was perhaps the most conciliatory of
their encounters, reflecting the recognition of both that with
Bradley's failure to win a single primary contest so far, the race
was likely to end soon.
</P>
<P>
   In one poignant moment, Bradley was asked what mistake in his
life he had learned the most from. A Rhodes scholar and Olympic
gold medalist before he was 23, Bradley talked about how he learned
to fail from his rookie season with the New York Knicks in 1966-67,
when he had been heralded as the team's savior, only to be booed
and spit on by fans when he played poorly. Some of his supporters
have likened that traumatic year to the struggles of his current
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caused me to ask myself, `You have to come to terms with
this,''' he said. ``I also began to see that life was not all good,
not all bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, revising his answer after Bradley answered, said his
biggest mistake was not being kind.
</P>
<P>
   With both reining in the harshness that has characterized their
campaign, the two revealed just how ideologically similar they are.
Both were given a chance to condemn the evangelical right wing,
which they did. Both want legal recognition for gay partners,
although both oppose legalizing gay marriage. Both condemned racial
profiling. Both praised their wives.
</P>
<P>
   And both praised the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have watched any of the eight previous meetings
between Gore and Bradley, many topics seemed familiar, even if the
candidates answered the questions somewhat differently. Last week
in Harlem, for instance, Bradley asserted that the vice president
had shown a lack of leadership by not pressing President Clinton to
sign an executive order to ban racial profiling by federal
law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But when the question was raised Wednesday night, Bradley
avoided conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is the civil rights issue of our time,'' he
said, not mentioning Gore. ``It is no longer blocking people from
schools. It is no longer trying to eat in a restaurant. It is
having the justice system in this country finally provide equal
justice for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore agreed. ``I think it has to stop. I want to be tough on
crime. I want to be tough on discrimination, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also passed on the opportunity to criticize Gore over
sending mixed signals on whether to allow China to join the World
Trade Organization. A few days ago, the former senator asserted
that the vice president had put ``the nail in the coffin'' of the
treaty that would bring China into the trade group when Gore
suggested to AFL-CIO officials that he might renegotiate the treaty
if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night, Bradley declined to make that argument when
a question about China and Taiwan relations was asked.
</P>
<P>
   Having repeatedly criticized Gore as a ``risk'' to the
Democratic Party because of his role in the campaign fund-raising
abuses of the 1996 presidential campaign, Bradley did not mention
Gore's problems Wednesday night. Instead, when a question about
money in politics was asked, Bradley spent more time talking about
the differences between himself and Sen. John McCain, the
Republican presidential candidate who has made an overhaul of the
system a centerpiece of his campaign. He noted that McCain was a
conservative on issue like abortion or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Gore agreed. ``We can't talk about it too much,'' he said
about campaign finance reform. ``It is one of the major issues in
this campaign. Then, apparently secure that Bradley was on his
side, Gore sought to use the issue to present a united front
against the Republicans.``It unites us, but it divides the two
Republican candidates,'' he said. McCain's main opponent, Gov.
George W. Bush, opposes revamping the finance rules.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the debate was so amicable that Bradley was asked if
he was repudiating his relentless criticism of the past against
Gore's congressional voting record, particularly against federal
funding for abortion, against certain gun control measures and in
favor of tobacco subsidies. He replied that Gore's record could be
used against him by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has evolved, I'm glad he has evolved,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the only rancorous exchange, Bradley said that Gore's
record of voting to support tax-exemption for religious
institutions like Bob Jones University would make it hard for the
Democrats to criticize Republicans like Bush for visiting that
college, where interracial dating is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee we should be attacking them for that,'' Bradley
said. But, he continued, ``then they're going to come right back
and point to those votes and it's going to be very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then squabbled with Bradley over what exactly he had voted
for, but the moment only highlighted how they otherwise so
thoroughly agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before the debate started, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
entered the room of reporters covering the candidates and announced
that he was endorsing Gore, whom he called ``the most qualified and
experienced candidate in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore team has sparked the greatest economic boom
in the history of this country,'' Jackson said. ``Therefore, the
vice president is perfectly positioned to continue this growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's announcement ends months of courtship by the two
Democratic candidates for his support. And while it is not clear
how many voters he might sway on his own, his endorsement is just
one of several by high-profile Democrats in recent days that have
added to the impression that the vice president has united the
party behind him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jackson called on Bradley to avoid creating the kind of
bitterness that split the party in 1980 when Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
of Massachusetts challenged President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That must not happen now,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to urge Bradley to quit the race. And he praised
the former senator for having raised important issues in the
campaign and having recruited athletes, including Michael Jordan,
into the party fold.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has his own history of bitterness with Gore. In 1988
when both men ran for the Democratic nomination, Gore and his
supporters criticized Jackson's position on Israel and other
issues, prompting Jackson to accuse Gore of negative campaigning.

OAKLAND SLATED TO GET TWO GIANT PANDAS FROM CHINA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JANINE DEFAO 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  OAKLAND, Calif. _ A pair of rare and adorable giant pandas
could find a new home in Oakland, making the city only the third in
the nation to house the famed black-and-white bears.
<P>
   Oakland leaders have signed an agreement with local government
leaders in China and plan to travel to Beijing next month to seal
the deal with China's federal government for two giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
   There are only five pandas in U.S. zoos, two in Atlanta and
three, including a new cub, in San Diego. There are believed to be
fewer than 1,000 in the wild, all of them in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been dreaming about pandas for years,'' Vice Mayor Henry
Chang said Wednesday. Chang is the architect of the agreement
between Oakland and the Pingwu People's Government in China's
Sichuan province, home to a vast panda reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, a native of China whose City Hall office is decorated
with computer-generated photographs of himself and pandas, said
bringing a male and female panda to Oakland ``will put us on the
map, not just for the whole United States but internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the agreement of the Chinese government, which
Chang expects, the project could take years and cost millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long, hard trip from agreeing to an offer from (local)
Chinese officials until you arrive with pandas on your doorstep,''
said David &LR; ju  &LR; Towne of the North American Panda Foundation, an
organization of zoos and other groups that oversees attempts to
bring pandas to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Towne estimated that a dozen U.S. cities have letters of intent
from local governments in China for panda loans.
</P>
<P>
   Building a research facility for the pandas would cost $8
million to $10 million and operating costs probably would reach $1
million a year, Oakland officials say. In addition to the Chinese
government, the U.S. government also would have to agree to import
the pandas.
</P>
<P>
   Chang said a panda exhibit and facility could open in two years,
but Joel Parrott, executive director of the Oakland Zoo, said it
could take at least twice that long. Parrott will accompany Chang,
Mayor Jerry Brown, City Manager Robert Bobb and others to China
next month.
</P>
<P>
   But Chang already is lining up support, from researchers at the
respected University of California at Davis veterinary school to
local companies that would provide money and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And Parrott said Oakland has some important factors in its favor
_ some of the mildest weather in the nation and a zoo in a 120-acre
park with plenty of room for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean we're playing a critical role in one of the most
endangered species in the world today. That would be a tremendous
honor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And having a male and female panda would open the possibility
that Oakland could someday have its own baby panda.
</P>
<P>
   America's love affair with the cuddly giants began nearly three
decades ago when then-President Richard Nixon brought Ling-Ling and
Hsing-Hsing to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., as a token of
friendship from China.
</P>
<P>
   The country's enthusiasm hasn't waned much. Baby Hua Mei, born
in August at the San Diego Zoo to two pandas on long-term loan from
China, is the subject of both a panda hotline and a ``panda cam.''
The zoo's Web site registered more than 4 million hits in one month
after her birth.
</P>
<P>
   The only other pandas in the United States are a pair in Atlanta
that arrived in November, the same month Hsing-Hsing was euthanized
at age 28 because of a kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   The National Zoo would like to replace its pair, but has said it
cannot afford the $1.2 million annual fee charged by the Chinese.
St. Louis and Memphis also are pursuing pandas for their zoos.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy feat. It took Atlanta 10 years to close their
deal.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's ``panda war'' between then-Mayor Frank Jordan
and then-Supervisor Angela Alioto in 1993 started with both
politicians saying they had agreements with local governments in
China to secure pandas. The promises went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But Chang, who has spent two decades cultivating government and
business ties in China as a consultant to U.S. businesses and as an
Oakland official, said ``everyone in China thinks we're there
already, that everything's arranged.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Chinese are willing to waive the annual fee because
they are interested in the research Oakland has proposed. The
project would focus on finding an alternative food source for
pandas because their bamboo diet is threatened by habitat loss.
</P>
<P>
   Chang is among the few Americans to visit pandas in their native
habitat in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not as cute as here (in zoos). They're dirty,'' he
said, but ``once you see a panda in the wild, that's it. You're in
love.''

WELLPOINT, ING BID $10 BILLION FOR AETNA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and ING
America Insurance Holdings want to acquire troubled health insurer
Aetna in a cash and stock deal worth $10 billion, officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Oaks-based WellPoint and ING expressed a ``desire to
begin discussions'' about the acquisition of Hartford, Conn.-based
Aetna in a letter dated Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``WellPoint's merger and acquisition strategy is to identify
opportunities where WellPoint can enhance value for customers and
stockholders,'' Leonard D. Schaeffer, WellPoint's chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a statement released late
Wednesday. ``Our approach in evaluating this situation will be
consistent with our strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter to Aetna said ING and WellPoint would pay Aetna
shareholders approximately $70 per share, or $44 in cash and $26 in
WellPoint common stock for each share of Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint is the nation's fifth-largest health maintenance
organization and was headquartered in suburban Woodland Hills until
it moved its executive offices to Thousand Oaks, 40 miles northwest
of downtown Los Angeles, last year. Its health care divisions
include Blue Cross of California.
</P>
<P>
   ING, based in Amsterdam, is a global financial institution that
is active in banking, insurance and asset management in more than
65 countries.
</P>
<P>
   John Rex, an analyst with Bear Stearns in New York, said
WellPoint and ING are probably interested in dividing Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my assumption that WellPoint would want the health care
aspects, and ING would want the financial aspects of Aetna,'' Rex
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said Wednesday that it will review the offer as part of an
overall review of its strategy and operations, spokeswoman Joyce
Oberdorf said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rex, ``It's good news for Aetna shareholders; it puts the
company in play. I wouldn't be surprised if there were other
offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the potential deal came just before the markets closed.
Aetna shares closed at $53.06, up 29.03 percent, or $11.93, with
most of the increase coming after Aetna's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint shares declined 13 cents to $23.44 and ING's U.S.
shares were up 25cents to $51.81.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's stock had declined more than 50 percent from a high of
$99.88 last May due to high medical costs and controversy over its
policies toward patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the company was hit by several class-action lawsuits
filed by the same attorneys who won large awards against the
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits allege, among other things, that its system for
paying doctors rewards them for skimping on patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna has also had difficulty in turning around Prudential
Healthcare and NYLCare, two money-losing health insurance companies
that it bought last year. Prudential's West Coast operation is
headquartered in Woodland Hills, less than a mile from WellPoint's
former headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The WellPoint-ING offer was received the day before Aetna
removed its chief executive officer, Richard L. Huber, and replaced
him with William H. Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, 68, has been a board member since 1977 and is
co-founder of the investment banking firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   News of WellPoint's interest in Aetna surfaced on the same day
the company said it had completed a $200 million acquisition of
Prudential Health Plans of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-based company was co-owned by Rush Presbyterian-St.
Luke's Medical Center and The Prudential Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   The deal brings together Rush Prudential and WellPoint's
existing Unicare business in Illinois. The Rush Prudential
companies will now be operated under the Unicare brand and will
offer both PPO and HMO products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very excited to close this deal,'' John Cygul, a
spokesman for WellPoint, said before news of the offer for Aetna
was disclosed. ``It is such a strong operation, in one of our
strategic locations.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition means WellPoint doubles its current medical
membership in Illinois to almost 600,000, said Rex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a nice fold-in with their strategy of
`densifying' their markets,'' added Rex. ``WellPoint can expect to
see some help to the bottom line from the deal next year. As for
this year, the deal will have a neutral impact on earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint serves 7.3 million medical members and nearly 32
million specialty members nationwide through Blue Cross of
California in California and Unicare throughout other parts of the
country. &QL;

 GORE, BRADLEY ENGAGE IN LOVEFEST IN LATEST DEBATE  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a Los Angeles debate that was more lovefest
than showdown, Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley spent 90 minutes
Wednesday night trying not to say anything bad about each other.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, the debate was almost a white flag, recognizing
that his campaign is likely to end next Tuesday when California and
15 other states choose their delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the debate, rumors were swirling that Bradley was
getting ready to abandon his shot at the Democratic nomination,
forcing the former New Jersey senator to publicly deny that his
campaign was just about over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at next Tuesday as takeoff day,'' Bradley said
during the debate. ``I'm in here to change the political process,
to appeal to people as Americans and human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   But with polls showing Gore far ahead in California and
elsewhere, Bradley backed off the scorching comments he had aimed
at the vice president earlier in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When he talked about gun control, for example, he argued that
the country ``needs a leader committed to this every day he's in
office,'' but gingerly stepped away from his previous charges that
Gore could not provide that leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also avoided the red-hot rhetoric that marked last month's
debate at Harlem's Apollo Theater. Time after time, the vice
president answered ``I agree with that'' when Bradley talked about
issues like campaign finance reform, civil rights and gun control.
He also backed away from chances to take a whack at the New Jersey
senator, body shots he had been willing to throw as recently as
Wednesday during a campaign appearance in the Los Angeles suburb of
Cudahy.
</P>
<P>
   When he talked about ways to help the disabled last night, Gore
mentioned the need to continue the Medicaid program and left it at
that. But in almost every campaign appearance he makes, he takes
pains to mention that Bradley wants to dump Medicaid and replace it
with a subsidy system Gore says is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken ceasefire in the campaign's barrage of charges and
countercharges delighted the vice president's backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows we disagree with Republicans, not with each
other,'' said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, Gore passed over Bradley's challenge to blast
John McCain and George W. Bush, the two GOP candidates for
president.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Christian right, for example, Gore said
that both Republicans were in the pocket of extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican party today is in the midst of an identity
crisis,'' he said. ``Both (McCain) and Gov. Bush are in favor of
taking away a woman's right to choose,'' refused to come out
against flying the Confederate flag over the South Carolina capitol
building and ``are in the hip pocket of the National Rifle
Association.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's debate stance wasn't surrender, but tactics, said one
Bradley staffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People watched Bill Bradley (tonight) and they saw that he's a
man of substance and integrity,'' said Dana Spurrier, a spokeswoman
for the former senator.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the often-harsh give and take of the campaign has been
the fact that Gore and Bradley are far more alike than different.
</P>
<P>
   Both came out against California's Proposition 22, which would
outlaw same-sex marriage, but both also said they opposed gay
marriage and preferred domestic partner rules that would provide
the same legal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 22 is ``mean-spirited,'' Gore said. ``It's time to
leave people alone because of the way God made them.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men also came out in favor of increasing the number of
H-1B visas available, which would open the way for more highly
skilled immigrants to come to the United States to work in the
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   The question of civil rights brought the most heartfelt
responses last night.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley called for a ban on racial profiling at federal agencies
and a requirement that local police agencies report of the racial
background of the people they arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Amadou Diallo shooting case in New York shows how deeply
racial profiling has penetrated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wallet in the hand of a white man is a wallet, but a wallet
in the hand of a black man is a gun,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore both refused to condemn the Rev. Al Sharpton, a
controversial New York clergyman who has a history of disputes with
both city officials and the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton represents many black people who feel they have been
discriminated against, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how do the voiceless get a voice,'' he asked.
``Sometimes it takes someone who rubs part of the people the wrong
way to focus attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the debate, the Rev. Jesse Jackson endorsed Gore,
saying that he was ``fully aware of the unfinished business of the
economic health'' of the society and was positioned to continue the
nation's economic growth.
   Jackson had been courted by both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bradley had to answer questions about
whether his campaign is taking on water after a crushing defeat in
Washington on Tuesday, a state where he had spent a lot of time and
money.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief press conference, Bradley quoted Mark Twain and said
the reports of his demise are greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night was a disappointment,'' Bradley said. ``At the same
time the delegate count is still the same _ 41 to 27. We're going
on to March 7. ... We're still in the race. We're working hard and
I feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread reports that senior advisors have been urging
Bradley to quit, he said there were ``zero who said I should drop
out.''
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, Gore refused to suggest that Bradley was
surrendering and leaving him with the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take a single vote for granted, much less a single
primary or caucus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both men left California immediately after the debate and
declined to say whether they would return to campaign again before
Tuesday's primary.

STEAMY READING AT THE CHECKOUT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Today: My sex change operation: Five minutes to
a new me!
<P>
   The plan today was to write about Muni or the rain, but I was
standing in the checkout line at the supermarket and happened to
notice that all anybody (women at least) cares about is sex.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling from the covers of women's magazines:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Sexecstacy: Make-him-throb moves so hot he'll sweat when he
hears your name'' (Complete Woman)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``50 tricks for outstanding orgasms/NC17 seductive
moves/applause-worthy foreplay'' (Glamour)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Supersize your sex life/ take home 10 tasty tips from the
world's lustiest lovers'' (Cosmo)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Your sex life: How often/How good/How orgasmic'' (Marie
Claire)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The great vibrator hum-off'' (Jane)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Deeply personal quiz: How sexually satisfied are you?''
(Self)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``New! Sex column/Surprise him tonight'' (Redbook)
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, there were a couple headlines I'm too
embarrassed to reprint here.
</P>
<P>
   Men's magazines aren't like this. We men don't need any sex tips
or quizzes. Our sex lives are already supersized.
</P>
<P>
   We don't phone up a buddy and say, ``Hey, how'd you score on the
deeply personal quiz in Motor Trend? My rating was `a quart low.'
''
</P>
<P>
   It's good to know what women are thinking about, but shouldn't
these magazines be kept in a curtained-off section of the market or
newsstand, with an armed guard checking IDs?
</P>
<P>
   Kids don't need to see this stuff. Frankly, neither do guys. It
makes us feel cheap, like playthings or lab rats.
</P>
<P>
   As for my sex-change operation: I think the technical medical
term is vasectomy. Read all about it in my first-person account in
Modern Hombre _ ``Cool Hand Dr. Luke: He cut me off at the pass.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG NEWSPAPER merger, sort of:
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle photographer Carlos Avila Gonzalez was zipping down
880, ran into traffic ahead so he slowed, then traffic behind ran
into him, in the person of a reporter for the San Jose Mercury
News.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't news. When it comes to getting the story, the
Merc is always right behind us.
</P>
<P>
   MYSTERY TRAIN demystified:
</P>
<P>
   Technically, there is no train from SFO to downtown S.F.,
despite notification in Korean Air's in-flight magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But having flown in and out of SFO only a few hundred times, I
was not aware that there  &UR; is  &LR; a free shuttle from SFO to the
Millbrae Caltrain station, and then a $2 train to the Caltrain
station in SoMa, 4th and Townsend, a trip of 29 minutes or less, no
stopping for traffic.
</P>
<P>
   'STICK JR.? Will the Giants' new ballpark be windy?
</P>
<P>
   Karen Knowles-Pearce has been sailing out of the South Beach
yacht harbor near the new ballpark for 10 years, and she says wind,
every day of the summer during the afternoons, is guaranteed, or
double your money back.
</P>
<P>
   Karen's baseball season weather prediction: Less fog at the new
park than at the 'Stick, warmer temperatures. ... But no wind? Why
do you think people park their sailboats there?
</P>
<P>
   WELCOME TO San Francisco. Give me your wallet and your watch.
</P>
<P>
   There has been at least a mini-rash of recent robberies of tour
vans and buses.
</P>
<P>
   The bad guys work fast, are very efficient and well-organized.
Palace of Fine Arts, Golden Gate Bridge, Cliff House. ... Tourists
get out for a quick look around, return to find their bus picked
clean.
</P>
<P>
   It's not right. How can we rip 'em off legitimately if someone
steals all their traveler's checks?
</P>
<P>
   IT'S FUNNY, says author Michael Gross, that there are three Baby
Boomers running for president who are hated by all Baby Boomers,
and one non-Boomer running who is admired by the Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   So we're a confused lot; sue us.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe we know that we can't respect anyone who did what we
did. Or we know that they know too much.
</P>
<P>
   Gross sorts out Boomer confusion and angst in his new book, the
quietly titled ``My Generation: Fifty years of sex, drugs, rock,
revolution, glamour, greed, valor, faith and silicon chips.''
</P>
<P>
   The book chronicles 19 zany Boomers, many of them from right
here by the bay, like the guy who invented LSD and helped give the
Grateful Dead its edge.
</P>
<P>
   One reviewer said the book ``is certain to induce a wave of
nostalgia among (Gross') peers.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if we get seasick?
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF BOOMERS, the German Christian Democrats, notes
eagle-eyed Ed Epstein, have elected a new leader:
</P>
<P>
   Fred Merz!
</P>
<P>
   Actually it's Friedrich, but everyone calls him Fred, I'm sure.
</P>
<P>
   This means that Ethel Mertz is the party's First Fraulein.
</P>
<P>
   It's strange, despite Ethel Mertz's huge influence on American
culture, nobody names their daughter Ethel anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the $2-per-gallon stigma.

MCCAIN GETS HERO'S WELCOME IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S LITTLE SAIGON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WESTMINSTER, Calif. _ Sen. John McCain, who recently caused a
controversy with his use of ethnic slur to describe his Vietnamese
captors, got a hero's welcome in the nation's largest
Vietnamese-American community Wednesday night, telling his audience
of 1,500 ``This is a community that epitomizes what America is
about.''
<P>
   McCain was met in the business community of Little Siagon, which
is part of the city of Westminster, with sidewalks crammed with a
cheering throng people waving the red and yellow flag of Vietnam
and the stars and strips with many of the women and children in
colorful native dress. Many of the people credited McCain with
freeing them from re-education camps after the fall of South
Vietnam in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud of your contributions,'' McCain told them at a
rally last night. ``I praise you.'' The Arizon senator was flanked
on stage by nearly a dozen Vietnamese POWs and he appeared
emotional as he introduced them.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention of the controversy last week in which he
referred to his Vietnamese torturers as ``gooks.'' But many
Vietnamese in the crowd said they understood the term in reference
specifically to particular guards who held in a POW camp for more
than 5 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in prison 18 years, '' said Tam Nguyen, who served in
the South Vietnames Special Forces. ``I want McCain for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was on a three-day barnstorm through California with five
days to go before the crucial California primary.
</P>
<P>
   Making other news, he backtracked on strong statements he
uttered Tuesday, when he called televangelists Pat Robertson and
Jerry Falwell ``forces of evil'' within the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about those comments Wednesday, McCain suggested he was
only resorting to a common and humorous ``Star Wars'' campaign
analogy that he has used in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my campaign, I often joke about Luke Skywalker, evil
empires and death stars,'' he said in a written statement. ``It was
in that vein that I used the phrase yesterday (Tuesday).
</P>
<P>
   ``While I disagree with the political message and tactics of
Rev. Falwell and Robertson, Mr. (Bob) Jones and other
self-proclaimed leaders of the Christian right, I do not consider
them evil, and I regret that my flip remark may have mistakenly
created that impression. ... I have always welcomed the support of
millions of religious conservatives who share my convictions ...
and our Judeo Christian values.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was waiting to go on the air for a live broadcast of
``Hardball'' with Chris Matthews, McCain told The Chronicle he was
deeply ``bothered'' that his offhanded bantering with reporters,
which he does constantly aboard his ``Straight Talk Express'' bus,
was misinterpreted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Tuesday's defeats in the Washington and Virginia
primaries and North Dakota's caucuses, McCain's abrupt turnaround
appears to reflect increasing pressure on his campaign to round up
GOP voters in California and to secure a win in the Super Tuesday
primaries next week.
</P>
<P>
   GOP front-runner George W. Bush was quick to criticize McCain
for his remarks about Robertson and Falwell, attributing his
victories in Washington and Virginia to voter rejection of ``the
politics of pitting one religion against another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is winning, and we're doing it the right way,''
the Texas governor said, ``uniting our party without compromising
our principles, expanding our base without destroying our
foundations.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's turnabout Wednesday was the second time this week that
he has felt obligated to clarify previous remarks.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, after announcing that he would skip Thursday night's
debate with Bush, McCain reversed himself and said he would rework
his schedule to participate via satellite. The CNN-Los Angeles
Times debate will be broadcast at 6 p.m. on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McCain apologized for referring to the prison guards
who tortured him in a Vietnamese POW camp as ``gooks.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments about Robertson and Falwell were made during a
three-day blitz of California. Riding with reporters on his bus
Tuesday, McCain, when asked about his previous criticisms of the
two televangelists, said, ``I'm willing to take on the forces of
evil. ... That's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator was specifically asked what he found objectionable
in the actions of the two Christian leaders. ``I'm talking about
the evil influence ... they have exercised over the Republican
Party,'' McCain said. ``They've driven us to the extreme right. ...
I blame them for setting a tone of exclusivity, and intolerance,
and bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the turnabouts and apologies, McCain maintains an
upbeat outlook on his chances in California and is drawing huge,
wildly enthusiastic crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited, I'm enthusiastic, I'm hopeful,'' he said. ``Yes,
I need to win California. Yes, it's a critical state. California
has enormous impact on the nomination, and I need to win. I think
we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   After addressing a cheering crowd of about 1,400 in Riverside,
McCain said polls show that ``we're within single digits in
California'' and gaining a percentage point a day among GOP voters.
</P>
<P>
   Many who turn out to see him, often holding his book, ``Faith of
My Fathers,'' say they have not voted Republican for years _ or
have never aligned themselves with a GOP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Democrat for 71 years _ and I'm a Republican for the
first time this year,'' said World War II veteran Jack Cullari of
Hemet. ``He's a leader. There's no comparison with Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain faces a daunting task in the nation's most populous
state. Even though he appears to be winning the popular vote in
California _ and gaining support among independents and Democrats _
recent polls show him lagging 15 to 20 percentage points behind
Bush among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And only the Republican votes will count toward the awarding of
California's treasure chest of 162 GOP delegates, according to the
rules of the state's winner-take-all blanket primary.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 23-year-old unarmed man was shot dead by a
plainclothes police officer Wednesday night after a struggle in a
Bronx apartment building just three blocks from where Amadou Diallo
was killed last year, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Malcolm Ferguson, who the police said was on parole for
a drug conviction, was shot once in the head, at about 6:30 p.m.,
and declared dead at the scene at 1045 Boynton Ave. in the
Soundview section, said John Scanlon, the Police Department's chief
of patrol. Scanlon said Ferguson was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, the police said, was one of two protesters arrested in
the neighborhood last Friday after the four officers who shot
Diallo were acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, dozens of protesters, still angry at last
week's acquittal of the four officers who shot Diallo, gathered
behind police sawhorses near the building after the shooting. Some
carried signs denouncing police brutality and confronted a squadron
of officers, some clad in helmets and other riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the mayor's office, the Bronx borough president's
office and the Police Department, along with elected officials,
went to the block to quell any potential for violence. There was
one arrest, for throwing a bottle at police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon said five housing officers who were part of an anti-drug
unit had been traveling to a public housing unit in the Soundview
section of the Bronx, but as they passed by the building at 1045
Boynton Ave., they noticed ``some movement in the hallway that drew
their attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers went to go into the hallway, and one individual
bolted up the stairs,'' Scanlon said. Officer Louis Rivera ran
after him, the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, on the second-floor landing, there was a
struggle,'' Scanlon continued. ``The officer's firearm discharged
and the individual succumbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Blood was found on Rivera's gun, indicating that Ferguson was
shot at very close range, Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m., Scanlon said that no weapon had been found on
Ferguson, but that there was ``a continuing investigation for
weapons and other evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The police found six packets of heroin wrapped in cellophane
tucked into Ferguson's pants, the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, who relatives said lived in the South Bronx, had been
arrested nine times since 1994, the police said. On two occasions,
he had his parole revoked, and he was on parole until April 3 for
selling drugs, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters said that the shooting of Ferguson, like
that of Diallo, happened in large part because he was black.
Scanlon said that the officer who shot Ferguson was Hispanic. Of
the other four officers in the unit, one was white, two were black
and the other Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   A witness, Modesto Rodriguez, said that the plainclothes
officers who went into the building were not easily identifiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw two guys with hoods go into the building,'' said
Rodriguez, 23, referring to the police. ``They didn't look like
cops. They looked like brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   In his four-and-a-half years on the force, Rivera had never
fired his gun, said Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey, a police
spokesman. ``He's squeaky clean,'' Fahey said.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was the subject of one excessive-force allegation, but he
was exonerated, Fahey said. ``He was the wrong cop in that
complaint,'' the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior police official said that Rivera had made 120 arrests
and described him as a ``very active police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   By 10 p.m., the neighborhood was largely blocked off. A phalanx
of officers in riot gear stood behind barricades as helicopters
circled overhead and floodlights illuminated the intersection of
Boynton and Watson Avenues. Dozens of detectives and other law
enforcement officials milled in and out of 1045 Boynton, a
four-story brick building on a narrow street.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, mostly teenagers, held up signs that included
slogans like ``No justice NYPD got away with murder.'' At one
point, many of the group held up their wallets and chanted ``don't
shoot,'' a reference to Diallo, whose wallet was mistaken for a gun
by the officers who shot him.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials also came out to try to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a tragic situation for this community, which has had
such a loss'' said state Sen. Larry Seabrook. ``Even if the
individual who expired committed a crime, it's too much to take at
this time. He was still an unarmed civilian.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the head of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
who arrived shortly after the shooting, said that the police had
changed their story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not told there was a scuffle,'' Siegel said. ``I was
told initially that he was running from the cop.''

STARS DEFEAT FLYERS BY SHOWING CUP FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Gentlemen, the Stanley Cup race may just have grabbed a
favorite in the Stars. Or, at least, as close to a favorite as
you're going to get in this wide-open season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ``the'' top team,'' Philadelphia coach Craig Ramsay
said after watching his Flyers lose to them, 2-0, last night at
Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   In case anybody forgot, the Stars have reminded them during the
past 11 days. They've played and defeated three serious Cup
contenders in Colorado, Detroit and Philadelphia. They've done so
in impressive fashion, too.
</P>
<P>
   A solid, all-around performance was employed against the Flyers.
The defense was stingy. The usual suspects like Mike Modano were
forces. The youngsters like Brenden Morrow were anything but
intimidated. The goalie... Well, Ed Belfour was his usual
dominating self.
</P>
<P>
   And the Stars are beginning to look more and more like the team
that won it all last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've gotten credit for winning the first one,''
Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``For us to get respect, we got
to win it again, and we feel like we can do it. ... Obviously, with
playing the good teams and doing well, we have the confidence that
we can get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team was at 100 percent or anything really close. The
Flyers were without big-name, big-game players Eric Lindros (back),
Keith Primeau (ribs) and defenseman Ulf Samuelsson (shoulder). The
Stars were without Joe Nieuwendyk (shoulder) and Jere Lehtinen
(ankle).
</P>
<P>
   With 1:27 remaining in the first period, the injury factor
became even. Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk had to be helped
from the ice after Flyers winger Keith Jones tripped and rolled
under him, upending the defenseman and spraining the medial
collateral ligament in Matvichuk's left knee. Matvichuk didn't
return to the game. The defenseman will be evaluated again today,
but Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he wasn't expected to miss more
than seven to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really could end up being day to day depending on how he
comes in'' today, Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Stars Lite vs. Diet Philly was a little less sexy, it
was no less exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The game had everything. Physical play, big saves, exciting
scoring chances and plenty of Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   He earned his fourth shutout of the season, stopping all 25
shots he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was good when he had to be good,'' Hitchcock said. Flyers
goalie Brian Boucher didn't have such a good game, allowing two
goals on 16 shots.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:02 of the third period, Stars center Aaron Gavey picked
defenseman Zarley Zalapski's pocket. He poked the puck toward
Philadelphia's goal. His shot wasn't the hardest or the best, but
bounced in off the pads of a diving Boucher for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I think I was going five-hole,'' Gavey said. ``I
don't know where it really went. When I looked back, I saw it
slowly making its way over the line. I was just praying it was
going to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Zalapski: ``I won't be doing that next time. It's a blatant
kind of play where a guy poke checks you and goes in uncontested.
Those just aren't good plays. It's so close that one or two things
that happen like that changes the course of a hockey game.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``one or two things'' happened with Zalapski on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   A Zalapski snafu also led to the Stars' first goal. After Modano
poked the puck away at the blue line, Morrow beat Zalapski to the
puck. Morrow couldn't beat Boucher, but he pushed the puck to
Modano on the left side, and Modano did. Modano's goal, at 6:10 of
the second period, was really all the Stars needed.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour made sure of that. He looked as good if not better than
he did early in the season. He had to be, too. The Flyers certainly
had their chances. A few point blank ones included.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had some good chances in the game,'' Belfour said. ``It's
definitely nice when they get those chances and you come up with
the saves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Stars sent a message to the rest of the league in the
past 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can you not count them out. They might just be the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if you want to have a chance to win in the playoffs
you have to beat the good teams because those are the teams that
stay the longest in the playoffs,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau
said.
</P>

MAYOR BARS CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS FROM JOINING NEWS CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ Mayor Richard Riordan shut five City Council
members out of his news conference Wednesday on the LAPD scandal
and then ordered the microphone shut off when they barged in after
it was over.
</P>
<P>
   One member said Riordan's actions bordered on creating a
``constitutional crisis''; another said his actions were a
declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, council members pounded on the door in frustration
and Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said they were threatened with
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan dismissed their complaints: ``I think they were just
being childish. Most of them don't come to the events I invite them
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Deputy Mayor Noelia Rodriguez: ``This certainly was a
historic day in Los Angeles because these council members have
never before shown an interest in what the mayor has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident is the latest in the long-simmering dispute between
the mayor and the council.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after Riordan concluded his news conference strongly
supporting Police Chief Bernard C. Parks in his eighth-floor media
room at City Hall, the five council members rushed in to protest
their being kept out of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Rita Walters, who at barely 5 feet tall is the
shortest council member, had a door shut on her foot and arm as she
attempted to slip through, members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is outrageous,'' Goldberg said. ``It is
absolutely essential we have a dialogue with the mayor on how to
deal with this. He is entitled to have his press conferences, but
to say we're not entitled to hear what he says is an outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Laura Chick added: ``This is symbolic of this
administration and its desire to control the flow of information.''
</P>
<P>
   After Riordan spoke and as council members were trying to speak
to the news media, the mayor ordered aides to shut off a device
known as a mult-box that allows television and radio reporters to
plug into an outlet to record what is said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are entitled to have their news conferences in their own
conference room,'' Rodriguez said, referring to the council's own
press facilities outside its third-floor chambers. ``Space is very
tight in this (mayor's) conference room and we barely had space for
the reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, a longtime foe of the mayor,
declared the impasse ``bordered on a constitutional crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, the fifth member of the group,
said the problems facing the city because of Rampart are the most
serious it has had in years and required a unified front.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is local government does not operate as effectively
as it should without forthright communication,'' Ridley-Thomas
said. ``The point here is to have the mayor and council work
collectively and collaboratively.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the public can have confidence in city leaders being
able to solve problems with so much acrimony, Walters said: ``He
declared war on us.''

WHITE HOUSE ATTACKS PATHS FOR MONEY LAUNDERING
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs 5th graf to fix quote)  
(rk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration plans to ask Congress
for sweeping new powers to combat money laundering including the
authority to ban financial transactions between U.S. banks or
brokerage houses and off-shore financial centers, administration
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The request is the centerpiece of administration efforts to
tighten money-laundering laws after the Bank of New York was found
to have acted as a conduit for about $7 billion in Russian money,
some of which investigators believe was derived from illegal
activities. The administration has also been searching for ways to
make it harder for drug traffickers to funnel their profits through
American banks.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers plans to announce proposed
legislation in a speech to bankers on Thursday, officials said. The
legislation would give his department a broad range of powers to
investigate and in serious cases forbid transactions between
American financial institutions and individual foreign banks or
entire foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that current laws do not provide
enough authority to fight money laundering, the practice of
filtering profits from illegal activities through banks to disguise
their origin. Short of having Congress declare emergency sanctions
against countries deemed to be a national security threat, the
officials said, they are mostly confined to waving a finger at
nations that tolerate money laundering and urging American banks to
be wary of doing business with such places.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of money laundering is so prominent and public that
it can't be ignored anymore,'' a senior official said. ``We need to
be able to target the root problems without unnecessarily hindering
legitimate economic activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to seek new powers is clearly a response to Russia,
where financial mismanagement has been a problem for the Clinton
administration and the International Monetary Fund. Some analysts
and members of Congress have complained that widespread corruption
in that country _ helped in part by the ease of transferring funds
abroad _ undermined multibillion-dollar foreign aid programs and
left one of the administration's top foreign policy priorities a
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation also appears to be an attempt to broker
a compromise between congressional proposals and private financial
companies. Both the House and the Senate are weighing bills that
would impose draconian restrictions on foreign banks that hide
money and, in some cases, new enforcement duties on domestic banks
and brokerage houses. Financial companies have complained that such
laws threaten to make them uncompetitive against foreign rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress had a mixed response to the Treasury's
proposal after briefings by Clinton administrations officials
Wednesday. Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and chairman of the House
Banking Committee, said the Treasury proposals were exactly what he
had been seeking. He said he would introduce the bill as his own
when it is sent to Congress next week.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and a member of the Senate's
banking committee, was less enthusiastic. He said the Treasury
proposals were a watered-down version of legislation he has
introduced that would mandate the isolation of foreign banks that
make hiding money their forte.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you leave this up to their discretion, diplomacy will
prevail over cutting off money laundering,'' Schumer said. ``The
Treasury seems to be taking a step in the right direction. But we
are going to toughen it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation would give the Treasury Department the right
to take any number of steps, along a progressive scale, to fight
laundering. On the light end of the spectrum, the department wants
the power to ask American companies to collect data on all kinds of
transactions with an off-shore bank or financial company. That
would help law enforcement officials track suspicious activity, and
would also make American banks wary of doing business with such
places, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where foreign governments stubbornly shield their banks
from prying eyes and act as havens for criminal funds, the
department wants the power to simply cut them off from the American
financial system, without seeking congressional approval for such
action each time.
</P>
<P>
   Although that would not necessarily force those nations to
tighten enforcement, the loss of access to the American market
would cripple any legitimate banking activity there and make it a
much less attractive destination for criminal elements as well, the
officials said. Moreover, officials hope that the U.S. action in
such cases will serve as a model for other developed countries,
putting further pressure on the laundering haven.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ever since the act of money laundering first became a crime, in
1986, Treasury officials have often been sympathetic to private
sector concerns that the old way of fighting money laundering _
putting a burden on banks and brokerage houses to police their
clients _ might simply drive banking business to nations that do
not demand as much. But the rise of multilateral efforts to counter
illicit flows of money through the international banking system in
recent years have made it possible to tighten restrictions at home
without driving too much legitimate banking activity abroad,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials already have sought to step up
anti-laundering activities through the one tool they now have in
their arsenal: moral suasion, or as the Treasury calls it, name and
blame. When a foreign bank or nation repeatedly refuses to abide by
generally accepted standards to make sure they are not being used
by criminals to launder money, Treasury has made that known to
domestic banks, usually through advisories. Those put the banks on
notice that they should be wary of money that flows into their
coffers from such sources. The advisories do not have the force of
law.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation before Congress would add processing the proceeds of
official corruption to the list of foreign crimes that fall under
the money-laundering statute. American financial institutions are
now barred from handling the proceeds from a narrow group of
offenses committed abroad, including drug trafficking, kidnapping
and bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   An advance copy of a speech Summers prepared for delivery on
Thursday identifies several countries that have served as either
sources of illicit money or havens for bank secrecy and laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, Colombia, and Nigeria, he says, are among the biggest
sources of such funds. The islands of Dominica, Nauru and Antigua
are among the biggest destination spots, with laws that make it
possible or actively encourage criminals to do business there.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they believed that such moral
suasion works. Antigua, Nauru, Russia and Colombia are all working
with the United States to toughen their laws, Summers says in his
address. After Clinton administration officials raised public
concerns about Nauru earlier this year, citing its role as a chief
haven for Russian money laundering, some American banks decided on
their own to stop doing financial-correspondent business with banks
chartered in that country.

LAKERS STREAK MARCHES ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ March arrived, the march continued, though often
in stop-motion action.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours removed from their ballyhooed battle in the
Pacific Northwest, the Los Angeles Lakers returned home for a date
with considerably less sizzle, and certainly none of the intrigue
of their just-completed victory over rival Portland.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Vancouver Grizzlies provided their own sort of
drama, of the upset variety, it was a short-lived notion. The
Lakers marched over their overmatched opponent to their 13th
consecutive victory, 103-91, on Wednesday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with their previous 16-game winning streak, the Lakers
(47-11) are once again tilling new ground. This is the longest pair
of double-digit streaks a Lakers team has had in one season.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, newly crowned NBA player of the month, scored
25 points as the Lakers also won their seventh in a row at home.
O'Neal added 17 rebounds and five assists before fouling out with
2:43 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, despite another off shooting night, scored a
game-high 27 points. He was 9 for 22 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off their inspired victory at Portland, the Lakers bench
maintained its heightened play. Robert Horry scored 10 points,
leading a 32-point effort from the reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers mostly muddled through this game. They never led
by more than six points until late in the third quarter, then
buried the Grizzlies (18-39) under an avalanche of 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers down by a point, Brian Shaw, Horry, Rick Fox and
Bryant hit successive 3s to take a 77-69 lead into the fourth.
Travis Knight's putback jam and another 3-pointer from Fox made it
a double-digit lead, 82-71, less than three minutes into the final
period, and the Grizzlies never got close again.
</P>
<P>
   For fourth-quarter excitement, fans had to settle for a couple
of spiffy Bryant dunks and Derek Fisher's flying leap over the
$1,000 courtside seats - complete with a foot to actor Jon Lovitz's
head - to save a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dickerson and Shareef Abdur-Rahim kept it interesting
for most of three quarters, scoring 18 points each for Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   A steep dropoff in Laker emotion and intensity was only natural
after Tuesday's explosive showdown in Portland. In fact, it was
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's got to be some letdown, certainly,'' coach Phil
Jackson said, ``but we know how we can win this ballgame, we
discussed the opportunity of what we have ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Grizzlies presented enough challenges to command the
Lakers' attention, even if they don't much resemble the Trail
Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the right kind of situation for us. They're a young
team, they're aggressive, a good point guard (Mike Bibby), all
those combination of things, like an outside-shooting center, that
have bothered us,'' said Jackson, named NBA coach of the month for
February. ``But this kind of team we know how to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   There were few glimmers of that knowledge in the first half, as
the Lakers emerged flat and barely took a 48-47 halftime lead on
Bryant's buzzer-beating bank shot.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal returned to form after a tough shooting night against
Portland. He hit 7 of 11 shots from the field and had 16 points, 10
rebounds, four assists and four blocked shots in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant struggled early but scored eight points in the half on
4-of-10 shooting. Rice had just four points by halftime, but the
bench crew of Horry, Fox, Fisher and Shaw combined for 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Defense was harder to find. The Grizzlies shot 47.6 percent and
got a huge boost from an unlikely source. Grant Long, who does not
resemble Rasheed Wallace, scored 11 points, hitting all five of his
field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson admitted some concern about keeping his team focused
during the dog days of March, but the Lakers have some more
inspiring opponents due at Staples soon. Eastern powers Indiana and
Miami are here Friday and Sunday, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a four-game trip to the East, with stops in New York
and Miami, in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a critical (time) because we have a short span of
time next week in which we have an opportunity to have a little bit
of down time, and then it's back-to-back (games) on Sunday-Monday,
and that East Coast trip is going to really challenge us,'' Jackson
said. ``That's ahead of us and looms out as our next real big
challenge as a basketball club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we have to get through this part of the season as
best as possible, stay healthy, and go into this mid-March. All
eyes turn to college (basketball), and we have to go through this
kind of withering schedule and play the best ball possible if we're
going to maintain what we've earned up to this point.''

NORTHRIDGE ROUTS WEBER STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A total effort translated into total domination
Wednesday night for the Cal State Northridge men's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be the end of the Matadors' recent frustration?
</P>
<P>
   CSUN carried the momentum of a thrilling win last weekend into a
blowout of old nemesis Weber State Wednesday night, 76-62 in front
of a season-best 1,401 fans at Matador Gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to do anything special, we just wanted to come
out and put the effort into it,'' said junior center Brian Heinle,
who had 16 points, eight rebounds and six assists. ``We're playing
hard on the defensive end and on the offensive end we're playing
really unselfish.... We've been waiting for a while now to get
everyone on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   That was obvious from tipoff to the final buzzer against the
Wildcats, who dropped into a fourth-place tie with the Matadors at
9-6 in the Big Sky. Forget about never trailing; Northridge never
let WSU get within 12 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe CSUN (17-9) sent a signal to defending Big Sky champion
Weber State (also 17-9). With one regular-season game left, these
teams most likely will meet in the first round of the conference
tournament next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played scared and we played soft,'' Weber State coach Joe
Cravens said. ``I didn't think we played hard or competed. We
played softer than a baby's behind all night. It's all about heart
and effort and we showed little of either one.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN showed both. The lingering effects of Saturday's 79-78 win
over Portland State, which the Matadors rallied from 17 points down
with 7 minutes left, were evident in the first half. Northridge
took a 26-9 lead with 9 minutes, 31 seconds left before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We defended well tonight,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said,
referring to WSU's 23.1 percent shooting in the first half. ``We
played 40 minutes of good, hard basketball. The focus was just
phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber State forward Harold Arceneaux, the favorite to repeat as
the Big Sky's MVP, had a game-high 27 points. But he made only 10
of 24 shots and he had six turnovers. Eddie Gill, the Wildcats'
all-conference point guard, was 4 of 12 from the field and had six
assists, four less than CSUN point guard Markus Carr.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play hard, we can be a pretty good basketball team,''
Braswell said.
</P>
<P>
   Carr said: ``That was Northridge basketball. We weren't worried
about anything other than Northridge.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN hosts Sacramento State (9-17, 3-12) Saturday night in its
home finale. The Matadors have an outside shot at tying third-place
Montana, which has two tough road games (Portland State and Eastern
Washington).

ANGELS INFIELDERS VIE FOR POSITIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ With Cactus League games set to begin Friday, one
of manager Angels manager Mike Scioscia's tasks this spring is to
determine who will be on his bench.
</P>
<P>
   He has seven players vying for the starting job at second base,
leaving the others to battle for a utility infielder role.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spiezio is the only one with a major-league contract and
started 59 games last season for Oakland. Justin Baughman, having
recovered from a broken leg, could give the club some speed, but he
hasn't played since suffering the injury in a Mexican Winter League
game in November of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The others in the hunt are Jason Bates, Pat Kelly, Benji Gil,
Carlos Garcia and Trent Durrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for the guy making our team as a utility player is
being able to play shortstop,'' Scioscia said. ``If you can play
shortstop, you can play second and hold your own at third. Whoever
can play short will be huge in who makes the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Baughman can play shortstop, but if he doesn't make the team as
the starter at second, he'll likely go to the minors so he can play
every day to make up for the time he lost to the injury. Garcia,
Bates and Gil have recent experience at shortstop. Spiezio, Kelly
and Durrington do not play there.
</P>
<P>
   Beating ASU: Garret Anderson had two hits and starting pitcher
Scott Schoeneweis struck out four in two innings as the Angels beat
Arizona State 7-3 at Tempe Diablo Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad and Gary DiSarcina had one hit each and Bengie
Molina had a hit and two RBI as most of the Angels regulars were
finished by the third inning. Reliever Greg Keagle, who pitched in
the Tigers organization last season, pitched 2 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis appeared in 31 games last season with the Angels -
all as a reliever - but Scioscia said he should be included in the
battle for starting spots along with Ramon Ortiz, Jarrod Washburn
and Brian Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the mix, no doubt about it,'' Scioscia said. ``He
obviously has the arm to pitch in the major leagues. And I think
with his maturity and makeup as a pitcher he's going to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: Jim Edmonds was excused from Wednesday's workout and
game because of personal reasons involving his children. He's
expected back today.... Dennis Wyrick, a freshman from Bishop Amat
High, started at shortstop for ASU. Wednesday night.... The Angels
signed pitcher Mike Fyhrie and outfielder Jeff DaVanon to contracts
for the 2000 season.... Pitching matchups for this weekend's Cactus
League games: Friday - Jarrod Washburn vs. Jamie Moyer (Mariners);
Saturday - Ken Hill vs. Gil Heredia (A's); Sunday - Kent Mercker
vs. Kevin Appier (A's).

   YUGOSLAVIA-REBELS (Dobrosin, Yugoslavia) _ Just across the
boundary line from Kosovo, guarded more visibly now by U.S. troops
in watchtowers, armed Albanians wearing uniforms of a new branch of
the Kosovo Liberation Army are training for a battle the West
doesn't want them to have. Their numbers and leadership are a
mystery, but on this day fewer than 20 men, wearing a mixture of
German and American fatigues, did exercises with their weapons. On
their arms, they wear a cloth badge of red, black and yellow that
looks exactly like that of the supposedly disbanded and disarmed
Kosovo Liberation Army. The only difference is their name: the
Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac, all towns in
Serbia itself, although their populations are largely ethnic
Albanian. By Steven Erlanger.

   NY-BUSH-PATAKI (New York) _ With George W. Bush's convincing
victories in North Dakota, Washington and Virginia on Tuesday, the
governor of Texas turns to New York, hoping that the vote in that
state next Tuesday will help him finally nail down a nomination.
Bush, though, is not the only governor with a lot riding on next
Tuesday's vote, and that becomes abundantly clear as Gov. George
Pataki's apparatus tries to assure that Pataki does not join the
list of Republican governors who have failed Bush during his
difficult political year. By Adam Nagourney and Richard Perez-Pena.

   IMF-U.S. (Washington) _ When President Clinton pledged this week
to block a German finance ministry official from assuming the top
post at the International Monetary Fund, in effect vetoing the man
the 15-nation European Union had collectively chosen for the job,
he seemed to risk a diplomatic confrontation across the Atlantic.
What really happened, Clinton administration officials and some
European diplomats say, is that Clinton agreed to confront Germany
in a way that European countries applauded but were unwilling to do
themselves. By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   AZERBAIJAN-U.S. (Washington) _ Pro-Armenian activists have kept
Azerbaijan on a United States blacklist since 1992 _ the only
former Soviet republic to be punished in this way _ thanks to a
well-coordinated lobbying effort by Armenian- Americans and a
strong coalition of Armenia supporters in Congress. But the
Azerbaijanis are pushing back. President Aliev himself has engaged
in face-to-face lobbying, and some high-powered hired professionals
are working behind-the-scenes. And big oil has been acting quietly
on Azerbaijan's behalf. By Marc Lacey.

<P>
   ABC-CABLE _ ABC is threatening to pull its signal off the Time
Warner cable system in Houston, leaving 650,000 homes without the
network's programming. The move speaks volumes about the changing
economics of the television business, in particular the growth of
the satellite industry, which is giving new leverage to the
networks. And it also reflects the increasing clout of the game
show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Disney, ABC's parent, is
demanding that Time Warner shift the Disney Cable Channel from a
pay, or premium, service to a basic service. Time Warner says this
is too costly and will force a rise in cable rates. By Bill Carter.

   NY-VILLAGE-HOUSE (New York) _ Like many people who meander
regularly through the storybook streets of the West Village, Tom
Fontana had always wondered about the strange house on 13th Street
near Eighth Avenue. Set at the end of a row of brownstones, with
its elegant Moorish window arches and stepped gable, the
three-story brick house looked like a reproduction of a
17th-century Dutch guild hall. But the formal front doors and a
chunk of the ground floor had been hacked away. By the time that
Fontana _ the television writer and mastermind of ``Homicide'' and
``Oz'' _ first stumbled upon house, in the 1980s, it looked as
though it had been through a bummer of a trip. By Nancy Hass.

   COLLECTING (Undated) _ It was a night like any other. Until I
knocked over the two and a half foot tall Finnish glass candle
pedestal, designed by Oiva Toikka in 1964. It stood in my living
room behind the Florence Knoll sofa. I paid $1,600 for it two years
ago at the Triple Pier Expo, a collectibles show in New York. The
purchase broke the ceiling on my expenditure for glass, ever. It
smashed into loose change in seconds. But that was only the
beginning of the crisis. By William L. Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   LEWITT-MURAL (Undated) _ Last fall, Carole and Dick Cline were
looking for something to hang over the fireplace in the sitting
room of their new home, which overlooks a golf course near Chicago.
The couple's art consultant, Deborah Lovely, brought by a few
paintings but none that worked with the couple's antique furniture
and multicolored rug, Cline said. Then Ms. Lovely suggested a Sol
LeWitt mural _ a ``wall drawing'' in the artist's parlance. By
Christmas, the couple had something to match the rug: a geometric
drawing in diluted inks applied with sponges, covering two walls of
their sitting room _ about 250 square feet. They just didn't have a
chance to meet LeWitt. By Fred Bernstein.

terms like doorjambs and thresholds, lintels and hinges, much less
carved paneled doors. It's enough to make a minimalist swoon. By
Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   FLOWER-SHOW (Undated) _ The snowdrops are blooming and the
species tulips are popping up. Some mornings, the air is balmy and
the sun has that golden light that says, ``Spring!'' And you put on
a lighter coat and freeze to death by the afternoon, when the
winter wind blows up again. That's the signal to get on the train
and head for your favorite flower show _ to wallow in woodland
gardens impossibly blooming with dogwoods and shadbush; to bury
your nose in acres of orchids, to drool over English gardens
stuffed with blue delphiniums you could never grow. By Anne Raver.

AN INSPIRATION TO EVERYONE HE MEETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He was a young man full of life. An immigrant from
Guadalajara, he was 23 and in America. He was making a nice living
at the clothing factory, driving his own car, meeting lovely
ladies, dancing into the night.
</P>
<P>
   And he was in the wrong neighborhood, on the very wrong night.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Hernandez parked his car and walked down an unfamiliar
Lincoln Heights street looking for an address, when he was suddenly
surrounded by a gang of about eight. After some false accusations
he barely had time to deny, a shotgun emerged and a shot flashed at
his head.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was left lying on the ground, uncertain what had
happened. The police arrived within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt I was bleeding from everywhere,'' Hernandez said.
``It was total confusion for me. I heard many things. One of the
police officers put a light in my face and said, `Can you see?' I
said, `No,' but at that time I thought it was all the blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You have to see!' I know he was upset. Sometimes we
forget police are human, too. I was totally blind.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Hernandez learned his vision would never return.
And quickly he learned something else almost more painful. He now
had a new identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hurt most was immediately society placed a label on me
that said, `Less than human being,' '' he said. ``That really hurt.
It was my biggest gripe because I said, `No, I'm alive. Don't tell
me that I'm worthless. Don't tell me that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't only being blind, it was, `Sit in a corner and we're
going to take care of you. We're going to give you a check.' Hey,
thank you, but no thank you. Give me an opportunity to be myself.
Tell me what I can do instead of giving me a check and telling me
to be comfortable. That was not a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward 27 very remarkable years.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is the president and founder of the Unification of
Disabled Latin Americans. Disturbed to learn there was no
organization set up to help disabled Hispanics, Hernandez
established his own.
</P>
<P>
   Now this modest organization that receives no state or federal
funding has helped thousands of Hispanics with various
disabilities. He puts the disabled to work helping the disabled. He
finds them jobs, raises funds, leads them to rehabilitation
centers, donates wheelchairs, beds, crutches. He organizes
wheelchair basketball leagues. He leads an annual anti-violence
march. Every four months UDLA sponsors a graffiti cleanup program.
</P>
<P>
   UDLA is again one of the official charities for the Los Angeles
Marathon and is sponsoring 14 wheelchair marathoners in Sunday's
event.
</P>
<P>
   But this year Hernandez, 50, received something else from the
L.A. Marathon. He was one of three honored with the Patsy Choco
Courage Award, an annual award for those who have demonstrated
unique inspiration in overcoming a difficult challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a role model for many, many people because of the
things he's done with his life,'' said Vera Martinez, the registrar
at the Braille Institute in Los Angeles. ``Nobody can meet him
without liking him. I just think he's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was at the Braille Institute 27 years ago when
Hernandez was first brought over from the Hollywood Presbyterian
Hospital, just 1 months after the gang initiation shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez spent a year there and credits the institute for
rehabilitating him and setting him on his course. And he discovered
that almost everyone helping the blind could see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Why not allow the blind to be counselors,
teachers? To me, that was a very legitimate question,'' Hernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the institute, he enrolled at Los Angeles City
College. There was no special program for the blind, but the former
University of Guadalajara student had two volunteers - Joanne Jones
and Alice Peterson - who read his assignments and textbooks to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They became my eyes,'' he said. ``I believe in guidance. God
sent me angels every time I needed one.''
</P>
<P>
   His first year at LACC, he struggled to set up UDLA. He
organized a meeting, put up fliers, made a pot of coffee and
waited. No one came. After several tries, a few handicapped showed
and he was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of it was, it was formed with two unique
characteristics,'' he said. ``It would be run, controlled and
supervised by disabled people of all types. And it would have
services to the disabled people of all races, free of charge.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to UCLA, where he graduated summa cum laude and then
devoted full time to his non-profit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in one of his signature hats, the talkative Hernandez
directs a small but busy office, all staffed by the handicapped.
Every six months, he brings in a new group of 40-50 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of a kind,'' said Adela Atenza, one of about seven
sighted volunteers. ``He just has so much charisma. You have to
give him a lot of credit for what he's done with his resources. He
can talk to other disabled people and say, `Hey, I did it. You can
do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said his great failing has been never learning how to
raise funds. He said his operation normally runs on less than
$100,000 per year and there have been many times when he could not
pay the rent. He dreams of having his own building.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I die tomorrow, I die a happy man,'' he said. ``I
accomplished so much with so many good people around me.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ The Internet has become one of the greatest
sources of trade rumors, most of which are unfounded.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The name of Astros outfielder Daryle Ward popped up recently in
connection with Yankees reliever Ramiro Mendoza. A year ago, Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker might have considered such a deal,
but a year ago the Astros had a totally different opinion of Ward.
</P>
<P>
   The club always has known Ward could hit; that much has been
impossible to overlook. What the Astros were uncertain about was
whether he could play any position other than first base, which
belongs to Jeff Bagwell as long as he wears an Astros uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Ward answered that question last season when he made a
commitment to playing the outfield and became the Astros' every-day
left fielder down the stretch. It did wonders for his value around
the league, not to mention the Astros' estimation of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly were willing to discuss (trading Ward) a year
ago,'' Hunsicker said. ``It's hard to say too many people are
untouchable these days, but he's close to it. Ward is getting
greater recognition because of what he did last year at the
major-league level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the perceptions from a lot of organizations were
similar to ours from a year ago, mainly that this was a kid who
could hit but his defense was a question mark, and there aren't too
many 23- or 24-year-old designated hitters around.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was minimal interest a year ago, but I think that has
changed now that he has demonstrated that he can play defense, and
he certainly has demonstrated that he can hit at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the strides Ward has made in the outfield, it's his bat
that still gets everyone's attention. Astros hitting instructor Tom
McCraw has called Ward the best young hitting prospect with whom he
has worked. In 125 games split between Class AAA New Orleans and
Houston last season, Ward hit .346 with 36 homers and 95 RBIs. He
had eight homers and 30 RBIs in 150 at-bats with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros certainly don't want to lose that type of thunder
from the left side of the plate, particularly with Bagwell eligible
for free agency after the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes me feel good, because it lets me know that I'm
getting credit for the hard work that I've put in to become a
better defensive player and a better all-around player,'' Ward said
of his near-untouchable status.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ward's defense has improved, he's still not on the same
level as Moises Alou, Roger Cedeno and Richard Hidalgo _ the three
players who will form the Astros' regular outfield alignment.
Because manager Larry Dierker places great emphasis on defense,
Ward will enter the season as the Astros' fourth outfielder and
their primary lefthanded power source off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Dierker will pick his spots to use Ward, who hit
seven of his eight big-league homers against righthanders last
season. Exactly when Ward's opportunities will present themselves
is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Dierker said. ``He's not one of our top
three defensively. But we also have to score, and the other corner
outfielders (Alou and Hidalgo) are righthanded, so he may get to
play a little _ pinch-hit, mostly _ or he may get to play (a lot).
It's going to make for some hard decisions lineup-wise, because the
other guys aren't going to want to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal scenario, the Astros would prefer to have Ward, 24,
playing every day in the big leagues or in the minors. But the
reality is that Dierker needs a bat like Ward's on the bench. Ward
hit .320 with two homers and four RBIs in pinch-hit appearances for
the Astros in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched guys like Billy Spiers, Jack Howell, Stan Javier and
Dave Clark,'' Ward said. ``As long as I continue to learn, I think
I can do pretty well as a pinch hitter. I'm not going to complain.
I'm in the big leagues having fun, so there's nothing to complain
about. I feel like I can help this team. Whether it's coming off
the bench or playing every day, I'm going to do my best to help the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys run into trouble when there's not a spot for them,
and they moan and complain. They don't focus on what they have to
do and concentrate on the season that's ahead of you. There are
people constantly watching you, and you have to keep your head up,
enjoy the game and just play baseball. That's what I try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   While it appears Ward will be the odd man out in the Astros'
starting outfield, Hunsicker believes there will be plenty of
opportunities for the young slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unrealistic to think you're going to get through the
season with three outfielders,'' Hunsicker said. ``It never works
out that way, because of injuries, off years, pitching matchups,
etc. The fact he did a commendable job in the outfield has
furthered his cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``To his credit, he worked hard at his defense and made himself
into an acceptable outfielder, and now we can consider him as a
legitimate outfield candidate as well as a backup first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to wait his turn and take the opportunities that
come to him, which will be when Alou and Hidalgo get rest against
certain tough righthanded pitching matchups. That's how I see it to
start the season, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But as evidenced by the 16 times the Astros used the disabled
list in 1999, how the lineup looks at the beginning of the season
can be quite different come September.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Hakeem Olajuwon might not have feared the worst, but it did cross
his mind. Instead, he got the best news possible about his
continued tendency to run out of breath faster than he can run.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olajuwon's three days of tests uncovered a minor, treatable and
common condition that might allow him to return to the court as
soon as tonight, when the Sacramento Kings visit the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon is suffering from a reactive airway disease that
restricts the flow of air through his bronchial passages during
heavy exercise. The condition, which has caused Olajuwon's lungs to
spasm, is similar to exercise-induced asthma.
</P>
<P>
   With the diagnosis, Olajuwon knew neither his age nor his
conditioning could be blamed for his lack of stamina and that the
condition that has caused his problems should be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listed the 100 things it could have been, this is the
one you'd have made the No. 1 (most favorable) choice,'' Rockets
team physician Jim Muntz said. ``It doesn't bother him in his daily
life. And it's easily treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon, 37, has suffered from anemia and in 1997 was diagnosed
with atrial fibrillation. But tests revealed no signs of those
problems, and Muntz said Olajuwon's lung capacity was determined to
be greater than it was four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy with all the tests that were done,'' Olajuwon
said. ``My heart is in good condition. It isn't anything related to
that. I was just trying to find out what is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so happy to discover it (Olajuwon's health) wasn't
normal. I was thinking I wasn't in shape. But instead of getting
better, it was getting worse. When they ran all these tests, I
wanted to find that out. Thank God, I'm very healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to detect the problem. This can't be normal. How can
you be winded every time you go up and down (the court)? I cannot
be that out of shape, because I know I've been training so hard
just to play. Something must be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon will be treated with medication taken via an inhaler.
There are also inhalers available to treat symptoms should they
continue during games or other especially stressful activities, but
they could cause a recurrence of other problems Olajuwon has had in
past years. Thus, doctors will limit the treatment of the condition
itself.
</P>
<P>
   After going through Wednesday's practice, Olajuwon said he
already felt better after beginning treatment with an inhaler and
that he plans to play tonight. Team physician Walter Lowe said he
would have to examine Olajuwon after today's shootaround before
giving him the OK to play. The Rockets are listing Olajuwon as
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be right to have him back out there if
we have to treat these symptoms continually through games,'' Lowe
said. ``I would, and I think the other doctors treating him would,
like to see him responding to the medication he takes, able to
bring his exercise level back up, to be able to train the way he
needs to to play and then be on the court. Whether that is tomorrow
or not remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many asthmatic conditions, this one is so treatable that
a cure is expected relatively quickly. Rockets forward Carlos
Rogers treats a bronchial condition with inhalers before every
practice and game. Though Olajuwon said learning of Rogers'
condition helped put him at ease, Olajuwon's treatment is expected
to be short-term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out it is very common, not something that is major,''
Olajuwon said. ``It will take a month or two weeks and be cured.
That's what I'm hoping.''
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain whether the condition was caused by
anti-inflammatory medication Olajuwon has been taking for about
eight years. He recently changed his anti-inflammatory medication
and was taken off of it this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dream has been worried about an anti-inflammatory he's been
taking,'' Lowe said. ``It (his condition) can come from allergies.
It can come from pollution. It can come from having a cold. We're
probably never going to be able to tell where it came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is it's treatable. In the exercise world, these
lung problems are really common with kids through adults. It is
something that can come out of the blue when you were perfect two
weeks before, and now you've got it for a while. It is something
you can treat for a little while, it will go away, whatever the
stimulus was is gone, and now you're off your medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole lot of different medicines to use for this. We
have to see how Dream responds to these medications. I think
(within) four, five days, we ought to know whether the treatment
Dr. Muntz and the pulmonary guys have him on are going to work or
whether we change him to other things. Now we're in the stage we
know what's going on. Then we have to find out what medicines are
going to work for him. And then we're going to have to see him in
action on the court to see if he can get to where he needs to be to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we want to see him doing really well before he plays.
Dream is going to want to play. There's no question about that. But
we really want to see him breathing the way he needs to before he
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said he would be cautious about returning
Olajuwon to the court. Olajuwon,who is averaging 11.4 points and
6.6 rebounds this season, had 21 points and nine rebounds in a
113-111 overtime loss to the Spurs on Feb. 20. But he struggled
with exhaustion in the next three games.
</P>
<P>
   He played 28 minutes in Charlotte on Feb. 22, totaling six
points and five rebounds. He played 23 minutes against the Nuggets
on Feb. 24, scoring 10 points and grabbing six rebounds. He had six
points and six rebounds in 13 minutes against the Lakers on Sunday.
He skipped Monday's game against the Clippers to begin tests in
Houston.

   ``I have to admit I'm concerned,'' Tomjanovich said. ``Dream has
been great. He really wants to do the right thing and all that. We
just have to make sure he doesn't put himself in jeopardy in any
way.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
She looks like an athlete _ 5 feet 7 inches of solid muscle.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But if forced to guess, most people would be hard-pressed to
come up with her sport. She could be a basketball player,
volleyball even. She could run track or play soccer.
</P>
<P>
   But Baytown's Andrea Gardiner probably looks least like what she
is _ one of the top figure skaters in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport where how an athlete looks is nearly as important as
how she performs, the 19-year-old isn't letting preconceived
notions limit her accomplishments. She recently returned from
senior nationals in Cleveland, where she exceeded expectations with
her best-ever finish _ fifth place _ only 1{ years after returning
to the ice following a hip fracture. That finish makes her an
alternate for the world team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole competition was just awesome,'' Gardiner said. ``I
did what I came to do _ skate well and prove to everyone that I'm
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the crowd was so into her performance that she received
a standing ovation. But when the scores were announced, they were a
bit disappointing. The crowd reacted with boos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first year back, so I expected the scores to be
low,'' Gardiner said. ``Now that I've watched the tapes, I
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The solid showing earned her a trip last week to the Four
Continents competition in Japan, where Gardiner finished ninth in
the short program and seventh in the long for eighth place overall.
</P>
<P>
   Both competitions were breakthroughs for Gardiner, who is
working to reclaim a top reputation after time off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole goal this year was to have a positive experience
with skating again,'' coach Becky Dever said. ``That was as much as
I hoped right away. I never expected her to be as successful as she
has been right away because of the political side of skating. But
last week showed that Andrea is very much on the right path.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Gardiner won the junior nationals at the age of 16. She
wasn't a prodigy like Houston's Tara Lipinksi, who was 14 at the
time and already known internationally. But Gardiner was proving to
be a top talent with a seemingly limitless future.
</P>
<P>
   All of that was cast in doubt in July 1998 when doctors
discovered a hip fracture. Gardiner did not suffer a sudden injury
on the ice. The bone apparently just snapped because of constant
pressure and stress, the doctors explained to her. She was out for
half the year and returned to the ice at senior nationals one year
ago, when a poor showing left her in 16th place. It was time to
make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd healed enough to skate, but I was not mentally prepared,''
Gardiner said.
</P>
<P>
   She hired former top skaters Dever and Kitty Carruthers to serve
as co-coaches and rededicated herself to the sport she had missed
so much in her absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Skating) had become a very stressful environment for her,''
Dever said. ``The poor kid was a mess. We worked, most importantly,
on her mind. She needed positive reiteration. It's almost like
parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 11 months, Gardiner has made the nearly 2{-hour
round trip five or six days a week to train at the Aerodrome in
Sugar Land, and the initial results showed in Cleveland. The next
major goal will be to make the Olympic team for the 2002 Winter
Games at Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   She will be competing against some talented up-and-coming
skaters. Like in gymnastics and tennis, ice skaters seem to get
younger each year. But women like Gardiner could have an edge,
Dever said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running into an area in skating where the quickness of
the little ones is very appealing to the eye,'' Dever said. ``And
to the sponsors and agents. But it's important to the sport to have
women represent them at the senior level. They're not going to give
away the whole pot of gold to the little girls even if they are
spitfires out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a word that could be used to describe Gardiner as well.
While not a spitfire in appearance, she certainly is in attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first day that she got home from nationals, she was
already setting her goals for next year,'' Dever said. ``She's back
on the international team. She earned her right to be there. That,
in itself, is a tremendous stride, and her future possibilities are
really endless.''

exactly as planned.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is he the dominator, staring over the brim of his
glove and intimidating even the game's biggest sluggers, but merely
the battling veteran hoping to find a place among the fellas.
</P>
<P>
   It's the way Gooden has embraced this prime-of-life career
change of sorts that says something about him. It says he has grown
up. It says he has found humility and perspective where once there
was ego and a feeling of invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in Gooden's outlook on baseball and life has been
clear every day at the Astros' spring-training camp, where he has
spent long hours putting in extra work, running sprints, doing
situps, signing autographs and fitting in with his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   At 35, Gooden has seen his once-bright star go the way of the
heat on his once-virtually untouchable fastball, which is to say
it's simmering somewhere on the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   Where once there was a bigger-than-life swagger and so much
money and acclaim so soon that it all became too much, now there is
the hope of simply earning an honest day's pay for an honest day's
work.
</P>
<P>
   There is balance in his life in every way. And it is impossible
not to hope that the friendly, grounded Gooden has found a home at
a place where the only star he wears is on the bill of his Astros
cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 19, I didn't realize everything I had,'' Gooden
said. ``I thought it would always be there. Maybe I didn't
appreciate it the way I should have.''
</P>
<P>
   The happy ending of Gooden's story would be his entering Astros
camp and suddenly regaining some semblance of his once-amazing
stuff. But that hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden is battling hard to find a place in the rotation, and his
progress has been slow. Good days have been followed by mediocre
ones.
</P>
<P>
   In a simulated game Monday afternoon, Gooden looked strong.
Astros manager Larry Dierker said Gooden's ball was livelier than
he had seen since camp began.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday in the same situation, Gooden was knocked around
as much as he set down bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm was tired, but I knew that was coming,'' he said. ``I
know this time of year you have to break down your arm and then
build it back up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Doc realizes he has come to the point in his career where he
must cure himself. And if he does, it would remedy many questions
for the Astros' pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first five years of his career with the Mets, Gooden
was by many accounts the most dominating pitcher in the game. Only
once in those first five years did he win fewer than 17 games or
strike out fewer than 175 batters _ a 15-7 year with 148 strikeouts
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He was pivotal in the Mets' World Series championship season of
1986. In 1985, when he went 24-4 at age 20, he was the youngest
player ever to win the Cy Young Award and also the youngest ever to
win 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past five years with the Mets, Yankees and Indians,
only once did Gooden win more than nine games or strike out more
than 88, going 11-7 with 126 strikeouts in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago with the Indians, Gooden found himself shuffled back
and forth from the bullpen, confused and frustrated the whole way,
and finished 3-4 with a 6.26 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for Gooden to redefine his game. And where better to
look to do that than with the Astros, where the clubhouse
atmosphere is relaxed and laid back, like Gooden? The starting
pitching staff also is in a state of transition, with Mike Hampton
gone, Scott Elarton recovering from surgery, and Shane Reynolds and
Jose Lima the only sure things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a chance here, and that's all I can ask for right
now,'' Gooden said. ``I don't have to be so much crafty as just
have the location and command of the pitches. When I was younger
and I fell behind in the count, everybody in the stadium knew what
was coming next _ the fastball. I can't do that now. I have to be
more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Progress has been slow. But there has been some. The Astros need
Gooden as much as Gooden needs the Astros. The Doctor is out. The
Insurance Man is in.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible not to hope this match works.

L.A. POLICE DEFENSIVE, BLAME THEIR TOP BRASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Police patrolling the city's streets in the hours
after a devastating report decried a culture of ``mediocrity'' in
the LAPD and expressed mixed but passionate sentiments over the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Many defended the maligned command staff, others argued a few
bad apples were causing the entire Los Angeles Police Department's
reputation to rot, and still others placed the blame squarely on
the top brass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chief who is anti-cop,'' said Officer Kathy Simpson,
a 14-year veteran of the department, assigned to the West San
Fernando Valley. ``The brass needs to be changed. It's all politics
up there.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a nearly 400-page report, released Wednesday, that
found no evidence of widespread corruption within the department
but argued mediocrity was flourishing at every level.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Ray Barron said most of the officers he works with are
good people. He argued that the Rampart scandal is isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our supervisors are very professional,'' he said. ``But it's
like any job. There are people you like working for and with, and
there are some people you don't like working for or with.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was issued after corrupt-cop-turned-informant Rafael
Perez told investigators that he and other dirty cops in the
Rampart Division framed suspects, stole evidence and shot unarmed
residents. He agreed to talk in exchange for a lighter sentence for
stealing cocaine from an evidence locker.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors and the rank and file across Los Angeles received
copies of the report and were briefed about it at roll calls
Wednesday afternoon before heading out to their posts.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Inquiry report, which was given to the Police
Commission on Wednesday, found that Rampart supervisors rarely
challenged officers' incident reports, even if they were
far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   Among its findings, the report stated, ``This scandal has
devastated our relationship with the public we serve and threatened
the integrity of our entire criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a positive reception from the public,'' he said. ``You
can't put a blanket statement over all of the department. Nobody
likes stereotyping.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, officers at Rampart were free to bend
or break rules to make more arrests. But Officer Estancio Rosales
countered that he had never been roughed up by cops in the 20 years
that he grew up in the Rampart area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's isolated,'' he said. ``There are some bad apples. Society
is not perfect.''

HE IMMORTALIZES PRIZE CATCHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Robert Munoz has heard fish stories from all over
the world, and believe it or not, every one of them is true.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 25 years, fishermen from Tarzana to Tokyo have put
Munoz in charge of producing replicas of their prized catches.
Munoz, and others like him, bucked the trend of mounting the actual
fish, known as skin mounts, in favor of creating molds that lead to
longer-lasting trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen have two options in immortalizing their catches. They
can bring the actual fish or several clear photos of it to Munoz,
or they can purchase one of his many premade species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business continues to be great,'' Munoz said while taking a
break from his mostly one-man operation in Baldwin Park. ``I don't
even need to advertise, and I get customers from all over the
world. Germany, Italy, Taiwan, Japan, Spain ... it's really
amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's all word of mouth. I will do work for one guy and he
will go home and show five of his buddies, and it just keeps
spreading from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses such as Munoz's help promote the idea of catching and
releasing fish. Anglers can experience the thrill of bringing in a
catch, and with Munoz' help they can create a lifelike replica even
though they threw back the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz works on approximately four fish per day, which includes
making the mold and painting. He charges an average of $11 per
inch, although the figures vary based on the type of fish. He
continues to accept orders for skin mounts, although the demand is
much smaller than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took awhile for this way to be accepted,'' Munoz said.
``For a long while, a lot of the old-timers thought skin mounts
were the only way to do it. They didn't say that (making a mold)
couldn't be done, but nobody knew how.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz, then in his early 20s and working for a taxidermist, set
out to create a mold from which he could replicate any species of
fish, a task that proved both expensive and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in those days, we had to buy gallons of whatever material
we wanted to try and just experiment with it,'' Munoz said. ``I'll
never forget when I figured out that first mold, I was so excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been working on it for six or eight months, and one day
I worked on one and then fell asleep. I woke up three or four hours
later, opened up the mold and it was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of skin mounts continued to fade over the years,
not just because of the conservation movement but also because the
skin mounts tended to peel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, people put them up in their living room or
whatever, and their heating and air conditioning systems cause a
lot of problems,'' Munoz said. ``The oil in the skin tends to
expand and contract depending on the temperature, and that causes a
lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz follows a pattern for customers who seek a custom mount,
one that is often filled with pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times people will just bring in a picture, one
picture, and expect an exact duplicate, and that's just not
possible,'' Munoz said. ``A lot of people have a bad picture, maybe
because the fish is in bad shape, and when I show them what the
fish is supposed to look like, they don't believe me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody actually brings a catch into the store, the
first thing I look at is the condition of the fish, to see if it
has any scars or marks or anything. If it's a good candidate for a
replica, I can do it, or I suggest that they just buy one that I
already made.''
</P>
<P>
   Buying a premade mount allows the customer to have his fish
instantly, rather than waiting several weeks. Munoz has his
22-year-old son, Robert Jr., working in the office with him, and at
age 47 he is starting to wonder what the future will hold for his
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to hire a painter a couple years ago, but I
just couldn't find the right person with the passion for the job,''
Munoz said. ``There are other methods out there to be mastered, but
they will take several years to figure out. I'm still having fun
with this though and the orders keep coming in.''

HIKERS SHOULD ALWAYS BE PREPARED FOR BAD WEATHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The weather on a recent Saturday was perfect and
it had Dave Smail worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gorgeous day,'' said Smail, who is one of the
directors of the L.A. County Sheriff's San Dimas Mountain Search
and Rescue Squad. ``It was definitely a day to be concerned about.
People see it as a gorgeous day and decide to go hiking. They're
not expecting bad weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the weather forecast - sunny days with overnight clouds
and early morning rain Sunday - held true. But what if the weather
changed? It's not an unlikely scenario; forecasts can change in a
matter of hours, especially in the Southern California mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people knew it was supposed to rain Sunday, but if a
group went Saturday and the weather forecast changed in the
afternoon, they wouldn't know about it,'' Smail said. ``It's a
concern for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sunday, it was raining and the temperature had dropped.
Monday, it was even colder and the snow level was down to 3,500
feet. Things like this happen more often than not.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of those day-trippers, Smail and others say, might take
just water and lunch. If the sun is shining and it's warm, they
might even leave the jacket in the car. They might be anglers who
hike up the West Fork of the San Gabriel River for early-morning
fishing, armed with only fishing gear, a snack and jacket.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the weather changes? The clothing gets wet, there's
no protection and it gets cold in a hurry. The hiker is suddenly
prone to hypothermia. Being exposed to the elements eventually
causes illogical thinking, loss of body temperature and can lead to
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern is to get people out safely and the weather
at this time of the year is a concern,'' Smail said.
</P>
<P>
   The team was successful in helping rescue four hikers in the
Angeles National Forest above Glendora on Tuesday. They had camping
gear and were prepared for the inclement weather, though. They were
found when rescuers say they spotted flashlight signals. Among the
10 items recommended by Smail, and other groups, for hikers is a
flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   Smail points out that food is not on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water is,'' he said. ``You can go several days without food.
It's not an essential. But water is.''
</P>
<P>
   Another essential, especially at this time of the year, is
protective clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a trash bag,'' Smail said.
</P>
<P>
   With a hole cut on top for the head, trash bags are ideal for
protecting hikers from rain and wind.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ March arrived and the march continued, though
mostly in stop-motion action.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours removed from their ballyhooed battle in the
Pacific Northwest, the Los Angeles Lakers returned home Wednesday
for a date with considerably less sizzle, and certainly none of the
intrigue of their just-completed victory over rival Portland.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Vancouver Grizzlies tried to provide their own
sort of drama, of the upset variety, it was a short-lived notion.
The Lakers marched over their overmatched opponent to their 13th
consecutive victory, 103-91, at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the previous 16-game winning streak, this latest
string means the Lakers (47-11) are once again tilling new ground.
This is the longest pair of double-digit streaks a Lakers team has
had in one season.
</P>
<P>
   Such achievements don't come without the occasional junk game.
This was one of them as the listless Lakers, sapped by a night of
tension and hype, couldn't put the Grizzlies (18-39) away until
late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things young teams learn ... is that you
accommodate highs and lows of a basketball season,'' coach Phil
Jackson said. ``After playing a game to an excited crowd last
night, we were somnolent out there in this game. We were walking
wounded, in our sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   That was evident in the way Kobe Bryant missed 13 of 22 shots
(but still finished with a game-high 27 points), in the way
Shaquille O'Neal collected fouls in bunches (fouling out late in
the fourth quarter) and in the way Glen Rice (eight points) never
really found a rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our legs were heavy,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal, newly crowned NBA player of the month for February,
was effective between fouls, making 11 of 17 shots to finish with
25 points, 17 rebounds, five assists and five blocked shots. Bryant
found his energy late, scoring 19 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't take this team lightly or feel like this was any
less of a game as far as our opponent,'' guard Derek Fisher said.
``This is the toughest game of the two, really, because it's easy
to get yourself going and bring your `A' game against a team that
everybody's been talking about the matchup, and a team that you've
been battling with all year for the NBA's best record....
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud because our effort was there,'' Fisher said.
``Things weren't necessarily clicking, but like I've said a million
times this season, these are games that the four years that I've
been here, we could have easily found ourselves on the losing end,
because we weren't playing our best game. But we still found a way
to grind it out.''
</P>
<P>
   They did it with another inspired effort from the bench. Robert
Horry scored 10 points, leading a 32-point effort from the
reserves. And the bench finally put the Grizzlies away.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers hadn't led by more than six points and were only up
by a point late in the third when O'Neal went to the bench with his
fifth foul. Then the Lakers hit four consecutive 3-pointers, from
Brian Shaw, Horry, Rick Fox and Bryant, to take a 77-69 lead into
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Knight's putback jam and another 3-pointer from Fox made
it a double-digit lead, 82-71, less than three minutes into the
final period, and the Grizzlies never got close again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our second unit is giving us the energy we need to play with
teams now, as we get into this, hard days, a lot of games and a lot
of travel, and we need the energy of this team to be picked up from
the players coming off the bench,'' said Jackson, named NBA coach
of the month for February.
</P>
<P>
   For fourth-quarter excitement, fans had to settle for a couple
of spiffy Bryant dunks and Fisher's flying leap over the $1,000
courtside seats - complete with a foot to actor Jon Lovitz's head -
to save a ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did like we usually do, we played down to the talent of our
competition,'' O'Neal said. ``However, we gutted it out and got a
win.''

SUPERIOR INDISTRIES MAKES MARKET INROADS
</HEADLINE>

By JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ Superior Industries International Inc.
announced Wednesday that it has won an initial multimillion-dollar
order from Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsubishi order is latest new contract for Superior, a Van
Nuys- based supplier of aluminum wheels and other vehicle
components. The company has recently added DaimlerChrysler and
Rover to a customer base that includes General Motors and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The contract with Mitsubishi could be worth up to $10 million,
according to Jeff Ornstein, Superior's vice president and chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   But the initial value pales in comparison its long-term
potential, said Doug Christopher, an analyst with Los Angeles-based
Crowell, Weedon &AMP; Co. The wheel contract may pave the way for more
work in the future as Superior builds a relationship with
Mitsubishi, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another customer added to their growing list of
customers,'' Christopher said. ``It's a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that the add-on business would be significantly
larger than the original contract,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Superior has already begun shipments of aluminum road wheels to
Mitsubishi's facility in Normal, Ill. The wheels will be used for
two 2001 model cars.
</P>
<P>
   Superior stock closed Wednesday at $23.88, unchanged from
Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Christoper said Superior's stock has gotten little respect
despite the company's strong earnings and solid balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the dominant company in the industry. The company is
in an excellent position,'' he said. ``Unfortunately in this
market, no one really cares about the traditional businesses.''

   Finally, a major if still barely coordinated relief effort is

nearly enough to mollify the anger of international aid agencies at
what they condemn as yet another ``pathetic'' failure of the rich

in a Third World country. ``If this had happened in the West, the

   Admittedly, the electoral fat lady has not yet sung. But with a
string of victories for George W. Bush in the GOP primaries on
Tuesday that left John McCain, his challenger, sprawled on the
ropes, it looks increasingly as though the race will ultimately
come down _ predictably _ to Bush and Al Gore. It may not be
exciting, but countries have faced worse problems than that. &QL;

GORE AND BRADLEY LOCK HORNS IN LOS ANGELES DEBATE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a Los Angeles debate that could be the last
between Democratic presidential hopefuls Al Gore and Bill Bradley,
the two opponents switched course Wednesday by striking a friendly
tone and setting themselves apart from the Republican candidates on
issues like abortion, campaign reform and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Gov. Bush and Sen. McCain are as anti-choice as you can
get,'' Vice President Gore said, referring to the two Republican
candidates. Knowing that is important to voters because the next
president will likely be called upon to nominate three judges to
the country's highest court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, said that, if elected
president, he would appoint Supreme Court judges who interpret the
Constitution with contemporary considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new conservatism is the same as the old conservatism,'' he
said, adding that he would make it a top priority to uphold the
historic court decision of Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was seen as a last prayer for Bradley to breathe new

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Extra! Extra! Coupons in here!
 &HT;    (For release March 5, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several decades ago, our newspaper's advertising director
suggested to me that we run a streamer across the top of the front
page advising readers that there were coupons in that edition worth
$200. A hidebound traditionalist, I rejected his idea and, instead,
put something of news value across the top _ or at least what I
believed to be news value.
</P>
<P>
   That my newspaper _ The Miami News _ eventually went out of
business speaks volumes about my reader judgment. While we in the
newspaper game believe news is what sells _ that's what our
detractors also claim: ``They're just doing that to sell
newspapers'' _ it may not be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Things such as discount coupons, entertainment news and sports
seem to be in a position of domination at many newspapers across
the country. It's also showing in news magazines as well, or
haven't you seen entertainment-skewed Time magazine lately?
</P>
<P>
   What's the bigger sell: A story that state contractors are using
substandard materials or that Kathy Lee Gifford is leaving her
morning show? What's of greater interest to readers: That the
county's homeless shelter is flat broke, or that there's a bunch of
coupons inside the paper?
</P>
<P>
   Several Sundays ago, my local newspaper ran a streamer on its
front page, advising readers that coupons within the paper _ in an
inserted booklet from a national drug chain _ were worth over $500
in savings.
</P>
<P>
   That the newspaper used part of its front page for promoting
advertisements is an issue between the various departments of the
newspaper, and its publisher. The sad truth likely is that more
readers turned to that coupon-filled booklet than to the editorial
page.
</P>
<P>
   One of my earlier editors would insist that a ``woman's
interest'' story appear on Page 1 every day because, he said, women
made the decisions about what newspaper to have delivered to the
house. The problem was that I never could define what was ``woman's
interest.'' Judging by many I know today, it very well could be the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Inasmuch as federal authorities have recently announced plans to
clamp down on advertising claims by long-distance telephone
companies (I never believed them anyway; not the 10 cents, not the
unlimited calls stuff), I set out to see what was with this claim
of $500 in coupons in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Surely I have better things to do, but I felt compelled. How
much did I have to spend to save $500 in a drugstore? So I leafed
through the 236 coupons in the booklet; not once but twice, all the
time tapping on the adding machine.
</P>
<P>
   Fully half the coupons did not give the price of the item, just
noted that it was 25 percent off or 25 cents off. The other ads had
the regular price and the price with the coupon. It was those that
I added up.
</P>
<P>
   It came to $1,770.25. That's what I would have to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, that's the total of only about half; do we double it
for those that did not include the price?
</P>
<P>
   I doubt that anyone saved $500 with coupons at the drugstore
that week, or ever intended to. This booklet was discounting
everything from phone cards to condoms to laxatives to hair spray _
no discounts on prescription drugs by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could take advantage of the full savings offered by these
coupons; who needs ALL that stuff? But the aggregate total of its
value made for a good streamer headline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man bites dog'' or ``Headless woman in topless bar'' seem to
have become outmoded by reader tastes and journalistic drift. Now
the big news is that there are coupons in the paper worth more than
$500 in savings.
</P>
<P>
   And I understand why it is happening. They're just doing it to
sell newspapers.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The impetus behind McCain's right jab
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't make too much of John McCain's dramatic disavowal of the
tele-reverends Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture was at least as much a matter of personal pique _
the two and their allies trashed McCain in South Carolina _ as it
was a principled assertion of political realignment.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the act wasn't brave after its fashion. Falwell and,
latterly, Robertson especially have been bully boys in the GOP for
years, using their presumed moral suasion openly, and wielding
their control of church-bidden voters less overtly, to pull the
party into an agenda that blends political conservatism and
Protestant fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting hybrid movement has fielded a partisan infantry
for the party _ some 20 percent of its reliable electorate by most
counts _ but at some cost.
</P>
<P>
   In elections where all else was equal, the muddle of dogma and
right-wing politics has lost the party more at the polls than it
has won.
</P>
<P>
   A shakeup that stopped that tail from wagging the dog would be
painful to the GOP at first but healthy for it in the long run,
just as the comparable change was when the Democratic Party
recaptured its own center by taking back the veto power it had
granted its fringes in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But while McCain claims to be after a similar move for his
party, that is less than certain.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign recruited its erstwhile rival, Gary Bauer,
longtime head of the Family Research Council, and while he was
excoriating Robertson and Falwell, McCain went out of his way to
praise, among other religious-right figures, James Dobson, mogul of
the sprawling Focus on the Family operations.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, except that Falwell and Robertson are more lurid and
Dobson and Bauer have managed to fly just under most media radar,
there is little to choose between Dobson-Bauer and
Robertson-Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   All are of a piece with the Christian-nation movement, either
advocating it or fellow-traveling with those who do. The aim is to
turn public policy and law into what Christian conservatives deem
the logical civil version of Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he dumped on the two televangelists, McCain emphasized
his solidarity with much of the evangelical political agenda _ his
commitment to outlaw nearly all abortions, to fund vouchers for
religious schools, to harass Internet pornography and more.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is certainly right to argue for a Republican Party that
is more Lincoln than Robertson, a party comfortable with religious
diversity rather than sullenly tolerant of it. But as we've seen
over the course of his jump-up, jack-in-the-box candidacy, politics
is intensely personal with John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It is very much an open question whether McCain was just doing
pay-back to Robertson and Falwell or whether he is girded for a
battle that would extend beyond this political season to build a
party that would continue to welcome religious conservatives but
would slip its thralldom to the political preachers who swank
around in their name.

 &HT;    Presidential race like a poker game
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ People who have been around politics usually
know better than to make predictions. Politics, after all, is about
people, and people are quite unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than engage in prophecy, the experienced political
watcher often will speak in hypothetical. Since Gov. George W.
Bush's defeat in New Hampshire, some folks around here are using
poker slang in assessing his situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'd better look at his hole cards,'' said one,
meaning taking stock of the cards the other players can't see and
deciding then whether to call, raise or (gulp!) fold.
</P>
<P>
   It's not at all likely the governor will fold his presidential
campaign, though challenger John McCain is teaching him a poker
lesson or two.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still given good odds to win, but the stroll to the
nomination that people were predicting six months ago didn't
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   And that is emboldening some around here to do the ``I could
have told you so'' routine, but not too loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is some hypothetical talk about the prospect of
the Republican presidential nomination being decided at the
convention. Just imagine what a return to the thrilling days of
yesteryear that would be.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a convention had any suspense to it was the 1960
Democratic convention in Los Angeles that produced the
Kennedy-Johnson ticket. Since then, however, nominations have been
decided long before the delegates set foot on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   If it is a convention scenario, then you're talking about a real
poker game where anything can happen. It could even be that Bush
has to take a look at the prospect of becoming a vice presidential
candidate or inviting McCain to join the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   We are, of course, just speaking hypothetically.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people have too much invested in Bush to give up
easily. The motives for those investments vary. Some have made
assumptions about Bush vacating his office and what happens then.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been that long ago that people were talking about who
moves where when Bush leaves for Washington. Lt. Gov. Rick Perry
would become governor, which would leave his post open to a
hypothetical contest between Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander,
Land Commissioner David Dewhurst and Sens. David Sibley (R-Waco)
and Teel Bivins (R-Amarillo).
</P>
<P>
   And hypothetically speaking, such a scramble would create
opportunities for advancement to fill those offices, which in turn
would open other doors.
</P>
<P>
   But that speculation has been cooled by McCain's show of
strength. It's a tough game and getting tougher as McCain and Bush
wrestling for control of the betting. Bush got raised in Michigan
and McCain is raising again in the March 7 Super Tuesday primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's hole cards aren't bad. His record as Texas
governor has a little something for everyone. He made public
education a priority, he engaged in foreign policy, and overall he
made good appointments to the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Bush was presumed to be way ahead was his presumed
ability to duplicate his crossover appeal in Texas on a national
basis. What he and his backers are learning again is that they play
poker differently in a national race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still given good odds to win the nomination. It just
isn't as easy as people thought it was going to be.

 &HT;    Is the honeymoon over?
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The ``Doonesbury'' cartoon for Tuesday was a
sign. Sen. John McCain, the former prisoner of war who disrupted
Gov. George W. Bush's smooth ride to the Republican nomination, may
be starting to have his paint peeled.
</P>
<P>
   Doonesbury, which had ignored McCain's insurgent campaign until
the day before, pondered McCain's mystical popularity. The
occasionally daffy Cricket has gone to work in conservative
McCain's anti-establishment campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's odd,'' she admits, ``is that I don't actually agree
with him on anything. But I'm drawn to his candor and independence
and quirky charm.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry Trudeau's cartoon is not exactly representative of the
press corps covering the McCain campaign. But the fact that
Trudeau, who has depicted former Vice President Dan Quayle as a
feather and George W. as a cowboy hat (with no cattle), finally is
dealing with McCain is just the latest evidence that McCain is
coming into the sights of The Dragon.
</P>
<P>
   That's the name veteran journalist Ross Ramsey, editor of the
Texas Weekly political newsletter, gives to the intense media
scrutiny that can suddenly focus on a presidential candidate who
becomes a front-runner or major contender. Paul Begala, who
co-managed Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign, calls it The
Laser _ because it is so hot and searing that it can melt almost
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The press can fawn _ witness George W. last year, Clinton in
1991 _ and McCain has been its recent darling. His
stream-of-consciousness openness on his ``Straight Talk Express''
campaign bus _ ask me anything _ impressed reporters used to a
stiffer distance.
</P>
<P>
   George W. had undergone scrutiny about allegations of drug use
and National Guard favoritism. But last year the former first son
also enjoyed star treatment from national reporters, including a
seven-part series in The Washington Post last summer, and was
featured on the covers of major news magazines. He thought he had
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Until New Hampshire. Bush's canned, rote remarks and distance
from reporters raised the question: Does he have The Right Stuff?
McCain's strong upset victory won him the magazine covers. Then,
because of Bush's response in South Carolina, The Dragon focused on
his campaign tactics _ particularly his appearance at
fundamentalist Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, the Bush campaign's recurrent claim that
McCain's ``Straight Talk Express'' is guilty of recurrent moving
violations has been accompanied by increasingly critical press
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few of the columns and stories include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott Greenberger in the Austin American-Statesman, about the
backlash McCain created among Asian Americans by his use of the
term ``gooks'' to describe his North Vietnamese captors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nicholas D. Kristof's report in The New York Times Sunday on
McCain's returning from Vietnam and dumping his wife, a former
model who had been seriously injured in a car accident. He then
married a 25-year-old former cheerleader whose beer baron father
helped McCain become a congressman from Arizona a year after moving
there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Congressional Quarterly, which put a smiling McCain on the
cover of a recent issue with the headline, ``If he's so popular,
why do senators hate McCain?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman, who wrote incredulously
about swooning Democrats who think Ralph Nader isn't liberal enough
yet are ditching Bill Bradley to vote for McCain. What's up?
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't agree with McCain on anything but campaign-finance
reform,'' Goodman writes. ``They're pro-choice, he's pro-life.
They're pro-gun control, he's pro-gun. They're in favor of a
nuclear test ban; he's opposed. They're for strong environmental
protection; he's not. But, hey dude, he's a stand-up guy with a
good sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cohen of FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting), a
left-of-center national media watch group headquartered in New
York, recently wrote that McCain had co-opted the objectivity of
the boys and girls on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of McCain's appeal to elite journalists is Vietnam
guilt,'' Cohen opined. ``Many baby boomer reporters were
well-connected collegians who dodged the war. In McCain they see a
hero, someone who didn't evade the war and who bravely survived
brutality in captivity.'' So they hold their punches.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff, that may be changing. The Dragon may be focusing its fire.

 &HT;    London bridge is going up
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ You usually can't go wrong with sightseeing in London.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most jaded traveler can't resist the Changing of the
Guard at Buckingham Palace or the spot where the ax beheaded
unlucky royals at the Tower of London, or Madame Tussaud's Wax
Museum, where you can see how much shorter you are than Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And now there's the new British Airways London Eye, which looks
like a humongous Ferris wheel. (Unlike the Ferris wheel, it has
enclosed motorized passenger capsules positioned on the outside of
the wheel structure, and it is supported by an A-frame from only
one side.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans should like it because they like rides,'' said one
passenger.
</P>
<P>
   I had to admit it _ I liked it.
</P>
<P>
   The new Millennium Bridge, the first pedestrian bridge to be
built across the Thames since the 18th century, is scheduled to
open in the spring but looks to be running behind schedule like its
sister millennium project, the London Eye.
</P>
<P>
   Londoners are a bit touchy about the Eye, which was an
embarrassment on New Year's Eve when the whole world got to see it
standing there, broken, a monument to other things in the United
Kingdom that are hard to fix.
</P>
<P>
   But they do like to talk about something else that's new, the
Millennium Dome, the world's largest structure of its kind,
covering 130 acres.
</P>
<P>
   It opened for the New Year's Eve celebration but has attracted
far fewer people than expected since then, less than half the
number projected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes all day to see it,'' some moan. ``What is it
anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boring.'' ``Expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   People I talked to were so outspoken about it that I didn't go.
I didn't have the time anyway, but I want to see if it's truly as
bad as that.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem may be the name of the exhibitions _ The
Greatest Show on Earth _ which doesn't really say what it is. In
fact, it doesn't have dancing elephants or acrobats.
</P>
<P>
   What it does have are 14 themed zones ``examining the choices
facing humankind at work, rest and play in the 21st century.''
Exhibits will close at the end of the year. Walk, don't run.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are West End theaters, the Tower Bridge, Thames
River cruises, the Changing of the Guard (ask at your hotel about
days), parts of Buckingham Palace that will open to the public in
August, the Changing of the Horse Guard, and shopping on Bond,
Regent and Oxford streets.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to see the sights is from the top of a
double-decker sightseeing bus, wind in your hair and Westminster at
your feet.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Information: Call (800) 462-2748 or drop by a tourist office in
London such as the one at Victoria Station.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels: I like the Lime Tree Hotel. It's only three blocks from
Victoria Station and the bus station, and a nice stroll to
Harrod's, Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, St. James Park and more.
</P>
<P>
   Sightseeing buses: Ask at your hotel about the nearest stop. Or
buy tickets at the Tourist Office at Victoria Station.

<P>
   ATHENS' NEW RIDE: THE SUBWAY
</P>
<P>
   Dandelions grow in the crevices of ancient rocks on the side of
the Acropolis, and sparrows chirp in the olive and pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   It feels like early spring, cool not cold, and the climb up the
marble steps is exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards at the top are wonders of the ancient world _ three
ancient temples built in the fifth century B.C. including the
glorious, marble-columned Parthenon, a testament to the golden age
of Pericles.
</P>
<P>
   A Greek school class sat in front of the building, and hands
were raised as children eagerly answered the teacher's questions.
No bad behavior on this field trip.
</P>
<P>
   A trickle of tourists _ a nice change from the crowds of summer
_ roamed the ancient buildings, their video cameras recording every
step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Close to the Parthenon is the site of the legendary contest
between Athena and Poseidon, and the Erechtheum, a shrine to Athena
and the twin deity Poseidon-Erechtheus. Six support columns on the
south side were carved in the shape of maidens, or caryatids. (The
real ones are in the museum.)
</P>
<P>
   On previous trips here, I've hired guides, who usually are
stationed at the entrance to the Acropolis, and it's worth the
small fee to help bring the monuments to life. (Talk for a few
minutes first to make sure he or she speaks English.) But on this
trip I carried a guidebook and took my time to admire the temples
and the city stretched to the horizon beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to see the Acropolis is the Sound and Light Show at
night. You sit on the terrace on the west side of Phillopappou
Hill, where ancient Athenians met in democratic assembly, and one
by one, the ancient buildings are spotlighted and their stories are
told.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Athens' ancient sites, and there are many, are within
walking distance of the Acropolis. But you need to spend several
days here to see them.
</P>
<P>
   I stayed at the foot of the Acropolis in the Plaka, the oldest
quarter in the city, where cars are not allowed on most of its
narrow, winding stone streets. If you get lost you can always look
up to get your bearings.
</P>
<P>
   Many people speak English, and if they don't, they are still
extremely helpful. I asked a woman for directions to a certain
street and she took my arm and walked with me for a block to point
out the way.
</P>
<P>
   At night you'll have a hard time finding a bad meal. At many
small restaurants you can go into the kitchen and point out what
you want. I could go to Athens and be content to do nothing but
eat.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, I took the funicular up Mount Lycabettus, which is
exhilarating too. If you're afraid of heights, just don't look
down.
</P>
<P>
   At the top, you can walk around, get ice cream in the cafeteria
and enjoy a spectacular view of the city _ and the Acropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in Syntagma Square in the heart of Athens, you can see
the Acropolis towering above the city.
</P>
<P>
   But for the newest attraction, you have to go below ground.
</P>
<P>
   Walk through glass doors in a small building near the Parliament
side of the park and take an escalator down.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see the city's new subway station, which opened early
this month. At first glance, the cavernous room looks like a
museum: gleaming marble floors, ancient pottery and statues behind
glass cases, dramatic lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Take another escalator, and you'll find the ticket counters and
subway maps, and take still another escalator and you'll see the
new red subway trains.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one main line, but it sure beats driving on the
streets above.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   Hotels: The Electra Palace Hotel has a rooftop bar, next to a
small swimming pool, that offers an outstanding view of the
Acropolis. Room rates are about $100. There are many small inns and
inexpensive pensions in the Plaka.

 &HT;    London from the ground up, up, up!
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A big wheel is churning out big excitement in London,
but the ``Eye'' isn't all that's the talk of the town. The world's
largest observation wheel is supposed to open March 3, delayed from
New Year's because of mechanical problems. Other ``big'' events:
The completion of the new Millennium Bridge, set for spring, and
the Millennium Dome, which is already open. And the Blair baby, due
in May, has tourists all aflutter. Who says London is stodgy?
</P>
<P>
   WHEEL OF FORTUNE
</P>
<P>
   From many places in London, including the prime minister's
residence, you can see the world's largest ``observation wheel.''
At the top, riders have 25-mile views.
</P>
<P>
   The London Eye was supposed to open New Year's Day, but because
of a ``clutch problem'' in one of the capsules, it won't open until
March 3.
</P>
<P>
   The enclosed glass capsules each hold 25 people. The wheel moves
at ``walking pace,'' slowly and silently. I took a ride on a test
run, and I could see the Thames winding through neighborhoods,
Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park and even Windsor Castle.
</P>
<P>
   And is that the queen getting into a helicopter at the palace?
Maybe another royal. Take binoculars. (Or you can rent them at the
London Eye ticket counter.)
</P>
<P>
   THE BLAIR BABY
</P>
<P>
   A baby is coming to No. 10 Downing St. Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his wife, Cherie, are expecting in May.
</P>
<P>
   In London, some people think it's a bit unseemly. Mrs. Blair is
45. ``It is rather LATE, don't you think?'' commented a matron in a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more excited. That's the foremost thing in the minds
of the tourists gathered outside the couple's residence. ``Do they
know if it's a boy or girl?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will she still work?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They look quite happy.''
</P>
<P>
   I LOVE LONDON FOOD
</P>
<P>
   I may be the only one in the world who loves to eat in London.
They have nouveau pub cuisine, but go for the real thing at a real
pub _ bangers (sausages) and mash (potatoes), Yorkshire pudding,
shepherd's pie (who could resist ground beef with mashed potatoes
on top?) and hot scones with clotted cream.
</P>
<P>
   And what I really love is fish and chips _ cod and potatoes
fried, then doused in malt vinegar and wrapped in paper. The grease
will drip to your elbows.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to skip the kidney pie. It has a flavor all its
own.
</P>
<P>
   CHANGING GUARDS: TWO FOR THE SHOW
</P>
<P>
   When the guards at Buckingham Palace in London go to work, they
could just say, ``Here I am, cheerio.'' But that wouldn't be any
fun for the tourists, so the guards put on a display that attracts
thousands of people, complete with a brass band and a drum section.
This is the best free show in town.
</P>
<P>
   In Athens, the soldiers who guard the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier next to the Greek Parliament don't have a band, but they do
wear the kind of uniform that is sure to draw a crowd _ short
skirts and pointy red shoes. The guards, called evzones, do some
high kicks and a Michael Jackson-like moon walk that makes their
rubber-soled shoes squeak on the marble courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to picture either one of them seriously guarding the queen
or Greek Parliament. Instead of shooting the enemy, they could just
throw a tuba.

 &HT;    Ride Bush's tails? GOP school board member tells Bush tales
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ You say that dentists aren't known for living
dangerously. Meet San Antonio dentist Bob Offutt. He needles George
Bush without Novocain.
</P>
<P>
   Offutt is a state school board member. He's a Republican. He has
an opponent, retired teacher Dan Montgomery, in the March 14
primary. No Democrat is running.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than spend his free time campaigning for himself, in
recent weeks Offutt spent time campaigning against Bush. The Steve
Forbes campaign flew Offutt and former board member Donna Ballard
to New Hampshire and Iowa to tell Republicans how wrong Bush is
about education.
</P>
<P>
   In these days when the GOP establishment criticizes John McCain
for talking out of school, Offutt hasn't just been talking. He's
been sky-writing.
</P>
<P>
   What's he saying? He says that Bush is for centralized control
over local school policies despite words to the opposite. Offutt
says Texas' policy that ultimately will pin student promotion in
grades 3, 5 and 8 to a state basic skills test is a harbinger,
under a G.W. Bush presidency, of federal control.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it will cause conservatives to wince, but Offutt has a
point. The increasing emphasis on the Texas Assessment of Academic
Skills means more state control over what teachers do.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Offutt, who is considered the leader of the
conservative wing of the school board, has his own inconsistencies
if local control is his aim. Board conservatives are aching to
regain control over content in state textbooks, something the Texas
Legislature took away with Bush's blessing, giving school districts
more textbook choices.
</P>
<P>
   The right wing of the school board has been at war with Bush and
the Legislature essentially from the start. In Montgomery, Offutt
faces a foe who has support from key GOP players in District 5,
including State Sen. David Sibley and State Rep. Kip Averitt.
District 5 includes McLennan, Bell and Coryell counties.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a dilemma for Republicans. In many ways Offutt could be
considered the party's hero. He recruited a slate of fellow social
conservatives to run for the state school board. They included a
home schooler and others who kept their children out of public
schools. Whether by stealth, voter apathy or organization, Offutt's
quest produced what often has been a controlling faction. That
faction has clashed with the governor and lawmakers over curriculum
standards and textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters credit Offutt with pushing for explicit state
curricular guidelines and phonics-based reading materials. Bush and
the Texas Education Agency made adjustments to the state curricular
guidelines after conservatives charged that the guidelines were too
``fuzzy.'' Offutt and supporters don't think TEA went far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery supports Bush's school policies and accuses the
Offutt wing of ``splitting the party in two.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives on the board have opposed Texas' participation
in the Goals 2000 program of federal education aid to states. They
say it is a Trojan horse for federal takeover. Montgomery calls
such concerns overwrought and unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   The retired teacher and basketball coach, now in Fredericksburg
as a sales representative for Transwestern Publishing Co., said
he's been astounded by efforts of conservative groups to get him on
the record about social issues that don't relate to the school
board, such as abortion, gun control and same-sex marriages. While
calling himself conservative, he said, ``I won't demagogue social
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   On Offutt's missions to New Hampshire and Iowa, Montgomery said,
``He didn't say anything good about Forbes. He denigrated
everything Bush has done.''
</P>
<P>
   That puts Offutt in an uncomfortable spot with the ``education
governor'' sitting a few lines above him on the primary ballot. On
March 14 we find out if the DDS has drilled too deep.

 &HT;    In `Drowning Mona,' Midler sinks to new low
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ No one has much good to say about blowsy
harridan Mona Dearly, who is sent to a watery grave within minutes
of the start of the unfunny comedy ``Drowning Mona.''
Unfortunately, that does not conclude the movie, for which there is
also not much good to say.
</P>
<P>
   Director Nick Gomez (``Illtown'') and first-time screenwriter
Peter Steinfeld probably had a hilarious time plotting out the zany
events that transpire in the sleepy town of Verplanck, N.Y. The
only problem is they don't come across as funny on screen. There's
nothing wrong with dark, mean-spirited comedy, unless of course it
doesn't produce laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Mona (played on one screechy note by a bloated Bette Midler) is
a hellion on wheels. As we get to know her through flashbacks, we
quickly understand why nobody is broken up over her demise. It
turns out that the Yugo in which she took a header into the Hudson
River had its brakes sabotaged. Police Chief Wyatt Rash begins
investigating her murder, but everyone in town had something
against Mona. At some point during ``Drowning Mona,'' most of the
audience will develop a grudge against her, too.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez seems to have in mind the atmosphere of a ``Picket
Fences''/``Northern Exposure'' small town, a quirky little village
chock full of oddball characters doing endearing, ditsy things. He
certainly has the cast to make the visit enjoyable, but the talent
is simply squandered. Jamie Lee Curtis puts about as much energy
into seducing both Mona's husband and son as she does serving meals
at the local diner. Neve Campbell does nothing with a
one-dimensional role as the bride-to-be of Mona's son's business
partner, obsessing over details of the wedding such as making sure
the chicken entree is deboned.
</P>
<P>
   Faring only slightly better is Danny DeVito as the police chief
with the unenviable task of sleuthing out the killer from the
surplus of suspects. Although not much is done with it, he is given
the promising trait of being fixated on show tunes. It is hard to
completely dislike a movie that makes reference to ``Starlight
Express,'' concluding ``It's no `West Side Story'.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, there is something intriguing about the fact
that everyone in Verplanck drives a Yugo, a holdover from when the
town was a test market for the boxy subcompacts. Nothing is made of
this peculiarity, either. Maybe it is just a bizarre product
placement, but then, Yugos have long since ceased being
manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, as Chief Wyatt wades through the would-be murderers, we
watch Mona perform oversized acts of rottenness, as the
interrogated recount their views of her, offer alibis and perform
cartoonishly. Far be it from me to give away a whodunit, but be
advised that time spent trying to figure out the murderer's
identity would not be used productively.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, give some thought to whatever happened to Midler's film
career. Coming close on the heels of ``Isn't She Great,'' the
Divine Miss M now has two of the millennium's worst movies to her
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Check your theater's refund policy before you enter. ``Drowning
Mona'' is dead in the water.

 &HT;    Filmmaker's pet project shows a lot of heart
 &HT;    By Jim Luksic
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``My Dog Skip,'' based on author Willie Morris'
memoirs about his childhood dog, is coyly labeled a ``true story''
_ meaning we're again at a filmmaker's mercy to distinguish truth
from embellishment. In this case, the responsible party is Jay
Russell, who directs the mournful, coming-of-age tale with utmost
care. Almost too much.
</P>
<P>
   Our starting point, according to the voiceover narration _ a
technique so prevalent it now seems mandatory _ is the summer of
1942 in Yazoo, Miss., (home of ``10,000 souls and nothin' doing.'')
Willie (Frankie Muniz) is the lone child of protective dad Jack
(Kevin Bacon), a veteran, and adoring mother Ellen (Diane Lane).
</P>
<P>
   Next-door neighbor Dink (Luke Wilson) doubles as Willie's best
friend and the town's star athlete; he's also heading off to war.
(We could do without the patriotic, momentous slow-motion effect
that captures Dink's farewell.) The boy's loneliness is cured by a
birthday gift, the title terrier (wonderful shot, from inside the
wrapped cage, of the kid's reaction). Skip soon helps Willie meet
beautiful classmate Rivers (Caitlin Wachs), who appreciates his
qualities _ unlike the trio of neighborhood paper tigers: Big Boy,
Henjie and Spit.
</P>
<P>
   The leisurely narrative is given a shot in the arm when a foray
into the local cemetery exposes two bootlegging thugs. Another plot
turn, and it's a doozy, involves the once infallible Dink; his
return home will test Willie's maturity. Our little hero, it comes
to light, demonstrates more backbone than his pushy peers do.
</P>
<P>
   Too often Russell takes liberties, such as with the
fife-and-drum anthemic score, rarely muting it. Perhaps true to
life, Skip proves to be as much a nuisance as a joy. This type of
soap lingers throughout, softening the impact of life's hard
knocks. (The kid's introduction to playing football recalls too
readily a scene in ``Forrest Gump.'')
</P>
<P>
   Spotlighting the loyal canine, something the mistitled ``A Dog
of Flanders'' inexplicably neglected, seems altogether sensible
herein. A deer-hunting incident portends a later development that
hits closer to home. There's also a nice, subtle point about
animals being oblivious to racial segregation.
</P>
<P>
   It's fair to question why such sizable stars as Bacon and Lane
are bumped to the margins for a considerable chunk of time. But the
affable Muniz, star of TV's ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' holds his
own amid the nostalgia. The actor looks quite the throwback
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the lens Russell harbors a knack for milieu, with a
distinct evocation of time/place, lovingly shot in warm, bright
golden hues. And the movie doesn't fall prey to Hollywood's
compulsion to spring nonstop entertainment and gimmicks upon us.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, there's no debating ``My Dog Skip''
has its heart in the right place. Whether the tale justifies a
major motion picture is another matter. Its stilted machinations
and sticky-sweet nature would seem ideal for an after-school
television special.

 &HT;    `Planet' actors should have stayed there
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I really don't care about the identity
of the planet. I'd just like to know the identity of the alien
being that is passing itself off as director Mike Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the claim that a top-shelf director like
Nichols actually helmed the galactic-sized disaster ``What Planet
Are You From?''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Nichols' name is in the credits. Also listed are such
talents as Garry Shandling, Annette Bening, Ben Kingsley, Greg
Kinnear and John Goodman. Only Bening and Kinnear, if that's who
they really are, acquit themselves fairly well. The rest are going
through the motions on the way to the pay window _ or their
spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   Co-written by the deadpan Shandling, this comedy is crude,
silly, trite and very unfunny. The plot and nearly every joke
revolve around sex. To call most of these gags sophomoric is to
give them an undeserved promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Shandling is an alien from a sexless, emotionless planet. He is
sent to Earth to marry and impregnate someone as quickly as
possible. The aim is to dominate our planet, although how that's to
be accomplished isn't clear.
</P>
<P>
   But, then, it doesn't matter. The joke is that Shandling,
despite being briefed on the ways of courtship and female
Earthlings, usually gets things all wrong. His pickup lines are
lame, and his transplanted sexual organ whistles like a real
musical instrument. That is the film's running ``joke.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks normal in a suit, though. He passes himself off as a
Phoenix banker and is mentored in the dating game by a duplicitous
Lothario (Kinnear). Eventually, he meets Bening and _ well, you
could write the ups and downs of the rest of the screenplay
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Shandling can be a stitch, as anyone who has watched his former
HBO series knows. But his wincing demeanor and deadpan humor don't
translate to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Bening brings some real emotion to her role as Shandling's
unknowing wife. Kinnear once again plays a boyish, airheaded,
ne'er-do-well, but he does it so well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Nichols, or whoever he is: Well, let's just say the
director actually resorted to filming dancing fountains during a
lovemaking scene. In fact, the only eruption this movie evokes is a
loud yawn.

   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ As the plane went down, Janice Gravely
prayed for a miracle. Her husband, Edmund, sat unconscious in the
pilot's chair, the victim of a fatal heart attack. Gravely radioed
for help, but no one replied. In a moment of panic, she unknowingly
broke two-way contact with the ground. No one could respond because
no one knew what frequency she was on.
</P>
<P>
   Gravely tried to fly the plane, but she didn't have any
experience as a pilot. The plane went down in a patch of woods. The
crash should have killed Gravely, but she survived and today shares
her story.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, just eight years after the crash, Gravely published an
autobiography titled ``Won't somebody help me!'' She begins the
book by recounting the day of the crash. She goes on to share her
story about how a young woman from Los Angeles came to live in
Rocky Mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the book because there were so many opportunities to
tell my story but so little time,'' Gravely said. ``I thought I'd
be able to include many more details in a written account of my
life. I also wanted to bring glory to God for all he has done and
continues to do for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravely's faith in God grew after the plane crash. She has
always been a woman of faith, however. Gravely has four children,
two boys and two girls. Her youngest child was diagnosed with
leukemia when she was 9 years old. By the power of God, Gravely
believes her child was healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord walked with us through our daughter's ordeal,''
Gravely said. ``We watched her endure years of chemotherapy. We
also watched the Lord heal her.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravely didn't put the pen down afterthe first book was
written. A divine inspiration prompted her to write another book.
</P>
<P>
   Gravely's second book, ``Ground Level Christianity,'' was
published in 1999. It's a collection of true stories she gathered
from people she knows, most of whom live in Rocky Mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories illustrate the principle of Christianity,''
Gravely said. ``I think people can learn more from these real life
stories than they can from a 20-minute sermon. The book truly is a
lesson on life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravely doesn't know what the future holds, but she said she is
looking forward to it. She'll go wherever the Lord sends her and do
whatever it is he needs her to do.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, she said she couldn't be happier living in
Rocky Mount, surrounded by her children and her grandchildren.

 &HT;    McGuane avoids the faults of many fish stories
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What is it about fishing that compels so
many people to write about it? It could be that moments spent on
the water seem, to the fisherman, magnified in their beauty and
drama. Or it may be that no one who takes fishing seriously ever
gets to spend enough time doing it, so we must sublimate with fish
stories. Armchair anglers make an insatiable audience.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most writing about fishing isn't very good. The
lowliest is of the how-to variety _ anecdotes of 30-fish days
preceding sponsor-heavy tips on how to clean out a lake.
</P>
<P>
   The more narrative efforts tend to be overwrought variations on
``The Old Man and the Sea,'' wherein our sport matches wits with a
quarry so cunning or large that the battle becomes epic. The story
usually climaxes with an epiphany along the lines of, ``catching
the fish isn't everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, a few writers have the talent and intellect to avoid
these pitfalls, and perhaps none is better than Thomas McGuane.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Longest Silence,'' a collection of 33 essays on fishing
written over 30 years, McGuane takes us from the streams of
Michigan to the shallow banks of the Florida Keys to the salmon
rivers of the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly every bend, he manages to give the sport a fresh
perspective, to be thoughtful without being trite, sincere without
being precious. McGuane approaches his fishing with discipline and
reverence, but he knows that once you're out on the water, it's as
much about folly and luck.
</P>
<P>
   What McGuane wants most from his fishing may best be illustrated
by what's absent from his stories. He does not tangle with the
feisty largemouth bass, a fish so democratic in its distribution
that it has spawned professional tournament circuits inviting
anglers to dress like shuttle astronauts. Nor does he spend manly
hours straining his back against the giant blue marlin of Hemingway
lore.
</P>
<P>
   McGuane's ethic is summed up best in the title story, about his
lonely, obsessive treks through the Keys back country, trying to
catch the wariest of saltwater fish, the permit, on a fly:
</P>
<P>
   ``What is most emphatic in angling is made so by the long
silences _ the unproductive periods. For the ardent fisherman,
progress is toward the kinds of fishing that are never productive
in the sense of the blood riots of the hunting-and-fishing
periodicals.''
</P>
<P>
   In this vein, McGuane fishes almost exclusively with a fly rod.
His favorite fish, like the permit, are famously uncooperative, and
his angling destinations exceedingly remote. He is searching for a
perfect moment, and he's willing to spend fruitless days on the
water to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Taken as a travelogue, you can watch, page by page, as callous
civilization and environmental apathy chase McGuane farther and
farther away: away from the Winnebago-lined trout streams of
Paradise Valley in Montana, away from the Jet Ski drone of the Key
West flats.
</P>
<P>
   He finds great salmon fishing in Russia and Iceland, and
steelhead in British Columbia, but he wryly notes that he wouldn't
have had to go so far had America not allowed its own rivers _ once
the most abundant _ to be strangled.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, McGuane avoids the didactic, and
there are many flashes of the dark wit that marks his novels, such
as in one essay when a trout runs downriver with all but the last
coil of line on his reel: ``It was like literature! He paused long
enough for me to consider how wonderful life could be when it had
great literature-style items, such as coincidence and fate and
elegant ironies. Then, in that moment of anti-magic, when
literature is converted to the far more familiar aspects of the
land in which we actually live and breathe and spend our days, the
great trout turned and straightened my hook.''
</P>
<P>
   See? Sometimes catching the fish isn't everything.

 &HT;    The truth about Harry
 &HT;    By Roz Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ I was impressed some months ago when ``Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' rose right to the top of the best
seller list and stayed there for weeks and weeks. It was soon
joined by three other Harry Potter books.
</P>
<P>
   The stories about Harry Potter are children's stories, but who
is laying out cash to keep them at the top of the list? The
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Why are they doing it? It's a fad. ``If your child has the Harry
Potter books, then my child must have them, too,'' say the mothers
and fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Before I bought a Harry Potter book, I told myself that after
all, there are many fantasy books ostensibly for children that have
become classics because they say something to adults about
selfishness, mindlessness and cowardice, as in the ``Oz'' books,
madness and injustice in ``Alice,'' stupidity, intellectual
trickery and simple-mindedness and enchantment in ``Pooh.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember as an 11-year-old the delight I felt when one day
Eeyore was standing in his part of the forest looking at some
sticks on the ground. Piglet came to see what he was looking at.
Two of the sticks touched at one end but not the other and the
third stick was laid across them. ``Do you know what this is?''
asked Eeyore.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Piglet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an A.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' said Piglet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not O, A,'' said Eeyore severely. ``Do you know what A means,
little Piglet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means Learning, it means Education, it means all the things
that you and Pooh haven't got. That's what A means. People come and
go in this forest and they walk to and fro, saying `Ha Ha!' But do
they know anything about A? It's just three sticks to them. But to
the Educated, it's a great and glorious A.''
</P>
<P>
   I was delighted because along with Eeyore, I knew what A meant.
</P>
<P>
   You can read all the Harry Potter books from now until Sunday
and not find characters like Eeyore and Piglet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of reading,'' said William Safire the other day in
our newspaper, ``once you get the hang of it, is not merely to
follow the action of a plot but to learn about characters, explore
different ideas and enter other minds.'' He is right. Grown-ups who
buy the Harry Potter books for their children but read them for
themselves find the books are written to entertain children, which
is laudable, but have nothing to say to adults.
</P>
<P>
   J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, won the prize
for the best children's books. But the top literary prize went to
Irish poet and Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney for a translation of
``Beowulf.'' This is as it should be, and we say bully for the
committee of judges who were not seduced by the publishing record
of all time into giving the Harry Potter books the top prize. On
the other hand, how many will read Harry Potter and how many will
read ``Beowulf''? The answer is disquieting.

 &HT;    Author intent on making impeachment story a good guys/bad guys
tale
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Compared to that other bestseller about
presidential libidinousness and mendacity _ Ken Starr's steamy
``Referral to the United States House of Representatives'' _
Jeffrey Toobin's Starr-bashing impeachment saga is both better
written and more pithily argued.
</P>
<P>
   Toobin has an eye for telling detail and an ability to connect
the far-flung dots of a complex story with a droll narrative style.
He's both authoritative and succinct when discussing the legal
system's takeover of the political system or the history of sexual
harassment law.
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Vast Conspiracy'' ultimately disappoints. In his zeal to
bury Starr and other Clinton pursuers under an avalanche of damning
facts and anecdotes, Toobin minimizes the president's
responsibility for his near downfall. The result isn't as one-sided
as the independent counsel's 1998 bodice-ripper, but there's a
Starr-ish imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   Toobin, whose ``The Run of His Life'' was the definitive O.J.
Simpson trial book, isn't exactly an apologist for President
Clinton (``dishonesty and self-pity ... are among the touchstones
of his character,'' he writes). But he's intent on making the
impeachment story a good guys/bad guys tale. So Clinton gets a
white hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The) most astonishing fact in this story may be this one: in
spite of his consistently reprehensible behavior, Clinton was, by
comparison, the good guy in this struggle,'' he says early in the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Toobin's bad guys are the stock characters of a James Carville
rant: Clinton-haters, right-wing fanatics, book deal-seeking
opportunists, zealous prosecutors and the sex- and scandal-obsessed
media.
</P>
<P>
   He skewers the bad guys with devastating details and vigorous
skepticism. But with Clinton's enablers and apologists, Toobin
tends to be softer and more credulous.
</P>
<P>
   We're treated to a meticulous retracing of the calls and faxes
and meetings between Linda Tripp and literary agent provocateur
Lucianne Goldberg and their accomplices. Even a staunch
anti-Clintonite would have to find Toobin's portrait of a scheming
Tripp more plausible than Tripp's own ``I am you'' self-martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   But as unsympathetic a character as she was, a complete picture
of Tripp and the swirl of controversy around her should at least
mention the Pentagon's leaking of Tripp's confidential personnel
file _ certainly a revealing example of the good guys' ability to
get down and dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Toobin's principal bad guy, Starr, is depicted convincingly as a
prosecutorial novice whose lack of instinct leads him to substitute
group think for his own judgment. This translated into an obsession
with projecting ``toughness,'' and it led to PR blunders (such as
making a First Amendment martyr out of Clinton attack dog Sidney
Blumenthal) and critical strategic disasters (such as failing to
wrap up an early immunity deal with Monica Lewinsky).
</P>
<P>
   He's less sure of Starr's ideological underpinnings, but he's
certain there's something dangerous there.
</P>
<P>
   Toobin describes Starr as a ``committed political conservative
who stood outspokenly opposed to Clinton on virtually every
controversial issue of the day'' and _ in the very next paragraph _
as someone who ``was no ideologue himself, (but) he had always
surrounded himself with them.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a middle-aged man with an unenlightened attitude
toward women in this saga, Toobin maintains it's the hymn-singing
prosecutor rather than the skirt-chasing president.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 29 attorneys who represented Starr's office before the
grand jury, Toobin reports, 25 were men. Out of 121 sessions with
witnesses before the grand jury, women led the questioning only six
times.
</P>
<P>
   It's noted that a female prosecutor wasn't personally
congratulated by Starr after some Whitewater convictions while her
male colleagues were. And while Starr heard everyone out in his
protracted office deliberations, Toobin says, ``at the end of the
process, ... one thing remained the same in any organization Starr
had led: he followed the advice of men.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to this rap sheet of gender crimes, Toobin reaches
to find something more than middle-aged randiness in the
president's relationship with the star-struck intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a peculiar way, one could see that Clinton cared for Monica
Lewinsky,'' Toobin writes of the president's videotaped deposition.
``He generally gave an embarrassed smile when he spoke of her, but
there was, if not gallantry, a kind of affection as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to talking on the phone with congressmen while
receiving Lewinsky's ministrations, the president ``had listened to
Monica complain about her parents.''
</P>
<P>
   That's multi-tasking.
</P>
<P>
   Some philandering can be seen as betraying a deep-seated hatred
of women, Toobin notes, but Clinton ``was not a misogynist.'' In
fact, Toobin finds, Clinton displayed ``in other circumstances, his
clear respect and admiration for women.''
</P>
<P>
   This vaguely gallant, affectionate respecter of women behaved
shabbily, Toobin concedes, but didn't deserve the venomous excesses
of his enemies. Even without the gallantry bit, the American public
and the political system arrived at more or less the same
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The legal principle behind this, Toobin notes, is called
``proportionality.'' It's too bad ``A Vast Conspiracy'' doesn't
have more of it.

 &HT;    George W. bio reissued by Soft Skull
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For all those who missed out on the
first printing, the St. Martin's Press disaster of last year,
``Fortunate Son,'' the cut-and-paste biography of George W. Bush
written by an ex-felon, has been reprinted in paperback by an
outfit with the unpromising name of Soft Skull Press.
</P>
<P>
   This was the book, you will remember, that alleged that Bush was
arrested for cocaine possession in 1972 but had the arrest expunged
because of his family's connections. Soft Skull told Publisher's
Weekly that the author, one J.H. Hatfield, had proved to their
satisfaction that his sources existed.
</P>
<P>
   Also resurfacing, but without the echoes of shame and ignominy,
is Ellery Queen, created 70 years ago by two cousins named
Frederick Dannay and Manfred Lee. ``The Tragedy of Errors''
contains the last Ellery Queen novel, as well as six uncollected
short stories. Half the book is taken up by tributes to the two men
by family, friends and current mystery writers. For more
information, contact Crippen and Landru, P.O. Box 9315, Norfolk, VA
23505.

   ROCK ON ...
</P>
<P>
   The Grateful Dead, or what's left of them, have formed Grateful
Dead Books and issued ``Spirit Into Sound'' by drummer Mickey Hart,
who also doubles as editor-in-chief. Grateful Dead books will be
predominantly marketed through the band's Web site, www.dead.net,
which receives a million hits a month.
</P>
<P>
   The imprint will issue a book called ``Art of the Dead'' next
year, and ``Spirit Into Sound'' will be reissued with an
accompanying CD next spring. They'll also be reprinting Hart's
first two books ``Drumming at the Edge of Magic'' and ``Planet
Drum.''

</P>
<P>
   Tim Robbins based his recent, botched film ``Cradle Will Rock''
on a chapter from ``Arena,'' a memoir by Hallie Flanagan, the
remarkable woman who ran the Federal Theater Project in the '30s.
``Arena'' has been out of print since 1992, but Limelight is
bringing it out again soon, with an introduction by Robbins
(nothing happens in this country without a celebrity's endorsement
...).
</P>
<P>
   ``Buena Vista Social Club'' is a paperback companion to the
wonderful documentary about Cuban musicians that spawned a
soundtrack CD that sold 800,000 copies. With text by director Wim
Wenders, the book will include all the lyrics to the songs as well
as photos shot during the production by guitarist Ry Cooder and his
son.

 &HT;    Timing, talent fuel Vin Diesel's success
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Vin Diesel's career is firing on all cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   The muscular, clean-pated actor stars in two films, ``Pitch
Black'' and ``Boiler Room,'' that opened simultaneously last month
to good reviews and better-than-expected box office sales.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pitch Black,'' Diesel played Riddick, a murderous convict
charged with safeguarding the lives of spaceship passengers who
crash-land on a remote planet inhabited by deadly nocturnal
creatures. USA Today's Susan Wloszczyna called him ``the best
reason to root for a bad guy since Arnie in the original
`Terminator'.''
</P>
<P>
   The gravel-voiced New York native displayed a different side in
``Boiler Room,'' donning an expensive suit to play a fast-talking,
foul-mouthed millionaire stock broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last weekend was amazing,'' Diesel said from Los Angeles,
seven days after the Feb. 18 opening of both films. Their
synchronous arrival was a coincidence, he said. ``No one expected
that. No one probably wanted that.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out well for Diesel, who earned raves for two
dissimilar roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was really lucky in that respect,'' he said. ``That
people were able to see such a diversity within the opening weekend
if they wanted to. That really worked to my advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old actor first came to attention as
Italian-American Pvt. Carpazo in Stephen Spielberg's Academy
Award-winning film, ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Spielberg created the
role for Diesel after seeing ``Multi-Facial,'' a short film that
Diesel wrote, directed, produced, financed and starred in that
screened at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Diesel provided the voice for the title character of
the award-winning animated family feature ``The Iron Giant.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a father who taught theater and an astrologist
mother, Diesel was raised in Manhattan. His real surname reportedly
is Vincent. His first name remains undisclosed.
</P>
<P>
   He chose the sci-fi thriller ``Pitch Black'' for his first
starring vehicle because of Riddick's character arc, ``and the fact
that he's so incredibly multidimensional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a superhero of sorts,'' Diesel said of the role, which
required him to go mano a alien with bat-winged, razor-jawed
monsters. ``He's an antihero. He's a character that reminded me of
some of those heroes that I had. The `Mad Max' character and the
`Terminator' character and all these fun characters that empowered
me as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's character-driven approach appealed to Diesel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that `Pitch Black,' the overall script, offered a
relatively new approach to sci-fi filmmaking _ or at least an
approach that was nostalgic of those great films in the past,'' he
said. ``Because this film didn't rely _ even while we were shooting
the film, we weren't relying solely on the special effects. We
wanted to create a film that could stand on its own, independent of
the creatures and the sci-fi element.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black'' opened at No. 4, earning an impressive $13.4
million in its opening weekend. ``The film had the highest
per-screen-average last week over every other film,'' Diesel said,
proudly. ``So the studio is super-excited about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Alien''-inspired thriller remained in the top 5 its second
weekend, earning $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Shot for $25 million, ``Pitch Black's'' success puts Diesel in
the high-octane fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is governed by the numbers, the actor said. ``Pitch
Black's'' strong opening and high per-screen-average makes him
suddenly viable for starring roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room,'' an independent film that premiered at this
year's Sundance Film Festival and opened at No. 8 with $6.7
million, may keep him from being typecast as an action hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the `Boiler Room' job for a bunch of reasons, but the
fact that I was wearing a suit definitely was a bonus,'' Diesel
said. ``Because that directly contrasts that formidable character
in `Pitch Black.' It adds a nice balance, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has deluged him with offers, but with them comes more
pressure to choose the right role. ``I already am very selective,
but I think with this in mind, I have to be that much more
selective,'' he said. ``Especially because longevity in this career
is something that you have to work at.''
</P>
<P>
   Diesel recently wrapped production on ``Knockaround Guys,'' due
in November, in which he stars opposite John Malkovich, Dennis
Hopper and ``Saving Private Ryan's'' Barry Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all play gangsters,'' he said. ``It's about these gangsters
that end up in Montana.''
</P>
<P>
   Diesel is preparing several projects as a writer-director,
including ``Doormen,'' based on his experience as a nightclub
bouncer. His feature debut, ``Strays'' _ which he wrote, directed,
produced and starred in _ competed at the 1997 Sundance Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   But with his career shifting into overdrive, Diesel plans to
stay in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will definitely give me more clout to produce films
and/or direct them,'' he said. ``But there are a lot of good
projects out there that I may go into starring in first. You can
always direct. You can direct when you're 50. So I've got to kind
of take advantage of all these great roles now.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE SEARCH FOR CYBERSOULS
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release
 &HT;    Sunday, March 5.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The other day, Gerald Levin waxed rhapsodic over
the future of the Internet. Levin heads Time Warner, an old-line
media company seeking to reinvent itself by hooking up with America
Online, a hot ticket to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard for me to exaggerate the implications of the
Internet revolution,'' Levin told senators at a hearing called to
review the pending mega-merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in our human history,'' Levin said, ``we
have at our disposal a universal, limitless connection that no
government, no corporation or centralized agency can control
because every user has the ability to publish and to offer
something new.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'm persuaded. You can even read reports online that peg the
Time Warner-AOL deal as little more than a bloated stock play. But
you needn't be a Wall Street bear or a Rust Belt technophobe to
ponder whether this revolt could stand a reality test.
</P>
<P>
   Take the guy who auctioned off a kidney on eBay last year. The
bidding topped out at $5.7 million before the auctioneers put a
halt to it because there's a federal law against trafficking in
human organs.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to a higher plane, a few days ago an 18-year-old Canadian
hopped on eBay to sell his soul. But the spoilsports canceled that
caper as well, arguing it's impossible to prove that his soul
actually exists.
</P>
<P>
   If it did, a natural buyer would be ``The Unholy Trinity,'' an
outfit based in Beverly Hills, which owns ``devil.com'' as an
Internet domain name. Those folks haven't done much with their $35
buy, completed in 1995 when only 19 million souls used the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there are more than 200 million. ``That number,'' Levin
predicts, ``will cross one billion by mid-decade, led by AOL's
easy-to-use consumer-friendly service.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also persuasive. As Steve Case, Levin's would-be partner
put it, ``anyone with access to a computer and a modem can visit
any one of our 800 million Web sites, in just about every language,
covering every topic you could imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   But does our soulful world truly need a site such as
speakersdirect.com, which lets people select a celebrity, make an
offer online and carry him or her off in a virtual shopping cart?
</P>
<P>
   If it does, then there are at least four reasons why I would
book Case _ although his name has yet to appear in the glitterati
cyber-roster.
</P>
<P>
   First, since he lives nearby, I'd save on travel fees. (Booking,
say, Jeffrey Archer, the British novelist, who is listed, could set
you back $9,600 for a first-class ticket from London.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, since Case's stock portfolio is already worth billions,
his patter might be quite reasonably priced. (To book Archer
requires anywhere between $50,001 and $75,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Third, since Case has volunteered to let Levin run the combined
company, he might have more time on his hands to give a speech _
between, that is, appearances to defend the soul of the merged firm
before wary lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And fourth, the speakers' site can be easily plugged into an AOL
start page, further simplifying the bidding process. Proposed AOL
keywords: Enough already.

<P>
   People would kill _ or at least hire a publicist _ to try to
achieve the coolness factor Chloe Sevigny has accrued in her young
life. Yet from the way Sevigny rolls her eyes when the ``C'' word
comes up, you'd think she'd kill to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   Was she always the hippest girl in town?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' she protests in a voice that is little more than
a loud whisper. ``I don't consider myself a hipster. But I've
gotten used to the idea that that tag is just something I'm going
to have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   To dispute it further, she admits that even at the age of 25,
she lives at home with her mother in Darien, Conn. She's never even
had her own New York apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll have to get one one of these days,'' she sighs.
``So far, I've just crashed with friends. I'm like a Connecticut
nerdy girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Nerdy is hardly the first word that Sevigny calls to mind,
unless you consider that she hit the spot where nerdy and cool came
together as an explosive fashion phenomenon. This is the woman Jay
McInerney dubbed ``the coolest girl in the world'' in a memorable
1994 New Yorker article; the girl who starred in the ultimate
street-kid movie, ``Kids''; the girl who modeled for the first-ever
Miu Miu campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of ``Kids,'' written by her longtime
on-again-off-again boyfriend, Harmony Korine, whom she met while
hanging out in Washington Square Park seven years ago, these
credentials make her cringe. She says that if she has any regrets,
it's having done the New Yorker interview at all.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be said that talking is not Sevigny's preferred
medium. Yet she has managed to give startling, memorable
performances in all kinds of movies _ from ``Kids'' to ``Gummo''
(Korine's second movie, about cat killers), Whit Stillman's ``The
Last Days of Disco,'' her 1999 trifecta ``Boys Don't Cry,''
``Julien Donkey-Boy'' and ``A Map of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   She's quick to point out that she has yet to feature in a studio
picture, although she'd love to work with Tom Cruise. This spring,
she will appear as Christian Bale's secretary in ``American
Psycho'' _ a role that has the distinction of being the only female
character he doesn't hack to bits or rape.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Sevigny lets those large doe eyes of hers tell
the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's like a silent-movie star in that way,'' says ``Boys
Don't Cry'' director Kimberly Peirce. ``Stuff just flows across her
face.''
</P>
<P>
   For a girl who started her acting career quite accidentally (``I
wanted to do costumes for period films,'' she sighs, ``but then I
met Harmony and Larry Clark in Washington Square Park, and wound up
in `Kids'''), no one is more surprised than Sevigny herself at the
acclaim she's received this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really lucky it was such a bad year for movies!'' she says
with a laugh. ``The whole Golden Globe thing was just surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Sevigny turned out to be such a skilled
actress. She had little tolerance for her brief stints with other
careers, such as modeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``My face is totally crooked. I could never do runway. I've
modeled now and again for money because it's easy, but it's so
tedious and boring,'' she complains.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion doesn't cut it for her, either. She was hired as an
intern at Sassy in the summer of 1992 because of her uncanny
ability to spot trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been interested in the high-fashion world,'' she
sniffs. ``And I never wanted to be Anna Wintour. I couldn't handle
that much responsibility. And the idea of trendspotting as a career
just sounds like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she's known for having rather fashion-forward tastes,
wearing the latest incarnations of YSL and Balenciaga to recent
movie premieres when most budding Hollywood types were barely aware
of these labels' first go-rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't do fashion according to Hollywood,'' she
says with a smile, rolling her big eyes for the umpteenth time.
``You will not see me with hair extensions or pashminas. Or in
Badgley Mischka or Pamela Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny does acknowledge the coolness of one thing: ``Boys Don't
Cry,'' a movie that Peirce almost didn't make because so many
people in Hollywood were chasing the rights to Brandon Teena's
life. Sevigny says she would have played any part. At first, she
read for Brandon. But when Peirce asked her if she had ever wanted
to be a boy, she didn't even bother to lie and say yes. Now, of
course, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Lana, the
girl Brandon fell in love with.
</P>
<P>
   ``They offered my part to two other girls before I got it,''
Sevigny admits freely. ``But I went in there and really fought for
it. I loved Lana and the footage I'd seen of her in the documentary
(``The Brandon Teena Story'') where she sings karaoke. So I copied
her style.''
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny and her co-star, Hilary Swank, even managed to make
their love scenes palatable to squeamish audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a credit to what an unbelievable job Hilary did,''
Sevigny says. ``We sort of forgot she was female. Then it freaked
us out when her husband (actor Chad Lowe) came down to the set. He
made it a little harder to buy the illusion. But the whole shoot
was intense. It was the hardest film I've ever made, every aspect
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, Sevigny was nominated for an Oscar for best
supporting actress. At the time of this interview _ prior to the
Oscar announcements _ Sevigny's publicist called to say that
Entertainment Weekly was picking her as a ``shoo-in'' for a
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing the new, Sevigny doesn't shriek. Instead of getting
up and running to the phone, she slumps deeper into her chair, and
stares even more intently at the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, I hope that's not true,'' she sighs. ``I'm not ready to
be nominated for an Oscar. I'm just not ready for that. All that
pressure. I mean, I know it wouldn't be a bad thing, but I'm not
really crossing my fingers. There are people who don't even go,
like Woody Allen,'' she says, brightening momentarily. Then the
eyes roll again. ``I doubt I could get away with that. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   People would kill _ or at least hire a publicist _ to try to
achieve the coolness factor Chloe Sevigny has accrued in her young
life. Yet from the way Sevigny rolls her eyes when the ``C'' word
comes up, you'd think she'd kill to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   Was she always the hippest girl in town?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' she protests in a voice that is little more than
a loud whisper. ``I don't consider myself a hipster. But I've
gotten used to the idea that that tag is just something I'm going
to have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   To dispute it further, she admits that even at the age of 25,
she lives at home with her mother in Darien, Conn. She's never even
had her own New York apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll have to get one one of these days,'' she sighs.
``So far, I've just crashed with friends. I'm like a Connecticut
nerdy girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Nerdy is hardly the first word that Sevigny calls to mind,
unless you consider that she hit the spot where nerdy and cool came
together as an explosive fashion phenomenon. This is the woman Jay
McInerney dubbed ``the coolest girl in the world'' in a memorable
1994 New Yorker article; the girl who starred in the ultimate
street-kid movie, ``Kids''; the girl who modeled for the first-ever
Miu Miu campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of ``Kids,'' written by her longtime
on-again-off-again boyfriend, Harmony Korine, whom she met while
hanging out in Washington Square Park seven years ago, these
credentials make her cringe. She says that if she has any regrets,
it's having done the New Yorker interview at all.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be said that talking is not Sevigny's preferred
medium. Yet she has managed to give startling, memorable
performances in all kinds of movies _ from ``Kids'' to ``Gummo''
(Korine's second movie, about cat killers), Whit Stillman's ``The
Last Days of Disco,'' her 1999 trifecta ``Boys Don't Cry,''
``Julien Donkey-Boy'' and ``A Map of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   She's quick to point out that she has yet to feature in a studio
picture, although she'd love to work with Tom Cruise. This spring,
she will appear as Christian Bale's secretary in ``American
Psycho'' _ a role that has the distinction of being the only female
character he doesn't hack to bits or rape.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Sevigny lets those large doe eyes of hers tell
the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's like a silent-movie star in that way,'' says ``Boys
Don't Cry'' director Kimberly Peirce. ``Stuff just flows across her
face.''
</P>
<P>
   For a girl who started her acting career quite accidentally (``I
wanted to do costumes for period films,'' she sighs, ``but then I
met Harmony and Larry Clark in Washington Square Park, and wound up
in `Kids'''), no one is more surprised than Sevigny herself at the
acclaim she's received this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really lucky it was such a bad year for movies!'' she says
with a laugh. ``The whole Golden Globe thing was just surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Sevigny turned out to be such a skilled
actress. She had little tolerance for her brief stints with other
careers, such as modeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``My face is totally crooked. I could never do runway. I've
modeled now and again for money because it's easy, but it's so
tedious and boring,'' she complains.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion doesn't cut it for her, either. She was hired as an
intern at Sassy in the summer of 1992 because of her uncanny
ability to spot trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been interested in the high-fashion world,'' she
sniffs. ``And I never wanted to be Anna Wintour. I couldn't handle
that much responsibility. And the idea of trendspotting as a career
just sounds like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she's known for having rather fashion-forward tastes,
wearing the latest incarnations of YSL and Balenciaga to recent
movie premieres when most budding Hollywood types were barely aware
of these labels' first go-rounds.
</P>

 &HT;    Rocker rejoins Braves, meets with teammates, reads apology
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kissimmee, Fla. _ John Rocker arrived for spring training today
and began the process of patching up his strained relationship with
his coaches and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker met with his teammates for a half-hour today after his
suspension was reduced by baseball arbitrator Shyam Das on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he addressed the media for three minutes, reading a
copy of his apology that ran in today's Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, appearing in his batting practice uniform, read his
statement, which was hand-written on the back of a Braves roster,
and then left, leaving Braves' General Manager John Schuerholz to
answer questions of the 100 or so reporters gathered at the
basketball fieldhouse at the Disney sports complex.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's statement ended with: ``I feel the arbitration process
was a fair one and I will respect and abide by its results. At this
point in time, I want and need to focus on helping my team. I
recognize that this situation will not simply go away, but please
understand that I will have no further comment on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker then joined the rest of the Braves on the field for the
first time since the World Series. He played catch with fellow
reliever Rudy Seanez.
</P>
<P>
   His arrival came a day after arbitrator Das cut the reliever's
suspension in half, ruling he should sit out the first 14 days of
the regular season for his offensive statements regarding gays,
minorities and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz discussed the clubhouse meeting between Rocker and
his teammates, saying, ``In this clubhouse, there are a lot of very
good leaders, and I think their influence in this situation will be
very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz characterized the team's feelings: ``In their minds,
it has been fairly dealt with and fairly resolved in the
clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the decision by Rocker to read a statement and take no
questions ``was John's preferred format, and he felt comfortable
with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker can pitch in a game as early as April 18, against the
Phillies at Turner Field, as opposed to the May 1 date originally
imposed by commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves met for 40 minutes regarding Rocker after their
workout on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I've said all along, and it seems to be the case
with other guys, which is I forgive him for what he said,'' Tom
Glavine said before the meeting. ``We'll have to see how things go
from here on out. He still has a lot of bridges to mend. We said
we're willing to give him the opportunity, so we'll see what
happens. We'll see what he does with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who saved 38 games last season, might not be in the
clear yet. Schuerholz hinted Wednesday that Rocker still might be
traded. When asked whether Rocker would return to his role as
closer April 18, Schuerholz said, ``If John regains his
effectiveness and remains with us, he'll have a very good chance to
be our closer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all be better off to get him in here and deal with the
initial onslaught now and be done with it, rather than four weeks
from now,'' Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz acknowledged that other teams had expressed interest
in Rocker. Among those is believed to be Montreal, who would send
the Braves closer Ugueth Urbina and a pitcher for Rocker and
starter Bruce Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who agreed to terms with the Braves on Tuesday for a
one-year deal believed to be worth $350,000, had his fine reduced
from $20,000 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Selig was angry about both reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with the decision of Arbitrator Das,'' Selig said
in a statement. ``It does not reflect any understanding of or
sensitivity to the important social responsibility that baseball,
an institution that has endured for more than 100 years, has to the
public. It completely ignores the sensibilities of those groups
maligned by Mr. Rocker and disregards the player's position as a
role model for children.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It's that time again. On Feb. 15, the Oscar nominations were
announced. Suddenly, five women underwent more stylistic scrutiny
than any supermodel or society girl ever has.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in New York, Milan, Paris and Los Angeles dropped what
they were doing to take note of these ladies, who are suddenly
Fashion's Most Desirable _ at least until March 27.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? One of these candidates could emerge as the next
Gwyneth Paltrow, a celebrity who gets as much attention for her
talent as she does for her sense of style. After all, it's not a
bad runway to show off the new trends for evening: only about a
billion people will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   No designer worth his or her sequins could ever hope for better
product placement _ a dress on an Oscar nominee is better than
having a commercial on the Superbowl.
</P>
<P>
   But will the first Oscar ceremony of the new millennium be any
different than the usual frenzied parade of ballgowns?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst things,'' Tom Ford notes, ``is seeing a dress
wear an actress rather an actress wear a dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger,'' says noted New York celebrity hairdresser John
Sahag, ``is that in looking glamourous, many actresses end up
looking old fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take a poll of fashion experts _ the designers,
hair stylists, makeup artists, clothing stylists, retailers and top
fashion editors _ to see what advice they can offer this new Top
Five.
</P>
<P>
   Some liked the challenge of glamming up the more serious
actresses, like Janet McTeer, Meryl Streep and Annette Bening.
``I'd love to see them in classic looks, sort of modernized Grace
Kelly,'' offers Jeanine Lobell, creator of Stila Cosmetics and a
veteran of Oscar makeup. ``If women like that do too much and get
too trendy, it's hard to pull off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone agrees with Barneys New York creative director
Simon Doonan, who says: ``The general consensus is, it's time for
something new!'' That means no more ballgowns, beaded sweater sets,
evening separates, too-tight clothes, and death to the pastel
pashmina. But what else do Oscar fashionistas have up their silken
sleeves?
</P>
<P>
   Here, some pointers from the pros.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANNETTE BENING, for ``American Beauty'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's always had the body and the swagger to wear anything, but
Annette Bening is loyal to one man: Giorgio Armani. She usually
wears a black column dress or black evening tuxedo. This year, she
has another requirement: on March 26, she'll be nine months
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I want to dress Annette Bening. I like the red
evening column with a draped neckline that was a knockout on our
fall runway. I can seriously see Annette Bening in this, in either
the red or the black. I love dressing her. I think she has stature
_ divine! She is an American beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Even though I have not seen all the movies and I'm
not familiar with all the actresses, I believe Annette Bening has
an amazing and perfect American style.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Annette Bening pretty
much always wears Armani. She's like the first lady of Hollywood
and she should dress like a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I love Annette, but I heard she's not going
because of the pregnancy. She's a classic beauty. Between her,
Julianne Moore and Hilary Swank, you can't do better than those
three. Not only do I respect them as artists, they also have
amazing bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``In all fairness to Annette Bening, she's been
pregnant for eight months and she still managed to look elegant at
the Golden Globes. But I don't think for her it's a year she'll be
making a major fashion statement.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Annette likes Escada. I'd suggest
something cashmere. Maybe Randolph Duke. They're pretty, they're
comfy, they're sexy. I did one for Cindy Crawford when she was
pregnant. Thank God we're not in the days of having to hide it any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROL SHAW, makeup artist, did Bening's makeup for the recent
Vanity Fair cover: ``I think she's just naturally luminescent. I
would do her either very understated or with a shiny red lip. Very
Old Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   SALLY HERSHBERGER, hairstylist: ``She always looks great, but
I'd like to freshen up Annette Bening's look a little. I'd brighten
up her color and smooth her short hair into an Audrey Hepburn-type
of style.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``I'd like to see her with
chin-length hair, with lots of layers. She needs slightly more
volume and movement in her hair. She's very, very sexy, but with
hair that's too extreme _ too short, too full. I'd also like to see
more of an amber-copper mix with her color. I'd also give her long
bangs.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Annette Bening dresses older than she
is. She wears Armani and Escada, and it's not the designs, her
choices are a little matronly. She doesn't have a typical face. Her
hair is too big. This is a woman who is more unique looking. She's
very sexy yet she doesn't dress sexy at all. I wish she would. She
has a great capacity for seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JULIANNE MOORE, for ``The End of the Affair'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore always manages to set off those amazing red locks
with of-the-moment looks _ by Prada, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren
_ without ever looking too fashiony or contrived. She walks the
line between fashionable and subtle without ever falling on her
heels.
</P>
<P>
   TOM FORD: ``Julianne Moore has the greatest style. I'd love to
dress her.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Julianne Moore is sexy and glamorous and she's the
one I'm most curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   TOMMY HILFIGER: ``I think Julianne Moore looks very good in
casual. I'd like to see her in our leather jeans and a cashmere
turtleneck.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I'd put Julianne Moore in a simple dress in a
vivid color, perhaps violet to play off her red hair. She's so
alluring and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``I have a beautiful brown cashmere dress in the
collection that would look great with Julianne Moore's red hair and
white skin. She should wear something fitted and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``For me, Julianne Moore is the
ultimate. You don't see many redheads on the screen. I would keep
her hair long, at about collarbone length, but I'd give it a bit of
angle between the cheekbone and jaws, with some long wispy layers
for movement. Her color is awesome _ I wouldn't change a thing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Julianne Moore is an example of the perfect
redhead. She should always stay with the reds, but I would play
with red seasonally on her _ for a winter show like the Academy
Awards, I'd make her a rich auburn, and in the summer, I'd do a
gorgeous strawberry shade.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES PURCELL: ``We need to get her to look more like a
glamorous actress than a Gucci ad. I would put Moore in something
neither over-the-top nor overly beaded, but simple and elegant with
a more dramatic hairstyle.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Of all the actresses nominated for
Best Actress, Julianne Moore likes clothes the most. She wears
Prada and Ralph and looks that are very simple. However, when Moore
wore a Ralph Lauren gown, the back was cut too close to the sides.
But she's very savvy not to wear looks that are too billowy or too
full. She always looks fuller than she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Julianne Moore could go vintage. She
could look great in a Henry James dress. I would suggest she go to
Galliano. She should have major impact on the red carpet. She's
just so beautiful. She should do a Victorian Henry James look.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANET MCTEER, for ``Tumbleweeds'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch British actress and Tony Award winner (for ``A
Doll's House'' on Broadway in 1997) is an enigma to designers but
says that what she'll wear to the Oscars is at the bottom of her
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody will come up with something nice for me to
wear,'' she said recently. ``I wore all British things to the
Golden Globes. Or I could be the first woman to wear pants to the
Oscars. But you don't often get to wear a really fancy frock in
your life, do you? So bring on the fancy frocks. I do hope all the
designers come calling. Stand in line, matey!''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``Somebody I'd like to see make an effort is Janet
McTeer, because she's so sensual and so sexy in that film, and
she's someone who could look even better at the Academy Awards. She
has an incredibly sensual body. At the Golden Globes, she looked
like she wanted to escape it. I'm thinking something minimal but
beautifully cut, sophisticated and sensual.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Janet McTeer is a British actress who
blew everybody off the map when she did `A Doll's House.' She's a
very full-shaped lady, and tall, and designers should be aware of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Janet McTeer needs to do something dramatic for
the Oscars, because a lot of us don't know her well. If she does
something really different, it'll make everyone wake up and say `Oh
my God, that's her?' I'd cut her hair _ which is too long, by the
way _ very short, and I'd bleach it beige. Then I'd do a beige gown
and taupe lips. Then, I guarantee, everyone would be talking about
her after the show because she'd look so fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Janet McTeer is a very handsome
woman. She wore a twin set with a skirt with a bit of a dramatic
train to the Golden Globes. For an English woman, she looked
fantastic. She shouldn't try to upstage herself if she did well at
the Golden Globes. She looked very handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BARRETT, hairstylist: ``Janet has a stunning face. I styled
her for the Golden Globes, and I brought out her face, using her
hair as an accessory. I also added a little red to her hair. I'd
like to see her do something similar for the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, stylist: ``The woman has so much presence. I'd
love to see her in something by Oscar de la Renta _ she's so
statuesque.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Someone like Janet McTeer, she's
waiting to be discovered. With her I would go with a beautiful
Badgley Mischka or Randolph Duke. She doesn't have to be
unpredictable. I love the fact that she's not a young starlet or an
older actress. I don't see her in something sexy, sexy. Maybe
Valentino or Armani. They're going through the Valentino archives.
I'm waiting for the sketches. Maybe something from the '40s. Or
there are some really great things from Chanel Couture. I could see
her in something fresh and spring-like.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``English women have these weird hairdos.
She would look so great with a short haircut. She has a
great-looking neck, that beautiful length that so many women don't
have. I'd do even a low ponytail with hair extensions at the nape,
emphasize the face and neck. That English look is such stoic
beauty. The more you add, the worse it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MERYL STREEP, for ``Music of the Heart'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is Streep's 12th Academy Awards nomination, which makes her
the most nominated female ever, tying with Katherine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Meryl may have every bit as much talent as Hepburn _ but
if only she had half as much style. Maybe after 11 times at the
Oscars she'll finally get it right. As Tom Ford reiterated, ``Meryl
Streep may be brilliant, but fashionwise, she needs a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I love Meryl,'' said the designer, scanning the
racks in her showroom for an example of the look she would
prescribe. She pulled out a turtleneck dress and declared it right,
with a few alterations: ``Just simple and beautiful, down to the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Meryl Streep is above and beyond fashion and her
style matches her personality: warm, elegant and superior.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Meryl Streep should go with
something very classic. She should do the Park Avenue Matron look
and wear a marvelous twin set, maybe an embroidered and embellished
sweater and full skirt, preferably Oscar de la Renta.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Meryl Streep should
wear Michael Kors. It plays up to her sexiness. She's been playing
it down and needs to play it up. Or, she should wear Celine. Her
hair should be over one eye. Kors knows how to give the ladies of a
certain age some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``I'd like Meryl Streep to cut her hair
off a bit, something off the shoulders, short around her face. Not
anything fancy, not extremely trendy. Something along the way of
very chic, above the shoulder. Then the weight line would be at the
right length.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Meryl Streep's been looking heavier. I
hope she'll be a little more glamorous at the Oscars. You don't
want her to look like the mother of the bride. I'd love to try
something a little corsety: emphasize the cleavage, suck in the
waist, push up the breasts. I rarely do black, but in this case I
might.''
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I always wanted to dress Meryl Streep because I
respect her so much as an actress. She hasn't come off as sexy
lately, but I think she can be classy and sexy at the same time.''
For Streep, Dennis suggested a beaded white robe with pants.
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I'd liven up her look with a tailored jacket
and a wonderful skirt. I've spent time on the red carpet and I've
seen photographers and journalists clamoring for a quote from
Portia de Rossi, when Meryl Streep comes in and no one pays
attention to the greatest actress of our time. That's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I think she
could use a little help in the fashion department. I'd love to make
her look glamorous and beautiful in a black strapless gown with an
A-line skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Of all the nominees, she's the one
that I'd most like to make over. First, I'd give her shorter hair _
something about chin length, keeping the ends soft and sexy,
something with a little volume so it's not just stuck to her head.
I'd keep her as a blonde, but give her some brighter highlights for
some depth.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Meryl Streep is the USA's perfect blonde. She can
wear any color blonde. If I were coloring her, I'd do a dark blonde
base with lighter tones in front and a little darker in back _ sort
of a surfer-girl shade. Her hair is too long right now.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I suggest a look that's clean and simple and
something she's comfortable with, even if it's not fabulous. She
should look like herself. At this point, it doesn't matter what she
wears.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Meryl Streep is the one who needs the
most help. I don't think she cares enough. Maybe she should wear
Oscar de la Renta. He doesn't sacrifice a woman's elegance while
trying to make them look modern.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HILARY SWANK, for ``Boys Don't Cry'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's this year's Oscar It Girl, with all the dream elements a
designer's looking for: tall, thin, hip, stylish, great looking,
has talent _ and a good bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Karl Lagerfeld, Donatella Versace and Tom Ford have put
her on the ``Must Dress'' list. As InStyle's Hal Rubenstein puts
it: ``Hilary Swank will be drowning in dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Hilary Swank has the greatest style.
She set the tone at the Golden Globes in a black Versace, and it
was a major coup for her and for Versace. She should stick with the
tried-and-true formula.''
</P>
<P>
   SIMON DOONAN, Barneys New York: ``It would be great if Hilary
Swank wore Comme des Garcons, or better yet, vintage Comme des
Garcons! My advice for the Oscars is vintage, vintage, vintage.
Hilary Swank could wear something vintage like a Dior `New Look'
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Hilary Swank is changing her look so as not to be
framed with the character of her movie. I know her well _ she
attended my couture show in Paris and I'm happy to help her
again.''
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I would pick Hilary Swank (to dress), because
she'll get the most attention _ and this is no secret _ it's all
about who will get the most attention.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTINA PERRIN: ``I think Hilary Swank has the most fantastic
body and that beautiful short, cropped hair. She should wear
something very sleek and dark red.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA HERRERA: ``I would like to see Hilary Swank in
something different beside a slinky embroidered dress. A red
strapless dress would be beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``Although Hilary Swank glammed it up in Versace
Couture at the Golden Globes, I think she should wear a satin
tuxedo for a feminine/masculine play. I don't really want to see
her in a ballgown or a long dress.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, veteran Oscar and Hollywood stylist: ``I have
the thrill of dressing Hilary for the Oscars this year! I think
she's our young Mia Farrow, with a sensuality about her that's the
girl next door with a little edge. I am thinking about color this
time. The Golden Globes was Hilary's first time out. I predict
she's gonna have a little more fun at the Academy Awards. We're not
married to one designer.''
</P>
<P>
   JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran Oscar makeup artist:
``I'd like to work on Hilary Swank. I just like the way she looks
and I think that she doesn't need a lot of makeup. She's the kind
of person you'd put one thing on _ a little eye or a little lip _
she's not someone you'd like to paint everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SAHAG, hairstylist: ``Hilary Swank's hair looks like it's
growing out from the film. I definitely think that now that she
finished her movie she could go back to being feminine: grow the
sides, fringe, and back out, and go for something messier and more
tousled. I think that would be a nice contrast for the public to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Hilary should consciously play
against the androgyny we've seen of her to show her versatility.
I'd take her hair a little longer. I'd also give her soft bangs
that she could brush to the side, and layer her hair a bit on top
for volume. I'd also like to see her with some caramel highlights;
they'd give her hair a little sparkle and make it a little more
electric.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS, celebrity colorist, Avon Centre: ``Because she
played a boy in `Boys Don't Cry,' I'd tell her to arrive at the
Oscars totally femmed out _ big red lips, honey-colored hair,
something really high gloss, high glam. I'd dress her in a gorgeous
Badgley Mischka dress and get Kevyn Aucoin or Laura Mercier to do
really glamorous makeup on her.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It's that time again. On Feb. 15, the Oscar nominations were
announced. Suddenly, five women underwent more stylistic scrutiny
than any supermodel or society girl ever has.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in New York, Milan, Paris and Los Angeles dropped what
they were doing to take note of these ladies, who are suddenly
Fashion's Most Desirable _ at least until March 27.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? One of these candidates could emerge as the next
Gwyneth Paltrow, a celebrity who gets as much attention for her
talent as she does for her sense of style. After all, it's not a
bad runway to show off the new trends for evening: only about a
billion people will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   No designer worth his or her sequins could ever hope for better
product placement _ a dress on an Oscar nominee is better than
having a commercial on the Superbowl.
</P>
<P>
   But will the first Oscar ceremony of the new millennium be any
different than the usual frenzied parade of ballgowns?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst things,'' Tom Ford notes, ``is seeing a dress
wear an actress rather an actress wear a dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger,'' says noted New York celebrity hairdresser John
Sahag, ``is that in looking glamourous, many actresses end up
looking old fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take a poll of fashion experts _ the designers,
hair stylists, makeup artists, clothing stylists, retailers and top
fashion editors _ to see what advice they can offer this new Top
Five.
</P>
<P>
   Some liked the challenge of glamming up the more serious
actresses, like Janet McTeer, Meryl Streep and Annette Bening.
``I'd love to see them in classic looks, sort of modernized Grace
Kelly,'' offers Jeanine Lobell, creator of Stila Cosmetics and a
veteran of Oscar makeup. ``If women like that do too much and get
too trendy, it's hard to pull off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone agrees with Barneys New York creative director
Simon Doonan, who says: ``The general consensus is, it's time for
something new!'' That means no more ballgowns, beaded sweater sets,
evening separates, too-tight clothes, and death to the pastel
pashmina. But what else do Oscar fashionistas have up their silken
sleeves?
</P>
<P>
   Here, some pointers from the pros.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANNETTE BENING, for ``American Beauty'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's always had the body and the swagger to wear anything, but
Annette Bening is loyal to one man: Giorgio Armani. She usually
wears a black column dress or black evening tuxedo. This year, she
has another requirement: on March 26, she'll be nine months
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I want to dress Annette Bening. I like the red
evening column with a draped neckline that was a knockout on our
fall runway. I can seriously see Annette Bening in this, in either
the red or the black. I love dressing her. I think she has stature
_ divine! She is an American beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Even though I have not seen all the movies and I'm
not familiar with all the actresses, I believe Annette Bening has
an amazing and perfect American style.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Annette Bening pretty
much always wears Armani. She's like the first lady of Hollywood
and she should dress like a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I love Annette, but I heard she's not going
because of the pregnancy. She's a classic beauty. Between her,
Julianne Moore and Hilary Swank, you can't do better than those
three. Not only do I respect them as artists, they also have
amazing bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``In all fairness to Annette Bening, she's been
pregnant for eight months and she still managed to look elegant at
the Golden Globes. But I don't think for her it's a year she'll be
making a major fashion statement.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Annette likes Escada. I'd suggest
something cashmere. Maybe Randolph Duke. They're pretty, they're
comfy, they're sexy. I did one for Cindy Crawford when she was
pregnant. Thank God we're not in the days of having to hide it any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROL SHAW, makeup artist, did Bening's makeup for the recent
Vanity Fair cover: ``I think she's just naturally luminescent. I
would do her either very understated or with a shiny red lip. Very
Old Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   SALLY HERSHBERGER, hairstylist: ``She always looks great, but
I'd like to freshen up Annette Bening's look a little. I'd brighten
up her color and smooth her short hair into an Audrey Hepburn-type
of style.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``I'd like to see her with
chin-length hair, with lots of layers. She needs slightly more
volume and movement in her hair. She's very, very sexy, but with
hair that's too extreme _ too short, too full. I'd also like to see
more of an amber-copper mix with her color. I'd also give her long
bangs.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Annette Bening dresses older than she
is. She wears Armani and Escada, and it's not the designs, her
choices are a little matronly. She doesn't have a typical face. Her
hair is too big. This is a woman who is more unique looking. She's
very sexy yet she doesn't dress sexy at all. I wish she would. She
has a great capacity for seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JULIANNE MOORE, for ``The End of the Affair'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore always manages to set off those amazing red locks
with of-the-moment looks _ by Prada, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren
_ without ever looking too fashiony or contrived. She walks the
line between fashionable and subtle without ever falling on her
heels.
</P>
<P>
   TOM FORD: ``Julianne Moore has the greatest style. I'd love to
dress her.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Julianne Moore is sexy and glamorous and she's the
one I'm most curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   TOMMY HILFIGER: ``I think Julianne Moore looks very good in
casual. I'd like to see her in our leather jeans and a cashmere
turtleneck.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I'd put Julianne Moore in a simple dress in a
vivid color, perhaps violet to play off her red hair. She's so
alluring and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``I have a beautiful brown cashmere dress in the
collection that would look great with Julianne Moore's red hair and
white skin. She should wear something fitted and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``For me, Julianne Moore is the
ultimate. You don't see many redheads on the screen. I would keep
her hair long, at about collarbone length, but I'd give it a bit of
angle between the cheekbone and jaws, with some long wispy layers
for movement. Her color is awesome _ I wouldn't change a thing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Julianne Moore is an example of the perfect
redhead. She should always stay with the reds, but I would play
with red seasonally on her _ for a winter show like the Academy
Awards, I'd make her a rich auburn, and in the summer, I'd do a
gorgeous strawberry shade.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES PURCELL: ``We need to get her to look more like a
glamorous actress than a Gucci ad. I would put Moore in something
neither over-the-top nor overly beaded, but simple and elegant with
a more dramatic hairstyle.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Of all the actresses nominated for
Best Actress, Julianne Moore likes clothes the most. She wears
Prada and Ralph and looks that are very simple. However, when Moore
wore a Ralph Lauren gown, the back was cut too close to the sides.
But she's very savvy not to wear looks that are too billowy or too
full. She always looks fuller than she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Julianne Moore could go vintage. She
could look great in a Henry James dress. I would suggest she go to
Galliano. She should have major impact on the red carpet. She's
just so beautiful. She should do a Victorian Henry James look.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANET MCTEER, for ``Tumbleweeds'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch British actress and Tony Award winner (for ``A
Doll's House'' on Broadway in 1997) is an enigma to designers but
says that what she'll wear to the Oscars is at the bottom of her
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody will come up with something nice for me to
wear,'' she said recently. ``I wore all British things to the
Golden Globes. Or I could be the first woman to wear pants to the
Oscars. But you don't often get to wear a really fancy frock in
your life, do you? So bring on the fancy frocks. I do hope all the
designers come calling. Stand in line, matey!''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``Somebody I'd like to see make an effort is Janet
McTeer, because she's so sensual and so sexy in that film, and
she's someone who could look even better at the Academy Awards. She
has an incredibly sensual body. At the Golden Globes, she looked
like she wanted to escape it. I'm thinking something minimal but
beautifully cut, sophisticated and sensual.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Janet McTeer is a British actress who
blew everybody off the map when she did `A Doll's House.' She's a
very full-shaped lady, and tall, and designers should be aware of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Janet McTeer needs to do something dramatic for
the Oscars, because a lot of us don't know her well. If she does
something really different, it'll make everyone wake up and say `Oh
my God, that's her?' I'd cut her hair _ which is too long, by the
way _ very short, and I'd bleach it beige. Then I'd do a beige gown
and taupe lips. Then, I guarantee, everyone would be talking about
her after the show because she'd look so fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Janet McTeer is a very handsome
woman. She wore a twin set with a skirt with a bit of a dramatic
train to the Golden Globes. For an English woman, she looked
fantastic. She shouldn't try to upstage herself if she did well at
the Golden Globes. She looked very handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BARRETT, hairstylist: ``Janet has a stunning face. I styled
her for the Golden Globes, and I brought out her face, using her
hair as an accessory. I also added a little red to her hair. I'd

waiting to be discovered. With her I would go with a beautiful
Badgley Mischka or Randolph Duke. She doesn't have to be
unpredictable. I love the fact that she's not a young starlet or an
older actress. I don't see her in something sexy, sexy. Maybe
Valentino or Armani. They're going through the Valentino archives.

there are some really great things from Chanel Couture. I could see
her in something fresh and spring-like.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``English women have these weird hairdos.

great-looking neck, that beautiful length that so many women don't
have. I'd do even a low ponytail with hair extensions at the nape,
emphasize the face and neck. That English look is such stoic
beauty. The more you add, the worse it looks.''
</P>

and wear a marvelous twin set, maybe an embroidered and embellished
sweater and full skirt, preferably Oscar de la Renta.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Meryl Streep should
wear Michael Kors. It plays up to her sexiness. She's been playing
it down and needs to play it up. Or, she should wear Celine. Her
hair should be over one eye. Kors knows how to give the ladies of a
certain age some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``I'd like Meryl Streep to cut her hair
off a bit, something off the shoulders, short around her face. Not
anything fancy, not extremely trendy. Something along the way of
very chic, above the shoulder. Then the weight line would be at the
right length.''
</P>
<P>

hope she'll be a little more glamorous at the Oscars. You don't

wear any color blonde. If I were coloring her, I'd do a dark blonde
base with lighter tones in front and a little darker in back _ sort
of a surfer-girl shade. Her hair is too long right now.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I suggest a look that's clean and simple and
something she's comfortable with, even if it's not fabulous. She
should look like herself. At this point, it doesn't matter what she
wears.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Meryl Streep is the one who needs the
most help. I don't think she cares enough. Maybe she should wear
Oscar de la Renta. He doesn't sacrifice a woman's elegance while
trying to make them look modern.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HILARY SWANK, for ``Boys Don't Cry'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's this year's Oscar It Girl, with all the dream elements a
designer's looking for: tall, thin, hip, stylish, great looking,
has talent _ and a good bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Karl Lagerfeld, Donatella Versace and Tom Ford have put
her on the ``Must Dress'' list. As InStyle's Hal Rubenstein puts
it: ``Hilary Swank will be drowning in dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Hilary Swank has the greatest style.
She set the tone at the Golden Globes in a black Versace, and it
was a major coup for her and for Versace. She should stick with the
tried-and-true formula.''
</P>
<P>
   SIMON DOONAN, Barneys New York: ``It would be great if Hilary
Swank wore Comme des Garcons, or better yet, vintage Comme des
Garcons! My advice for the Oscars is vintage, vintage, vintage.
Hilary Swank could wear something vintage like a Dior `New Look'
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Hilary Swank is changing her look so as not to be
framed with the character of her movie. I know her well _ she
attended my couture show in Paris and I'm happy to help her
again.''
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I would pick Hilary Swank (to dress), because
she'll get the most attention _ and this is no secret _ it's all
about who will get the most attention.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTINA PERRIN: ``I think Hilary Swank has the most fantastic
body and that beautiful short, cropped hair. She should wear
something very sleek and dark red.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA HERRERA: ``I would like to see Hilary Swank in
something different beside a slinky embroidered dress. A red
strapless dress would be beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``Although Hilary Swank glammed it up in Versace
Couture at the Golden Globes, I think she should wear a satin
tuxedo for a feminine/masculine play. I don't really want to see
her in a ballgown or a long dress.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, veteran Oscar and Hollywood stylist: ``I have
the thrill of dressing Hilary for the Oscars this year! I think
she's our young Mia Farrow, with a sensuality about her that's the
girl next door with a little edge. I am thinking about color this
time. The Golden Globes was Hilary's first time out. I predict
she's gonna have a little more fun at the Academy Awards. We're not
married to one designer.''
</P>
<P>
   JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran Oscar makeup artist:
``I'd like to work on Hilary Swank. I just like the way she looks
and I think that she doesn't need a lot of makeup. She's the kind
of person you'd put one thing on _ a little eye or a little lip _
she's not someone you'd like to paint everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SAHAG, hairstylist: ``Hilary Swank's hair looks like it's
growing out from the film. I definitely think that now that she
finished her movie she could go back to being feminine: grow the
sides, fringe, and back out, and go for something messier and more
tousled. I think that would be a nice contrast for the public to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Hilary should consciously play
against the androgyny we've seen of her to show her versatility.
I'd take her hair a little longer. I'd also give her soft bangs
that she could brush to the side, and layer her hair a bit on top
for volume. I'd also like to see her with some caramel highlights;
they'd give her hair a little sparkle and make it a little more
electric.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS, celebrity colorist, Avon Centre: ``Because she
played a boy in `Boys Don't Cry,' I'd tell her to arrive at the
Oscars totally femmed out _ big red lips, honey-colored hair,
something really high gloss, high glam. I'd dress her in a gorgeous
Badgley Mischka dress and get Kevyn Aucoin or Laura Mercier to do
really glamorous makeup on her.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Gisele, where's your resume?
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, a model's career generally came and went
faster than a speeding limo. A few magazine covers, some runway
work and then a quick dive into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   A few made it in acting, like Andie MacDowell, Lauren Hutton,
Cybill Shepherd, Farrah Fawcett or Brooke Shields, or did apparel
lines like Cheryl Tiegs and Jaclyn Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent generation _ Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington,
Naomi Campbell and Elle McPherson, to name a few _ are becoming
brands in their own right, and the potential for big bucks makes
those runway fees look like cigarette money.?
</P>
<P>
   Crawford is practically Cindy Inc., with corporate offices under
the name Crawdaddy in New York and Los Angeles that do nothing but
deal with her deals. She's got a slew of carefully selected
contracts and endorsements that include Kellogg's Special K, Omega
Watches, Pepsi and Revlon; plus she has her own projects, including
exercise tapes, a makeup book and an equity stake in Estyle.com,
where she writes a regular fashion and advice column.
</P>
<P>
   Turlington is behind the Puma-manufactured Nuala yoga apparel
line and will have her own area on a new magazine-format Web site,
Simplicity.com, to launch on Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has a beauty deal with Cosmopolitan Cosmetics, the
prestige beauty arm of German beauty giant Wella, and has been
touring the world to launch her new signature fragrances. She's
also involved with politics in South Africa and has done numerous
fund-raisers there using her fashion connections.
</P>
<P>
   Elle McPherson has a lingerie line and a regular gig on
``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Can a model go from being just a face to a brand that consumers
will flock to?
</P>
<P>
   Why not, say their agencies. By the time a model's career is
slowing, she's already been around the world a few dozen times and
met a few hundred rich and powerful people. That can be parlayed
into great job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These girls make incredible connections when they work,'' said
Monique Pillard, president of Elite USA. ``They know how to dress,
how to speak, how to present themselves. That's very valuable when
they decide to go onto the next phase.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what it says about our culture, but these days,
anybody with fame or notoriety is sought after for endorsements,''
said Crawford in an interview from her Los Angeles office. ``If you
want to go into business, modeling isn't necessarily the ideal way
to start out. But if you are smart, and lucky, and people start to
know your name, you can build on that momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   For the majority, the next phase is acting. It works for some in
every generation, from Lauren Bacall to Andie MacDowell to Brooke
Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Carolyn Murphy played an uptight WASP in Barry
Levinson's 1999 film ``Liberty Heights.'' Shalom Harlow has been
going to auditions instead of runway shows for a few seasons, and
Amber Valletta has been reading scripts backstage at shows during
fashion week.
</P>
<P>
   But what about other business ventures? Can models work a
boardroom after they've left the showroom?
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as what they are doing is appropriate to the fashion
field, it makes sense,'' said Jeff McKay, owner of his own ad
agency, Jeff McKay Inc. ``But some projects have zero credibility.
For instance, I can't stand it when people in fashion or
celebrities try to get political. My feeling is, I don't want a
model telling me what to think any more than I want a politician
telling me what to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pros and cons,'' said Ellis Verdi, president of the
ad agency DeVito/Verdi. ``It works best if the field is related to
being a model, like fashion or health. In any case, you are
grabbing onto a known quantity, and that is a leg up for any new
company. Ultimately, any brand can become a super brand. There are
people out there who have started with a hell of a lot less and
done very nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a model doesn't work against someone anymore,'' said
Michael Flutie, president of Company and Flutie Entertainment. ``In
the new media, especially with the Internet, it enhances the
marketability. You can build models' careers now in the same way
that you build a celebrity. The whole entertainment industry
propels models into a new career.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, all that time spent in front of a camera can be a
help to the business plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to hire a model for the initial ad campaign,
and that's a big help to the bottom line right there,'' Verdi said.
``There are some cost efficiencies there that can be pretty
significant for a startup.''
</P>
<P>
   But personality does come into play a lot more once models are
doing more talking than walking.
</P>
<P>
   To keep her credibility clean, Crawford said, she goes for
projects that build on each other. And she's got the marketing
lingo down pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any new proposal, I ask myself, do I believe in the
product, does it fit with my other projects?'' she said. ``For
example, a cigarette ad wouldn't add value to Revlon.''
</P>
<P>
   The silver screen is the top-ranked destination for most models
looking to their career futures. But Flutie, who has a division
that deals only with models moving into acting careers, said he
tries to get his clients to think more broadly about their future _
especially if their talent is not exactly Oscar-potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a girl who wanted to be an actress,'' he said. ``She
was taking lessons and working with a coach. And the coach came to
me and said, `This is not going to happen.' I had to tell her,
because it would have been wrong not to. You have to be delicate,
so what I say is, `Let's keep the acting as a hobby, and develop
something else at the same time.' I try to look at the girls'
interests. I say, `What would you be doing if you weren't
modeling?'''
</P>
<P>
   But what if the former-model-turned-ceo indulges in
stereotypical model behavior _ moody, unreliable and diva-esque?
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't matter as long as it doesn't affect the bottom
line, Verdi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The awareness of a famous model as someone who is attractive
and healthy and vibrant is far greater than the small awareness of
someone as difficult,'' Verdi said. ``Frankly my bigger concern is
that you are dealing with someone who is used to going first-class
everywhere. What happens if her business manager comes to her and
says, `We can't afford this. You have to fly coach.' To me that is
a bigger issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem, Flutie said. Unlike previous generations that
took the money and ran, Flutie said the cadets he's seeing know a
lot more about their image and long-term market appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see a new generation of models driven by the
entrepreneurial spirit,'' he said. ``Girls today know more about
commerce and business.'' &QL;

<P>
   No science-fiction novel is complete without an appearance of
the universal thing-maker. Whether it's called a fabricator, a
replicator or a Mark-12 Hyperduplicator, the basic idea is always
the same: a gadget that miraculously creates or copies any object
the protagonist desires.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional thing-maker may be an abused plot device, but a
real one, linked to the Internet and nestled between the microwave
and the blender, would be the most exciting domestic appliance
ever. Need a comb, a Ken doll, an exhaust manifold for a 1967 Ford
Fairlane? Download it.
</P>
<P>
   This fantasy is not as farfetched as it sounds. Three-D printers
_ known in the industrial world as solid-imaging machines _ are
already here in nascent form, transforming the way products are
designed.
</P>
<P>
   Once the first home models arrive, in a decade or so, consumer
culture may never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your children's children will print their own toys,'' predicts
Mervyn Rudgley, senior director of business development for 3D
Systems of Valencia, Calif., the first and largest company in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hull, founder of 3D Systems, expects the technology will
eventually lead to the ultimate in online shopping: goods delivered
directly into the customer's living room.
</P>
<P>
   Hull cooked up the first solid-imaging system in 1984 in a
back-room lab while working for a company in San Gabriel, Calif.,
that made ultraviolet lamps. Some of the lamps were used to treat
special coatings that harden when exposed to ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   By extending the process, Hull realized, he could make solid
objects from light-cured plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Laboring long nights and weekends, he finally persuaded a
computer-guided light beam to dance in a precise pattern on the
surface of a basin full of gooey polymer.
</P>
<P>
   After the jittering beam solidified a thin layer of plastic, a
platform just below the surface dropped a fraction of a millimeter,
submerging the layer under another coat of polymer, and the
procedure repeated itself.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the topmost layer hardened, the platform rose
dramatically, revealing Hull's first creation: a translucent,
bluish, inch-tall cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crude,'' he says, ``but it showed what was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull dubbed the process stereolithography, meaning roughly
``printing in three dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the sense right from the start that this would be a big
industry. With this, any shape you could design with a CAD
(computer-aided design) program, you could make.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hull unveiled his machine at a Detroit engineering show in
1987, designers snapped it up. Compared with traditional
prototyping, which required artisans to carve wood, sculpt clay or
machine steel, stereolithography seemed miraculous. It could
translate a computer model of a camshaft or valve stem into a 3-D
prototype in hours rather than weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And a team in Tokyo could electronically send that model to a
stereolithography machine in Tennessee, where collaborators could
inspect a physical prototype and zap back instructions for
revisions.
</P>

   Soon, designers from dozens of industries began quickcrafting
concept models of heart valves, dinnerware, drainpipes, dentures,
lightbulbs _ almost any object imaginable. Virtually every home in
America now contains products prototyped by stereolithography
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you shorten prototyping time so dramatically, you can
keep changing and improving the design much more quickly,'' says
Rudgley, who estimates more than 5,000 solid-imaging machines are
cranking away worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Solid imaging also permits 3-D copying. At a Los Angeles
computer-graphics show last summer, more than 700 people poked
their heads into a laser-scanner linked to a solid-imaging machine.
Each person was rewarded with a small glimpse at the future: a
2-inch-tall, micromillimeter-accurate sculpture of his or her face.
</P>
<P>
   The copied object need not even be visible to the eye. Working
with a solid-imaging machine and a CT scanner, researchers examined
and replicated a mummy's skull in the National Museum of
Antiquities in the Netherlands without unwrapping a single bandage.
</P>
<P>
   Several manufacturers of medical implants use solid imaging to
model X-rays of diseased bones and to create accurate molds for
casting replacements such as artificial hip joints.
</P>
<P>
   Applications that seem exotic today will become routine, as
solid imaging grows rapidly cheaper and more versatile. A decade
ago, the first stereolithography machines cost around $300,000 and
could build only plastic objects. Today there are more than a
half-dozen related technologies, some of which are far more
economical.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-jet solid imaging is the new cost leader. Your household
solid-imaging machine, whenever it arrives, will likely use this
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders Prototype Inc., in Merrimack, N.H., sells $65,000 units
the size of a two-drawer file cabinet. A pair of heads, similar to
the ones in standard ink-jet printers, zips back and forth around a
platform, spitting out 6,000 microdots of hot plastic per second.
</P>
<P>
   Each pass of the heads adds another layer of plastic, building
up a 3-D object.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-jet imaging is slow but precise, perfect for modeling small,
finely drawn objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewelers love them,'' says Sanders CEO David Bothwell. ``They
use them to make the actual wax `positives' used to make casting
molds.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are feverishly pushing the technology beyond plastic
so that solid imaging can be used to build finished products, not
just prototypes. Devices that can custom-create objects from metal,
paper, ceramics and composites are either in production or close to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right at the very beginning,'' Bothwell says.
</P>
<P>
   Give the solid-imaging pioneers a few more years of tinkering,
and that Hyperduplicator might not look like such a silly plot
device after all. &QL;

<P>
   No science-fiction novel is complete without an appearance of
the universal thing-maker. Whether it's called a fabricator, a
replicator or a Mark-12 Hyperduplicator, the basic idea is always
the same: a gadget that miraculously creates or copies any object
the protagonist desires.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional thing-maker may be an abused plot device, but a
real one, linked to the Internet and nestled between the microwave
and the blender, would be the most exciting domestic appliance
ever. Need a comb, a Ken doll, an exhaust manifold for a 1967 Ford
Fairlane? Download it.
</P>
<P>
   This fantasy is not as farfetched as it sounds. Three-D printers
_ known in the industrial world as solid-imaging machines _ are
already here in nascent form, transforming the way products are
designed.
</P>
<P>
   Once the first home models arrive, in a decade or so, consumer
culture may never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your children's children will print their own toys,'' predicts
Mervyn Rudgley, senior director of business development for 3D
Systems of Valencia, Calif., the first and largest company in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hull, founder of 3D Systems, expects the technology will
eventually lead to the ultimate in online shopping: goods delivered
directly into the customer's living room.
</P>
<P>
   Hull cooked up the first solid-imaging system in 1984 in a
back-room lab while working for a company in San Gabriel, Calif.,
that made ultraviolet lamps. Some of the lamps were used to treat
special coatings that harden when exposed to ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   By extending the process, Hull realized, he could make solid
objects from light-cured plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Laboring long nights and weekends, he finally persuaded a
computer-guided light beam to dance in a precise pattern on the
surface of a basin full of gooey polymer.
</P>
<P>
   After the jittering beam solidified a thin layer of plastic, a
platform just below the surface dropped a fraction of a millimeter,
submerging the layer under another coat of polymer, and the
procedure repeated itself.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the topmost layer hardened, the platform rose
dramatically, revealing Hull's first creation: a translucent,
bluish, inch-tall cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crude,'' he says, ``but it showed what was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull dubbed the process stereolithography, meaning roughly
``printing in three dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the sense right from the start that this would be a big
industry. With this, any shape you could design with a CAD
(computer-aided design) program, you could make.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hull unveiled his machine at a Detroit engineering show in
1987, designers snapped it up. Compared with traditional
prototyping, which required artisans to carve wood, sculpt clay or
machine steel, stereolithography seemed miraculous. It could
translate a computer model of a camshaft or valve stem into a 3-D
prototype in hours rather than weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And a team in Tokyo could electronically send that model to a
stereolithography machine in Tennessee, where collaborators could
inspect a physical prototype and zap back instructions for
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, designers from dozens of industries began quickcrafting
concept models of heart valves, dinnerware, drainpipes, dentures,
lightbulbs _ almost any object imaginable. Virtually every home in
America now contains products prototyped by stereolithography
machines.
</P>

   &UR; KEYS TO LOW STRESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As professor of ergonomics at Cornell University, Alan Hedge has
investigated a lot of failed attempts to find a less stressful way
to type.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the keyboards that claim to be ergonomic really do
diddly-squat,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But the vertical split-keyboard, made by Ergonomic-Interface
Keyboard Systems in La Jolla, Calif., is different. Hedge's tests
suggest that the accordionlike keyboard does reduce the risk of
developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Horizontal keyboards, the norm since the invention of the
typewriter in the 1860s, force typists to twist their wrists
downward, thus compressing the tunnel through which the nerves in
the forearm pass.
</P>
<P>
   That pressure sometimes triggers carpal tunnel syndrome, a
painful condition that, if left untreated, can lead to loss of
sensation and use of the hands.
</P>
<P>
   The vertical split-keyboard, with keys facing outward, places
the wrists in a more neutral, untwisted position.
</P>
<P>
   In trials on 12 touch typists, Hedge found that the split
keyboard kept wrists in a low-stress position more than 75 percent
of the time, as compared to less than 50 percent for conventional
keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the vertical keyboard, you're virtually never in a
high-risk position,'' Hedge says.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the vertical split-keyboard exists only in prototype
form. According to its creator, Jeffrey Spencer of
Ergonomic-Interface, the improved design could actually be holding
it back.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional-keyboard manufacturers, facing lawsuits by injured
office workers, may be leery of licensing a technology that implies
their past products were deficient.

 &UR; MOLECULE MOVER AND SHAKER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory, James Gimzewski plays with
molecules as freely as a child plays with blocks.
</P>
<P>
   By manipulating a tiny, electrically charged stylus, Gimzewski
has built an abacus of carbon molecules one ten-millionth of an
inch wide. He's now working on a variety of other molecular
contraptions, including a tiny rotor that spins using the heat
energy around it.
</P>
<P>
   These devices are the first steps toward a new kind of
micro-industry, constructed molecule by molecule.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What's the use of such tiny machines?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  If you tried to make one engine on a nanometer (billionth
of a meter) scale, you could ask, ``What good is it?'' You can't
put it in a tractor. But if you made a trillion of them, you could
do all kinds of things: Drop them on a field and they could plow it
or aerate the soil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How would you fuel those engines?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  You want to use something like ATP, the energy-carrying
chemical in biology. Then strange ideas like miniature medical
submarines going through the human body and fixing problems are
maybe not so ridiculous after all. You could use chemicals in the
body to operate the motor and control which way the sub turns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  You work at IBM _ what's the computer connection?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  For computers, small is beautiful. In 10 to 20 years, the
way we make chips will reach its limits. So there is an interest in
anything on the nanometer scale.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  When will we see useful molecular machines?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Ten years is reasonable. Not next year, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What inspired you to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  In school, I was always best in science and art. Actually,
I wanted to be a painter. But when I got to high school, they said
you have to do science, because art is not something you're going
to make a profession out of. Eventually, I realized science and art
are the same anyway. The artist has a paintbrush, and I have a
tunneling microscope and a computer, but the creativity is the
same.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  If you could use molecular technology to redesign yourself,
what would you change?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I'd like to have X-ray vision eyes to see through walls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What's the biggest problem in the world today?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  It is people's fear of themselves and others.
Nanotechnology could help solve that. I dream of the day when
technology is invisible and people can communicate with each other
over distances without mobile phones and so on. I think that would
change our society very much.

 &UR; THE ICE MAN HEALETH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, tattoos are bold fashion statements, but what
purpose did they serve 5,000 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a medicinal one, says Max Moser, a physiologist at the
University of Graz in Austria. He and his colleague, Leopold
Dorfer, reached this conclusion after examining Otzi, the mummified
ice man extracted from a glacier in the Alps in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Otzi's back, right knee and left ankle were adorned with 15
groups of short, bluish-black tattooed lines, probably made by
injecting ash beneath the skin with a bone or wooden needle.
</P>
<P>
   The locations of the tattoos closely match those of traditional
acupuncture points used to treat backache and stomach upset.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, X-rays of Otzi's body indicate that the
middle-aged man had arthritis of the hip joints, knees, ankles and
spine. Forensic analysis also reveals that the ice man's intestines
were rife with whipworm eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Otzi lived some 2,000 years before the oldest generally
recognized evidence of acupuncture, which raises questions about
whether the practice originated in Europe, not China.
</P>
<P>
   Moser thinks the history of acupuncture may be even more
complicated: ``At the time when Otzi was around, I'm sure that many
shamanistic cultures worldwide might have practiced it. But only
the Chinese formalized it and saved it into modern times.''
</P>
<P>

 &UR; COGS IN THE KITCHEN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Industrial robots are too clumsy to help with household chores
like cooking, but Shigeki Sugano and his colleagues at Waseda
University in Tokyo built WENDY for high-dexterity tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans change the pose of their fingertips to adjust their
force on objects. The nails generate high pressure,'' Sugano says.
</P>
<P>
   WENDY'S fingers have a hard core surrounded by soft rubber pads
and a rigid ``nail'' on top. The robot can modify how much force it
applies by changing the angles of its joints. The system is so
refined that WENDY can crack open an egg into a frying pan.
</P>
<P>
   Sugano plans to add systems that respond to voice commands,
thereby moving his robot even closer toward becoming a useful
domestic assistant.

   Otzi lived some 2,000 years before the oldest generally
recognized evidence of acupuncture, which raises questions about
whether the practice originated in Europe, not China.
</P>
<P>
   Moser thinks the history of acupuncture may be even more
complicated: ``At the time when Otzi was around, I'm sure that many
shamanistic cultures worldwide might have practiced it. But only
the Chinese formalized it and saved it into modern times.''

   Industrial robots are too clumsy to help with household chores
like cooking, but Shigeki Sugano and his colleagues at Waseda
University in Tokyo built WENDY for high-dexterity tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans change the pose of their fingertips to adjust their
force on objects. The nails generate high pressure,'' Sugano says.
</P>
<P>
   WENDY'S fingers have a hard core surrounded by soft rubber pads
and a rigid ``nail'' on top. The robot can modify how much force it
applies by changing the angles of its joints. The system is so
refined that WENDY can crack open an egg into a frying pan.
</P>
<P>
   Sugano plans to add systems that respond to voice commands,
thereby moving his robot even closer toward becoming a useful
domestic assistant.

 &HT;    PERUVIAN FLY MAY BE CALLED TO HYACINTH WARS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A tiny Peruvian fly, so small it could perch on the
head of a pin, is being studied as a possible recruit in the war on
imported water hyacinths.
</P>
<P>
   So far, U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists are unwilling
to bring the fly to the United States. Further tests will be
required to confirm indications it feeds on nothing but hyacinths,
said entomologist Ted D. Center of the agency's Aquatic Plant
Control Research Unit in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very promising at this point,'' Center said Wednesday
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Dense mats of water hyacinths infest hundreds of ponds, lakes
and streams throughout the south from Texas to the Carolinas, plus
California and Hawaii. They damage water quality, block boat travel
and clog water pumping stations.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida alone, more than $5 million is spent every year
spraying herbicide on floating aquatic plants, primarily hyacinths.
</P>
<P>
   Native to South America, water hyacinths can spread when parts
of a colony break off and sprout in new areas. Entomologists,
assuming that areas where the plant originated would have the
largest number of its natural enemies, reasoned that upstream
reaches of the Amazon River basin would be a good place to look.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring Amazon tributaries in Peru last year, they found a
flourishing collection of hyacinth eaters and collected hundreds of
samples in a week. The collection included the current candidate, a
previously undiscovered species from a group of insects known to
entomologists as Thrypticus.
</P>
<P>
   The insect is being studied in cages in Argentina, the
department's Agricultural Research Service announced Wednesday.
After adults breed, hordes of their offspring start digging into
the hyacinths' stems, Center said.
</P>
<P>
   Another insect from Peru, a small ``plant hopper,'' also is
being studied in Argentina, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA released three species of hyacinth-eating insects in
the 1970s. Although these bugs are helping to reduce hyacinth
spread, ``we need more, we need better,'' Center said.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated it will be three years before entomologists feel it
will be safe to release the new flies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hyacinths produce lush leaves and beautiful blue-to-lavender
flowers, which have often been brought home by tourists. That's
apparently how the plant reached the United States in the late 19th
century.

<P>
   Q: What was the exact vote count for each of the candidates in
the Iowa caucuses? I've heard under 2,000 people voted on the
Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   _ D.K., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither party has released exact vote counts for the
caucuses, which are tabulated in a more informal manner than
primary voting.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 61,000 people who voted in the Iowa Democratic party
caucus this year, 63.4 percent voted for Al Gore and 35.0 percent
for Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the Iowa caucus, the Democratic Party released
the delegate count for each candidate rather than vote totals:
1,269 for Gore, 698 for Bradley and 33 uncommitted out of 2,000
total delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people want to turn the Iowa caucus into a primary,''
said Kim Warkenten, executive directory of the Iowa Democratic
Party. ``People elect a certain number of delegates in each
precinct.''
</P>
<P>
   There were around 86,300 votes cast in the Iowa Republican
caucus, with George W. Bush receiving 41 percent, Steve Forbes
receiving 30.5 percent, Alan Keyes 14.3 percent, Gary Bauer 8.5
percent, John McCain 4.7 percent and Orrin Hatch 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me what Clark Howard's latest book is and
whether he is still writing?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.J., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Crippen and Landru is publishing Howard's first short-story
collection in April: ``Challenge the Widow-Maker and Other Stories
of People in Peril.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find the book at area stores under ISBN
1-8859-4139-0, you can order it from Crippen and Landru for $18.50
at Box 9315, Norfolk, VA 23505, or the Web site
www.crippenlandru.com.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, 66, has written more than 20 novels and true-crime
nonfiction books, winning the Edgar Allan Poe and Ellery Queen
magazine awards for his short stories. You can write to him at Box
1527, Palm Springs, CA 92263.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Jim Dougherty, the first husband of
Marilyn Monroe?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.D., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: You can write to him at Box 157, Sabbatus, ME 04280,
according to the president of the Marilyn Remembered fan club in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty, who wrote ``The Secret Happiness of Marilyn Monroe''
in 1976, spoke at a club meeting about five years ago, group
President Greg Schreiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe was 16 and Dougherty was 21 when they married on June 19,
1942. He joined the Merchant Marine and was sent overseas in 1944,
and they divorced in 1946 shortly after she began modeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been married twice since then _ both times happily
married _ and was a policeman in different areas of the country,''
Schreiner said. ``He supposedly has another book to be published
soon.''

   &UR; By JOSHUA MICAH MARSHALL &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two nights before the New Hampshire primary, I was sitting in a
Manchester bar arguing with a fellow reporter about the latest Al
Gore-Bill Bradley polls. ``I'm not gonna believe any poll,'' my
colleague told me, ``until I see John Zogby's name on it.''
</P>
<P>
   A little-known independent pollster based in Utica, N.Y., Zogby
rocketed to fame by correctly predicting the results of the 1996
presidential election. But like all religions, the cult of Zogby
relies on myths about his feats and denial about his failures.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby's dead-on prediction in 1996 _ he forecast Bill Clinton's
eight-point win over Bob Dole, while most pollsters expected a much
wider Clinton margin _ won him a burst of media attention. What is
odd is how Zogby's reputation has mushroomed ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits, reporters, and chat show hosts now routinely genuflect
to him. ``Joining us now from Detroit is the nation's most accurate
pollster, John Zogby,'' said Bill O'Reilly of Fox News Channel's
``The O'Reilly Factor'' in November. Robert Novak calls him ``the
country's hottest pollster.'' Dick Morris says he's ``New York's
most accurate pollster.'' The Washington Times' Wes Pruden bows to
the ``the hottest (and most accurate) pollster.'' Chris Matthews, a
leading Zogby acolyte, welcomed him to ``Hardball'' in 1998 by
saying, ``John Zogby, you're the best pollster.''
</P>
<P>
   The cult grows despite Zogby's embarrassing miscues. He stumbled
several times during the 1998 election cycle, the only big election
since his 1996 triumph. One of the closest Senate races that year
was the Al D'Amato-Charles Schumer contest in Zogby's home state of
New York. Most polls found Schumer opening up a discernible lead in
the final days of the campaign. Not Zogby, who predicted a D'Amato
victory after his final numbers showed D'Amato holding a razor-thin
lead. Schumer trounced D'Amato by 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby went out on another limb in Illinois, where one-term Sen.
Carol Moseley-Braun faced a tough fight against conservative
challenger Peter Fitzgerald. Though Moseley-Braun managed a small
comeback in the campaign's final days, most polls showed her
trailing by as much as 10 points. But numbers released by Zogby
International Nov. 3 gave Moseley-Braun a three-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mort Kondracke enthused the night before the election, ``If
Carol Moseley-Braun wins in Illinois and Al D'Amato wins in New
York, John Zogby is going to go right into the Polling Hall of Fame
because nobody agrees with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald beat Moseley-Braun by three points.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby is not a bad pollster. He's a very good one. He's just not
head and shoulders above the rest. He flubs his share of races, but
the media ignore his failures. They seize on evidence that confirms
their beliefs and disregard contradictory data.
</P>
<P>
   Take Matthews' spin on Zogby's New Hampshire polls. No pollster
predicted the scale of John McCain's 19-point victory over George
W. Bush. But Zogby did give McCain one of his highest margins, a
12-point lead over Bush in his final tracking poll. So Zogby kind
of called it, right?
</P>
<P>
   Matthews thought so. ``You were clearly the closest pollster
getting it,'' he gushed to Zogby two weeks later. What Matthews
didn't mention, or maybe didn't notice, was that Zogby's final
numbers also gave Al Gore a 12-point lead over Bill Bradley, even
though Gore only won by five points. Most other pollsters noticed
Bradley's late surge and got that five-point margin right.
</P>
<P>
   So what explains Zogby's outsized reputation? Pundits have
convinced themselves that he discovered a magical technique that
elevates him above mere polling mortals: He only polls ``likely
voters.'' It's true that news organizations frequently release
polls of registered voters or even all adults. But every serious
political pollster screens for likely voters. The skill is figuring
out who's a ``likely'' and who's not.
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason for Zogby's popularity is that his
polls make Republicans feel good. Conservatives clutched at his
accurate prediction of the 1996 race because it seemed to show that
Clinton wasn't so popular after all. Since then, Zogby's numbers
have usually shown Republicans doing better than they do in other
polls. Zogby is a registered Democrat and, he says, a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   My hunch is that Zogby's method of determining who's a ``likely
voter'' emphasizes low-turnout elections, especially ones in which
Republicans are disproportionately able to mobilize their base.
That allows him to notice some Republican upsets that other
pollsters miss. But it also sometimes leads him astray, as it did
in the D'Amato-Schumer race.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to blame Republican partisans for treating Zogby's
calculations as electoral truth revealed from on high. But what's
the media's excuse?

   ............................................
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 20 headline in the Sunday Times of London was
spectacular: ``Lennon funded terrorists and Trotskyists.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News and other U.S. media presented their own garbled
versions of the story.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the errors lies a fascinating and significant story
about a renegade former intelligence officer for MI5, the
top-secret domestic security service in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   David Shayler, a former officer at the Libya desk of MI5, is one
of those rare establishment whistleblowers. Starting in 1997 he
went public _ in interviews with the British Broadcasting Corp. and
other media outlets _ with his outrage over the abuse of power he
saw while working for MI5.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw included an MI5 file on John Lennon, the former
Beatle, and he told the Sunday Timesand anybody else who'd
listenwhat was in it: reports describing Lennon's financial support
for left-wing groups in Britain in the late '60s, along with a copy
of the lyrics to Lennon's song ``Working Class Hero,'' written in
what appeared to be Lennon's own handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler made these revelations along with a much more serious
claim: that Britain's foreign intelligence service plotted to
assassinate Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the security services are prohibited from disclosing
information about their work; under Britain's Official Secrets Act
they can be prosecuted for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Shayler fled Britain, but soon was detained in a Paris
hotel room by French police at the request of British authorities.
The French government put him in prison while Britain tried to
extradite him. Eventually Shayler was freed, and he now lives in
Paris. But if he sets foot in Britain, he will be jailed as a
traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, after so much time has passed, the Sunday Times
seems not to have considered the possibility that the MI5 files on
Lennon it described perhaps contain erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shayler, the files contained reports that Lennon
made large contributions in the late '60s to the Irish Republican
Army and the Workers' Revolutionary Party, whose best-known member
was Vanessa Redgrave _ among the ``terrorists and Trotskyists'' of
the headline.
</P>
<P>
   These reports are almost certainly false. Lennon never had
anything to do with the Workers' Revolutionary Party, widely
regarded as the looniest '60s left-wing group. In the late '60s
Lennon was friendly with the International Marxist Group, which
published the underground Red Mole, edited by Tariq Ali and Robin
Blackburn. But they had a completely different political
orientation from the Workers' Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even a former member of the Workers' executive committee, Roger
Smith, told the London Observer that the MI5 information was wrong:
``There was absolutely no link between Lennon and us.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Lennon provided financial support to the IRA is a bit
more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Lennon was an outspoken supporter in the late '60s and early
'70s of what he called ``Irish civil rights.'' He joined protest
marches in London organized by the highly visible ``Troops Out''
movement. Lennon appears in a well-known photograph marching in a
demonstration carrying a sign that said RED MOLE/ FOR the
IRA/AGAINST BRITISH IMPERIALISM.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, after British troops shot and killed 13 people in
Northern Ireland on Bloody Sunday, Lennon wrote and recorded a
song, ``Luck of the Irish,'' and sang it at a demonstration in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, recently denied that the
British-born musician ever contributed money to the IRA. Even if he
had, it would have been a lawful act. It wasn't until the 1974
Prevention of Terrorism Act was passed by the British government
that financial support for the IRA was criminalized.
</P>
<P>
   It's pertinent that in February, 1981, three months after Lennon
was gunned down outside his Dakota apartment in New York City, I
personally made a Freedom of Information request for Lennon's FBI
file. I wanted the dossier for research on a book I was writing
about Lennon, ``Come Together,'' which was later published by the
University of Illinois Press.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the FBI released only about two-thirds of the file
and many of the released documents were heavily censored _ with

by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, I
sued for release of the whole file.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, represented by the Justice Department, fought
against disclosure. In July '91 the Federal Appeals court in San
Francisco directed the FBI to be more specific why the release of
the missing documents would be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Finally in 1997 the Clinton administration released all but 10
documents from the Lennon file. The FBI has told the courts that
those 10 contain national security information provided by a
``foreign government intelligence agency.'' The FBI refuses even to
release the name of that government.
</P>
<P>
   About three weeks ago (Feb. 18, 2000), at a hearing in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles, Judge Brian Robbins ordered the FBI
to release two letters it received from the unnamed foreign
government _presumably Britain _requesting that the Lennon
information remain confidential. The FBI has 28 days to comply or
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Caravallo, a U.S. Justice Department attorney, says an
appeal is likely in order to defend the principle that national
security documents from a foreign government should be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Shayler recently provided a declaration for U.S. courts
describing the MI5 documents he has seen. Because of Shayler, we
already know the nature of the information being withheld. We know
that it consists of 30-year-old reports on the political activities
of a dead rock star. We also know that the information is
erroneous, at least in part.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of legitimate national security issues, these pages _
like the pages of the Lennon FBI file that have already been
released _ record an abuse of power by the government, engaged in
illegitimate surveillance of dissidents engaged in lawful political
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Lennon in the headlines after all these years? He
personified the dreams of the '60s. ``Imagine no more countries,''
he sang. And yet the establishment press in Britain still seems
intent on discrediting him. Apparently the battles of the '60s are
not yet over.

   ............................................
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 20 headline in the Sunday Times of London was
spectacular: ``Lennon funded terrorists and Trotskyists.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News and other U.S. media presented their own garbled
versions of the story.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the errors lies a fascinating and significant story
about a renegade former intelligence officer for MI5, the
top-secret domestic security service in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   David Shayler, a former officer at the Libya desk of MI5, is one
of those rare establishment whistleblowers. Starting in 1997 he
went public _ in interviews with the British Broadcasting Corp. and
other media outlets _ with his outrage over the abuse of power he
saw while working for MI5.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw included an MI5 file on John Lennon, the former
Beatle, and he told the Sunday Timesand anybody else who'd
listenwhat was in it: reports describing Lennon's financial support
for left-wing groups in Britain in the late '60s, along with a copy
of the lyrics to Lennon's song ``Working Class Hero,'' written in
what appeared to be Lennon's own handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler made these revelations along with a much more serious
claim: that Britain's foreign intelligence service plotted to
assassinate Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the security services are prohibited from disclosing
information about their work; under Britain's Official Secrets Act
they can be prosecuted for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Shayler fled Britain, but soon was detained in a Paris
hotel room by French police at the request of British authorities.
The French government put him in prison while Britain tried to
extradite him. Eventually Shayler was freed, and he now lives in
Paris. But if he sets foot in Britain, he will be jailed as a
traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, after so much time has passed, the Sunday Times
seems not to have considered the possibility that the MI5 files on
Lennon it described perhaps contain erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shayler, the files contained reports that Lennon
made large contributions in the late '60s to the Irish Republican
Army and the Workers' Revolutionary Party, whose best-known member
was Vanessa Redgrave _ among the ``terrorists and Trotskyists'' of
the headline.
</P>
<P>
   These reports are almost certainly false. Lennon never had
anything to do with the Workers' Revolutionary Party, widely
regarded as the looniest '60s left-wing group. In the late '60s
Lennon was friendly with the International Marxist Group, which
published the underground Red Mole, edited by Tariq Ali and Robin
Blackburn. But they had a completely different political
orientation from the Workers' Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even a former member of the Workers' executive committee, Roger
Smith, told the London Observer that the MI5 information was wrong:
``There was absolutely no link between Lennon and us.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Lennon provided financial support to the IRA is a bit
more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Lennon was an outspoken supporter in the late '60s and early
'70s of what he called ``Irish civil rights.'' He joined protest
marches in London organized by the highly visible ``Troops Out''
movement. Lennon appears in a well-known photograph marching in a
demonstration carrying a sign that said RED MOLE/ FOR the
IRA/AGAINST BRITISH IMPERIALISM.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, after British troops shot and killed 13 people in
Northern Ireland on Bloody Sunday, Lennon wrote and recorded a
song, ``Luck of the Irish,'' and sang it at a demonstration in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, recently denied that the
British-born musician ever contributed money to the IRA. Even if he
had, it would have been a lawful act. It wasn't until the 1974
Prevention of Terrorism Act was passed by the British government
that financial support for the IRA was criminalized.
</P>
<P>
   It's pertinent that in February, 1981, three months after Lennon
was gunned down outside his Dakota apartment in New York City, I
personally made a Freedom of Information request for Lennon's FBI
file. I wanted the dossier for research on a book I was writing
about Lennon, ``Come Together,'' which was later published by the
University of Illinois Press.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the FBI released only about two-thirds of the file
and many of the released documents were heavily censored _ with
large portions of text blotted out. As the plaintiff, represented
by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, I
sued for release of the whole file.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, represented by the Justice Department, fought

Francisco directed the FBI to be more specific why the release of
the missing documents would be harmful.

<P>
   The return of U.N. arms inspectors to Iraq would do more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
   This is true no matter how robust is the successor to the U.N.
team that originally worked to disarm Iraq _ that is, the new group
led by Hans Blix, former head of the International Atomic Energy
Agency and chairman of the new U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Simply discovering and destroying Iraq's biological, chemical
and nuclear capabilities is not enough to stop Iraq over the long
term if Iraq is able to simply rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   If inspectors return to Iraq, President Saddam Hussein is again
likely to refuse to cooperate, leaving the United States almost
alone in seeking punishment including military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, besides gaining the complicity of officials at
the United Nations, Iraq has also gained the tacit _ and at times
overt _ support of several major powers: notably Russia, China and
France.
</P>
<P>
   Even more dangerous, however, is the possibility that Saddam
WILL cooperate with the new inspectors. This would spell not only
an end to inspections but also an end of sanctions. And then Iraq
would be free to reconstitute its arms programs _ a clear and
present danger to the entire Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising as it sounds, an impasse will better position the
United States to hamper Saddam's quest for weapons of mass
destruction _ and to avoid being a part of the deliberate flouting
of U.N. resolutions and arms-control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In the final years of the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM,
which was dispatched to disarm Iraq after the Persian Gulf war,
Saddam chose his provocations according to his own lights,
disrupting inspections or otherwise egregiously violating
agreements when he felt global support for his cause was strong or
when domestic concerns led him to pick a fight abroad.
</P>
<P>
   If the inspections resume, and Saddam picks a particularly
sensitive moment _ say, a setback in the Arab-Israeli peace process
or a burst of internal discontent in Saudi Arabia _ to be defiant,
the necessary diplomatic support for U.S.-led strikes to ensure
compliance may not be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Today's politicians and pundits who champion a resumption of
inspections say that, first, it will lead to the end of Iraq's
clandestine arms projects. Some inspections, they say, are better
than none and besides, it is impossible for Iraq to sustain an
impasse for very long. All three assumptions are false.
</P>
<P>
   The nominal success of inspections today would give Saddam a
free hand to develop bombs tomorrow. A new round of work would
probably not unearth much. U.N. workers would likely discover only
what Saddam wanted them to, or at best marginally improve our
knowledge of what is going on, leaving Iraq's existing lethal
capabilities untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is likely to again find itself in a nasty dilemma
comparable to what it faced on the eve of the Desert Fox airstrikes
in December 1998, when UNSCOM was finally withdrawn. The options:
Either ignore Saddam's deception and pave the way for declaring
Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction, or use force to demand
access.
</P>
<P>
   Past shows of force against Iraq, however, have brought at best
limited progress on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   A more fundamental concern is that if Iraq were allowed to
forbid the conduct of ``any time, any place'' searches and instead
to control their timing and location, it could eventually get a
passing grade for disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam could then push to have Iraq certified as free of
nonconventional arms, which would end the sanctions that keep
Saddam in his box. Better an impasse than a sham.
</P>
<P>
   Before the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the world knew little of
Iraq's efforts beyond the fact that it had a chemical-weapons
program _ used with gruesome effectiveness against its own Kurdish
population and against Iran during the eight-year war. Information
discovered after the Persian Gulf conflict indicated that Iraq was
close to producing a nuclear weapon and had vast stores of chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the United States and its allies mistakenly believed
that Operation Desert Storm had destroyed much of Iraq's
threatening capability. As Defense Secretary Richard Cheney
testified in the immediate aftermath of Desert Storm, ``Saddam
Hussein is out of the nuclear business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq's arsenal proved far more extensive than Western
leaders initially suspected _ and the job for inspectors more
onerous too.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Saddam blocked the inspectors' access, lied to
them about the existence of his deadly weapons programs and
otherwise made a mockery of the whole system. Iraqis repeatedly
stopped the U.N. team at the door and simply moved any sensitive
documents out the rear exit.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's interference was hardly subtle, and its pretexts for
noncompliance were often pathetic. But except for the United States
and Britain, the major powers would not back up the beleaguered
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the work was going full-bore, its effectiveness was
limited. Finding hidden weapons in a vast area is exceptionally
difficult, particularly biological weapons, which require
relatively limited infrastructure and can be easily concealed as
legitimate medical or research facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the U.N. inspectors were never led to a real
success: a complete accounting of Iraq's secret programs and the
destruction of all its proscribed weaponry. Baghdad revealed almost
none of its activities willingly and often lied about destroying
parts of its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of Iraq's biological weapons effort became clear
only after the August 1995 defection of Hussein Kamel al-Majid, a
former general and son-in-law of Saddam who had headed the
clandestine weapons projects. Likewise, the defection of Wafiq
al-Samarrai, the former chief of military intelligence, led to the
revelation that Iraq had manufactured and loaded onto delivery
systems the lethal chemical agent VX _ a surprise to UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq almost certainly still has a small stockpile of chemical
weapons and limited quantities of biological agents and seed stock.
Yet Iraq implausibly insists that its nonconventional weapons
programs have been terminated and therefore demands that sanctions
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Although assessments vary, Iraq would probably need only a few
years to build a nuclear weapon after sanctions were lifted. Its
biological programs could be resumed in a matter of days. Producing
chemical agents such as mustard gas and sarin would take only a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   So not only sanctions but also strict controls over Iraqi
imports are still crucial to stop proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions have cut Iraqi state revenues by $10 billion to $15
billion a year, slashing the regime's assets. Equally important,
sanctions have sharply restricted what Iraq can buy. If Iraq cannot
acquire dual-use items that can be used for both weapons and
legitimate civilian purposes, developing weapons of mass
destruction will be far harder. An Iraq that can trade as a
``normal'' nation is an unnerving prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Russia is an aggressive advocate of Iraq's cause and a
full-throated critic of inspections and sanctions. France and China
also oppose U.S. policy and _ except for a handful of traumatized
gulf emirates, especially Kuwait _ the Arab states often hesitate
to support U.S. strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatically, it would be difficult and, indeed, foolish for
Washington to openly oppose renewed inspections. But U.S.
policy-makers should recognize that compromises, which offer the
false promise of progress, will in fact lay the groundwork for Iraq
to go its own way.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has spent what limited money he controls on the tools of
war and on lavish rewards for his loyal followers, not on the
well-being of the Iraqi people. Money earmarked for humanitarian
purposes often goes unspent. The regime smuggles humanitarian goods
out of Iraq to sell on the black market. And Iraqis living in the
parts of northern Iraq under U.N. control fare far better than
those under Saddam's political thumb.
</P>
<P>
   If sanctions were lifted, there is little reason to expect that
Saddam would start spending revenue generously on the Iraqi people
and every reason to believe he would blow it on Iraq's lethal toys.
</P>
<P>
   To counter legitimate humanitarian concerns about the harm done
by halting the transfer of some dual-use items _ such as chlorine,
which can be used for both chemical weapons and water purification
_ Washington should push for more international supervision of
Iraqi imports. If the world community can confidently purchase,
transfer and install water-treatment facilities without worrying
that Iraq will divert them for military uses, it could send the
requisite dual-use items.
</P>
<P>
   Such humanitarian acts, however, require that control remain in
international hands lest Saddam's goons swipe the technology. Iraq,
not the United States, is the main barrier to such a shift.
</P>
<P>
   In a wider sense, however, the stumbling blocks in this
diplomatic dance lie not with Iraq but with the U.S. allies and
other major powers who are so anxious to resume trade with Baghdad.
Indeed, America's greatest obstacles are the efforts by France,
Russia and other defenders to readmit Iraq into the community of
nations without requiring it to adhere to international norms.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, standing alone may be self-defeating, despite its
moral attractiveness. But the perfect should not become the enemy
of the good. Renewed inspections would, however unwittingly, help
Saddam develop his weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing inspections may require Washington to stake out some
unpopular diplomatic positions, but given the stakes involved, the
danger of offending Saddam's defenders is easily worth the risk.

</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the United States and its allies mistakenly believed
that Operation Desert Storm had destroyed much of Iraq's
threatening capability. As Defense Secretary Richard Cheney
testified in the immediate aftermath of Desert Storm, ``Saddam
Hussein is out of the nuclear business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq's arsenal proved far more extensive than Western
leaders initially suspected _ and the job for inspectors more
onerous too.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Saddam blocked the inspectors' access, lied to
them about the existence of his deadly weapons programs and
otherwise made a mockery of the whole system. Iraqis repeatedly
stopped the U.N. team at the door and simply moved any sensitive
documents out the rear exit.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's interference was hardly subtle, and its pretexts for
noncompliance were often pathetic. But except for the United States
and Britain, the major powers would not back up the beleaguered
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the work was going full-bore, its effectiveness was
limited. Finding hidden weapons in a vast area is exceptionally
difficult, particularly biological weapons, which require
relatively limited infrastructure and can be easily concealed as
legitimate medical or research facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the U.N. inspectors were never led to a real
success: a complete accounting of Iraq's secret programs and the
destruction of all its proscribed weaponry. Baghdad revealed almost
none of its activities willingly and often lied about destroying
parts of its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of Iraq's biological weapons effort became clear
only after the August 1995 defection of Hussein Kamel al-Majid, a
former general and son-in-law of Saddam who had headed the
clandestine weapons projects. Likewise, the defection of Wafiq
al-Samarrai, the former chief of military intelligence, led to the
revelation that Iraq had manufactured and loaded onto delivery
systems the lethal chemical agent VX _ a surprise to UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq almost certainly still has a small stockpile of chemical
weapons and limited quantities of biological agents and seed stock.
Yet Iraq implausibly insists that its nonconventional weapons
programs have been terminated and therefore demands that sanctions
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Although assessments vary, Iraq would probably need only a few
years to build a nuclear weapon after sanctions were lifted. Its
biological programs could be resumed in a matter of days. Producing
chemical agents such as mustard gas and sarin would take only a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   So not only sanctions but also strict controls over Iraqi
imports are still crucial to stop proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions have cut Iraqi state revenues by $10 billion to $15
billion a year, slashing the regime's assets. Equally important,
sanctions have sharply restricted what Iraq can buy. If Iraq cannot
acquire dual-use items that can be used for both weapons and
legitimate civilian purposes, developing weapons of mass
destruction will be far harder. An Iraq that can trade as a
``normal'' nation is an unnerving prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Russia is an aggressive advocate of Iraq's cause and a
full-throated critic of inspections and sanctions. France and China
also oppose U.S. policy and _ except for a handful of traumatized
gulf emirates, especially Kuwait _ the Arab states often hesitate
to support U.S. strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatically, it would be difficult and, indeed, foolish for
Washington to openly oppose renewed inspections. But U.S.
policy-makers should recognize that compromises, which offer the
false promise of progress, will in fact lay the groundwork for Iraq
to go its own way.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has spent what limited money he controls on the tools of
war and on lavish rewards for his loyal followers, not on the
well-being of the Iraqi people. Money earmarked for humanitarian
purposes often goes unspent. The regime smuggles humanitarian goods
out of Iraq to sell on the black market. And Iraqis living in the
parts of northern Iraq under U.N. control fare far better than
those under Saddam's political thumb.
</P>
<P>
   If sanctions were lifted, there is little reason to expect that
Saddam would start spending revenue generously on the Iraqi people
and every reason to believe he would blow it on Iraq's lethal toys.
</P>
<P>
   To counter legitimate humanitarian concerns about the harm done
by halting the transfer of some dual-use items _ such as chlorine,
which can be used for both chemical weapons and water purification
_ Washington should push for more international supervision of
Iraqi imports. If the world community can confidently purchase,
transfer and install water-treatment facilities without worrying
that Iraq will divert them for military uses, it could send the
requisite dual-use items.
</P>
<P>
   Such humanitarian acts, however, require that control remain in
international hands lest Saddam's goons swipe the technology. Iraq,
not the United States, is the main barrier to such a shift.
</P>
<P>
   In a wider sense, however, the stumbling blocks in this
diplomatic dance lie not with Iraq but with the U.S. allies and
other major powers who are so anxious to resume trade with Baghdad.
Indeed, America's greatest obstacles are the efforts by France,
Russia and other defenders to readmit Iraq into the community of
nations without requiring it to adhere to international norms.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, standing alone may be self-defeating, despite its
moral attractiveness. But the perfect should not become the enemy
of the good. Renewed inspections would, however unwittingly, help
Saddam develop his weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing inspections may require Washington to stake out some
unpopular diplomatic positions, but given the stakes involved, the
danger of offending Saddam's defenders is easily worth the risk.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In Russia, the March 26 presidential election offers no
alternatives. It seems that Vladimir Putin, the acting president,
has an obvious advantage. I know Putin. He is an intelligent and
serious man. But to hold any position on him, it is necessary to
see more: who he relies upon and in what manner he works and which
goals he sets. As yet, none of this is clear.
 &HT;    I make no secret of the fact that I regret that former Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov pulled out of the race.
 &HT;    I had spent two years trying to persuade everyone and myself
that he would be the best choice for president. Primakov is well
known in Russia and the West and that is a very important
qualification.
 &HT;    More importantly, if Primakov, whom I have always supported,
were participating in the election today, at least he would pose an
alternative. But Primakov was unable to withstand the ordeal of
what the Kremlin-controlled media did to him during the
parliamentary election campaigns _ the blatant smear tactics. We
must call things by their names: His knees simply gave way.
 &HT;    Now, from my knowledge of all the candidates in the race, I
would say that critical questions must be asked of all of them,
primarily Putin. Nothing is known about the foundations of his
program. But as to the issues, and what must and must not be done,
certain things are quite clear.
 &HT;    First, dictatorship is impossible in Russia anymore under any
regime in the Kremlin, Putin's or anybody else's. This is the point
everyone raises, the question I am always asked, especially by
people in the West: Is it possible that Russia will turn back? No.
 &HT;    What I would say is that a system of effective authority is
needed, that law and order are needed; but that such an imperative
should not be confused with a dictatorship.
 &HT;    Today's political leaders are being confronted with new problems
for which they are unprepared and have no solutions _ not only in
Russia but also in the West. The confrontation of opposing blocs
has ended, the Warsaw Pact organization has dissolved and many new
independent states have appeared. We have lost the system of
relations that previously held the world together and organized it,
however defective that system was.
 &HT;    As yet there is no good replacement. We now have ``goods'' that
seem as threatening as evils. For example, freed from the threat of
a nuclear nightmare that hung over everyone's head during the Cold
War, and freed from the discipline imposed by each of the rival
blocs during that time, every country finds that it now possesses a
certain new freedom of action. And yet nowhere, despite this
``freedom,'' do we see nations fostering truly genuine democratic
and peaceful international relations.
 &HT;    The United States viewed the end of the Cold War as essentially
the removal of obstacles on the road to achieving longstanding
goals of American policy. Even though the United States spoke about
a new world order, it essentially meant a continuation of its own
policies. The existing order in world economic affairs was
essentially to Washington's liking.
 &HT;    And so, in this new century, while the Cold War on the whole has
passed into history, its legacy and many of its elements have
persisted, although in changed form. We still have the concept
that, somehow, the West ``won'' and Russia ``lost.'' No wonder,
with such viewpoints, the two ``partners'' are not closer than they
are.
 &HT;    Both Russia and the United States are on the eve of presidential
elections, but there is fear and tension. What does Washington have
in store for us? ask Russians who have become disappointed with the
West's promises and fiercely loyal to their own heritage. In turn,
the West tries to analyze whether Putin, or some other successor to
former President Boris Yeltsin, will be the new Stalin, and foment
war.
 &HT;    We wonder, so long after the Berlin Wall has come down, why the
fact that the world has become pluralistic is not a greater cause
for celebration and respect and trust. Instead, the idea of various
``dangers'' coming from the East is expressed in Western
publications and sometimes in the speeches of Western political
leaders.
 &HT;    Still, Russia will not go back.
 &HT;    It is true that instead of the euphoria of 1989-90, a certain
pessimism has set in. In Russia and the former republics, any
leftover memories of that ``new world order'' are being considered
either a myth or a utopian idea.
 &HT;    But for an authoritarian or totalitarian system to flourish, as
we in the Soviet Union very well knew, there must be more _
something more sinister than disappointment. There must be closed,
secretive behavior relative to the outside world. When a regime
tightens the reins on its own population and uses any form of
coercion it desires, one result is that it will choose
confrontation as the most comfortable foreign policy.
 &HT;    And so it will be incumbent upon the two new presidents _ those
of Russia and the United States _ to raise to a qualitatively new
level the kind of international dialogue that played an
irreplaceable role in ending the Cold War. Without democratization
of international relations, we cannot arrive at any new, genuinely
peaceful world order.
 &HT;    Our people must hold the politicians precisely to these goals.

<P>
   Two nights before the New Hampshire primary, I was sitting in a
Manchester bar arguing with a fellow reporter about the latest Al
Gore-Bill Bradley polls. ``I'm not gonna believe any poll,'' my
colleague told me, ``until I see John Zogby's name on it.''
</P>
<P>
   A little-known independent pollster based in Utica, N.Y., Zogby
rocketed to fame by correctly predicting the results of the 1996
presidential election. But like all religions, the cult of Zogby
relies on myths about his feats and denial about his failures.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby's dead-on prediction in 1996 _ he forecast Bill Clinton's
eight-point win over Bob Dole, while most pollsters expected a much
wider Clinton margin _ won him a burst of media attention. What is
odd is how Zogby's reputation has mushroomed ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits, reporters, and chat show hosts now routinely genuflect
to him. ``Joining us now from Detroit is the nation's most accurate
pollster, John Zogby,'' said Bill O'Reilly of Fox News Channel's
``The O'Reilly Factor'' in November. Robert Novak calls him ``the
country's hottest pollster.'' Dick Morris says he's ``New York's
most accurate pollster.'' The Washington Times' Wes Pruden bows to
the ``the hottest (and most accurate) pollster.'' Chris Matthews, a
leading Zogby acolyte, welcomed him to ``Hardball'' in 1998 by
saying, ``John Zogby, you're the best pollster.''
</P>
<P>
   The cult grows despite Zogby's embarrassing miscues. He stumbled
several times during the 1998 election cycle, the only big election
since his 1996 triumph. One of the closest Senate races that year
was the Al D'Amato-Charles Schumer contest in Zogby's home state of
New York. Most polls found Schumer opening up a discernible lead in
the final days of the campaign. Not Zogby, who predicted a D'Amato
victory after his final numbers showed D'Amato holding a razor-thin
lead. Schumer trounced D'Amato by 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby went out on another limb in Illinois, where one-term Sen.
Carol Moseley-Braun faced a tough fight against conservative
challenger Peter Fitzgerald. Though Moseley-Braun managed a small
comeback in the campaign's final days, most polls showed her
trailing by as much as 10 points. But numbers released by Zogby
International Nov. 3 gave Moseley-Braun a three-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mort Kondracke enthused the night before the election, ``If
Carol Moseley-Braun wins in Illinois and Al D'Amato wins in New
York, John Zogby is going to go right into the Polling Hall of Fame
because nobody agrees with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald beat Moseley-Braun by three points.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby is not a bad pollster. He's a very good one. He's just not
head and shoulders above the rest. He flubs his share of races, but
the media ignore his failures. They seize on evidence that confirms
their beliefs and disregard contradictory data.
</P>
<P>
   Take Matthews' spin on Zogby's New Hampshire polls. No pollster
predicted the scale of John McCain's 19-point victory over George
W. Bush. But Zogby did give McCain one of his highest margins, a
12-point lead over Bush in his final tracking poll. So Zogby kind
of called it, right?
</P>
<P>
   Matthews thought so. ``You were clearly the closest pollster
getting it,'' he gushed to Zogby two weeks later. What Matthews
didn't mention, or maybe didn't notice, was that Zogby's final
numbers also gave Al Gore a 12-point lead over Bill Bradley, even
though Gore only won by five points. Most other pollsters noticed
Bradley's late surge and got that five-point margin right.
</P>
<P>
   So what explains Zogby's outsized reputation? Pundits have
convinced themselves that he discovered a magical technique that
elevates him above mere polling mortals: He only polls ``likely
voters.'' It's true that news organizations frequently release
polls of registered voters or even all adults. But every serious
political pollster screens for likely voters. The skill is figuring
out who's a ``likely'' and who's not.
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason for Zogby's popularity is that his
polls make Republicans feel good. Conservatives clutched at his
accurate prediction of the 1996 race because it seemed to show that
Clinton wasn't so popular after all. Since then, Zogby's numbers
have usually shown Republicans doing better than they do in other
polls. Zogby is a registered Democrat and, he says, a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   My hunch is that Zogby's method of determining who's a ``likely
voter'' emphasizes low-turnout elections, especially ones in which
Republicans are disproportionately able to mobilize their base.
That allows him to notice some Republican upsets that other
pollsters miss. But it also sometimes leads him astray, as it did
in the D'Amato-Schumer race.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to blame Republican partisans for treating Zogby's
calculations as electoral truth revealed from on high. But what's
the media's excuse?

<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif. _ In the Apollo Theater debate two weeks
ago, Bill Bradley ripped into Al Gore, depicting him as a closet
conservative who was unreliable on a host of issues important to
Democrats _ abortion rights, gun control and racial justice.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday night's Los Angles Times/CNN debate, Bradley stood
next to Gore for the ninth and final time and uttered not a single
word of criticism _ until 12 minutes before the end, when he
responded obligingly to a pair of questions from journalists who
essentially requested a reenactment of last week's fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt that Bradley's opinion of Gore has changed so
dramatically in a week. Nor do I think that Bradley's tonal
flip-flop indicates that he is desperately flailing around for a
last-ditch way to win the election _ everyone knows it's utterly
hopeless, including Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was striking how un-desperate Bradley sounded in the
face of imminent defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, I think the sudden temperamental shift is explained by
the strange quality of interiority that has characterized Bradley's
campaign from the outset. Bradley has always viewed running for
president as an opportunity for personal growth and character
development. I think he's staying in the race for another week to
achieve a sense of completeness as he comes to grips with the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   To put it a bit cruelly, I think Bradley views his unsuccessful
presidential campaign as a book that needs a last chapter.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve the closure he requires, Bradley had to do two things
before exiting the campaign. First, he had to show himself that he
could stand up to that lying bully, Al Gore. That was the purpose
of last week's onslaught at the Apollo.
</P>
<P>
   But having demonstrated that he could stick up for himself, he
didn't want to exit amid a haze of negativity and contention.
Bradley wants to depart the stage on the high-minded, substantive,
and civil note on which he began his candidacy. That's the
explanation for Wednesday night's tepid performance.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Bradley sounded like he was writing the epitaph for
his own campaign. ``Not enough politicians speak from their core
convictions,'' he declared at one point. ``I got into this race to
try to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley kept drawing from this rhetorical well, calling for ``a
politics of belief and conviction'' and for politicians who
``respect the people.'' At another point, he added, ``Trust is the
absolute ingredient that's needed between a leader and the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Bradley made remarks of this sort to denigrate Gore.
Wednesday he offered them as credits to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Such declarations of principle aren't about trying to convince
the press and public to think well of Bill Bradley once again.
Rather, I think Bradley means to solidify the legacy of his
campaign in his own mind.
</P>
<P>
   The new five-minute television commercial Bradley is buying has
the same purpose: to prove to the candidate's own satisfaction that
his campaign had real value, that it proved a ``different kind of
politics'' was possible.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bradley's campaign was always better at expressing such
values than it was at exemplifying them. What I think Bradley never
grasped was the extent to which his moral hauteur and self-regard
undermined his presidential quest from the start. For a candidate
to be scrupulous and reflective is appealing. For a candidate to be
a smug and self-conscious is not.
</P>
<P>
   It's striking how much Bradley's performance Wednesday night
recalled his manner in the first Gore-Bradley debate back in
October. As he was then, Bradley on Wednesday was high-minded and
low affect. He presented himself as someone of superior character
trying to raise the ethical tenor of national politics.
</P>
<P>
   To those not already enamored of him, he failed to make much of
an impression. Bradley's indignation is closer to the surface than
it was back then. But in other respects, he really hasn't changed
very much.
</P>
<P>
   The chief difference between the debate Wednesday night and the
debate four months ago is that the guy Bradley is running against
has improved vastly.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bradley's real legacy, though that's not how he sees it.
Bradley thinks he helped the Democrats by showing them that a
nobler type of politics is possible. In reality he helped them by
turning the vice president into a fiercer, more agile candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley leaves the race thinking of himself as Al Gore's
better. Most of us will remember him as Al Gore's appetizer.

 By CHON A. NORIEGA  
 &HT;    Despite the well-documented growth of the Hispanic community as
a political and market force, Hispanics enter the 21st century with
a lower level of media access and representation than when protests
first raised the issue in the 1960s.
 &HT;    As The Hollywood Reporter recently noted, ``Hispanics have
historically been the most underrepresented of all the minority
groups in film and TV, and there is no sign that their numbers are
increasing.''
 &HT;    In fact, guild figures released in late 1999 show significant
declines from the previous year: from 4 percent to 3.5 percent for
actors, and from 3.1 percent to 2.3 percent for directors.
Hispanics make up just 1.3 percent of the writers for prime-time
television.
 &HT;    But that's not the really bad news. While these numbers have
remained almost constant for the last three decades, the Hispanic
community itself has grown from 4.5 percent of the national
population in 1970 to 11.5 percent in 2000. In other words, there
are roughly two-and-a-half times more Hispanics getting the same
small percentage of jobs.
 &HT;    And in Los Angeles, where the film and television industry is
located, Hispanics make up around 45 percent of the population.
 &HT;    The industry has achieved consensus about the cause of the
problem: a lack of Hispanics in decision-making positions.
 &HT;    In a survey conducted for the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, I
found that Spanish-surnamed employees accounted for 1.9 percent of
the executive positions at major studios and networks. In no
instance did a Hispanic executive occupy a creative decision-making
position.
 &HT;    Roughly 60 percent of networks and studios do not employ any
Hispanic executives.
 &HT;    Why? According to the industry itself, the reason is simply
economic. Hispanics may be a disproportionately large market, but
they are not ``distinct enough'' as consumers to be able to demand
inclusion on the production side.
 &HT;    That's right, we're too mainstream to gain admittance to the
executive suite.
 &HT;    What the industry is really trying to argue is that it operates
by economic rationale alone. In fact, the industry is relatively
small and its key players all tend to know each other. Hispanics
have not been part of that crowd.
 &HT;    The entertainment industry already has an extraordinarily high
failure rate (around 75 percent for new television series and not
much better for movies), and one look at Kevin Costner's
mega-budget box-office duds throws any sense of logic out the
window.
 &HT;    But in the absence of a formula for success, the industry has
invented one around itself, going with the actors, producers and
formats it already knows. These do not provide a higher success
rate, but they give executives a greater comfort factor than
gambling on the unknown.
 &HT;    If 1999 signaled an all-time low for minority representation _
best exemplified by the all-white casts for the 26 new prime-time
series in the fall _ it also witnessed the first national Hispanic
advocacy efforts since the early 1970s.
 &HT;    The most notable movement involved the creation of the National
Association of Latino Independent Producers. Ironically, these 250
Hispanic producers _ as a professional group with defining
characteristics and accomplishments _ have almost no visibility in
the press, the industry and even the media advocacy groups fighting
on their behalf. They are simply not part of the debate, and hence
they are never identified as part of the solution.
 &HT;    But these are precisely the people who will make the Hispanic
images that are currently missing from mainstream film and
television.
 &HT;    Now that they have organized, where are the Hispanic executives?

 By AMY WU  
 &HT;    The Fox Network's controversial game show ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire'' proved that, in America, love has lost any shred
of innocence it once had. It has become something to be selected
and chosen like a commodity.
 &HT;    As an Asian-American female, I have noticed how this dynamic _
women ``falling in love'' with men who have large wallets _ has
infiltrated the Asian community. Wealthy Asian males now have their
choice of mate across racial boundaries.
 &HT;    In a new book titled ``Asian-Americans: Intermarriage and the
Social Construction of Love'' (Beacon Press), demographer Larry
Hajime Shinagawa writes that more and more Asian-American men are
marrying outside their ethnic group _ something that was once very
rare. Part of the reason comes down to dollars and cents.
 &HT;    How so? Because Asian males have a reputation for being
wealthier than other ethnic groups, and those dollar signs are
attracting women of all colors.
 &HT;    Don't get me wrong _ many men find Asian women alluring, but for
very different reasons.
 &HT;    As a young, Chinese-American woman, race has played a major part
in all my relationships. At 15, I swore I would marry for love. At
17, when being Asian was no longer so fashionable, I swore I would
only marry a white man. My goal was to become as ``American'' as
possible.
 &HT;    At 21, I traveled to Hong Kong to work as a journalist, and
while I was there I witnessed firsthand how fashionable it was for
white men to date and marry Asian girls.
 &HT;    One of my white male colleagues, who had been dating an Asian
airline stewardess for three months, offered an explanation: ``I
like the way Asian women look, how polite they are and how they
seem so demure and innocent.''
 &HT;    The Asian women who I encountered in Hong Kong restaurants and
public places dutifully leaned against their lovers for support and
giggled with their hands over their mouths. They were thin-boned,
longhaired and looked like high school girls. And on the flip side,
these Asian women viewed white men as coveted prizes.
 &HT;    I also befriended an American music executive whose girlfriend
was 20 years his junior _ a local girl who looked every inch the
Asian princess. He lived in an impressive penthouse overlooking the
city and took her out to dinner every night.
 &HT;    She giggled and charmed him, and he was delighted. In return,
she got to live in a penthouse and had a closet filled with Gucci.
I only hope it was true love, but I have my doubts.
 &HT;    In Hong Kong, my adolescent dream of being considered completely
American became a reality. In fact, I met many men _ both Asian and
Caucasian _ who thought I was too American. I am not a Suzy Wong
look-alike. I laugh freely. I ask many questions. I am opinionated.
Most of all, I like talking about current events.
 &HT;    I once went on a date with a local guy, an accountant who drove
a Mercedes-Benz. His interest in me soared after he discovered I
was a transplanted New Yorker. My colleagues who were local women
coaxed me into going out with him even though I thought he was
about as exciting as a brick.
 &HT;    ``He has a Benz, a big bank account. He'll take care of you for
the rest of your life,'' they said, perhaps secretly hoping I would
drop him like a hot potato so that one of them could scoop him up.
 &HT;    After two dates he tired of me. I knew too much about the stock
market and current events. I explained I loved to travel to exotic
places. I didn't lean against his arm, fetch his slippers and wash
his laundry. It was at that point I had decided that I would rather
spend my time with a starving poet than a wealthy numbers-cruncher.
 &HT;    Call me a traditionalist, but I think the new love landscape is
shameful and bizarre _ and Fox's alarmingly popular TV debacle is a
perfect example. True Love only lasts when fate is allowed to do
its work, and when the feelings aren't tainted by other motives.
 &HT;    For now, I think I'll stick with feng shui and fortunetellers.

SAME-SEX MARRIAGE PROPOSED IN VERMONT

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Lawmakers in Vermont stand tiptoe at the threshold of tolerance.
Will they make same-sex marriage legal for the first time in the
United States? Although Hawaii and California have already passed
domestic partnership laws, Vermont proposes enacting a far more
extensive same-sex marriage law.
 &HT;    So far the country road to same-sex unions in Vermont has been
paved with legislative responsibility, public hearings and positive
results. Recently the Judiciary Committee of the state's House of
Representatives indicated, in an informal 8-3 vote, that it would
draft ``a broad civil rights bill that does not cross the legal
threshold of marriage.''
 &HT;    To their credit Vermont lawmakers have been dealing directly
with the task at hand _ providing gay and lesbian couples the same
``common benefit, protection and security of the law'' guaranteed
to opposite-sex couples. Lawmakers have no choice: They must comply
with the state Supreme Court's legislative order to grant legal
benefits and protections to same-sex couples. This can be achieved
by including gays in existing civil marriage laws or by creating a
parallel domestic partnership system.
 &HT;    Despite the ruling's clear intent, legislators face a daunting
task. Many residents of the state, including Democratic Gov. Howard
Dean, are ``uncomfortable'' with the idea of same-sex marriage.
 &HT;    Dean recently clarified his position. ``I'm against gay
marriage,'' he said in a recent radio interview.
 &HT;    His view is reflected in a recent poll of 623 registered Vermont
voters in which 52 percent oppose the Supreme Court ruling, 38
percent agree and 10 percent remain undecided.
 &HT;    Yet the voices of tolerance reverberate loud and clear in the
chambers of the state capital. Consider Rep. Steve R. Hingtgen, who
has offered a compelling rationale for legal same-sex marriage
instead of a domestic partnership system.
 &HT;    ``For all those who have come before this committee preaching
hate in all its poor disguises, whether with Bible, a law degree or
Ph.D. in hand,'' he said, ``those who have filled our ears with
hate, they will not be sent a message of rebuke by this committee
by our choosing domestic partnership. The hateful will have been
strengthened by our decision.
 &HT;    ``Pursuing the domestic partnership path validates the hate.
Going with domestic partnership validates the bigotry. It does more
than validate it. It institutionalizes the bigotry and
affirmatively creates an apartheid system of family recognition in
Vermont,'' Hingtgen said.
 &HT;    Rep. William Suchmann suggested that honesty and fairness should
be the compass by which to guide the journey of citizens, who like
himself, are uneasy with same-sex marriage.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I am uncomfortable seeing two adults of the same gender
openly displaying affection. But that is my problem. I have a much
bigger problem with a community that passes judgment on a specific
group of God's children and deems them unfit to share in an
institution that draws its strength from compromise and unselfish
love,'' Suchmann wrote in a letter printed on the editorial page of
one Vermont newspaper.
 &HT;    A minority of the House expressed dissatisfaction after the
committee voted to go the domestic partnership route.
 &HT;    ``I'm disappointed we're not doing marriage. But I also want to
emphasize that if our committee and Legislature adopt a
comprehensive domestic partnership bill, it will be the single most
forward-looking piece of legislation for gay and lesbian people in
the entire United States, and this is still very big news,'' said
Rep. William J. Lippert Jr., vice chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, who is gay.
 &HT;    A broad civil-rights bill that does not cross the legal
threshold of marriage will never fully guarantee equal rights for
gays.
 &HT;    Perhaps 10-year-old Courtney Dozetos, who testified at committee
hearings, said it best: ``It would make me feel special and good if
my moms could get married. I don't and probably never will
understand why that can't happen.''
 &HT;    Rep. Dean Corren puts the issue in it's proper historical
perspective. He understands that extending civil marriage to
same-sex couples is the only true ``remedy for what may be the last
great instance of legal discrimination based solely on bigotry.''
 &HT;    American history is rife with lessons on bigotry. Separate but
equal did not work in the South. It took bold action _ integration
_ to foster true equality.
 &HT;    Vermont legislators need to be bold. Legalize same-sex marriage.

 &HT;    How do hotels attract guests in a fiercely competitive market?
By going way beyond overnight shoeshines, 24-hour room service and
pet goldfish in guest rooms to offer something that their rivals
don't.
 &HT;    Here's a rundown of some of the unusual perks that hotels are
tempting visitors with these days.
 &HT;    Anyone who's skilled with a pool cue may get a chance to cut a
deal at the Hotel Loretto, where the ``Rack 'em! Rate'' rules.
Guests who win a game of pool against Janine Shelton, the general
manager, can get a reduced room rate _ 25 percent off one night's
accommodations or 5 percent off one night's accommodations for each
ball left on the table, whichever is greater.
 &HT;    For example, if a guest beats Shelton and she leaves seven balls
on the table, the guest would receive 35 percent off their room
rate. But if Shelton fails to pocket any balls during the game or
if the guest sinks the eight ball on the break, the guest receives
his first night's accommodations free. The ``Rack 'em! Rate'' is
based on space availability. For more information: The Hotel
Loretto, 211 Old Santa Fe Trail, Santa Fe, N.M. 87501; (800)
727-5531; www.noblehousehotels.com/loretto/index.html.
 &HT;    At the Four Seasons Las Vegas, the usual poolside amenities such
as Evian mist and cold towels are supplemented with sliced
cucumbers to relieve eyes tired out by late Vegas nights. The hotel
says it hands out 3,000 slices of cucumbers per week. For more
information: Four Seasons Las Vegas, P.O. Box 98881, Las Vegas,
Nev. 89193; (800) 819-5053; www.fourseasons.com.
 &HT;    In car-obsessed California, the Pan Pacific San Francisco offers
on-site auto detailing with car expert Joe Newhoff. Available by
appointment only, standard cleaning is $35 and extended cleaning is
$60. Add a hand polish and wax and the cost is $145, while complete
auto detailing is $295. For more information: Pan Pacific San
Francisco, 500 Post St., San Francisco, Calif. 94102; 800-533-6465;
www.panpac.com.
 &HT;    At Villa del Sol in the Mexican resort of Zihuatanejo, guests
can take the ``Interactive Spanish and Mexican Cuisine Course.''
Participants tour the town markets, learning about herbs, spices,
fruits, vegetables and fish, while shopping for the ingredients for
a Mexican meal.
 &HT;    Afterwards, guests can help prepare a Mexican meal or merely
watch the demonstration. Tequila, wine, beer and soft drinks are
served with the lunch, along with a booklet of recipes. The
five-hour course is $80 per person and limited to a group of eight.
For more information: Villa del Sol, Playa la Ropa, Zihuatanejo,
Mexico; (888) 389-2645; www.hotelvilladelsol.com.
 &HT;    At Hastings House, each guest's name is hand-lettered on the
door to their room and a personalized greeting card welcomes them.
In the evening, guests receive a personalized dinner menu. Every
morning, a wake-up hamper filled with fresh coffee or tea and
homemade pastries is delivered to the door of their suites. For
more information: Hastings House, 160 Upper Ganges Road, Salt
Spring Island, B.C., Canada V8K 2S2; 800-661-9255;
www.hastingshouse.com.
 &HT;    The Four Seasons Hotel Washington, D.C., has a ``Quiet Room''
for $30 per hour. It's a private, soundproofed getaway where guests
can relax or listen to CDs while sitting in a leather recliner with
built-in massage functions. The room is lit by recessed, adjustable
``mood'' lighting. There's a remote-controlled audiovisual system
as well as a sound machine that can emulate noises like ocean
waves. In addition, a mini-fridge stocked with complimentary
refreshments, hot and cold face towels and a lava lamp are at their
disposal. For more information: The Four Seasons Hotel, 2800
Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20007; 800-819-5053;

 &HT;    An Irish Yogi is what the Fitzpatrick Family Group of Hotels
offers at the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel and the Fitzpatrick Grand
Central Hotel. Yogi Paul Dallaghan of Dublin teaches private
Vinyasa-style yoga to guests in their rooms. Sessions must be
arranged 24 hours in advance, and the cost is $80 per hour or $100
for 90 minutes. For more information: Fitzpatrick Hotels, 687
Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022; 800-367-7701;

``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER  
 &HT;    How do hotels attract guests in a fiercely competitive market?
By going way beyond overnight shoeshines, 24-hour room service and
pet goldfish in guest rooms to offer something that their rivals
don't.
 &HT;    Here's a rundown of some of the unusual perks that hotels are
tempting visitors with these days.
 &HT;    Anyone who's skilled with a pool cue may get a chance to cut a
deal at the Hotel Loretto, where the ``Rack 'em! Rate'' rules.
Guests who win a game of pool against Janine Shelton, the general
manager, can get a reduced room rate _ 25 percent off one night's
accommodations or 5 percent off one night's accommodations for each
ball left on the table, whichever is greater.
 &HT;    For example, if a guest beats Shelton and she leaves seven balls
on the table, the guest would receive 35 percent off their room
rate. But if Shelton fails to pocket any balls during the game or
if the guest sinks the eight ball on the break, the guest receives
his first night's accommodations free. The ``Rack 'em! Rate'' is
based on space availability. For more information: The Hotel
Loretto, 211 Old Santa Fe Trail, Santa Fe, N.M. 87501; (800)
727-5531; www.noblehousehotels.com/loretto/index.html.
 &HT;    At the Four Seasons Las Vegas, the usual poolside amenities such
as Evian mist and cold towels are supplemented with sliced
cucumbers to relieve eyes tired out by late Vegas nights. The hotel
says it hands out 3,000 slices of cucumbers per week. For more
information: Four Seasons Las Vegas, P.O. Box 98881, Las Vegas,
Nev. 89193; (800) 819-5053; www.fourseasons.com.
 &HT;    In car-obsessed California, the Pan Pacific San Francisco offers
on-site auto detailing with car expert Joe Newhoff. Available by
appointment only, standard cleaning is $35 and extended cleaning is
$60. Add a hand polish and wax and the cost is $145, while complete
auto detailing is $295. For more information: Pan Pacific San
Francisco, 500 Post St., San Francisco, Calif. 94102; 800-533-6465;
www.panpac.com.
 &HT;    At Villa del Sol in the Mexican resort of Zihuatanejo, guests
can take the ``Interactive Spanish and Mexican Cuisine Course.''
Participants tour the town markets, learning about herbs, spices,
fruits, vegetables and fish, while shopping for the ingredients for
a Mexican meal.
 &HT;    Afterwards, guests can help prepare a Mexican meal or merely
watch the demonstration. Tequila, wine, beer and soft drinks are
served with the lunch, along with a booklet of recipes. The
five-hour course is $80 per person and limited to a group of eight.
For more information: Villa del Sol, Playa la Ropa, Zihuatanejo,
Mexico; (888) 389-2645; www.hotelvilladelsol.com.
 &HT;    At Hastings House, each guest's name is hand-lettered on the
door to their room and a personalized greeting card welcomes them.
In the evening, guests receive a personalized dinner menu. Every
morning, a wake-up hamper filled with fresh coffee or tea and
homemade pastries is delivered to the door of their suites. For
more information: Hastings House, 160 Upper Ganges Road, Salt
Spring Island, B.C., Canada V8K 2S2; 800-661-9255;
www.hastingshouse.com.
 &HT;    The Four Seasons Hotel Washington, D.C., has a ``Quiet Room''
for $30 per hour. It's a private, soundproofed getaway where guests
can relax or listen to CDs while sitting in a leather recliner with
built-in massage functions. The room is lit by recessed, adjustable
``mood'' lighting. There's a remote-controlled audiovisual system
as well as a sound machine that can emulate noises like ocean
waves. In addition, a mini-fridge stocked with complimentary
refreshments, hot and cold face towels and a lava lamp are at their
disposal. For more information: The Four Seasons Hotel, 2800
Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20007; 800-819-5053;
www.fourseasons.com.
 &HT;    An Irish Yogi is what the Fitzpatrick Family Group of Hotels
offers at the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel and the Fitzpatrick Grand
Central Hotel. Yogi Paul Dallaghan of Dublin teaches private
Vinyasa-style yoga to guests in their rooms. Sessions must be
arranged 24 hours in advance, and the cost is $80 per hour or $100
for 90 minutes. For more information: Fitzpatrick Hotels, 687
Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022; 800-367-7701;

 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 &HT;    This year, many tour companies are including adventure-travel
excursions for the senior set. Here is a sampling.
 &HT;    
 SOUTHWESTERN STYLE  
 &HT;    Interhostel, an international study/travel program for adults
ages 50 and older, is adding six new domestic trips for 2000 _
including two that explore the Southwest and its heritage.
 &HT;    The trips are sponsored by the University of New Hampshire's
Continuing Education Program. Travelers can head for Palm Springs
(April 2 to 7) or Palm Desert, Calif., (April 9 to 14), where they
will learn about the wonderful activities of such organizations as
Animal Advocates for Life.
 &HT;    The Palm Desert program includes a tour of the Wildlife
Ambassadors facility to meet Belgian tigers, a meeting with the
curator scientist of the Palm Springs Desert Museum and a trip to
the Living Desert, a outdoor museum where wild creatures are
rescued and cared for.
 &HT;    The Palm Springs outing will include guided tours of the Agua
Caliente Indian Canyons as well as a ride on the Aerial Tramway.
Depending on the trip you choose, the price is about $830, double
occupancy, without airfare.
 &HT;    Interhostel is also offering a trip to the Butler Wash
Archaeology and Rock Art Service Project in Eastland, Utah, from
April 15 to 21. Tour-goers are given the chance to explore the Comb
Ridge area, which is particularly rich in archaic sites. Here, rock
art dates back as far as 8000 B.C. Participants also learn how to
locate and survey cliff dwellings, learn how to document sites and
participate in lectures and discussions about the ancient people of
the area.
 &HT;    Interhostel requires that travelers be able to hike two to four
miles in hilly canyon land. The price is $935 (no singles), without
airfare.

 UNDATED: ... like Maya.''

<P>
   --Early elementary age. In kindergarten and first grade, you'll
begin to see some recognition of cultural values, from, ``Why am I
the only one in the class with two moms?'' to, ``I don't like being
the only one.'' This is a dawning sense that being different has
consequences, and it's your cue to talk about how the world works,
says McGleughlin.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends couching it in terms a child can grasp: ``You
know how the teacher has more to say about what happens than the
kids? Well, in the world we live in, there are more heterosexual
families than homosexual families, so they have more to say about
how rules work. Some of the rules in the world are good and some
are bad. One rule says that families with two moms aren't as good
as families with a mom and a dad, and that's a rule we want to help
change because we know it isn't true and it's not a good rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Follow through by being a visible advocate in your child's
school, being available to talk to parent groups, to girl or boy
scout groups, etc., says Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   --Late elementary and middle-school age. Because this is a stage
when children want more than anything else to be like everyone
else, it's the trickiest time for parents. ``Even the most loving
and accepting kid can be embarrassed by same-sex parents or at
least be more cautious about disclosure,'' says Martin. She says
it's not unusual for a 10-year-old to come home saying ``I hate our
family!'' or to ask ``Could you not hold hands in front of my
friends?'' or even ``Can I call you Uncle instead of Dad?''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson calls this one of the ``bumps'' same-sex parents have
to deal with. (Another one: mothers teaching a son to pee. ``You
draw on friends or relatives,'' she says.)
</P>
<P>
   As hurtful as the apparent rejection can be, Martin urges not to
take it personally. ``It's about the need to fit in, not about
you,'' she says. Her advice is to be as respectful and responsive
as possible: ``OK, we won't hold hands.'' If you have to draw a
line, try to negotiate around it: ``I can't pretend to be your
uncle, but maybe there's some other way we can make this more
comfortable for you.'' Some children are sad or withdrawn during
these years. ``Learn to tolerate the sadness but don't be silent
yourself,'' says McGleughlin. Let her know you're available to
talk, and initiate conversations even if she doesn't: ``Has there
been any teasing lately?''
</P>
<P>
   --Mid- to late-adolescence. A developmental task of these years
is coming to grips with your sexual identity. Once this is resolved
for a child, family differences are less of an issue, too, says
Patterson. Firestone points out that studies show that children of
gay parents are no more likely to be gay themselves than children
in the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Some children have thicker skin than others. McGleughlin tells
of a 9-year-old who was tired of getting hassled about having two
moms. ``Look,'' he told his classmates one day, ``this is the way
it is. Get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moira Brace, now an eighth grader, says having two moms makes
her feel special. ``It feels good,'' she says. ``It's the same as
having a mom and a dad. They love you. You don't really think about
it day to day.''

SUGGESTIONS FOR PARENTS
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Clue in all the adults in your child's life, from baby sitters
to parents of peers, on the story of your family: ``Charlie has two
moms. His biological dad lives in LA.''
</P>
<P>
   --Explaining homosexuality and heterosexuality need not include
a discussion of sex until you would have that discussion with a
child in any other family, usually about 9 or 10. When younger
children ask how babies are made, tell them honestly, but also
include the story of how they were made: ``Mama Sue and I could not
make a baby ourselves, so we adopted you!''
</P>
<P>
   --Studies show children with same-sex parents benefit from
having a close relationship with an adult of the opposite sex.
Enlist relatives, friends, teachers, and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   --Other studies reveal that children of same-sex parents
typically wish their parents were less affectionate with each other
in public and had fewer lesbian/gay posters or books around the
house.
</P>
<P>
   --Be sure to tell your children they don't need to protect you:
``Don't be afraid to tell me if something happens or you have bad
thoughts. It won't make me feel bad. I can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   --Especially if you are not out in all areas of your life, talk
to chidlren about the language of choice: ``People don't tell
everyone everything that happens in a family. You pick and choose
whom you feel safe talking to.''
</P>
<P>

BASEBALL JUSTICE AWAITS AN APOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ He is everyone's burden, the scourge of
baseball and we have wasted too many words on him already.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta reliever John Rocker said stupid words to a national
magazine in December and drew a whopping suspension from Baseball
commissioner Bud Selig. Wednesday, an arbitrator cut the suspension
in half, reduced Rocker's fine from $20,000 to $500 and ruled that
the pitcher can report to spring training immediately.
</P>
<P>
   And so there will be more words spilled as Planet Rocker crashes
into the Kissimmee, Fla., swamp. Just think what it'll be like when
the Braves play their first series in New York at the end of June.
Anyone care to ride the No. 7 train to Shea with John Rocker?
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that the arbitrator shaved two weeks off
Rocker's sentence. Deep down, Selig probably expected this ruling,
but now Bud gets to walk around saying he did his best to punish
Rocker in the name of social responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentence isn't about the money or the suspension.
Rocker's punishment follows him everywhere. He has become a
prisoner of his own racist/sexist/xenophobic/homophobic remarks.
Going to New York is going to be hell for him, and his toughest
challenge awaits in his own clubhouse _ a place populated by the
teammate he called a ``fat monkey,'' and numerous ``foreigners'' he
insulted in his ridiculous rant.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves held a players-only meeting Wednesday after the
ruling came down. Brian Jordan predicted that today will be just
another day at the office and Tom Glavine said teammates were
prepared to forgive the 25-year-old lefthander. Randall Simon _
target ot the ``fat monkey'' remark _ said he could make peace with
Rocker if the reliver makes a personal apology. In Arizona, Tony
Gwynn told ESPN that he wouldn't be surprised if one of the Braves
``gets in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is expected to address his teammates en masse, then hold
a press conference. His representatives, the Hendricks Brothers, no
doubt spent Wednesday night helping him prepare his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Some Red Sox veterans commented on what it'll be like for Rocker
when he walks into his clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez said, ``They know him well enought to know about
his apology. You're gonna see it. If he joins the Braves Friday and
you see an empty space where he is sitting and you see everybody
skipping away from him when he eats, they don't trust him. They
don't want him around. But if they welcome him back and accept him
the way he is, he probably means his apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Mike Stanley added, ``I'm sure they'll set up some kind
of meeting where he can address Randall Simon among others. It's
going to be tough to repair in his own clubhouse, never mind what
he's going to have to do around the country. I remember what it was
like for guys who crossed the picket line. They had a hard time
finding a guy to play catch with. And as a player, you don't want
to have anybody say you have the same opinions this guy has. You
don't want to appear that you're friends with him.''
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin, who has been with the Sox longer than any active
player, said, ``He has to deal with his teammates. He's going to
have to apologize to all of them and hopefully they can deal with
it and it will pass. But he's going to pay for those remarks for
the rest of his life. I'm hoping it doesn't hurt baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be a zoo in Kissimee. The Rocker problem just
won't go away and Selig admits concerns about the pitcher's safety.
</P>
<P>
   Every thinking American (and some who don't think, but just call
talk radio) has an opinion about Rocker and his punishment. Many
have expressed disappointment with the arbitrator's ruling. At
least one Atlanta official has called for the Braves to trade
Rocker. The ever-despicable Players Association continues to lobby
for Rocker and said the penalty should be further reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, when ranking offenses committed by professional
athletes, it's hard to find the proper place for Rocker's rant. Was
it worse than Marty McSorley hack attack? Worse than Wil Cordero
beating his wife or Darryl Strawberry failing a drug test (Straw
got a year)? The NFL has two players awaiting trials for murder,
but John Rocker and his words are on the lips of the fandom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rocker has committed no crime. It's never been against
the law to say stupid things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he really means his apology, that's good enough,'' said
Martinez. ``We're not God. We don't have the right to judge. If he
comes to Dominican ever, and I have a chance to welcome him to the
Dominican I would do it. Maybe he doesn't know any other way to
express himself. Maybe nobody taught him. I know he's big enough to
know what's good and bad . . . I'm not standing up for him. Make
that clear. I'm just not one to judge.''

E-SERVICE FIRM LOOKS TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE PACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Breakaway Solutions has made all the right moves in its brief
life as an Internet success story.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston company lined up blue-chip venture backers, had a
successful IPO, watched its stock take off like a rocket, pulled
off a major merger, and created its own venture capital fund, all
in nine months. Whew.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part. Breakaway has to find a way to
distinguish itself from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the Internet, Wall Street is still in the Lake
Wobegon stage: every company is above average. That will pass. As
in any maturing business, some companies will emerge as winners;
others will fall behind. The list of losers will be a long one, in
part because Wall Street has financed so many competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the space that Breakaway plays in, usually referred to
as e-consulting or e-service. Companies in this field are busy
getting corporate America on the Web. They help clients with
strategy, branding, and the complicated technical issues involved
in becoming a serious e-commerce player.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Mark D'Annolfo covers this turf for the investment bank
of DB Alex. Brown. He says there are 15 companies already on his
radar screen, with another 15 waiting in the wings to go public in
the next few quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity in this field is not a secret,'' agreed Randy
Mehl, an analyst with Robert W. Baird.
</P>
<P>
   Can Breakaway find a way to break away and become a leader in
e-service?
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Brooks says it can. The chief executive of Breakaway
insists his company has a very different focus than most of its
rivals. The competition has targeted strictly big customers, the
Fortune 500 or their international equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks isn't knocking that decision. When a Ford or a General
Motors decides it needs a Web operation, the dollars spent on
consulting will be huge. ``These guys are hunting elephants,''
Brooks said of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Breakaway is after smaller game: medium-sized companies and
emerging firms, most of them dot-coms. Its clients have names like
eRisks.com, JobDirect.com, and VerticalNet. Many of Breakaway's
clients are dot-coms financed by Internet Capital Group, a
Pennsylvania company that owns 40 percent of Breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks says emerging companies have different needs than the
giants. They need more hand-holding, for one thing. They also want
a consultant who can handle everything from soup to nuts. Breakaway
bills itself as a full-service provider. It does strategy,
implementation, and something few of its competitors do: hosting.
</P>
<P>
   For a fee, Breakaway will take over the Web operations for a
client and run them at one of its own computer centers. Unlike
consulting, where the paychecks stop when the job ends, hosting
involves a long-term relationship. ``We like the fact that it
represents a stable revenue stream,'' said David Smith, a money
manager at Loomis Sayles.
</P>
<P>
   Breakaway fans, Smith included, also like the company's
experienced management team. Brooks was an executive at Cambridge
Technology Partners, a big consulting firm. Many of Brooks's
deputies were founders of their own Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also applaud the speed with which Breakaway has come
out of the chute. In January, the company acquired Eggrock
Partners, a Concord consulting firm with a similar mission. The
$252 million deal gave Breakaway more clients, more offices, and a
leg up on late-starting rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal put us a year ahead of schedule,'' crowed Brooks, who
knows that in the world of the Internet, getting there first counts
for an awful lot.
</P>
<P>
   In a critique of Internet companies he wrote last year, Warren
Buffett said that not all fast-growing businesses will prove to be
good investments. The key, he said, ``was determining the
competitive advantage of any given company and above all the
durability of that advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Breakaway have an advantage that will last as rivals, big
and small, invade its turf? So far, Wall Street seems to think it
does. The stock, which debuted at 14 in October, traded Wednesday
at 124 1/8. That translated to a market value of about $2 billion _
not bad for a company that had $10 million in sales in its most
recent quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts concede the stock has had a big run-up, and they would
not be surprised to see it take a break for a while. Still, most
are bullish on Breakaway's long-term prospects; most have a buy
rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks thinks Breakaway is different enough and fast enough to
keep a step ahead of the pack. We'll check back sometime to see if
he's right.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chalk up another win for the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore Networks, a Chelmsford, Mass. firm that went public
last fall, Wednesday blew past Gillette Co. to become the
Massachusetts company with the second-greatest market value.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore ended the day with a market cap of nearly $40 billion,
compared to Gillette's $37.6 billion. Never mind that in the most
recent quarter Sycamore had sales of $29 million, about 1 percent
of Gillette's sales of $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore's optical networking products are hot; Gillette's razor
blades and batteries are not.
</P>
<P>
   With a market cap of $120 billion, EMC Corp., the Hopkinton,
Mass. maker of storage systems, remains the market-value leader in
Massachusetts. EMC moved past Gillette last year.

THE SEPTIC TANK QUANDARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I just moved into a house that has a septic system, with the
usual septic tank and leaching field. Such systems are new to me.
How often should they be pumped out?
</P>
<P>
   PAUL BAMBERY, Acton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. How often? It depends on whom you ask, and how many peple
there are in the family. And, there is little agreement. People who
pump out septic tanks for a living suggest doing it once a year.
Others say that is ridiculous, a ploy to get more work, and suggest
every four or five years. Some say you can go 10 years and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Who's right? They all are; at least they are not technically
wrong. So, compromise. If the system is working properly, have it
pumped every three to five years. Or, do what many septic tank
owners do: Wait until it backs up, which may take many years. The
handyman does not think the latter is a good idea; it happened to
him once, and he does not want it to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My walnut plywood paneling has been up for 30 years and still
looks good, but the veneer is coming up a bit in the vertical
grooves. How can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   HAROLD WHITE, Boxford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the veneer is the full thickness of the plywood, the
paneling needs to be renailed. If the veneer is very thin, you can
apply a bead of adhesive caulk to the groove and press the veneer
back. You can buy most caulks in brown and other colors, and you
should be able to find a near match to the walnut paneling. I find
that PhenoSeal, widely available in hardware stores, is the best.
It is slow to set, but once it does, it holds like a tiger.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I had a white maple hardwood floor installed last spring. Now
there are small openings between the boards, large enough that I
can get a credit card through. The varnish broke at the joints, and
the lines are black. Is there anything I can do to improve this
situation?
</P>
<P>
   TONY CORDEIRO, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Live with it, or have the floors sanded and refinished and
hope for the best. Some hardwood floors open up for no apparent
reason, but there always is a reason. It often happens when the
boards have excessive moisture in them and are at their largest
dimension when they are laid. Also, your boards may have been laid
immediately upon delivery, and not stored in the house for at least
two weeks for them to assume the same moisture as the house. After
your boards were laid, they behaved nicely, until autumn, when they
began to dry out and shrink, causing the separation and the varnish
to break at each joint. I cannot account for the black lines,
except to guess they are simply shadows on the sides of each board.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to have the boards taken up and relaid tight, wait
until next winter, when they are at their dryest and smallest. With
luck, they will stay tight longer than they did originally.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am looking for a small corner medicine cabinet. I have
looked in a few places, without success. Are there any around?
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA McGURL, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a few around, including one that I found in the
Renovators catalog. It may be too big (30 inches high and 22 wide)
for your purpose, but it is the only one I could find. Call
800-659-2211. Another possible source for a corner cabinet is Yield
House.
</P>
<P>
   Your only other option is to build one. The hardest part about
that is the various angles the frame and trim boards must be sawn
at. Come to think of it, the handyman built a corner cabinet that
came out fairly decent, he doesn't mind saying. The point is, if he
can do it, you certainly can.

</P>
<P>
   Q. I had a forced hot-air furnace installed in the attic. Where
can I find a humidifier that will go on the furnace but will not
freeze in winter?
</P>
<P>
   C.B., High and dry
</P>
<P>
   A. The furnace is well insulated, as it should be, being in the
attic, but I don't think a humidifier can be insulated well enough
to keep it from freezing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I don't think it is a good idea to put a furnace in the
attic. No matter how well insulated it is, you cannot insulate
against an open flame, and the uninsulated flame will make the
attic warm, which can lead to ice dams in winter, and resulting
leaks in the house. You are better off, in my opinion, with a
furnace in the basement big enough to heat the whole house, or a
furnace in the living space, a closet, etc. Some people feel that
if the attic is big enough and well ventilated, a furnace there is
all right. I disgree.
</P>
<P>
   As for a humidifier, I suggest a console appliance, one that
will handle a whole floor. With such a console, you can keep an eye
on it, judge how much water you are introducing into the house, and
keep the water sweet and suitable for humidifying.

CLINTON FATIGUE ISN'T NONSENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sean Wilentz, a history professor at Princeton and the chairman
of the university's American studies program, made himself a hero
to some _ and a laughingstock to others _ when he defended Bill
Clinton during the House impeachment hearings in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against the president did not rise to the level of
impeachment, Wilentz lectured the congressmen, and only ``the
zealots and the fanatics'' could think they did. This was not a
subject on which reasonable people could disagree. ``Vote in favor
of impeachment,'' he warned the committee, and ``history will track
you down and condemn you for your cravenness.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Wilentz is back, and still in high dudgeon. This time his
target is ``Clinton fatigue'' _ the widely held belief that
Americans are weary of the incumbent president and are desperate
for new leaders who can speak plainly and behave honorably. In
back-to-back columns for The New Republic, Wilentz slams the many
commentators and editorialists who have dared to suggest that
Clinton fatigue is fueling John McCain's insurgency or that Al Gore
may suffer politically from his association with the president.
``An utter hoax,'' Wilentz calls such talk. ``Bloviation
masquerading as political science.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he says, The Washington Post's David Broder spouts
nonsense when he writes that ``the character question'' will loom
large in the campaign. Bill Kristol and David Brooks of The Weekly
Standard are ``in denial'' if they honestly imagine that McCain is
being buoyed by ``the swell of anti-Clinton sentiment.'' .
</P>
<P>
   It is all nonsense, he fumes. Voters are not tired of Clinton.
They are not looking for an antidote to his slickness. There is no
fatigue, no disrepute. On the contrary: The man in the White House
is stunningly popular. Unlike every other president since Harry
Truman, he has not seen his popularity drop during his final years
in office. ``Clinton is the great exception,'' Wilentz writes. He
points to one recent opinion poll that puts the president's
approval ratings at ``an astonishing 66 percent.'' Far from being
fed up with Clinton, Americans love the guy _ so much so, the
professor argues, that were it not for the 22d Amendment, he could
have won a third term.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one problem with Wilentz's reading of the polls:
He didn't read enough of the polls.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Clinton's performance as president, his numbers
are indeed sky-high. But when the public is asked to assess Clinton
the man _ and this Wilentz acknowledges only in passing _ his
numbers plunge below sea level.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, two scholars of public opinion have just pulled
those numbers together in a paper for the American Enterprise
Institute. And really, say Seymour Martin Lipset and Karlyn Bowman,
there is no way around it: ``The difference between views of
Clinton's performance as president and his personal character
amounts to a chasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider some of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey last June, the Pew Research Center asked, ``Would
you like to see the next president have personal qualities similar
to Bill Clinton, or would you like to see a president who has
different personal qualities?'' Eighty-three percent said they
hoped for something different; only 12 percent wanted more of the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Clinton mostly be remembered,'' Gallup asked in 1998,
``for his accomplishments or his involvement in personal scandal?''
Scandal: 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of how you feel about his political views'' _
Gallup again, 1999 _ ``would you say you respect President Clinton,
or don't you feel that way?'' Don't feel that way: 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten times during 1998,'' note Lipset and Bowman, ``ABC News
and the Washington Post asked whether the statement `He has high
personal moral and ethical standards' applied to Bill Clinton. No
more than 3 in 10 ever said that it did.'' On 15 separate
occasions, the CBS/New York Times poll asked whether the president
``shared the moral values most Americans try to live by.'' Only
once did a majority say he did.
</P>
<P>
   If this isn't Clinton fatigue, it is an uncanny facsimile.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some pollsters have measured Clinton fatigue _
literally. The ABC/Washington Post poll asked respondents whether
they agree or disagree with the statement ``I'm just plain tired of
Bill Clinton.'' Last September and again last month, majorities
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the pundits who are in denial, not this time. Not only
are Americans fed up with this president who has done so much to
degrade the public discourse, they wish he had never been elected
in the first place. If the 1992 election were held again, asked a
Fox News poll last March, would you vote for Clinton or Bush?
Remarkably, 58 percent said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential campaigns are complex affairs; the 2000 race will
not turn on ``Clinton fatigue'' alone. But that fatigue is
unmistakable. As Americans go about the business of choosing a new
president, it will be a priority for many to get the sour taste of
the old one out of their mouths.

OF LOVE AND NORTHERN LIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories _ Winter sojourners used to
be nearly as rare as flamingos in this frigid outback. And then the
Japanese suddenly decided that there is nothing hotter than
nuzzling beneath the pulsating glow of the aurora borealis, even
with the mercury tickling 30 below.
</P>
<P>
   It's the call of romance as much as the fantastic show of the
northern lights that's bringing Japanese visitors by the thousands
to this gold-rush settlement in the coldest months of winter, even
though, for many of these travelers, the romance seems to occur
mainly in the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I dreamed my fiance would bring me,'' said Keiko
Sugihara, 27, cheerfully conceding: ``Except I have no fiance, or
even a boyfriend. So I came with some other office ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's the idea that counts _ and the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights are very romantic,'' Sugihara said. ``And there is
the excitement of a frozen wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the number of Japanese coming to the Northwest
Territories in the dead of winter was too small to bother counting,
certainly no more than a few dozen. Now they're pouring in by the
jetload. This season _ the prime time for viewing aurora borealis
extends from December through March _ more than 10,000 will have
descended on Yellowknife (pop. 17,500).
</P>
<P>
   The northern lights are shimmering displays of light that dance
across the night skies when the earth's magnetic field interacts
with charged solar particles and gases in the upper atmosphere.
It's a sight to behold, but jaded Yellowknifers are far more amazed
by the arrival of so many Japanese _ and refuse to believe the
visitors have come simply to oooh and aaahh.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no. Not sightseeing!'' said Lam Pham, a
Vietnamese-born taxi driver by now completely local in his bemused
regard for the Japanese hordes. ``They come to make love in the
snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Yellowknifers are adamant that Japanese believe a child
conceived in the open air under the aurora will enjoy great
fortune. So they journey to Canada's north, year-round denizens
insist, to, well, procreate in the snowdrifts. That, almost every
Yellowknifer will rush to tell you, explains the tourist rush.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tale told with gusto and shocking detail.
</P>
<P>
   Except no one is more shocked by it than the Japanese
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think _ no! That's crazy!'' gasped Yumiko Sato, 30, an
airline safety supervisor from Osaka. ``In the snow? At these
temperatures? How weird. Are we polar bears?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Japanese, with giggles and grins, call the territory a
``romance destination.'' And gritty Yellowknife does seem to
attract surprising numbers of honeymooners and sweethearts,
although the tourist ranks also include plenty of standard-issue,
Nikon-wielding sightseers of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Sato arrived with beau in tow, explaining matter-of-factly:
``Oh, yes, we wanted a special place so he can propose to me.
Tonight, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Japanese are fast putting their mark on a
mining town more used to prospectors, bush pilots and _ as
territorial capital _ bureaucrats posted from Ottawa. These days,
the saloons are stocked with sake and Sapporo beer, cafe menus come
printed in Kanji characters, and shopkeepers greet browsers with
calls of ``konnichi-wa!''
</P>
<P>
   Tour outfitters are reveling in the aurora boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is up more than hundredfold,'' said Jared Minty,
operations manager for Raven Tours Ltd., which caters primarily to
Japanese tour groups and which vigorously markets the northern
lights in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   `It's extrordinary,'' he said. ```For Japanese, the night view
from Yellowknife is the eighth wonder of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Yellowknife is among the best places on the planet for
watching the otherworldly arcs playing hundreds of miles into the
blackness. (Others are in Alaska, Norway, Finland, and Labrador.)
Tour operators say that visitors have a more than 90 percent chance
of catching the view, although clouds can cause serious
disappointment and sometimes _ even on clear nights _ the lights
fail to show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, because of atmospheric conditions, there are better and
more regular sightings here than at the North Pole,'' said Minty of
Raven Tours.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko Sugihara made the journey with three office pals, all from
Kyoto and all outfitted in white thermal boots and heavily
insulated red parkas and snowpants. The effect was more Michelin
Man than Versace, but the young women seemed delighted to look so
rugged.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, they'd need the padding on this bitter night in which
they bundled aboard buses with scores of other Nihonjin for the
bumpy 30 mile ride to Prelude Lake, an icelocked expanse offering
vast panoramas of night sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are not the most demonstrative of folk. But as
eerie curtains of green, violet and white light rippled across the
northern heavens, shrieks and moans and ecstatic cries rolled over
the stunted spruce taiga.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so great! Oh beautiful!'' shouted Hiro Ototake, 29, a
pharmacist from Otsu who'd flown to Yellowknife with his new bride,
Emiko, for a bracing subarctic honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   The couple alternated between tight embraces of each other and
tightening their parka hoods into the tiniest of apertures from
which their noses glowed and their eyes gleamed happily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the most romantic place I can imagine,'' said Emiko,
who, like many Nihonjin on the excursion, also wore a surgeon's
mask over her nose and mouth. ``So my lungs don't freeze.''
</P>
<P>
   The brutal cold is just part of the grand adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come to the far north in winter, you want to experience
the intensity of the Canadian climate,'' said Hiyoshi Abe, 51,
editor of a trade magazine for the metal industry.
</P>
<P>
   Most Japanese spend only three days in Yellowknife before
heading back, during which time they feast on caribou stew, trundle
across the tundra on dogsleds, splurge on Inuit carvings and _ with
belly-shaking hilarity _ pose for snapshots beside the two very
basic outhouses at Prelude Lake. The waterless facilities seem to
astound the highly urban guests.
</P>
<P>
   The northern lights have occupied a special place in the
Japanese heart for centuries and figure in the nation's folklore.
The spectacle was once routinely visible from the island of
Hokkaido, but a slight shift in the magnetic North Pole and a
not-so-slight increase in pollution have made the aurora
exceedingly rare even in northernmost Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese people have a reverence for nature, even though few
of us live close to nature,'' said Abe. ``So to travel such a great
distance to see these lights seems reasonable. In that sense, it's
certainly a journey of love.''

RIGHT-WING VOICES IN DISHARMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Day after day, conservative talk radio star Rush Limbaugh rails
against Republican insurgent John McCain, assailing the traitorous
``McCain Mutiny'' as a remnant of the moderate ``Rockefeller-Ford
wing of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the dial, however, another syndicated talk host
with equally conservative credentials _ G. Gordon Liddy _ is
backing the Arizona senator. ``What we really need is a mensch,''
says Liddy. ``And McCain is a mensch.''
</P>
<P>
   If the McCain-George W. Bush fight has triggered a civil war
inside the Republican Party, it has also fractured any sense of
unity among the conservative media. While the mainstream press is
widely accused of being too enamored of McCain, the Arizona
senator's candidacy has created a fault line in the media debate on
the right, generating disbelief, passion, and plenty of arguments
among ideological allies.
</P>
<P>
   At The Weekly Standard, publisher William Kristol and senior
editor David Brooks wrote a story embracing McCain's bid as a
``political phenomenon with potential appeal to the country as a
whole.'' Fred Barnes, the magazine's executive editor, attacked
McCain for not ``acting like a regular Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican race for president ``certainly is dividing The
Weekly Standard. No doubt about that,'' says Barnes, who also
cohosts ``The Beltway Boys'' on the Fox News Channel. ``It is
easily the most divisive thing in a Republican race that I can
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   And the battle rages. The editorial pages of two right-leaning
tabloids _ the Boston Herald and New York Post _ enthusiastically
endorsed McCain. The editorials in the conservative Washington
Times, clearly favoring Bush, cuff McCain around regularly.
</P>
<P>
   In the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal, a column by
Paul Gigot disdainfully comparing McCain to Jimmy Carter was
situated right next to one by Dorothy Rabinowitz conjuring up warm
comparisons between the senator and Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   CNN analyst and Weekly Standard writer Tucker Carlson, who
admires McCain, recently returned to his office after an absence to
find scores of e-mails attacking his fondness for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   The media war over McCain and Bush, he says ``sort of divides
along the following lines _ those who like to see the finger given
to the Establishment and those who don't.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to see the Bush supporters as representing the
buttoned-down conservative Establishment and McCain fans as the
wilder and crazier rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Herald editorial page editor Rachelle Cohen refers to the
pro-Bush view as ``the sort of Wall Street Journal . . .
business-page kind of conservatism.'' (The Journal's rock-ribbed
editorial page makes no secret of its dislike for McCain.)
</P>
<P>
   ``To some Republicans, there is the Bill Kristol Weekly Standard
crowd,'' counters Helle Bering, editorial page editor of The
Washington Times. ``They've been looking for an alternative to the
Republican Establishment for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   R. Emmett ``Bob'' Tyrrell Jr., editor in chief of The American
Spectator says the rancorous warfare among conservatives ``is a
sign of some sort of psychological disorder.'' Both candidates, he
says, are ``propounding principles and policies that are certainly
within the mainstream of conservative,'' politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Spectator executive editor Wlady Pleszczynski, who recently
wrote a piece on the magazine's Web site accusing McCain of
seducing the media, is ``annoyed by a lot of this (McCain support).
He's a very smooth-talking, schmoozy fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the debate among conservative media types seems to
mirror the broader disagreements in the electorate. Bush supporters
feel more comfortable with his policies while McCain fans think
character trumps ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have issue differences with McCain,'' says Liddy. ``Nobody
cares. What they want is a real man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Herald's Cohen sounds the same note. ``Having looked this
guy in the eye, we said `we really like this guy,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Citing differences on tax policy and campaign finance reform,
National Review editor Richard Lowry says, ``We have a lot of
problems with where (McCain's) positioned himself . . . I think
McCain has never had deep political convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have trouble understanding the McCain appeal,'' echoes
Barnes. ``On domestic policy, he's one big fuzzball.''
</P>
<P>
   Above the fray, however, are a few notable conservative voices
that are sitting this one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is not a conservative's dream. The other is just a flub,''
says The (Manchester) Union Leader's editorial page editor,
Bernadette Malone Connolly. ``For those of us in the ivory tower,
there's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   And MSNBC and radio talk host Oliver North blames both
candidates for a nasty, mudslinging campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pox on both their houses,'' he says. ``My advice to both of
them is to cool it.'' In this campaign, North adds, ``I'm one of
those guys in the religious right that's agnostic.''

CONGOLESE PERSEVERE AGAINST WAR'S RAVAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOMA, Congo _ There is church on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise Mama-Eleye Balize passes her days in the monotony of
surviving. The 25-year old works in a crowded marketplace grinding
cassava roots into flour. The hut where she works is filled with
sweet odors of rot from a nearby garbage heap. Flour dust powders
her eyebrows and high cheekbones, so that her face looks like the
image in a photographic negative.
</P>
<P>
   Balize's life fits the portrait of a people trampled by ethnic
hatred, greed, and thirst for power _ the scourges that fuel the
ongoing war in Congo. A young mother of three children under the
age of four, she earns maybe $5 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband has been jobless for two years. The family eats only
one meager meal of beans and corn a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't allow myself to be tired,'' Balize says, her infant
pulling at her breast, unsated. She can't produce enough milk. ``If
I get tired, there won't be food.''
</P>
<P>
   Six foreign armies and nine rebel factions wage a war of
multiple fronts and confusing subplots, violating their own
cease-fire and pillaging Congo's mineral treasures. The United
Nations makes modest plans to intervene, while the ordinary people
of this vast country endure with improbable grace.
</P>
<P>
   The Congolese have weathered colonialism, dictatorship,
invasions, rebellions and counterrebellions. Their economy has
collapsed. Light bulbs are scarce, AK-47s ubiquitous. Yet those
with jobs rise daily to work, even though they have not seen wages
in months or years. And those without jobs rise to look for work,
forming hopeful crowds daily outside the compounds of foreign
relief organizations and the few factories still operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the central paradox of Congo: No one has been paid in
two years, but everyone is still alive,'' said Alexandre
Liesbekind, a senior representative of the International Committee
of the Red Cross. ``In French there is a good word _ pauperization.
That is what's happening to the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen months after the outbreak of fighting, the war in Congo
has stalled and splintered. Rebel movements backed by Rwanda and
Uganda have marched halfway across the country from the east, while
the Congolese military, backed by Zimbabwe and Angola, holds the
west. Neither side seems capable, or particularly driven, to push
for total victory.
</P>
<P>
   The instability has encouraged numerous smaller conflicts and
freestyle pillaging. Two related ethnic groups in the northeast,
the Hema and Lendu, have been slaughtering each other over land.
Rebel and government forces from neighboring Burundi have taken
their war across the border into southeastern Congo. Nearly all the
foreign forces are hauling off timber, diamonds, gold, and precious
ores.
</P>
<P>
   Into this climate the UN Security Council last week agreed to
deploy a small mission to monitor the cease-fire signed by the
belligerents last July in Lusaka, Zambia. But that decision has not
made people here any more optimistic about peace. The operation
will bring in just 5,537 observers and protection forces in a
country roughly the size of western Europe. The four sites where
the force will deploy are separated by vast expanses of
impenetrable rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny force will have no power to impose sanctions for
cease-fire violations or disarm rebel factions that have not signed
the Lusaka accord. With such a limited mandate, regional security
experts worry it will only solidify the current de facto partition
of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operation is totally meaningless,'' said Patrick
Mazimhaka, chief peace negotiator for neighboring Rwanda. ``It
would take three years minimum to begin disarming and separating
the armies and factions under a meaningful UN military operation.
We have to set up centers to collect arms, create buffer zones, and
supervise repatriation. The answer is greater engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda's stance does not bode well for the peacekeeping effort's
success, because the tiny nation's security concerns lie at the
crux of the war.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, when extremist Hutu killed
roughly 800,000 people, the majority of them members of the rival
Tutsi people, the killers fled into vast UN refugee camps just
outside Goma in eastern Congo. Most of the refugees were
repatriated in 1996 and the camps closed, but an unknown number of
Hutu militias, known as interahamwe, and former Hutu soldiers fled
into the bush.
</P>
<P>
   These forces, estimated to number in the tens of thousands, were
never disarmed. They carried out repeated cross-border killing
sprees against Tutsi, prompting Rwanda, with Uganda's help, to
launch back-to-back wars against its giant neighbor: the first in
1996 against then-Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko for harboring
the Hutu extremists; then again in 1998 against Congo's president,
Laurent Kabila, for doing the same. Although Rwanda signed the
cease-fire last year, it won't drop its guard until Hutu extremists
in exile are disarmed and repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   Through the gloom of povery and war, however, some light shines
through.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated violations by all sides, the warring parties in
Congo agreed last week to hold themselves to the Lusaka cease-fire
as of March 1. Whether they do will determine how soon the UN
peacekeeping force arrives. And Kabila's most important ally,
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, is under serious pressure to
retire after voters delivered a stunning rebuke in a referendum two
weeks ago, partly in response to Mugabe's costly military adventure
in Congo, where he has sent 11,000 troops to Kabila's defense.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary obstacle to peace remains the interahamwe and
former Hutu soldiers, and there is no solution in sight. Many have
been integrated into the Congolese and Zimbabwean armies, as well
as the rebel forces fighting against the Tutsi-led government in
Burundi. And as long as they have the means to wage war, Rwanda
won't stand down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can we do? Our job is not yet done in Congo,'' said
Mazimhaka, Rwanda's negotiator. ``Our job is to bring our people
back, hopefully without their guns. We have to dig in deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   What does all this have to do with the price of beans in
Mama-Eleye's marketplace? Actually, quite a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Set on the black volcanic northern shore of Lake Kivu, Goma sits
at the crossroads of this, Africa's most complicated war. Its
people's story is a chronology of woes that has brought destitution
even to those who were once prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   Kasuku wa Ngexo was a wealthy man a few years ago. He had three
farms in the rolling hills outside Goma where 6,000 cattle and 250
horses fattened themselves on kikuyu grass and clover. He produced
cheese, butter, and beef. He also had a tea factory in town and a
game lodge in the nearby Virunga mountains, where tourists could
see elephants and chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't poor,'' he said. ``I'm broke now.''
</P>
<P>
   The destruction came in waves. Hordes of Rwandans poured through
this border town after the genocide in 1994, prompting the United
Nations to establish huge refugee camps. The refugees stole cattle
and set up butchering sites inside the camps, according to reports
by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. So did soldiers hired to
run security in the camps.
</P>
<P>
   The first war started in 1996. As Kabila's rebels, backed by
Rwanda and Uganda, advanced, Mobutu's troops fled, looting cars,
houses, and factories. Extremist Rwandan Hutu joined the mayhem.
Two years later it happened again. The second war started, and this
time Kabila's troops pillaged as they fled.
</P>
<P>
   There were 450,000 cattle in the Goma area six years ago,
according to the local farmers cooperative. Today the herds are
gone. Lost too are 200,000 goats, 200,000 sheep, 100,000 pigs, and
hundreds of horses. Eighty percent of the wildlife in Rwindi
national park has been slaughtered, including elephants and hippos.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cars in town are gone, most of the factories idle.
Hotels are bankrupt, owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in
unpaid bills by the Rally for Congolese Democracy, the main rebel
faction based here. Banks are broke. Farther out, farms lie fallow,
coffee plantations neglected. No tourists come. Until the Rwandan
Hutu go home, people here say, it is too dangerous to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Goma hums with its own economic illogic. No one seems to
have money, yet everyone survives by selling things to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Kabuo peddles bananas at the marketplace, not far from
Mama-Eleye's flour hut. Like everyone who sells produce here, she
travels to another town 50 miles away, twice a week, to buy
bananas. She barely makes enough to cover her transport costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very hard,'' she said, her forehead tightening into a
deep cleft.
</P>
<P>
   ``True,'' Ngexo shrugged. ``But you have to be optimistic. It's
my country. I'm a Congolese.''

   BOSTON _ What do Duke Ellington, Alan Greenspan, and Aristotle
have in common? Genius, yes. (We'll grant Al some leeway here.)
Beyond that, each is a featured player in a popular course being
offered on a Boston campus this semester.
</P>
<P>
   One course is 30 years old and imaginatively combines community
service with classroom study. Another is a year old and like its
subject, the stock market, could scarcely be trendier. A third is
brand new and stylishly untrendy: a course on early American jazz,
taught by a Mozart scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The courses, chosen not entirely at random, sample the variety
and popularity of what's being taught at area colleges at any given
time.

<P>
   Literature and Arts B-80: The Swing Era
</P>
<P>
   Examines American jazz from the early 1930s to bebop. Considers
sociological issues and the relationship of swing-era jazz to
classical music and popular song, to place swing's achievements
into a broader historical and musical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I call a mean tune!'' Robert Levin shouts out over
the closing bars of ``Hocus Pocus,'' a 1934 Fletcher Henderson cut,
featuring the incomparable Coleman Hawkins on tenor sax. Levin then
fires up a CD dub of a Louis Armstrong recording he inherited from
his father, a jazz buff.
</P>
<P>
   For the next hour, the perpetual-motion Harvard prof cannot seem
to stand _ or sit _ still. Bouncing over to the piano, Levin bangs
outs a Bach prelude followed by some Jelly Roll Morton licks.
Strutting around the Sanders Theatre stage in front of 560
students, he dips his shoulders and wags his fingers in classic
hepcat style to a peppery clarinet solo by Buster Bailey. Close
your eyes and you can almost smell the Cotton Club circa 1937.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're figuring out what makes this music tick as well as
connecting to it emotionally,'' Levin tells his audience, a mixed
bag of Harvard students and AARP types who are auditing.
</P>
<P>
   For Levin, a classically trained keyboardist who studied with
Nadia Boulanger, ``The Swing Era'' represents a chance not only to
branch out into more of a pop-music idiom but to expose a younger
generation, in a serious and scholarly way, to the recordings he
grooved on as a kid in Queens, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple reason I'm doing this is that I'm crazy about the
music,'' says Levin, whose piano-thumping lecture style has been
packing them in all semester. ``But that's not reason enough. The
fact is, this is the first truly mass popular music in US history.
I want students to get a real insight into the aesthetics of swing,
the way they'd view a painting in a fine arts course or read a poem
in a literature class.''
</P>
<P>
   The course benefited from an early buzz around campus, in part
because Levin also teaches a popular course on chamber music and is
famous for his energy and showmanship. For most of the students in
L&AMP;A B-80, Bix Beiderbecke and Benny Goodman belong as much to
ancient musical history as Beethoven and Liszt do. But as they're
learning, American music didn't start with Jimi Hendrix and Miles
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah Trierweiler, a freshman from Denver, was initially drawn
to Levin's course because it fills a core requirement. ``I listen
to mostly KISS-108 stuff,'' says Trierweiler, ``but not a lot of
jazz. This looked like fun, though. Levin is pretty quirky, too. He
dances around a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Bolton, a junior from Alabama, grew up near New
Orleans listening to '60s and '70s rock. Now, she digs
jazz-influenced groups like Phish. ``I wanted to understand the
background more,'' says Bolton, who concedes that Levin's use of
terminology is ``tough to follow at times.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart and soul of Levin's lectures are close audio analyses
of classic swing tracks. Lectures on Goodman and Ellington
incorporated repeated playings of ``King Porter Stomp'' and ``Mood
Indigo,'' performed by different bands with different arrangements.
Like any good jazzman, though, Levin is an inveterate improviser. A
discourse on Ellington's recording of ``Take the A Train,'' for
instance, segued into a brief history of the Manhattan subway
system.
</P>
<P>
   Says Levin, ``My secret goal is to build students' listening
libraries, the way others bought `Rubber Soul' or `Born in the
USA.' Because once you've got these recordings, you'll listen to
them. I'm on a cultural crusade here.'' Move over, Bruce.

</P>
<P>
   PL 088-089: Person and Social Responsibility (PULSE)
</P>
<P>
   Course requirements include 10 to 12 hours per week of community
service. In light of classic philosophical and theological texts,
students address the relationship of self and society, the nature
of community, the mystery of suffering, and the practical
difficulties of developing a just society.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All things being equal, there is almost no chance Kristin
Kusmierz would have crossed paths with Michael Brady during her
college years. Or wanted to. Kusmierz is a BC junior from North
Kingstown, R.I. Brady is a 44-year-old, HIV-positive substance
abuser from Scituate who never went to college and who is ``pretty
much on my last chance right now,'' Brady says.
</P>
<P>
   BC's PULSE course is nothing if not a great equalizer, though.
And so one day last week, Kusmierz and Brady took a stroll together
around Shattuck Hospital in Jamaica Plain, where Brady is a patient
in the Living and Recovering Community program (LARC) and Kusmierz
works as a student volunteer through the Victory Programs agency.
The two found more in common than either might have dreamed of four
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not like a conversation between a college student and a
dope fiend,'' Brady recalled afterward. ``We talked about the
virus, about substance abuse and her maybe going into human
services after she graduates. It's nice to hear what a student has
to say to someone who's been on the street for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusmierz nodded. ``To actually see people living with the virus
teaches you more than any book can,'' she said, seated in a cramped
hospital conference room with two fellow PULSE students and half a
dozen LARC patients. ``In class, we focus on how to live your life,
how to develop a system of meaning that builds a community. It's
much easier to internalize something when you read it and see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusmierz is one of 300 BC students enrolled in the program this
year, continuing a tradition established in 1970. In weekly section
meetings, students discuss writings by Aristotle, Rousseau, and
Locke along with contemporary authors like Charles Taylor and
Jonathan Kozol. They also keep detailed journals, diaries that
often provoke soul-searching examinations of what personal and
social responsibility truly mean.
</P>
<P>
   The course has seldom been more popular. About 150 students were
turned away this year for space reasons, despite the heavy reading
load and community-service requirement. Program director Donald
McMenamin says word of mouth is his best recruiting tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids hear from other students who say it's the most
important course they've taken at BC,'' says McMenamin. ``They
start out thinking they're going to change the world, and they
leave realizing how much they've been changed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   In class, McMenamin and his colleagues push students to relate
what they're reading to issues they've encountered in the field.
Thus a recent discussion of Taylor's ``The Ethics of Authenticity''
prompted McMenamin to ponder the relationship between the
individual and society, asking students if there were anything like
a shared definition of the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does your concept of the dream correspond to that of the
people in the placement agencies where you work?'' he inquired.
``If the good life is going to be achieved,'' he argued, ``all the
voices must be at the table. If we exclude some of those voices, we
risk impoverishing our notion of what is authentic.''

CLASS LETS TEENS ANALYZE THE MESSAGE BEHIND THE BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SANDY COLEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Poet Corey Cokes is standing in a classroom at New
Mission High School, rocking, moving side to side, sweeping and
swooping slender hands as he fires off rhythmic messages in poems:
</P>
<P>
   The ``n'' word is not a name to let loose on your own people, he
tells them in ``Trainspotting.''
</P>
<P>
   People and things are not always what they appear to be, he lets
them know in ``Snapshot,'' touching on the abuse of his mother he
witnessed as a child:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   sistah Sarah's mascara, well, it ran away with tears
</P>
<P>
   you see, for years she has maintained that
</P>
<P>
   miss congeniality smile while in denial of her man's hands
</P>
<P>
   at work she's a wife, a mother &AMP;
</P>
<P>
   a professonal...liar.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Students at the school in the city's Roxbury neighborhood sit so
still and quiet, a cough coming from down the hall sounds like
thunder in here. They breathe in Cokes's words like fresh air,
learning the lessons teacher Damon Smith has been trying to get
across in his hip hop class.
</P>
<P>
   Words are power. You can make them hurt. You can make them heal.
Cokes does both as he rages against racism, black self-hatred,
domestic violence and taking life at face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very critical of what he sees. I want students to stop
and be critical,'' said Smith, who created the hip hop class _
``Beats, Rhymes and Life'' _ taking the name from an album by
former hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who owns more than 300 hip hop CDs, has been an avid fan
of the music since the late 1970s when it emerged, rooted mainly in
break dancing, graffiti expression and deejaying. That was long
before the genre became today's consumer-driven cultural phenomenon
shaping everything from speech patterns to fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And because hip hop has become such an intregal part of the
lives of youths, Smith developed the class a year ago to engage
students and teach them about writing, politics, communication,
consumerism and anything else that fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their world revolves around that,'' said the 27-year-old
teacher. ``They connect very well to the music. . . . I wanted my
students to be really critical of this culture and not just take it
and accept it blindly.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaria Johnson, 18, was doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Before the class, she didn't really think about the lyrics of
songs. ``If I was in the car or something, I would know the words
but I wasn't hearing,'' said Johnson, who signed up for the class
to get a better understanding of how hip hop affects society.
</P>
<P>
   The class, which requires students to pick apart lyrics and
analyze them, has taught her to dig deeper beyond the groove of a
good beat. ``We'll listen to a song, and we have to have evidence
for why we like a song,'' Johnson said. ``We can't just say I like
Tupac. We have to say I like the bass line or the lyrics, or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Ruggs, 15, has been playing around with a microphone and
rap lyrics since he was 5 years old. He draws smiles from
classmates because he constantly talks about an album he will
someday make. Smith's class was a natural draw, he says, a chance
to take a serious look at a hobby. And, besides ``my parents,
they're old. They've got those old jams.''
</P>
<P>
   But, old jams also have a place in Smith's lesson plan. He opens
the course using Marvin Gaye's ``Mercy Mercy Me'' and ``What's
Going On,'' to show students the timelessness of some words and
music.
</P>
<P>
   He knows the next question he throws out will spark strong
reactions: Will hip hop last as long?
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of several weeks, students will try to answer
that question through a variety of assignments, including writing
at least six papers. They dissect song lyrics, explore songs that
best represent their lives, and discuss who are the top 10 hip hop
artists and why.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our students don't necessarily like to write,'' said
Smith. ``Students in the hip hop class choose to be there and they
know there is a heavy writing piece to it. So, it's an avenue for
them to open up. . . . Rather than writing about `The Grapes of
Wrath,' I have them writing about a song by Jay-Z.''
</P>
<P>
   It's working said 17-year-old Marc Auguste, who writes gospel
raps. ``If I have to write about something, I have a better chance
of putting work into it if I'm interested. And I'm deep into this
class.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Smith admits it doesn't work for all students. There are
those who don't pass because they don't want to write. But, ``they
love to talk about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conversation drives the class.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the topic was on the role of women as artists and
people in the hip hop world.
</P>
<P>
   To fuel debate, Smith shows a video of Rah Digga and Busta
Rhymes singing ``Dirty Harriet,'' which featured a powerful,
shotgun delivery and plenty of the buttock-shaking, breast-baring
women who have become a staple in many videos.
</P>
<P>
   Smith then opens the conversation by having students read the
lyrics of a 1987 Slick Rick song, ``Treat Her Like a Prostitute,''
to show how not much has changed when it comes to degrading women
in music.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to say you don't have to treat no chick like a
queen unless you got to know her,'' said Auguste, adjusting the
black knit cap on his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have said it better, but I agree with the message,''
adds Johnson. ``You have to get to know someone. He's giving a
message my mother would give. . . . I think he's just saying don't
give a girl your all. . . . I wouldn't treat a guy like he's the
king of the earth until he deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a table before a dozen students, Smith asks: ``Are we
looking at women with even a baseline of respect? In this song, is
Slick Rick talking about a select group of women or all women? . .
. This is from 14 years ago. Now is a new day. We have Lauryn Hill.
We've got Eve. But, where do women fit?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at it,'' responds Johnson, ``it's just like
society. What is the role of women in society? It's a society
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith agrees. ``Hip hop is kind of a mirror of society. But, it
could be different. It should be different. Why isn't it? Because
we're not critical enough.''

&HT;     JUDGE RESCHEDULES HEARING ON NEWSPAPER MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge has rescheduled a hearing on a
lawsuit that seeks to block the Hearst Corp., owner of the San
Francisco Examiner, from purchasing its larger morning rival, the
San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker moved the hearing on the suit
brought by Clint Reilly, an unsuccessful candidate for mayor, from
March 23 to April 13 due to scheduling conflicts, according to the
office of Joseph M. Alioto, who is Reilly's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has announced plans to buy the Chronicle for a reported
$660 million and merge it with the Examiner if a buyer for the
afternoon newspaper cannot be found. Reilly's suit contends that
such a merger would result in higher advertising and subscription
rates and thus harm consumers. It also claims the purchase would
violate federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has denied those contentions and claims the proposed
merger of San Francisco's two dailies would benefit consumers by
boosting competition between newspapers in Bay Area suburbs and
between electronic media. Gary Halling, Hearst's lawyer, has asked
the court to dismiss the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The April 13 hearing will be on Reilly's request that Walker
enter a preliminary injunction barring Hearst's purchase of the
Chronicle, pending a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst is trying to sell the Examiner and says it has had
several inquiries. Reilly has expressed interest in buying the
paper and has met with Hearst executives to discuss it, Alioto
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's proposed purchase of the Chronicle was announced in
August and has been under review by the antitrust division of the
U.S. Department of Justice since then. The two newspapers operate
under a federally approved joint operating agreement, through which
they share publishing expenses but maintain separate news
operations.

CHILDREN OF GAY PARENTS FARE BEST AMID HONESTY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the 3-year-old daughter of a lesbian couple flew for the
first time, the preschooler struck up a conversation with the woman
in the seat behind them. ``Who are you traveling with?'' the
parents heard the woman ask their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two moms,'' the 3-year-old answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is your real mom?'' the woman replied.
</P>
<P>
   The child was incredulous. ``Do you believe in ghosts!?'' she
asked. ``They're both real!''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of social worker Jade McGleughlin's favorite
anecdotes and not just because it makes her chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything she can think of, it illustrates two points
widely agreed on by professionals who study children raised by
same-sex parents. The first is how accepting and matter-of-fact
young children are about their family's differences. The second is
how important it is for parents to be open and truthful about those
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children's interaction with a culture that is homophobic
impacts parenting every step along the way,'' says McGleughlin.
``They don't just need practical strategies; they need inner
strength that comes from feeling secure within their family.''
</P>
<P>
   Put another way: Children fare best when there are no secrets.
</P>
<P>
   For the estimated 6 to 14 million children in the United States
who are being raised by same-sex parents, this isn't always so,
says Manhattan psychologist April Martin, the nation's foremost
clinician specializing in gay and lesbian family issues.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them were born to heterosexual couples and have been
raised by a homosexual couple after a divorce. If they are
struggling not only with the split-up of the family, not only with
a parent's changed identity, but also with a secret, ``this is a
child in distress,'' says Martin. She is the author of ``The
Lesbian and Gay Parenting Handbook'' (HarperCollins).
</P>
<P>
   When a parent's sexuality is hidden from a child, he senses
something is wrong; lacking information, he fills in with his
imagination, which is often worse than the truth: ``Dad must be
sick or dying.'' When the family story is hidden from the world, it
becomes a source of shame: `` `There's something wrong with my
family' typically evolves into `There's something wrong with me,'
'' says social worker Jennifer Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a child's sense of shame can be so deep that Firestone
counsels partners not to become parents unless they are willing to
be open. Firestone is the founder of Alternative Family Matters, a
counseling and resource agency, and leads workshops for prospective
lesbian and gay parents at Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For partners who can't be out for fear of losing custody or a
job, she urges at least being open with your child. Otherwise, says
McGleughlin, ``children have no way to voice their distress about
the way the world is treating them.'' McGleughlin is the founder
and codirector of the Center for Alternative Families, also in
Cambridge, and an instructor at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The sooner the better
</P>
<P>

<P>
   If you have left a heterosexual marriage, a good rule of thumb
is to tell a child as soon as possible that you are gay, no matter
what his age, says Martin. For instance, a mother might say:
``Something I have discovered about myself is that I love women.
I'm not involved with anyone now, but I might be and you might have
questions and feelings about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time (or in preschool, if your child has been raised
since birth by you and a same-sex partner), give a child the
language he needs, for instance: `` `Hetero' means `different' in
Latin, and `sexual' refers to gender, so heterosexual parents are
parents of different sexes, a man and a woman. `Homo' means `same,'
so homosexual parents are two men or two women.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are partners whose child has been with you from birth,
begin then to tell him his story, not just how he came to be born
but also that there are different kinds of families, some with a
mom and a dad, some with a stepparent, some with two moms or two
dads, some with grandparents. Talking about this with relatives and
strangers as well as with your baby is as much for you as it is for
your child, notes Martin: ``For many parents, it takes some getting
used to to speak these words out loud. You need to build up your
muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Establishing your own comfort level comes in handy soon enough.
All children of same-sex parents come home with uncomfortable
experiences early in life, from a classmate's innocent question _
``What do you mean, you have two moms?'' _ to being excluded: ``My
mom says you can't come to my birthday party because you have two
dads.''
</P>
<P>
   By far, children with two dads have the hardest time, says
developmental psychologist Charlotte J. Patterson, a professor at
the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more likely to notice two men and a child, so more
notice is drawn to these kids,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why what parents model counts so much, even when a
child is only a baby. Are you afraid of questions or do you respond
with good faith and information? Do you go into the school and
advocate for your child _ ``This is who we are; what can we do to
support/help you present this to the community?'' _ or shirk from
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do becomes the equipment a child works with. The
toolbox,'' says Martin.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes every toolbox includes community support. ``All
children of gay parents need to see and know other children who are
like them,'' says Firestone. McGleughlin says, ``It's a source of
strength to see that life isn't just about not being something but
also about being something.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Witherill and Susan Brace of Cambridge are convinced of
the truth in that. They became involved with a group of lesbian
families even before their daughter, Moira, now 13, was born. For
years, the group of mothers traded baby-sitting and overnights for
the kids and shared summer vacations. In fifth grade, when Moira
faced a barrage of nasty taunts by peers, it was the support of
children from that group that helped her through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could talk to them, one friend in particular,'' says Moira.
``There were some things I didn't even tell my moms.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stages of development
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least part of Moira's response was driven by her stage of
development. This can play a key factor in how a child of any age
copes:
</P>
<P>
   --Infants and toddlers. What their family looks like to the rest
of the world matters not at all to them, as long as they are well
loved, says Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   --Preschoolers. Children begin to notice all kinds of
differences: the color of a playmate's skin or hair; that someone
has a mom and dad instead of two moms. They don't know, however,
that there is a cultural message attached to it, says Patterson.
Keep your response matter of fact and simply acknowledge the truth
in the observation: ``You're right, Sally has a mom and a dad. You
have two moms.'' Expand on it if you have other examples to point
to _ ``Gerard has a stepmom and a dad, and Maya has brown skin and
her parents' skin is white'' _ but also point out ways in which
your families are alike: ``We have a dog and so does Gerard's
family. You have a sister just like Maya.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Blame it on Bill Bastone and Danny Green. They're the guys who
busted Rick Rockwell, the (maybe) multimillionaire who married a
stranger in front of (really) 23 million viewers. They're the ones
who dug up a restraining order filed against Rockwell years ago and
posted it on the Internet. They're the muckrakers who forced Fox to
cancel the rebroadcast of ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire,'' disappointing the one or two of us who missed
it the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, if Western civilization is about to crumble because of a
made-for-television marriage, we ought to be able to watch the
foundation fall, if only in reruns.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's any consolation, Bastone didn't see the show,
either. ``I'm a little upset myself,'' admits Bastone, who is the
cofounder of www.thesmokinggun.com. When he isn't chasing down
incriminating evidence on possible millionaires, Bastone is an
investigative reporter for The Village Voice. His beat: the Mob.
When you run around in circles like that, you dig up a lot of juicy
documents that never make it into the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Bastone and his pal Green, a freelance writer
based in New York, have amassed piles of rib-tickling,
face-reddening documents. In April 1997, they launched the Smoking
Gun Web site, a repository for dirt about celebrities, sports
stars, dead presidents, and _ well, why not? _ J. Edgar Hoover.
It's part gossip column, part police log, part political journal.
And it's always entertaining. (Unless you're Martha Stewart or
Howard Stern, whose dirty linen has been aired on the site.)
</P>
<P>
   In this age of digital technology, the site genuflects to the
ink-smudged, coffee-stained paper documents buried in musty old
courthouses and county offices. It's also a paean to the drudgery
of investigative reporting. ``A lot of this work is about calling
courthouses and police departments and going through files and
Xeroxing,'' says Green. ``It's scut work, but it's fun to get
e-mail from Norway and Australia saying, `I love the site, but who
is Marv Albert?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Each piece of paper reveals some sort of secret: The Stewart
files feature a police report that depicts the Home Beauty Queen
swearing at some poor sap in East Hampton. In the Kirstie Alley
papers, the actress's ex-husband, Parker Stevenson, outlines his
case for spousal support in excruciating detail, down to the
marching bands and the exotic animals. (We'll leave that one to
your imagination.)
</P>
<P>
   Just the facts, sweetheart, just the facts. These guys don't
make up any of this stuff, and even if they can be accused of
raking muck, they don't post anything on the Web site until they've
verified its accuracy, 100 percent. So how did they get the (maybe)
multimillionaire scoop? Someone in Southern California dropped a
dime, and the fearless reporters had their ``guy in LA'' scour the
files at the LA County Courthouse. The guy eventually came up with
the restraining order, which depicts the not-so-happy husband as a
controlling brute. After they confirmed it was the same Rockwell,
they posted the document along with Rockwell's mug, I mean, head
shot. They have been deluged with e-mail from folks claiming to
have some connection with Rockwell and his erstwhile bride, Darva
Conger.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other Internet startups, they haven't exactly been
flooded with buyout offers since they broke the story. ``No one has
arrived at our door offering riches, but they're welcome,'' says
Bastone, who doesn't let a day go by without filing a Freedom of
Information Act request.
</P>
<P>
   The two writers haven't bothered to request their own files from
the FBI, though. ``I'm afraid there wouldn't be a smoking gun
there,'' says Green, with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   When they aren't investigating not-so-eligible bachelors, the
members of the Fourth Estate like nothing better than to gossip
about each other. Witness the enormous popularity of Jim Romensko's
Media News (formerly www.mediagossip.com), which was recently
acquired by the Poynter Institute, a journalsim school in St.
Petersburg, Fla. Well, now there's a fabulous parody of the media
gossip site, put together by a couple of comedians in the Big
Apple. The parody is at www.modernhumorist.com, which promises more
hilarity this spring. I say, bring on the humorists; let spring
begin.

 THE TIBURON: THE LITTLE HUNDAI THAT COULD  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If someone asked me to define the word ``funky,'' I'd have to
give them the old
``I-can't-put-it-into-words-but-I-know-it-when-I-see-it'' line. Or,
I'd say, ``the Hyundai Tiburon.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this truly is a funky little sports car.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there aren't a lot of them around, when one does go
by you tend to notice and ask, ``What was that, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   And the two folks I've seen get out of them were . . . well,
they struck me as being on the funky side, too.
</P>
<P>
   And, besides being funky, they weren't tall.
</P>
<P>
   Tall people don't fare well in the Tiburon.
</P>
<P>
   Only by setting the driver's seat into a slightly reclining
position could I get the Tiburon to accommodate my 6-foot frame.
And it doesn't take a genius to figure out what happens when you
hit a big pothole.
</P>
<P>
   While I was preoccupied with my fit inside the car, my good
friend Jerry, a retired
machinist-turned-gunsmith-turned-clockmaker, was more interested in
the Tiburon's fit-and-finish. He lifted the hood and hatchback,
then ran his hands over the body panels and looked at the engine
and pronounced his judgment: ``Whoever made this car knew what they
were doing.'' High praise indeed from a man who was rebuilding
Lincoln, LaSalle, and Cadillac engines back in the '40s and still
machines parts to the 10,000th of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   My problems fitting into a vehicle aren't anything new. In the
past, I've gone into a Honda store prepared to buy a Prelude, a
Toyota store ready to buy a Celica, and a Saturn store ready to buy
a two-door coupe. In each case, sitting in the vehicle _ especially
if it was equipped with a sunroof _ proved impossible. Even
plopping into Audi's much-acclaimed TT coupe left me hunched over
trying to see overhead traffic lights through the narrow
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, part of the problem is me, but part is with these
autos' designs. They are perfect fits for most folks under
5-feet-10.
</P>
<P>
   If the Tiburon fits you, however, it could be one of the neatest
buys on the market.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a base price tag of $13,999 and a 10-year,
100,000-mile warranty (five years bumper-to-bumper and rust
perforation). In its favor, it also offers unique styling,
surprisingly good handling, a neat-but-not-luxurious interior, and
plenty of oomph from the 140 horsepower produced by its 2.0-liter,
4-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
   Our test version had a sunroof, big-time sound system, rear
spoiler, and leather accoutrements that pushed the price near
$17,000.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? It's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Think you can't drive a 5-speed manual? This is the smoothest
I've ever tried. The main reason is that the engine revs don't
immediately fall off when you ease off the gas to shift, allowing
the engine and transmission to meet smoothly in the next gear. I
always pride myself on smooth shifts but rarely have I found
seamless shifting so easy to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Lift the hatchback and there's room for several weeks' worth of
groceries, the dry cleaning, and whatever else you want to toss
back there. Lower the lid and it's all hidden by sheet metal and an
almost unnoticeable cover.
</P>
<P>
   Buzzing around town, which is what the Tiburon does best, you'll
get nearly 30 miles per gallon with great performance. It does
0-to-60 in 8.5 seconds, but the perceived quickness is even better
than that.
</P>
<P>
   From the driver's seat, looking over the hood is reminiscent of
sitting in a classic Triumph Spitfire. Then there was the color _ a
yellow that harked back to Chrysler's Super Bees of the late '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Or as the lady who rolled down her window in front of
Melrose-Wakefield Hospital when I popped out at a red light to slam
down the hatchback said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the color of your car . . . and I love the car. What is
it anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai Tiburon. A name worth remembering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The handling was sensational on those occasions when I could
let it go on a winding road.
</P>
<P>
   --The square headlight coverage pattern was unique and seemed to
give this myopic driver outstanding night vision.
</P>
<P>
   --The wipers (front and back) gave clear, clean consistent
visibility in misty and greasy road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The cupholders pulled out of the front console and blocked
access to the radio controls and also put the cup's contents in
jeopardy of a flying fist during gear changes.
</P>
<P>
   --The driver's seatbelt and jammed in its guide.
</P>
<P>
   --For three days, every time I hit the right directional signal
at night, I also managed to turn off the headlights, making the
driver in front of me wonder why I was flashing my lights.
</P>
<P>
   --And I could not find a spot to put a turnpike toll ticket,
except under a strap on the sun visor.

   Kusmierz noted that as people focus more on individual freedoms
and less on how their actions affect others, the dividing line
between haves and have-nots sharpens. ``As long as large segments
of society can't realize their definitions of the good life,'' she
said, ``programs like LARC will exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The voices heard around a hospital conference table last week
were authentic, all right, painfully so. Amid the sobering talk of
viral loads and T-cell counts, though, there was also laughter. And
that constituted a learning experience in itself.
</P>
<P>
   John Miller, a LARC patient from Dorchester, glanced at Richie
Moriarity, a sophomore from Maryland, and said that if he could
give these BC kids one gift, it would be ``an awareness of drug
addiction. Because there's always a line to cross, and I crossed
it. Once you cross it, you can't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Moriarity smiled back. ``Being at BC gives you a warped sense of
reality,'' he said softly. ``Everyone there is fortunate. Everyone
has plenty of money. It knocks me off my feet every day I come over
here. It's like _ '' Moriarity glanced around the table _ ``hel-lo,
Richie. Welcome to the real world.''

   EXP 88S: Understanding the Stock Market
</P>
<P>
   Students will begin to develop an understanding of and an
appreciation for the fundamentals of stock market investing, doing
so within the realm of larger social, demographic, political, and
economic contexts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what a margin is?'' asks Timothy Stratford in a
basement classroom of Braker Hall. ``No one?''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine students sit on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' says Stratford, writing ``THE MAGIC OF MARGIN'' on a
blackboard. ``Now, the whole premise of what I'm about to tell you
is that you should never do it, but it's crucial to know about.'' A
hand goes up. ``Yes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Greenspan said today he was unconcerned about margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Stratford laughs. ``Did he say why?'' he asks, tapping the
board. ``OK, here's my concern,'' continues Stratford. ``It's
buying stock with money you don't have. It's the biggest disaster
you can do. Mutual funds do it because they can get in and out of
stocks quickly. You can't. Any questions?''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began week six of an unusual course offered by Tufts
University's Experimental College. Call it Greenspan 101. From
calculating interest rates to shorting tech stocks, the course aims
to demystify the Dow while equipping students with the basics of
portfolio building. Chaucer? Organic Chem? Forget about it. The
cheer you hear is tuition-strapped parents yelling, ``Finally, a
course with a return on investment!''
</P>
<P>
   Stratford, an ex-bartender who logged 17 years as a broker, was
likewise cheered when 200 students showed up for the course last
spring, six times the number he could accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who don't get in beg me for a seat.'' says Stratford,
now teaching the course for the third time. ``If I were a broker
and 180 prospective clients showed up, I'd be thrilled. But I'm not
trying to sell them anything here.''
</P>
<P>
   The students, most of whom admit they don't know NASDAQ from
NASCAR, must write brief application essays. ``Like learning to fix
my car and cook a turkey,'' wrote one, ``learning about the stock
market is one of those goals that I've had for a while but haven't
gotten around to addressing.'' Gushed another, ``I only know that
those mysterious numbers that flash by right before the commercials
on the national news excite me more than any other possibility in
my life.'' Ah, youth.
</P>
<P>
   Two students have brought parents to class. Drew Carlton, a
senior from Shaker Heights, Ohio, took the course last fall. An
experienced day trader, Carlton knew as much about Internet trading
as Stratford did, maybe more. Still, says Carlton, ``I liked it
because it's a lot more relevant than most college classes. This is
something everyone should know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Robin, a senior psychology major from Long Island, knew
nothing about investing before this semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about to graduate, and I thought I'd better take one
course in something relevant,'' says Robin. Her midterm assessment?
``It's given me a basis for reading the business page every day,''
she says. ``Some things are still unclear, though, like inflation
and interest rates or _ '' join the club, Jennie `` _ what actually
moves the stock market up and down.
</P>
<P>
   If Stratford preaches anything, it's the value of patience and
discipline. Strategies like dollar cost averaging _ investing small
amounts consistently to capitalize on market fluctuations _ are
emphasized over picking the next hot dot-com stock or go-go mutual
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Says Stratford, ``Some of these kids want to make money, some
have parents who think this is good stuff to know, and some want to
walk into job interviews and not sound like idiots.'' He smiles.
``I'm here to help them all.''

IMAGINE A WORLD OF ALL WIRELESS, ALL THE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Sometime this spring, Scott Young's company will
throw out its office desk phones and join a small but growing group
of people who are going all-wireless for their telephone needs.
</P>
<P>
   Young's firm, PrairieComm of Rolling Hills, Ill., has one
unusually strong reason for switching its 120 employees from
landline phones to cell phones: It sells processing chips for
several leading cell phone makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is an image thing,'' Young said in an interview at
the Wireless 2000 convention here. ``If we want to project
ourselves as a cutting-edge wireless company, this is a way to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, there are good reasons for any other company to
consider following suit. ``It's the advantage of being able to get
a call anywhere: In your office, in the elevator, walking out to
the parking lot, wherever,'' said Young, who said AT&AMP;T Wireless
officials have told him his company is their third Chicago-area
customer going all-wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 4 percent of the 86 million US wireless phone
owners use them as their exclusive phone, double the percentage
estimated in a study last June by the Yankee Group of Boston,
according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association's
chief economist Bob Roche, whose group sponsored the three-day
convention that concluded Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some people see a potential revolution in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the hoopla this week over announcements about wireless
Internet access and e-commerce deals, association president Thomas
Wheeler said what is known as ``wireline displacement'' is an
overlooked but promising trend for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have all this wireless Net news popping, I think
you would be hearing a lot more about the growing numbers of people
who are using their wireless phone as their only phone,'' Wheeler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides mobile professionals replacing their office phone with a
portable unit, industry officials see big markets emerging among
young people, college students and first-time homebuyers who expect
to move frequently.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using a wireless phone as a landline replacement is
especially powerful internationally. In many countries, people face
months of waiting to get a landline phone and may have to pay, in
countries such as Finland and Japan, up to $1,000 for a wired
connection. In Egypt, a country where landline service is scarce
and installations plagued by delays, Vodafone AirTouch PLC has
signed up over 350,000 subscribers for wireless and found the
service generated a profit within just four months, Vodafone
chairman Chris Gent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would want a phone nailed to the wall when you can have it
in your hand?'' said Harvey White, chairman and chief executive of
Leap Wireless in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Leap, a spinoff from phone maker Qualcomm, of which White was a
founder, is launching a service in 17 American cities under the
Cricket Communications brand offering local phone service through
wireless technology. The cities include Pittsburgh, Denver, and
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   First offered in Chattanooga, Tenn., the service gives people
unlimited local calling in their home area for $30 a month,
prepaid, on a $100 or $130 digital phone, but with no roaming
charges for calls outside the area.
</P>
<P>
   In just nine months, White said, Cricket has sold its service to
7 percent of potential customers in the market, of whom more than
60 percent use the wireless phone as their primary or sole phone.
Cricket officials have no current plans to enter the New England
market but say they are interested in finding opportunities in the
region. .
</P>
<P>
   David Friedman, marketing vice president for US Cellular, whose
markets include rural parts of northern Maine, New Hampshire and
Vermont, said there is a huge market for wireless to crack, given
that the average residential wireline customer uses the phone 1,100
minutes a month, compared to about 150 minutes for wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, of all the time Americans spend talking on the
phone, only 5 percent is now over wireless units, said G. Edward
Evans of Dobson Cellular Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Reynolds, president of Bell South Mobility in Atlanta, said
he thinks that ``secondary lines are the most vulnerable to being
replaced'' by portable phones. ``We're seeing young, mobile
customers who have cut the cord or, frankly, never had a cord.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a teenager you used to get a second landline phone
for them,'' said Herschel Shosteck, a Wheaton, Md., industry
consultant. ``Now you get a wireless phone for the teenager and
keep the second line for your Internet use.''
</P>
<P>
   Shosteck said he sees evidence wireless phones are becoming
increasingly popular for college students who may live in four
dorms over four years and have summer jobs in different places.
With plans like AT&AMP;T's One Rate that offer 10 cents a minute for
wireless and long distance, ``the mobile phone number makes more
sense for them, and I think they will keep that as they grow up.
They're not going to give up their mobile phone just because they
have a house in the suburbs,'' Shosteck said.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives, however, caution there are clear
limits to how much ``wireline displacement'' there will be. James
P. Caile, Motorola's corporate vice president of marketing for
personal communications, said, ``If you're in a household of more
than one person, you need to provide some sort of communication
dedicated to the household, like if someone is just calling to
reach someone in the family,'' Caile said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, technology has been slow to develop for offering a
single number that can serve more than one wireless phone, although
Denver-based US West has pioneered a popular service that rings
both a home and mobile phone through one number.
</P>
<P>
   And Josh Kiem, a director of marketing with Motorola's personal
communications line, said, ``In other countries where there are
waiting lists for traditional phone service, (wireless replacement)
is happening. In the US, we have great landline service, so this
will probably be one of the last countries'' where wireless makes
serious inroads into traditional landline business.

EMULATION'S DUAL PERSONALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Journalism keeps you humble, if you're the sort of journalist
who puts his e-mail address at the bottom of the column. Readers
never hesitate to bring me up short.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for instance, I talked about the copper transistors
being used in the hottest new microprocessors. A couple of
sharp-eyed fans caught the blunder. It's the connectors between
transistors that are made of copper, not the transistors
themselves. Good catch, guys.
</P>
<P>
   Others directed their fire at my main point: that the torrent of
new superfast processors will provide far more power than most of
us need. Several of you responded that we'll soon have
sophisticated new programs that will need all the computing cycles
we've got. One correspondent pointed me to one of the most
interesting examples, a remarkable bit of software called VMware.
</P>
<P>
   It's a variation on the not terribly new concept of the software
emulator, a computer program that makes one computer act as if it
were another computer.
</P>
<P>
   Emulation programs have long been used by engineers to help them
design new computer systems. But they've never been especially
popular with ordinary users, except among loyal fans of Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh machines. Whatever its merits, the Mac is
a sort of technological Gilligan's Island, and many users are eager
for some way back to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   So there are programs like SoftWindows 98 and Virtual PC that
let a Mac run Microsoft Windows programs. I tried SoftWindows over
a year ago on my iMac, but found it sluggish and frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Connectix Virtual Game Station does a darn
good job of turning any late-model Mac into a Sony PlayStation
gaming console. I've just been playing the new Die Hard Trilogy
PlayStation game on my iMac, with the help of Virtual Game Station.
My performance is lousy; the computer's is superb.
</P>
<P>
   Emulators add an extra layer of software between the operating
system and the programs you want to run. So even the best of them
don't run as well as the systems they're trying to emulate. This is
particularly true when you're trying to emulate software that runs
on entirely different hardware. Windows programs are all written to
run on X86 chips, the design created by Intel two decades ago. To
make them run on a Mac, you need a layer of software that will make
a Mac's PowerPC processor run like a Pentium. It gets sticky.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that emulators aren't very popular with users
of Intel-compatible PCs. There's already a lot of good software
that runs ``natively'' on Intel-type processors. Why bother with
emulation?
</P>
<P>
   But there is the occasional good reason. Say there's a Windows
95 program that doesn't behave itself when running under
Microsoft's new Windows 2000 operating system. Or say you want to
use the GIMP, a powerful Linux graphic design program, without
having to convert your entire computer to Linux.
</P>
<P>
   One simple solution is dual-booting. You can set up a PC with
several operating systems, each stored in a different partition on
the hard drive. Then, at boot-up time, you can tell it which
operating system to load. Programs like V Communications Inc.'s
System Commander Deluxe were invented for this purpose. Or, you can
use LILO, a little utility that's built into Linux.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're booted into one operating system, you can't use
the others. It could be quite useful to run two or three operating
systems on the same computer at the same time. That's what VMware
was designed for.
</P>
<P>
   I'm running VMware on an IBM ThinkPad loaded with Microsoft's
Windows 2000. I can now pop open a window on the laptop and have
Red Hat Linux running inside, almost as fast as it does on one of
my dedicated Linux machines. And I can easily hop back and forth
between Linux and Windows applications. For instance, I cut a few
words out of this article, being written in Windows on Microsoft
Word, and pasted the words into WordPerfect, running under Linux.
</P>
<P>
   VMware runs on Windows NT and 2000, and on Linux. I'd love to
have something like this running on my Linux machines. Then again,
VMware costs $300 for the commercial version and $100 for personal
use. Maybe I'll wait for the completion of Wine, an ongoing project
to build a free Windows emulator for Linux. With Wine, I could do
all my serious work in Linux, then pop open a Windows
flight-simulation program, just for fun.
</P>
<P>
   Either VMware or Wine will require lots of extra processing
power for decent performance. A one-gigahertz processor with a ton
of memory and a fat hard drive ought to do nicely. The average user
certainly doesn't need this kind of rig, but for many of the people
who read this column, there's no such thing as too much computer. I
stand corrected.

MCCAIN MAY FOCUS EFFORT ON THE NORTHEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as Senator John McCain committed another $1
million to his California advertising effort, his campaign has been
working on an alternative strategy that assumes the Arizona senator
cannot win delegates in that vital state, but must instead focus
winning an ``inside straight'' of the New England states, New York
and perhaps Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   If the strategy works, McCain hopes to withstand an expected
Bush onslaught in Southern states on March 14 and hang on until
another round of moderate, northern states hold their votes through
April.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling from their primary defeats this week, both Republican
McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley are reworking their insurgent
strategies, hoping to come up a modest number of victories in next
week's Super Tuesday to remain politically alive for at least
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While the McCain campaign publicly continues to insist that the
Arizona senator can win California, a top campaign aide who spoke
on condition of anonymity said he and some other advisers have
concluded there was little chance of winning the Republican vote in
the state, and the winner gets all 162 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCain campaign is hopeful that it will at least get a
publicity bonanza if it wins the non-binding, open-to-all ``beauty
contest'' vote in California. McCain himself continues to emphasize
California's ``incredible importance'' and said he hopes to win
there. If McCain wins the beauty contest, as result which his
strategists hope will put pressure on the state to allocate
delegates based on the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not conceding California,'' McCain spokesman Dan
McLagan said Wednesday. ``We are putting up a heavy ad buy.'' The
campaign also is hoping that McCain does so well in Thursday's
debate that the race turns around.
</P>
<P>
   But the chances of winning delegates in California looks
difficult. A Los Angeles Times poll found that Bush leads McCain
among Republicans by 47 percent to 26 percent. While McCain has a
history of slicing through poll deficits, he also has difficulty
doing well among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's emphasis on the Northeast and Ohio comes at a time when
his campaign has been internally divided over recent matters such
as McCain's indecision about whether to participate in a California
debate and his blast at Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson.
McCain will participate in the debate via satellite due to what he
called a campaign commitment in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts say the obtacles in road ahead of him may
be insurmountable, especially in the wake of McCain's defeat on
Tuesday in Washington, a moderate state McCain expected to win.
Bush beat McCain in Washington by 58 percent to 38 percent.
``McCain's always playing catch-up,'' said Michael Genovese,
director of the Institute for Leadership Studies at Loyola
Marymount University in Los Angeles. ``The establishment here is
opposing him in ways that are almost pathological. They were
expecting a quick, clean race by Bush and this adds to resentment
of McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after months of discussing issues and weeks of harsh
attacks, the campaign has boiled down to the fundamental battle
over who can accumulate enough delegates to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Texas Governor George W. Bush has 170
delegates, while McCain has 105, with 1,034 needed for nomination.
There will be 613 delegates at stake next Tuesday. McCain starts
out with the assumption that he will sweep the five New England
states holding a vote on that day, giving him 102 delegates. Bush
also is competing in the region, but clearly is not expecting to do
well there. When asked about New England Wednesday, Bush responded
that he hoped to win Maine.
</P>
<P>
   After New England, McCain hopes to win New York, which has 101
delegates. McCain leads in some recent New York polls, but Bush is
hopeful about his chances there because it is a Republican-only
primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain hopes to win Maryland and Minnesota, both moderate Super
Tuesday states, with 65 delegates up for grabs. McCain may benefit
from Maryland rules that allow independents to participate in the
GOP primary, but not in the Democratic contest. But McCain is
likely to be hurt by Minnesota's reliance on a caucus system, which
favors an establishment candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, has strong hopes of winning in Georgia, with 54
delegates, and Missouri, with 35 delegates. McCain's strategy
relies heavily on doing well in the open primary of Ohio, with 69
delegates, but a just-released poll shows Bush is ahead in Ohio by
53 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the 162-delegate state of California, which McCain
describes as being of ``incredible importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet earlier this week, McCain sent signals through his
strategists that he was focusing on Northeastern and Midwestern
states. On Monday, he attacked Christian Coalition founder Pat
Robertson as an ``agent of intolerance'' and he continued to
criticize Bush for speaking at Bob Jones University, whose leaders
have called Catholicism a ``cult.'' At the same time, McCain said
that he couldn't participate in a California debate because he had
a scheduling conflict in New York, a heavily Catholic state where
McCain hopes Bush is hurt by the Bob Jones matter.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, however, both strategies were being called into
question. McCain lost Washington despite authorizing phone calls to
Catholics there about Bush's visit to Bob Jones University. And
McCain reversed course on the debate, saying he would participate
via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, McCain advisers acknowledged that they were stunned
at the scope of the Washington loss. The initial idea was that
McCain would offset his expected Virginia defeat with a Washington
win, and then ride a moderate wave to victory in California.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who Wednesday once again hammered the Republican Party
for its reliance on unlimited donations of ``soft money,'' faces
the quandary of running against his party while seeking the support
of its members. In the week after his Michigan victory, McCain's
chief argument was that he was more electable in the general
election than Bush. Now Bush's trio of victories on Tuesday,
especially the Washington win, revitalizes his claim to
electability.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain does not do well on Super Tuesday, he then faces a
series of March 14 contests in what looks like Bush country: Texas,
Florida, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Louisiana. McCain, who
previously has said the contest could be decided by March 7, now is
hoping to hang on until at least the Illinois vote of March 21, and
possibly until April 4, when Wisconsin and Pennsylvania hold their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the delegate race has barely begun. With
2,170 delegates needed for nomination, Gore has 42 and Bradley has
27, according to an Associated Press tally. Yet after Bradley
losses in Iowa, New Hampshire and Washington, some of his advisers
have discussed whether the former New Jersey senator should
withdraw. Bradley said Wednesday he will continue until at least
Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has yet to win any contest, stunned many of his top
advisers by focusing all of his energies on a six-day tour of
Washington, hoping that a win in Tuesday's non-binding primary
would boost his candidacy nationally. But the opposite occurred.
Vice President Al Gore beat Bradley in Washington by 68 percent to
31 percent, embarrassing the former New York Knick and raising
questions about why he didn't focus more on New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley clearly needs some major victories on Super Tuesday,
starting in New York, which theoretically should be his best state
aside from his home turf of New Jersey. Bradley campaign spokesman
Kristen Ludecke, dismissing suggestions that the Washington loss
had stalled the campaign, said the schedule now favors Bradley.
Bradley is much better-known in the Northeast from his days as a
basketball star than is elsewhere. In addition, Bradley is hoping
to do well in Missouri, where he was born and raised.

&HT;     BANANA REPUBLIC CHIEF TO HEAD WAL-MART'S ON-LINE AFFILIATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The chief executive of Banana Republic, which is
owned by San Francisco-based Gap Inc., is leaving the specialty
retailer to become the head of Wal-Mart's on-line division.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Jackson, 48, has headed Banana Republic since 1996 while
also overseeing the on-line operations for the Gap brands for the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wal-Mart has become such an incredible leader. It's one of the
most admired companies in the world,'' said Jackson, speaking
Wednesday about her opportunity to join what is considered to be
the world's largest retailer.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site for Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
has gone through a dramatic restructuring this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 6, the company announced the creation of a separate
company, Wal-Mart.com. Wal-Mart still holds the majority interest
in the on-line company. On Jan. 1, Wal-Mart also launched a
redesigned site with additional features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll evolve from the site that exists. We'll hopefully keep
what's good, improve what needs improving, add features that don't
yet exist,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's 22-year career in retail includes positions with
Federated Department Stores Inc., Saks Fifth Avenue, Walt Disney
Company and Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   She has been named by Fortune magazine as one of the ``50 Most
Powerful Women'' in U.S. business each of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Millard ``Mickey'' Drexler, the chief executive of Gap Inc.,
said in a statement that Jackson has left behind an exceptionally
strong management team at Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In her five years here, Jeanne has helped build Banana
Republic into a leading apparel brand, and in the past year and a
half she's helped to expand our business on line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's starting date is yet to be determined, but she expects
to begin in April. Wal-Mart.com is temporarily being based in Palo
Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Gap on Wednesday announced it had formed an office of the
president to run the Banana Republic business until a permanent
chief executive is named. The office will be run by three Banana
Republic executives: Jerome Jessup, Gary Muto and Amy Schoening.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Beegle, who has been leading the day-to-day operations at
Gap's direct-to-consumer business, was named head of the on-line
business.

</P>
<P>
   In Czech and other Slavic languages, the suffix ``ova'' is added
to the last names of all females. It's an ending long-ingrained in
the vernacular that quite literally means ``belonging to'' the
male, as in belonging to a woman's father or husband. (In English,
``ova'' is plural for ``ovum,'' a female egg cell.)
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make any American feminist wince. But Europe _
and especially Central Europe _ has long fought against
American-style political correctness, a term often derided as
describing a tortured sensitivity resulting in ridiculous changes
to the language.
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing, even in post-Communist countries like
the Czech Republic, meaning the use of the suffix ``ova'' may soon
be over.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation recently proposed by the Czech Republic's Ministry
of Interior would enable a woman to remove the suffix from her last
name.
</P>
<P>
   According to government officials, the legislation is expected
to pass and could take effect by the end of the year. They insist
the impetus for the proposal is not a rise in complaints, but is
simply the result of a changing world in which women are seeking
more control.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Kavkova, who runs Relocation Management International, a
Prague-based firm that helps companies relocate to the Czech
Republic, said some women have started to consider the use of
``ova'' demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they use it reluctantly because they accept it as part of
life here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, language is not as scrutinized in Europe as it is in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for example, people who deliver the mail are still
called postmen, even if they are women.
</P>
<P>
   And even though British Prime Minister Tony Blair often speaks
out in favor of women's rights, no one bats an eye that the female
members of Parliament belonging to his Labor Party are popularly
referred to in the press as ``Blair's babes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Czech Republic is even more traditional than
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for example, the kind of country in which high-level
female involvement in business or government is rarely encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech Republic there are no women in the Cabinet, whereas
in Sweden, 12 of 20 Cabinet positions are occupied by women.
</P>
<P>
   But many post-Communist countries are introducing laws these
days to put them in line with the European Union, which they aspire
to join.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech Republic, legislation to combat sexual harassment
was recently proposed following the publishing of a study by the
daily, Lidove Noviny, indicating that almost half of the country's
working women had been sexually harassed in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Zuzana Roithova, one of just nine female members in the
81-member Senate, said Czech women have been slow to push for more
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good family life is more important to many than their
rights,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Women right's advocates said it's no surprise then that the
Czech government is just now considering giving women the option of
removing the suffix ``ova'' from their last names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminism is not so popular in post-Communist countries as it
is elsewhere,'' said Jirina Ciklova, founder of the Center for
Gender Studies in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think this new proposal is a positive one and that, as a
result, many women, at least many of those from the younger
generation, will change their names,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Ciklova said, however, the change may not go over so well with
older women, who favor the suffix for making it immediately clear
whether someone is male or female.
</P>
<P>
   Even she agreed that some Czech names just won't sound right
without the ``ova.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she pondered, ``Can you imagine saying Martina
Navratil, instead of Martina Navratilova?'' She certainly can't.

 &HT;    MEXICO CITY'S SCARY AIR: CLEANER, BUT STILL FILTHY
 &HT;    For Use Sat., March 4 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Shortly after the dawn of the new year, Mexican
authorities here proudly announced that in 1999 Mexico City had
experienced the cleanest air in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the city was choking on those words.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most polluted metropolises was again shrouded
in smog that clogged nasal passages, stung eyes and made throats
raw. For a few days in early February schools in the southeastern
part of the city were ordered to keep kids indoors to reduce risks
to their young, developing lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted mostly by skyrocketing levels of suspended particles _
microscopic solids in the air _ the government ordered some
industries to cut production by half, and used emergency laws to
pull more old cars off the roads. Officials completely shut down
more than 150 brick-making factories known to sometimes illegally
use old rubber tires as fuel.
</P>
<P>
   People crowded into emergency rooms with respiratory illnesses
as the levels of suspended particles soared to well more than
double what's acceptable for human health. Forest fires near the
city also contributed to the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's true that more than a decade's worth of reforms have
helped reduce some aspects of classic air pollution, said Adrian
Fernandez, the director-general of information and measurement
programs for Mexico's National Ecology Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't like to act too triumphant,'' he hastened to add.
``There is so much more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City and the Greater Valley of Mexico are cursed by a
ring of mountains that trap pollution inside a bowl teeming with
18.5 million people, 4.5 million vehicles and tens of thousands of
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are exposed to a sickening stew of car exhaust and
industrial emissions. Add to that the ingredients of soil blowing
from vast tracts of unpaved land and wind-borne fecal matter
dropped by legions of street dogs. The region's bone-dry winter air
makes pollution even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Relief usually comes only with the spring rains.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last year by the World Resources Institute, a
Washington, D.C.-based research group, estimated that Mexico City
may have the world's worst air for children under 5 years of age.
Researchers here are studying the damage pollution causes to kids;
meanwhile those residents who have the foresight and income buy air
filters and limit their kids' outdoors activities.
</P>
<P>
   When air pollution here began approaching apocalyptic levels in
the late 1980s, Mexico established one of the world's most
sophisticated pollution-monitoring systems and began to enact a
series of reforms. Last year, Fernandez said, measurements showed
that action had indeed paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Major contaminants like carbon monoxide, lead and sulphur
dioxide had dropped within normal levels with only a few exceptions
during 1999. As a result, the city experienced only five days of
full-fledged emergencies last year. compared to year earlier???
</P>
<P>
   What helped, Fernandez said, was the phasing out of leaded
gasoline use in Mexico. It was completely eliminated in 1997. Heavy
industrial oil, too, contains a third less sulphur now. Two power
plants and a number of other industries in the metropolitan area
have switched to the less-polluting natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   All cars produced in Mexico since 1991 have catalytic
converters. Because many Mexicans can't afford new cars, however,
only about 40 percent of vehicles are equipped with the
pollution-reducing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's 11-year-old ``Today You Can't Drive'' law pulls about
20 percent of the city's older cars off the streets every day. Five
years ago, officials decided to double the program whenever
pollution levels skyrocket as they did earlier this year, pulling
about 40 percent of old cars off the road during emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news, Fernandez said, is that ozone _ the product of
fuel emissions and sunlight - is still an alarming health hazard.
Ozone peaked and remained for several hours at levels considered
well above the healthy norm almost every day last year, Fernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone irritates noses, throats and eyes. People with colds, the
flu or chronic respiratory problems suffer diminished lung capacity
that leaves them gasping for air. When ozone is strong, illnesses
are prolonged and doctors report a higher number of patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day here seems more difficult, especially in the
winter,'' said Altagracia Flores, who is highly exposed to car
fumes six days a week in Mexico City while she sells newspapers at
a curbside stand. ``I've had a cold at least two times a month
recently and every day my eyes feel irritated. Headaches at this
time of year are also more common.''
</P>
<P>
   The other contaminant that still plagues Mexico City's air at
dangerously high levels are suspended particles, the product of
vehicle and industrial fuel emissions, dog droppings and soil
erosion from barren open space that's devoid of trees or grass.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended particles lodge in the lungs and cause acute or
chronic respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Reforestation projects have helped reduce suspended particles
originating from soil, Fernandez said, but the city still needs to
do more work to fill in bare patches of land.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mexico City started a crackdown on pet poop, but
disregard for the law is more common than compliance. And with more
than a million stray dogs roaming the city, it's hard for
maintenance workers to keep pace with the refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said ozone and suspended particles should decline as
more industries and vehicles in Mexico City convert to using
natural gas. Two large natural-gas underground distribution centers
are under construction now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to have a very positive effect,'' he said. ``In
five years, about 90 percent of medium and big industries will be
using natural gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, however, say the prediction is a wild one. At current,
only 12 percent of factories in the Valley of Mexico use natural
gas and two centers won't be enough to fulfill the needs of the
rest, said Luis Manuel Guerra, director of the non-governmental
National Institute of Ecological Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be at least 100 centers,'' said Guerra, a
long-time critic of the government who believes it has moved too
slowly and too inefficiently to curb pollution.
</P>
<P>
   If the government really wants to get serious about pollution,
he said, federal and city officials should team up to convert the
city's crazy-quilt system of above-ground mass transit to buses and
taxis that use natural gas. Right now, thousands of the
privately-owned mini-buses that careen through the city are some of
the worst contaminators.
</P>
<P>
   It costs at least $3,000 to convert a vehicle's gas tank to one
that can use natural gas, Guerra said. But the investment can be
recouped within a few months because the price of natural gas is
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Fernandez said, natural gas is heavily taxed in
Mexico, making it hard to persuade industries or vehicles to
convert. He's been wrestling with Mexico's Treasury Department over
proposals to reform the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra also suggested the government invest in the construction
of artificial lakes near clusters of industries so the humidity
could help capture suspended particles.
</P>
<P>
   Both Guerra and Fernandez agree that more enforcement of Mexico
City's existing environmental laws is also a must.
</P>
<P>
   At least half a million of the 4.5 million vehicles circulating
in the city haven't gone through mandatory smog-control testing,
Fernandez said. Mexico recently gave regular police, rather than
special environmental officers, the power to crack down on this
massive flaunting of the law.

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S PRESIDENTIAL MEN HOLD KEY TO PUTIN'S POLICIES
 &HT;    For Use Sun., March 5 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Imagine a presidential campaign without television ads
or tour buses, and a platform that arrives only after the election.
</P>
<P>
   Recipe for disaster? Maybe in America. But in Russia this
strategy has kept acting President Vladimir Putin the runaway
favorite in the upcoming March 26 elections, when the world's
second-largest nuclear power is scheduled to elect a new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Like Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, Putin has
made no bones about drawing policy plans from a tight group of
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers here say these men _ who to a large extent
are Putin's former college friends or colleagues and currently hold
key posts in his government _ are particularly important to
divining what Putin, a 47-year-old former KGB officer and political
novice, stands for.
</P>
<P>
   It is also these men whom Putin will pick to run the next
government, making them key figures to watch to determine how
Russia will develop policies at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is often described as a good manager that knows how to
select people and muster political will to get things done,'' said
Yevgeny Volk, the head of the Heritage Foundation in Moscow.
``First, he needs to get elected. When that happens, he'll have a
proven group of men to run the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The team Putin has drawn around him have a common profile: Most
are men who have studied law, are in their late-30's or early 40's
and hail from the candidate's hometown, St. Petersburg. Among these
are Putin's Chief of Staff Dmitry Kosak, 41; Dmitry Medvedev, 34,
Putin's campaign chief; and the head of the Federal Security
Bureau, 48-year-old Nikolai Patrushev.
</P>
<P>
   However, the one man within Putin's circle who has an entirely
different background from the leader is the person tapped to become
Putin's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Kasyanov, who has worked in the Ministry of Finance
since 1993, is a Moscow native with a post-graduate degree in
economics. A stocky, blond-haired man who speaks fluent English, he
currently is Russia's first deputy prime minister, and in that
position takes over the reins of government when Putin is out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin insiders say Kasyanov, 42, caught Putin's eye after
after the minister successfully negotiated a $10.6 billion debt
relief package for Russia in February. It was a deal extremely
important for the health of the country's struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kasyanov meets all the requirements needed (in a prime
minister). He's experienced in domestic and international politics,
he's a consummate professional, he has no political ambitions and
he has a head on his shoulders,'' said Igor Bunin, the director of
the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Second in line after Kasyanov is Ilya Klebanov, 49, a close
friend Putin appointed deputy prime minister in charge of defense
last May. An experienced businessman who was chief executive at a
weapons-building company, Klebanov has been cited as one of
Russia's best mangers.
</P>
<P>
   In his current position, Klebanov travels abroad frequently to
negotiate military and trade deals with Russian allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's economic revival is one of Putin's buzzwords.
(Klebanov) knows what it takes to run a business, and Putin likes
his real world experience,'' a St. Petersburg-based friend of both
men said, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In December, before becoming acting president, Putin established
an economic think tank charged with creating a 10-year economic
development plan for the country, a plan he made clear he would
adopt if he was elected.
</P>
<P>
   Although the organization has yet to publicize the strategy (and
says it won't until after the elections), the president of the
think tank, German Gref, 36, is expected to become Putin's
Economics Minister.
</P>
<P>
   Gref and Putin have worked together since 1993, when they both
were members of the St. Petersburg city government. Gref, a nappy
dresser who sports a trimmed goatee beard, relocated to Moscow in
1998 when he became the deputy chairman of the State Property
Committee, the government agency in charge of privatization.
</P>
<P>
   He describes his economic views as moderately liberal, favoring
lower taxes and reform in Russia's aging industrial sector. These
ideas, he said would be spelled out in the 10-year plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Government) should be strong so that it can rather quickly
and effectively spell out new rules of the game ... rules of ethics
and taxes ... and ensure all citizens and market participants
followed these rules,'' Gref said in a Feb. 23 speech.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all cabinet positions will go to Putin's
entourage. Current Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov is expected to stay
on in his position. The acting president is thought to favor a new
man to head the Defense Ministry, Valentin Bobryshev, the
55-year-old former commander of Russia's Southern Army Group.
</P>
<P>
   This mixture of experienced officials and new bureaucrats is one
strategy Putin's campaign staff is quick to tell reporters that
their candidate likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in favor of step-by-step reforms in the economy, while
revolutionizing the inner workings of the Russian government,''
said Mikhail Margelov, a Putin campaign consultant. ``We have a man
who wants to end corruption by making government more vertically
integrated and more user-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Putin's circle gets high marks from Western
business and political circles, the lack of detail they have given
Russian voters has made skeptics of some at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The team's) public pronouncements are pathetic in their lack
of detail. The words could mean one thing, or they could be a
liberal smoke screen,'' said Pavel Flegenhauer, a Moscow-based
political analyst.

``First, he needs to get elected. When that happens, he'll have a
proven group of men to run the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The team Putin has drawn around him have a common profile: Most
are men who have studied law, are in their late-30's or early 40's
and hail from the candidate's hometown, St. Petersburg. Among these
are Putin's Chief of Staff Dmitry Kosak, 41; Dmitry Medvedev, 34,
Putin's campaign chief; and the head of the Federal Security
Bureau, 48-year-old Nikolai Patrushev.
</P>
<P>
   However, the one man within Putin's circle who has an entirely
different background from the leader is the person tapped to become
Putin's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Kasyanov, who has worked in the Ministry of Finance
since 1993, is a Moscow native with a post-graduate degree in
economics. A stocky, blond-haired man who speaks fluent English, he
currently is Russia's first deputy prime minister, and in that
position takes over the reins of government when Putin is out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin insiders say Kasyanov, 42, caught Putin's eye after
after the minister successfully negotiated a $10.6 billion debt
relief package for Russia in February. It was a deal extremely
important for the health of the country's struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kasyanov meets all the requirements needed (in a prime
minister). He's experienced in domestic and international politics,
he's a consummate professional, he has no political ambitions and
he has a head on his shoulders,'' said Igor Bunin, the director of
the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Second in line after Kasyanov is Ilya Klebanov, 49, a close
friend Putin appointed deputy prime minister in charge of defense
last May. An experienced businessman who was chief executive at a
weapons-building company, Klebanov has been cited as one of
Russia's best mangers.
</P>
<P>
   In his current position, Klebanov travels abroad frequently to
negotiate military and trade deals with Russian allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's economic revival is one of Putin's buzzwords.
(Klebanov) knows what it takes to run a business, and Putin likes
his real world experience,'' a St. Petersburg-based friend of both
men said, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In December, before becoming acting president, Putin established
an economic think tank charged with creating a 10-year economic
development plan for the country, a plan he made clear he would
adopt if he was elected.
</P>
<P>
   Although the organization has yet to publicize the strategy (and
says it won't until after the elections), the president of the
think tank, German Gref, 36, is expected to become Putin's
Economics Minister.
</P>
<P>
   Gref and Putin have worked together since 1993, when they both
were members of the St. Petersburg city government. Gref, a nappy
dresser who sports a trimmed goatee beard, relocated to Moscow in
1998 when he became the deputy chairman of the State Property
Committee, the government agency in charge of privatization.
</P>
<P>
   He describes his economic views as moderately liberal, favoring
lower taxes and reform in Russia's aging industrial sector. These
ideas, he said would be spelled out in the 10-year plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Government) should be strong so that it can rather quickly
and effectively spell out new rules of the game ... rules of ethics
and taxes ... and ensure all citizens and market participants
followed these rules,'' Gref said in a Feb. 23 speech.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all cabinet positions will go to Putin's
entourage. Current Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov is expected to stay
on in his position. The acting president is thought to favor a new
man to head the Defense Ministry, Valentin Bobryshev, the
55-year-old former commander of Russia's Southern Army Group.
</P>
<P>
   This mixture of experienced officials and new bureaucrats is one
strategy Putin's campaign staff is quick to tell reporters that
their candidate likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in favor of step-by-step reforms in the economy, while
revolutionizing the inner workings of the Russian government,''
said Mikhail Margelov, a Putin campaign consultant. ``We have a man
who wants to end corruption by making government more vertically
integrated and more user-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Putin's circle gets high marks from Western
business and political circles, the lack of detail they have given
Russian voters has made skeptics of some at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The team's) public pronouncements are pathetic in their lack
of detail. The words could mean one thing, or they could be a
liberal smoke screen,'' said Pavel Flegenhauer, a Moscow-based
political analyst.

   ``ROBIN HOOD WAS RIGHT'' &QL; 
By Chuck Collins and Pam Rogers (Norton, $28.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wait! Don't mail those checks yet. Collins and Rogers have
advice about charitable giving that will help you donate your money
with thought and purpose rather than with guilt and self-interest.
Americans gave $109 billion to charity last year, yet one in four
top earners gave nothing, the wealthy gave smaller portions of
their assets than did the poor, and only 13 percent of the money
went to direct public benefit through human service programs (most
went to churches, the arts, elite private universities and
hospitals). Here, the authors attempt to redefine modern
philanthropy in order to affect change _ instead of focusing on the
immediate symptoms of social or economic problems, they want our
dollars to chip away at the CAUSES of those problems. Collins and
Rogers are dedicated, energetic, knowledgeable and frankly, a bit
daunting in their zeal. But you'll learn something if you listen to
them. As Alfre Woodard writes in her preface, ``Robin Hood was
right. And he had a damn good time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``HAWKE'S COVE'' &QL; 
By Susan Wilson (Pocket, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's one for the ``Bridges of Madison County'' crowd, another
novel that attempts to parlay yearning and denial into a bad but
bittersweet bestseller. A young journal-keeping woman named Vangie
retreats to her grandmother's farm in a small coastal town (note
the title) to recover from the death of her baby and to wait for
news of her husband, who is overseas fighting in World War II. It's
not long before a down-on-his-luck stranger named Joe shows up, and
we know what that means. Vangie hires him to work on the farm, they
drink tea and lemonade, they watch each other through lowered
lashes, they swim (``There is,'' Wilson writes, ``a strange
intimacy in swimming . . .''), she spreads ointment on his
blistered hands. When Vangie's husband is declared missing in
action, she and Joe have a hot night together in the hayloft, but
word comes the very next morning that the husband is still alive.
Denial commences. Years pass. Violins play. Their children grow up
and get nosey. Have you been here before? You betcha. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOREVER LIESL'' &QL; 
By Charmian Carr (Viking, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were hoping to find some dirt here, but according to Carr,
there was precious little of it on the set of ``The Sound of
Music.'' Until now, the only relief from the unrelenting sweetness
of the film was an anecdote about Christopher Plummer, who played
Baron von Trapp and who allegedly hated the movie so much he called
it ``The Sound of Mucus.'' But Carr, who played the von Trapp
daughter Liesl, debunks that story, saying that Plummer himself
denies it (he did despise the song ``Edelweiss'' and tried to have
it tossed from the film). Mostly, this book is a cheerful report on
a cheerful experience, with some funny moments on the side. When
she attended the Mexican premiere (the film was called ``La Novicia
Rebelde,'' or ``The Rebellious Novice''), the unsuspecting Carr was
taken to a bullfight. The matador dedicated the bull to her, and
she watched in horror as the bull was tormented by the matador and
the matador was then run over by the bull. She visited the matador
in the hospital, as Liesl certainly would have done if she'd been
there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE VISION OF EMMA BLAU'' &QL; 
By Ursula Hegi (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hegi's new novel is a family saga that begins in the early
1900s, when scrappy teenager Stefan Blau comes to America from
Germany (specifically from Burgdorf, which figures into Hegi's
earlier books, ``Stones From the River'' and ``Floating in My
Mother's Palm''), and sets out to make his fortune. After a fire in
the New York restaurant where he works, he leaves the city and goes
to a small town in New Hampshire because a fellow immigrant has
told him it reminded him of Germany. There, Stefan marries twice
and loses both wives to the births of his children before he
returns to Burgdorf to bring back and marry Helene Montag, his
childhood friend and the character through which Hegi explores the
difficult adjustment of the German immigrant. Serving as a backdrop
for the story is the Wasserburg, the grand and glorious apartment
building that Stefan builds, which reflects the fortunes of his
family. Hegi's characterization is superb, part of a story that is
as well-constructed as the Wasserburg itself.  &QL;

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, THE DEMOCRATIC WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (LAST IN A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES. ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K''
 &UR; CATEGORY  &UR; - RESENDING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 AND INHERITING-3
 &UR; FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE. The author
 &UR; examines the Democratic ``Liberal Moralist'' and ``Liberal
 &UR; Realist'' positions in the debate over the direction of American
 &UR; foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The American people are undergoing an out-of-body experience:
History is repeating itself, and they have been transferred back to
1920 and the battle waged by Woodrow Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge
over America's entry into the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wanted both to make the world ``safe for democracy'' and
for the United States to obey the covenant of the League of
Nations, irrespective of national self-interest. His opponent was
Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
although Lodge favored America's entry into the League, he wished
to modify certain articles as a means of preserving U.S. national
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to make any concessions and, in 1920, the League
went down to defeat. The conservatives of 2000 are the spiritual
descendants of Lodge, while present-day liberals inherit the legacy
of Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a liberal moralist, Clintonian foreign policy is an amalgam
of Wilson, Jimmy Carter's ``universal human rights'' and reaction
against the Vietnam War with its rejection of unilateral action by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation in 1993, Clintonian diplomacy shattered
the boundaries of the containment of Communism theory articulated
by George F. Kennan, a foreign-policy expert and diplomat, at the
beginning of the Cold War. Essentially a strategy to halt further
imperialism of the Stalinist empire, containment theory limited the
extension of American power to the Elbe, which, from 1947 to 1990,
was the eastern border of Germany. &QL; 
NATO EXPANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy committed itself to the enlargement of
the horizon of democracy, and Clinton pursued this goal on two
fronts: expansion of NATO in Europe and support of Boris Yeltsin in
Russia. When Clinton embarked on the jihad of making the world safe
for democracy, he not only embraced this aspect of Wilsonism but
capitulated to the arguments of Anthony Lake, his first national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine brought Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary into NATO. By including these three countries under the
NATO umbrella, the United States committed itself to the defense of
countries it never previously considered within its own sphere of
national self-interest. This enormous broadening of American
guarantees was justified under the principle of missionary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding NATO, Clinton broke American implied agreements
with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``A World Transformed,'' written by George
Bush, who was president at the time of the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's
national security adviser, is unequivocal on this point: At no time
did Bush, Scowcroft, or Secretary of State James Baker indicate to
Gorbachev that NATO would be extended eastward to Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary after the Soviets voluntarily renounced their
title to these tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward Yeltsin was another case of missionary
democracy. The Clinton administration adamantly supported Yeltsin
on the grounds that he was leading the democratic capitalist
transformation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeltsin's resignation from office and the crowning of
Vladimir Putin as his successor is a serious setback for the
Clinton doctrine. Putin's recent alliance with the Communists
belies the assertion that democracy is functioning in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Hamilton, Democratic loyalist, respected former
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and current
director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Putin's recent coalition
with the Communists ``amounts to a defeat for Clinton, for it
strengthens the power of the Communists in the Duma.'' &QL; 
PUSHING MULTILATERALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Wilson ideal that the Clinton doctrine continues is that
American diplomacy should unfold within multilateral institutions.
Liberal moralists are suspicious of unilateral actions because they
fear it will give rise to worldwide anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the fact that recent ventures in which America
acted under the aegis of the United Nations _ such as in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo _ all appear to be failures, the
White House still upholds the usefulness of multilateralism. The
Oval Office fears the bully backlash _ that other nations will
express their resentment against the paramountcy of the United
States by opposing American policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of liberal moralism to which the Clinton
doctrine abides is free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal moralism wishes to turn the movement toward economic
globalization to an advantage for the United States, and so Clinton
has devoted much effort to the reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wishes to use trade as a form of social engineering,
because he hopes that free trade will encourage the growth of a
capitalist entrepreneurial class in countries making the transition
out of communism, like China. Borrowing a phrase from his former
economic adviser, Andrea Tyson, Clinton thinks in terms of
``strategic trade,'' or trade with a deeper purpose than just
making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In its approach to China, the Clinton doctrine combines the
strategic trade and the ``strategic partner'' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the strategic partner is to detach China from any
``anti-hegemonist'' bloc alliance. Primarily, this means preventing
the re-creation of the Cold War Sino-Soviet coalition. &QL; 
OVAL OFFICE'S PLAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hook of strategic trade is associated with the universal
human-rights theory of Carter. By its use of strategic trade, the
Oval Office hopes to ensnare President Jiang Zemin into granting
more ``human rights'' to Chinese citizens. The ultimate aim of
trans-Pacific social engineering is to both speed the development
of a commercial middle class in China and to provide these
entrepreneurs with the protective shield of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives of all camps attack the Clinton doctrine on China
as a contradiction between rewards and punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting upon the differences that separate Republicans and
Democrats, Democratic loyalist Hamilton told ``The Arizona
Republic,'' ``Republicans are very skeptical of international
organizations, such as the U.N., the World Trade Organization and
the like. Democrats generally support these multilateral
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a monopolar world in the social and economic
sense. Even though the U.S. is the only superpower in the military
or `hard' sense, it cannot dictate to all nations of the globe in
matters of gender, children, values or culture. In terms of `soft'
power _ education, information and trade, this is a multipolar
world and the U.S. must learn to act in conjunction with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that the most important lever of
diplomatic power has changed from `hard' to `soft' power. To me,
trade is the crucial issue.'' &QL; 
PARTY SPLIT ON POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tend to stress military power,'' Hamilton
added. ``I am an unrepentant free-trader because I believe that
unrestricted trade, from which all sides benefit, is the best way
to export the democratic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But policies are divisive ones within the Democratic Party. To
hold the presidency again in November, Democrats desperately need
the support of American labor, and the AFL-CIO has already endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. Nevertheless, a divorce has taken place
between the corporatist and labor wings of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatists favor strategic trade and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, because they will be the ``winners''
from the globalization of trade, while Big Labor is opposed to
these policies, because they will be the ``losers'' when domestic
wages are repressed. The Seattle meeting of the World Trade
Organization ended in chaos when Big Labor and environmentalists
led street demonstrations demanding environmental protections, an
end to child labor in China and other Asian countries and
improvement of working conditions before any further reduction of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of China and world trade will be hotly debated along
partisan lines when Congress is called on to approve China's entry
into the World Trade Organization in the fall, and they will play a
major role in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already become a victim of the Democratic dependency on
Big Labor. Gore suffers from a split personality: one face as vice
president and the other as party candidate. As vice president, he
speaks in favor of the Clinton doctrine, but as candidate he must
massage the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Gore's divided personality made the front pages
when the AFL-CIO criticized him for placing the reduction of
tariffs before the increase of wages, the growth of labor unions
and the end of sweat shops in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Gore's problems with the labor unions, he is also a
Liberal Moralist. In the war of words currently waged in opinion
journals, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations
at Harvard University, has acted as the vice president's script
writer. In an article in the March/April issue of ``Foreign
Affairs,'' Walt has written a Democratic response to the Republican
broadsides that were published by ``Foreign Affairs'' in the
previous issue. The vice president's proxy only proved that on
foreign affairs, Gore is a clone of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is also a Liberal Moralist and although there are
no significant differences between Gore and Clinton, there are
important divisions between Gore-Clinton and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Clinton favor an increase in the defense budget, but
Bradley advocates a cut in appropriations for the Defense
Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the
spinning-wheel Third World.  &QL; 
`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

childhood friend and the character through which Hegi explores the
difficult adjustment of the German immigrant. Serving as a backdrop
for the story is the Wasserburg, the grand and glorious apartment
building that Stefan builds, which reflects the fortunes of his
family. Hegi's characterization is superb, part of a story that is
as well-constructed as the Wasserburg itself.  &QL;

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

&HT;     STANFORD'S FRESHMAN STAR HOBBLED BY INJURIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: Colo., Wash.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ When freshman Jamie Carey joined the Stanford
women's basketball team last fall, coach Tara VanDerveer gave her a
bit of friendly advice: ``I like a big lineup, so you'd better play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey didn't blink, and she has played well. Very well. She's
been a season-long starter despite her youth and the fact she's a
relative midget at 5-feet-6-inches.
</P>
<P>
   She has averaged just under 11 points a game and is leading the
team with 63 3-pointers, just a dozen off Vanessa Nygaard's school
record and five behind Jennifer Azzi's Cardinal freshman mark.
She's also 10th in the nation in 3-point shooting percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive than Carey's numbers are her toughness and
her poise. From the moment she took the court against the U.S.
women's national team in the Cardinal opener, nothing has shaken
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She takes care of the ball,'' VanDerveer said. ``She's smart,
makes good decisions, recognizes when things are open and when
they're not. She's really, really special.''
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem. Carey hasn't been really, really
healthy for some time.
</P>
<P>
   She injured both her ankles during her junior year at Horizon
High School in Thornton, Colo., and they have never completely
healed. On Saturday, near the end of Stanford's win over
Washington, she went sprawling after tripping over a Husky player
and reaggravated a high left ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Carey was in tears on the bench, and left Maples Pavilion on
crutches. She has remained on crutches this week, and her status
for the Cardinal's crucial road games at UCLA and USC Friday and
Sunday is very much in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know if she'll be able to play,'' team trainer
Mike Leahy said. ``It's day to day. We'll just have to wait and
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey, who has missed just one game this season, is being
cautious, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ankle was very painful when I hurt it again,'' she said.
``As a player, you always want to play, but I just have to wait and
see now, because it's hard to tell just how long it will take to
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   But VanDerveer, well aware of Carey's ability to bounce back,
said, ``Personally, I'm counting on her. It's nice to have an extra
day (a Friday game instead of the normal Thursday) for her to rest.
But if she's not basically 100 percent, she's not going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   VanDerveer blamed herself for not getting Carey out earlier from
Stanford's blowout win over Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just stupid,'' the coach said. ``What makes it so bad
is that I've been a nervous wreck all year sitting on the bench and
worrying about whether I should leave her in or take her out. I had
Christina Batastini at the scorer's table waiting to replace her
Saturday, but I couldn't get her in before Jamie got hurt again.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey probably will be facing extensive rehabilitation and
perhaps surgery after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell,'' she said, ``but that's not an issue right
now.''

Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

REPUBLICAN FOREIGN-POLICY PERSPECTIVES: MORALISTS VS. REALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVING IN ``A'' CATEGORY. / SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE)
 &UR; The author examines the Republican ``Conservative Moralist'' and
 &UR; ``Conservative Realist'' positions in the debate over the
 &UR; direction of American foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Foreign Policy Debate of 2000 is a cascade of ink not
limited to the battle of the journals. It has become a bonanza as
well for the publishing industry as authors from different research
institutes flood bookstores and libraries with their tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious outlet for discussions of international
affairs is the bimonthly magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' which
specializes in the disputations of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace, and his intellectual soul mate, Bill Kristol, editor of
the ``Weekly Standard'' journal, co-wrote an article in ``Foreign
Affairs''called ``Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,'' in which
they wrote: ``Finally, American foreign policy should be informed
with a clear moral purpose, based on the understanding that its
moral goals and its fundamental national interest are almost in
harmony . . . The remoralization of America at home ultimately
requires the remoralization of American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   `GREAT FATHER FIGURE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows that democracies do not fight each other,''
writes Robert Kagan, who may be considered the leading advocate of
the Conservative Moralist congregation. ``American democracy should
be expansionary, and the U.S. should be more assertive and activist
in enlarging the frontiers of democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Ronald Reagan as the great father figure of American
foreign policy. Not only was Reagan skeptical of international
organizations, but he also understood the necessity for the U.S. to
act unilaterally and to intervene into the affairs of another
country on the grounds of American national interest. Reagan had an
intuitive grasp of hard power, or military force.''
</P>
<P>
   REALISM AND MORALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kagan traces his intellectual ancestry to Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join realism and moralism,'' Kagan said, ``and so did Teddy
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson, for all his genius, even though he
desired to make the `world safe for democracy,' was willing to
sacrifice American sovereignty to a world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``TR (Teddy Roosevelt) would not have done that, but recognized
the need to use U.S. power unilaterally to spread American ideas
and values. Reagan was part of the TR (Roosevelt) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, has published a book, ``Freedom Betrayed,'' that reads
like a hymn to the American system.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ledeen, the democratic revolution has passed
through two periods: The first was the American Revolution of 1776,
and the second is America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A proselytizing Democrat, Ledeen attaches himself to the Wilson
who sought to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' and ``Freedom
Betrayed'' presents the United States as a revolutionary power, a
``chosen nation'' for converting the world to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of Conservative Moralists is open to theological
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan, Kristol and Ledeen abandon the principles of George
Kennan's ``containment policy'' through which America won the Cold
War. The containment policy was essentially a static program, for
it conformed to a bipolar world, and it assumed that both the
Soviet Union and the United States would remain on their sides of
the Iron Curtain, while Washington waited for the decay of
Stalinist Communist imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood of Conservative Moralism wants to replace the
static nature of the containment policy with a form of democratic
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the post-Cold War world is a monopolar one in which
the United State is preeminent, that limits to American
expansionism no longer exist, this College of Cardinals seeks to
root the democratic flag in such far-away places as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (countries that few Americans even know
are on the map) _ all of which, not incidentally, are enormously
rich in oil and natural-gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign-policy gurus have not proved their claim that
unilateral intervention into the affairs of a sovereign country is
an effective means of installing democracy in a nation. Government
through the consent of the people arises only when other supportive
institutions exist, such as a free press, an independent judiciary
and a population committed to the principles of civil rights, and
these cannot be imposed by paratroopers descending from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY OR CAPITALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the prophets of Conservative Moralism do not clearly
indicate which they wish to export _ democracy or capitalism.
Michael Ledeen, however, does have the courage of his faith, for he
wishes to export the Reagan Republican Platform of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freedom Betrayed,''Ledeen defines the democratic
revolution: ``Today it means waging war against the growing power
of the preeminent modern institution: state bureaucracy . . That is
why the call to slash the size of government is such an integral
part of the democratic revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between the American Constitution and
the Republican platform of 1980: Although it is patriotism to ask
American soldiers to fight for the Constitution, it is bottomless
greed to ask them to fight to imperialize the Reagan 1980 campaign
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to position itself as the final arbiter of the Great
Debate, ``Foreign Affairs'' has devoted its January-February 2000
issue to the Republican side of this argument. In this issue,
Condoleezza Rice wrote the lead article, ``Promoting the National
Interest,'' an exposition of the Conservative Realist position. In
the March/April 2000 issue, ``Foreign Affairs''will follow up with
the Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   NATION COMES FIRST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice has deep roots in the Bush dynasty because she worked as a
Russian specialist on the National Security Council under President
Bush and presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft. A book by Bush and
Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed,'' refers to her as extremely
competent and knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emphasizing one of the major principles of Conservative
Realism, Rice upholds the primacy of national interest over
international organizations and norms. The theory of ``universal
human rights'' is a wonderful ideal, but here also national
interest takes priority over the banner of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russia, Rice supports the expansion of NATO to
include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The United States
should not be deterred by Russian anger because of the ballooning
of NATO into real estate once controlled by Soviet armies.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet specialist to Bush favors U.S. support for the
continued independence of the Ukraine and other countries in
Central Asia that seek to protect their sovereignty from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   REBUILD MILITARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea region is of vital importance for U.S. interests
because of its huge oil and natural-gas reserves. In this region of
the globe, the policy of containing the Soviet Union is replaced by
the policy of dismembering Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing President Clinton for cutting the defense budget,
Rice wants to rebuild the military to throw out the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians and construct a
national missile-defense system. The defeat of the renewal of the
1992 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was correct. In the last
analysis, it is ``hard power,'' the persuasiveness of the bullet,
that determines the fate of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rice favors U.S. participation in all international
organizations because such collaboration is an advantage to the
national interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she favors continued U.S. participation in the
World Trade Organization, because she favors opening markets for
U.S. exports. Trade is an important instrument of U.S. foreign
policy, and the international reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers represents a gain to the United States because it helps
create an entrepreneurial capitalist class in whatever nation
becomes a partner in these commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with China, the former national security adviser
believes, is in American national self-interest because it will
speed economic liberalization, and the emergence of an aggressive
capitalist phalanx could act as the springboard for the sprouting
of political democracy. Unlike Clinton, however, Rice does not view
China as a ``strategic partner'' but as a ``strategic competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Realists want to maintain Taiwanese
independence, and they image themselves as the party of the right
on the China issue. In essence, they want to create an East Asian
``rollback theory'' in the style of John Foster Dulles, keeping
China out of Taiwan and forcing China out of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   CEASE BEING WORLD'S POLICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her new position at Stanford University, Rice launched has
her most spirited diatribes against the Clinton administration on
the question of humanitarian intervention. She points to the
failure of such action in Haiti and to the ineffectiveness of
multilateral humanitarian intervention in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States exerts hard hegemonic power in the
world, it should not act as the earth's ``globocop.'' Rice does not
believe that it is within the national interest of the United
States to play the universal gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Rice an authoritative voice from the Conservative
Realist pew, but the probable ghostwriter on foreign policy for
Gov. George W. Bush. There is no difference in substance between
the Rice essay and a speech on America's position in the world that
Bush gave to kick off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
Reagan, agrees with Rice, particularly on the need to protect U.S.
sovereignty and to build an anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was defeated,''
Kirkpatrick confessed. ``I worked for five years at the U.N., and I
can tell you that votes in the General Assembly are often stampeded
and ill-informed. There are over 150 members in the General
Assembly, and the vast majority have no experience with nuclear
weapons, and so their votes are not based on fact or experience. It
is wrong to give such a body a literal veto over American
armaments, defense and national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall discussing the issue of the anti-ballistic missile
defense system with Ronald Reagan. The president looked upon a
system which could prevent an attack as a moral imperative because
it would prevent incalculable carnage. He believed that the policy
of MAD _ mutually assured destruction _ was immoral because it left
open the possibility of attack and cataclysmic bloodshed. To be
able to deter such an attack was equal to defending against
unprecedented inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN BEEFS UP HIS TEAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also a member of the Conservative Realist
choir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has added some illustrious names to his
foreign-policy team. Other notable foreign-policy sages now stand
alongside Henry Kissinger in the ex-Navy pilot's camp, and they
include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Larry Eagleberger, Kirkpatrick and R.
James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner of war also looks suspiciously upon mainland
China. Although McCain supports the maintainence of normal trade
relations with China, he looks upon that country of 1.2 billion
people as a rival to the United State in the Pacific Rim, and he
stands firmly for continued independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The November election will undoubtedly witness impassioned
disagreements over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China already enjoys most-favored-nation trading rights with the
United States and a mushrooming trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AT CENTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging China as a potential adversary, McCain wants to link
membership in the World Trade Organization with domestic
liberalization in China. Rather than remain in a state of Clinton
self-denial, Conservative Realists want China to broaden universal
rights, grant religious freedom and cease political repression
before granting it equal representation in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Bush or McCain becomes the GOP
presidential contender, China will become the center of gravity of
the foreign-policy debates. For most of the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House, from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan
and George Bush, the Cold War raged and Republicans looked tougher
on the Soviet Union than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evil Empire'' has disappeared, the bipolar world is a
theme of the past, but the Republicans have also suffered their
losses: They can no longer appear as the knights of anti-communism.
To reinvent their image as Sir Lancelot slaying the Red Dragon,
they are trying to paint Beijing as the Second KGB. Abiding by the
philosophy of ``Wag the Dog,'' if a war does not exist, then it is
necessary to invent one.

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, THE DEMOCRATIC WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (LAST IN A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES. ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A'' e
 &UR; CATEGORY  &UR; - RESENDING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 AND INHERITING-3
 &UR; FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE. The author
 &UR; examines the Democratic ``Liberal Moralist'' and ``Liberal
 &UR; Realist'' positions in the debate over the direction of American
 &UR; foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The American people are undergoing an out-of-body experience:
History is repeating itself, and they have been transferred back to
1920 and the battle waged by Woodrow Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge
over America's entry into the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wanted both to make the world ``safe for democracy'' and
for the United States to obey the covenant of the League of
Nations, irrespective of national self-interest. His opponent was
Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
although Lodge favored America's entry into the League, he wished
to modify certain articles as a means of preserving U.S. national
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to make any concessions and, in 1920, the League
went down to defeat. The conservatives of 2000 are the spiritual
descendants of Lodge, while present-day liberals inherit the legacy
of Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a liberal moralist, Clintonian foreign policy is an amalgam
of Wilson, Jimmy Carter's ``universal human rights'' and reaction
against the Vietnam War with its rejection of unilateral action by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation in 1993, Clintonian diplomacy shattered
the boundaries of the containment of Communism theory articulated
by George F. Kennan, a foreign-policy expert and diplomat, at the
beginning of the Cold War. Essentially a strategy to halt further
imperialism of the Stalinist empire, containment theory limited the
extension of American power to the Elbe, which, from 1947 to 1990,
was the eastern border of Germany. &QL; 
NATO EXPANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy committed itself to the enlargement of
the horizon of democracy, and Clinton pursued this goal on two
fronts: expansion of NATO in Europe and support of Boris Yeltsin in
Russia. When Clinton embarked on the jihad of making the world safe
for democracy, he not only embraced this aspect of Wilsonism but
capitulated to the arguments of Anthony Lake, his first national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine brought Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary into NATO. By including these three countries under the
NATO umbrella, the United States committed itself to the defense of
countries it never previously considered within its own sphere of
national self-interest. This enormous broadening of American
guarantees was justified under the principle of missionary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding NATO, Clinton broke American implied agreements
with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``A World Transformed,'' written by George
Bush, who was president at the time of the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's
national security adviser, is unequivocal on this point: At no time
did Bush, Scowcroft, or Secretary of State James Baker indicate to
Gorbachev that NATO would be extended eastward to Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary after the Soviets voluntarily renounced their
title to these tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward Yeltsin was another case of missionary
democracy. The Clinton administration adamantly supported Yeltsin
on the grounds that he was leading the democratic capitalist
transformation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeltsin's resignation from office and the crowning of
Vladimir Putin as his successor is a serious setback for the
Clinton doctrine. Putin's recent alliance with the Communists
belies the assertion that democracy is functioning in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Hamilton, Democratic loyalist, respected former
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and current
director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Putin's recent coalition
with the Communists ``amounts to a defeat for Clinton, for it
strengthens the power of the Communists in the Duma.'' &QL; 
PUSHING MULTILATERALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Wilson ideal that the Clinton doctrine continues is that
American diplomacy should unfold within multilateral institutions.
Liberal moralists are suspicious of unilateral actions because they
fear it will give rise to worldwide anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the fact that recent ventures in which America
acted under the aegis of the United Nations _ such as in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo _ all appear to be failures, the
White House still upholds the usefulness of multilateralism. The
Oval Office fears the bully backlash _ that other nations will
express their resentment against the paramountcy of the United
States by opposing American policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of liberal moralism to which the Clinton
doctrine abides is free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal moralism wishes to turn the movement toward economic
globalization to an advantage for the United States, and so Clinton
has devoted much effort to the reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wishes to use trade as a form of social engineering,
because he hopes that free trade will encourage the growth of a
capitalist entrepreneurial class in countries making the transition
out of communism, like China. Borrowing a phrase from his former
economic adviser, Andrea Tyson, Clinton thinks in terms of
``strategic trade,'' or trade with a deeper purpose than just
making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In its approach to China, the Clinton doctrine combines the
strategic trade and the ``strategic partner'' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the strategic partner is to detach China from any
``anti-hegemonist'' bloc alliance. Primarily, this means preventing
the re-creation of the Cold War Sino-Soviet coalition. &QL; 
OVAL OFFICE'S PLAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hook of strategic trade is associated with the universal
human-rights theory of Carter. By its use of strategic trade, the
Oval Office hopes to ensnare President Jiang Zemin into granting
more ``human rights'' to Chinese citizens. The ultimate aim of
trans-Pacific social engineering is to both speed the development
of a commercial middle class in China and to provide these
entrepreneurs with the protective shield of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives of all camps attack the Clinton doctrine on China
as a contradiction between rewards and punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting upon the differences that separate Republicans and
Democrats, Democratic loyalist Hamilton told ``The Arizona
Republic,'' ``Republicans are very skeptical of international
organizations, such as the U.N., the World Trade Organization and
the like. Democrats generally support these multilateral
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a monopolar world in the social and economic
sense. Even though the U.S. is the only superpower in the military
or `hard' sense, it cannot dictate to all nations of the globe in
matters of gender, children, values or culture. In terms of `soft'
power _ education, information and trade, this is a multipolar
world and the U.S. must learn to act in conjunction with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that the most important lever of
diplomatic power has changed from `hard' to `soft' power. To me,
trade is the crucial issue.'' &QL; 
PARTY SPLIT ON POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tend to stress military power,'' Hamilton
added. ``I am an unrepentant free-trader because I believe that
unrestricted trade, from which all sides benefit, is the best way
to export the democratic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But policies are divisive ones within the Democratic Party. To
hold the presidency again in November, Democrats desperately need
the support of American labor, and the AFL-CIO has already endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. Nevertheless, a divorce has taken place
between the corporatist and labor wings of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatists favor strategic trade and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, because they will be the ``winners''
from the globalization of trade, while Big Labor is opposed to
these policies, because they will be the ``losers'' when domestic
wages are repressed. The Seattle meeting of the World Trade
Organization ended in chaos when Big Labor and environmentalists
led street demonstrations demanding environmental protections, an
end to child labor in China and other Asian countries and
improvement of working conditions before any further reduction of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of China and world trade will be hotly debated along
partisan lines when Congress is called on to approve China's entry
into the World Trade Organization in the fall, and they will play a
major role in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already become a victim of the Democratic dependency on
Big Labor. Gore suffers from a split personality: one face as vice
president and the other as party candidate. As vice president, he
speaks in favor of the Clinton doctrine, but as candidate he must
massage the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Gore's divided personality made the front pages
when the AFL-CIO criticized him for placing the reduction of
tariffs before the increase of wages, the growth of labor unions
and the end of sweat shops in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Gore's problems with the labor unions, he is also a
Liberal Moralist. In the war of words currently waged in opinion
journals, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations
at Harvard University, has acted as the vice president's script
writer. In an article in the March/April issue of ``Foreign
Affairs,'' Walt has written a Democratic response to the Republican
broadsides that were published by ``Foreign Affairs'' in the
previous issue. The vice president's proxy only proved that on
foreign affairs, Gore is a clone of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is also a Liberal Moralist and although there are
no significant differences between Gore and Clinton, there are
important divisions between Gore-Clinton and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Clinton favor an increase in the defense budget, but
Bradley advocates a cut in appropriations for the Defense
Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the
spinning-wheel Third World.  &QL; 
`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

REPUBLICAN FOREIGN-POLICY PERSPECTIVES: MORALISTS VS. REALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVING IN ``K'' CATEGORY. / SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE)
 &UR; The author examines the Republican ``Conservative Moralist'' and
 &UR; ``Conservative Realist'' positions in the debate over the
 &UR; direction of American foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Foreign Policy Debate of 2000 is a cascade of ink not
limited to the battle of the journals. It has become a bonanza as
well for the publishing industry as authors from different research
institutes flood bookstores and libraries with their tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious outlet for discussions of international
affairs is the bimonthly magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' which
specializes in the disputations of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace, and his intellectual soul mate, Bill Kristol, editor of
the ``Weekly Standard'' journal, co-wrote an article in ``Foreign
Affairs''called ``Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,'' in which
they wrote: ``Finally, American foreign policy should be informed
with a clear moral purpose, based on the understanding that its
moral goals and its fundamental national interest are almost in
harmony . . . The remoralization of America at home ultimately
requires the remoralization of American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   `GREAT FATHER FIGURE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows that democracies do not fight each other,''
writes Robert Kagan, who may be considered the leading advocate of
the Conservative Moralist congregation. ``American democracy should
be expansionary, and the U.S. should be more assertive and activist
in enlarging the frontiers of democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Ronald Reagan as the great father figure of American
foreign policy. Not only was Reagan skeptical of international
organizations, but he also understood the necessity for the U.S. to
act unilaterally and to intervene into the affairs of another
country on the grounds of American national interest. Reagan had an
intuitive grasp of hard power, or military force.''
</P>
<P>
   REALISM AND MORALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kagan traces his intellectual ancestry to Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join realism and moralism,'' Kagan said, ``and so did Teddy
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson, for all his genius, even though he
desired to make the `world safe for democracy,' was willing to
sacrifice American sovereignty to a world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``TR (Teddy Roosevelt) would not have done that, but recognized
the need to use U.S. power unilaterally to spread American ideas
and values. Reagan was part of the TR (Roosevelt) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, has published a book, ``Freedom Betrayed,'' that reads
like a hymn to the American system.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ledeen, the democratic revolution has passed
through two periods: The first was the American Revolution of 1776,
and the second is America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A proselytizing Democrat, Ledeen attaches himself to the Wilson
who sought to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' and ``Freedom
Betrayed'' presents the United States as a revolutionary power, a
``chosen nation'' for converting the world to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of Conservative Moralists is open to theological
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan, Kristol and Ledeen abandon the principles of George
Kennan's ``containment policy'' through which America won the Cold
War. The containment policy was essentially a static program, for
it conformed to a bipolar world, and it assumed that both the
Soviet Union and the United States would remain on their sides of
the Iron Curtain, while Washington waited for the decay of
Stalinist Communist imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood of Conservative Moralism wants to replace the
static nature of the containment policy with a form of democratic
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the post-Cold War world is a monopolar one in which
the United State is preeminent, that limits to American
expansionism no longer exist, this College of Cardinals seeks to
root the democratic flag in such far-away places as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (countries that few Americans even know
are on the map) _ all of which, not incidentally, are enormously
rich in oil and natural-gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign-policy gurus have not proved their claim that
unilateral intervention into the affairs of a sovereign country is
an effective means of installing democracy in a nation. Government
through the consent of the people arises only when other supportive
institutions exist, such as a free press, an independent judiciary
and a population committed to the principles of civil rights, and
these cannot be imposed by paratroopers descending from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY OR CAPITALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the prophets of Conservative Moralism do not clearly
indicate which they wish to export _ democracy or capitalism.
Michael Ledeen, however, does have the courage of his faith, for he
wishes to export the Reagan Republican Platform of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freedom Betrayed,''Ledeen defines the democratic
revolution: ``Today it means waging war against the growing power
of the preeminent modern institution: state bureaucracy . . That is
why the call to slash the size of government is such an integral
part of the democratic revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between the American Constitution and
the Republican platform of 1980: Although it is patriotism to ask
American soldiers to fight for the Constitution, it is bottomless
greed to ask them to fight to imperialize the Reagan 1980 campaign
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to position itself as the final arbiter of the Great
Debate, ``Foreign Affairs'' has devoted its January-February 2000
issue to the Republican side of this argument. In this issue,
Condoleezza Rice wrote the lead article, ``Promoting the National
Interest,'' an exposition of the Conservative Realist position. In
the March/April 2000 issue, ``Foreign Affairs''will follow up with
the Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   NATION COMES FIRST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice has deep roots in the Bush dynasty because she worked as a
Russian specialist on the National Security Council under President
Bush and presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft. A book by Bush and
Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed,'' refers to her as extremely
competent and knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emphasizing one of the major principles of Conservative
Realism, Rice upholds the primacy of national interest over
international organizations and norms. The theory of ``universal
human rights'' is a wonderful ideal, but here also national
interest takes priority over the banner of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russia, Rice supports the expansion of NATO to
include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The United States
should not be deterred by Russian anger because of the ballooning
of NATO into real estate once controlled by Soviet armies.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet specialist to Bush favors U.S. support for the
continued independence of the Ukraine and other countries in
Central Asia that seek to protect their sovereignty from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   REBUILD MILITARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea region is of vital importance for U.S. interests
because of its huge oil and natural-gas reserves. In this region of
the globe, the policy of containing the Soviet Union is replaced by
the policy of dismembering Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing President Clinton for cutting the defense budget,
Rice wants to rebuild the military to throw out the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians and construct a
national missile-defense system. The defeat of the renewal of the
1992 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was correct. In the last
analysis, it is ``hard power,'' the persuasiveness of the bullet,
that determines the fate of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rice favors U.S. participation in all international
organizations because such collaboration is an advantage to the
national interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she favors continued U.S. participation in the
World Trade Organization, because she favors opening markets for
U.S. exports. Trade is an important instrument of U.S. foreign
policy, and the international reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers represents a gain to the United States because it helps
create an entrepreneurial capitalist class in whatever nation
becomes a partner in these commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with China, the former national security adviser
believes, is in American national self-interest because it will
speed economic liberalization, and the emergence of an aggressive
capitalist phalanx could act as the springboard for the sprouting
of political democracy. Unlike Clinton, however, Rice does not view
China as a ``strategic partner'' but as a ``strategic competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Realists want to maintain Taiwanese
independence, and they image themselves as the party of the right
on the China issue. In essence, they want to create an East Asian
``rollback theory'' in the style of John Foster Dulles, keeping
China out of Taiwan and forcing China out of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   CEASE BEING WORLD'S POLICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her new position at Stanford University, Rice launched has
her most spirited diatribes against the Clinton administration on
the question of humanitarian intervention. She points to the
failure of such action in Haiti and to the ineffectiveness of
multilateral humanitarian intervention in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States exerts hard hegemonic power in the
world, it should not act as the earth's ``globocop.'' Rice does not
believe that it is within the national interest of the United
States to play the universal gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Rice an authoritative voice from the Conservative
Realist pew, but the probable ghostwriter on foreign policy for
Gov. George W. Bush. There is no difference in substance between
the Rice essay and a speech on America's position in the world that
Bush gave to kick off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
Reagan, agrees with Rice, particularly on the need to protect U.S.
sovereignty and to build an anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was defeated,''
Kirkpatrick confessed. ``I worked for five years at the U.N., and I
can tell you that votes in the General Assembly are often stampeded
and ill-informed. There are over 150 members in the General
Assembly, and the vast majority have no experience with nuclear
weapons, and so their votes are not based on fact or experience. It
is wrong to give such a body a literal veto over American
armaments, defense and national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall discussing the issue of the anti-ballistic missile
defense system with Ronald Reagan. The president looked upon a
system which could prevent an attack as a moral imperative because
it would prevent incalculable carnage. He believed that the policy
of MAD _ mutually assured destruction _ was immoral because it left
open the possibility of attack and cataclysmic bloodshed. To be
able to deter such an attack was equal to defending against
unprecedented inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN BEEFS UP HIS TEAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also a member of the Conservative Realist
choir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has added some illustrious names to his
foreign-policy team. Other notable foreign-policy sages now stand
alongside Henry Kissinger in the ex-Navy pilot's camp, and they
include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Larry Eagleberger, Kirkpatrick and R.
James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner of war also looks suspiciously upon mainland
China. Although McCain supports the maintainence of normal trade
relations with China, he looks upon that country of 1.2 billion
people as a rival to the United State in the Pacific Rim, and he
stands firmly for continued independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The November election will undoubtedly witness impassioned
disagreements over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China already enjoys most-favored-nation trading rights with the
United States and a mushrooming trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AT CENTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging China as a potential adversary, McCain wants to link
membership in the World Trade Organization with domestic
liberalization in China. Rather than remain in a state of Clinton
self-denial, Conservative Realists want China to broaden universal
rights, grant religious freedom and cease political repression
before granting it equal representation in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Bush or McCain becomes the GOP
presidential contender, China will become the center of gravity of
the foreign-policy debates. For most of the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House, from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan
and George Bush, the Cold War raged and Republicans looked tougher
on the Soviet Union than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evil Empire'' has disappeared, the bipolar world is a
theme of the past, but the Republicans have also suffered their
losses: They can no longer appear as the knights of anti-communism.
To reinvent their image as Sir Lancelot slaying the Red Dragon,
they are trying to paint Beijing as the Second KGB. Abiding by the
philosophy of ``Wag the Dog,'' if a war does not exist, then it is
necessary to invent one.

COACH SAYS YOU NEED A TIME OUT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday March 2)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I understand paying someone who is meeting you at the gym and
worries about your hamstrings as much as you do.
</P>
<P>
   And I understand why it might be a good idea to have a personal
guide when shopping in order to keep the mother of the bride away
from leopard prints.
</P>
<P>
   There are many things about which someone else knows best.
Advisers are important. What would we do without that friend we can
call to ask, ``Tell me again why I wanted to be a blonde?''
</P>
<P>
   Now people are acquiring a personal coach, to help them organize
all aspects of their overwrought life. At first I wondered, why add
one more person to your life when you don't have time for the ones
already in it?
</P>
<P>
   Then I went to lunch with Lotty, a woman who used to never take
time to eat out. A self-described overworked overachiever, she
swears she's a new woman since gaining a coach whose goal is to get
Lotty's personal and professional life in balance.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of a professional coach is to help you figure out what
you want in your life and why in your attempts you've become
addled, snappish and no fun anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Lotty, who from all accounts used to be a lot of fun even after
she gave up motorcycles, said in the past few years all she's done
is work. She does a lot of her job at home and one of the problems
with that is there's no one to say ``You're losing it. Let's knock
off for a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   She generally gets up at 4:30 a.m. and goes to her computer
where she sits in her pajamas until 4:30 p.m. after which she pulls
on some clothes and then drives into town to the office.
</P>
<P>
   She said the main reason she sought out a coach, whom she
describes as a ``gorgeous brilliant MBA with diplomatic skills,''
was to get better at her job, which for all the time she spent at
it, never seemed to get done.
</P>
<P>
   Those who've watched this trend grow and who predict that
eventually as many of us will have personal coaches as personal
fitness trainers, say the coach is part consultant, therapist,
motivational speaker and paid friend.
</P>
<P>
   You would like to think we should be able to do this without
paying for it but apparently we can't.
</P>
<P>
   Lotty's coach honed in on the problem of her wanting to be queen
of the hop. She got Lotty to delegate responsibility, give up some
control and modify some of her expectations for herself and her
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time she told Lotty to play. And she gave her a
way to rationalize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said I was working much too hard and with my level of
stress I couldn't be efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotty pays a bunch of money for that kind of wisdom. There's
something about advice that comes with a price tag. If your mother
says you're working too hard, she's just being mom, but if an
expert gives you permission to slack off and then says, ``that will
be $100,'' you listen.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one of Lotty's coach's tips for free. Give yourself one
hour every day to do something that is fun and good for you.
Because of the ``good for you'' part, that probably cuts out eating
a pizza, but maybe not. It certainly doesn't mean doing your taxes
while you're on the phone with a client and also keeping an eye on
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Lotty now pencils in one hour of fun every afternoon. Maybe she
reads something for pleasure or listens to music. The other day she
took her dogs for a walk in the rain and reported, ``It was
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Two people told me in the past week they've awakened at 3 in the
morning with heart pounding and panicked over how they were going
to finish a certain project. A friend says she feels like she has
one eye on one task and another looking at the next one. She's
working two jobs, looking in on ill parents, promoting a new book,
feeling guilty about not getting to yoga class and trying to enjoy
a new romance. It's not like these people want it all to go away.
</P>
<P>
   They're the kind who, if they won the lottery, would not give up
their planner, like the friend who, when she can't sleep, gets up
and starts writing a new novel.
</P>
<P>
   Or Lotty, who says, ``It's a huge job. I have so much to do. And
I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend she went to San Francisco with friends. ``It was
just for fun,'' she said, ``something I would never have done a
year ago before I had my coach.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also carrying a smaller purse, which is only big enough
for her sunglasses, keys and some money. No room for a pager or
cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Her coach has also told her it's time to start dating again.
</P>
<P>
   Yay, coach.

 I LOVE A MAN MY FAMILY WILL NOT ACCEPT  
 By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: I'm 17 years old and I've had a few boyfriends.
The guy I'm interested in now is 26 years old and lives in Texas.
He's been my pen pal for more than a year. We've discovered that we
love each other.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, I'm planning on meeting him. Recently he's brought
up the subject of sex. When I go down there, would it be wrong if I
did have sex with him?
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother, I'm sure, would not approve. She says that we
should be friends for two years. I'm sure that back in her day,
young people had sex when they were in love, even though she denies
it. _ W.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I'm not sure of your question. Are you expecting me to
give you permission to have sex with someone you've never met? If
so, you may have come to the wrong psychologist. Regardless, let me
talk you through your situation.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's wonderful that you have a pen pal, and you're
exploring your emotions at arm's length. I would probably be as
excited as you are about meeting him for the first time, but slow
down a bit!
</P>
<P>
   When you meet your pen pal, you should not stay with him. A
chaperoned visit _ perhaps with a friend _ may make you feel a
little safer. The fact is, you don't know this guy. You know the
fantasy of who you hope is, and he knows what his fantasy is of
you. The real people have yet to meet.
</P>
<P>
   My problem with the two of you having sex is not only the age
difference _ in certain states you are legally considered a minor
and he could be accused of statutory rape _ or that you don't
really know him. The fact is _ even if you are madly in love with
him _ after the visit, you will return to finish high school and
he'll go back to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The safest way for the two of you to maintain a long distance
relationship is without sex. It's fine to fantasize, but for right
now I suggest that you get to know each other better _ and not in
the biblical sense. No sex!
</P>
<P>
   The first time you have sex with someone should be very special
and you don't want it to be with a stranger. You want to feel that
you know this person.
</P>
<P>
   I know that you feel you do know him, but take your time. I
promise that you when you do have sex for the first time, whether
it's with this man or not, you want to feel that the person will be
there for you, not only that night, but the next morning and,
hopefully, for a long while to come.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: In June of this year, I found out that my husband
of two years was married to another women in Ohio. When he found
out that I knew, he put a gun to my head and threatened to kill me.
</P>
<P>
   I escaped from this Gulf War veteran and am losing mostly
everything in the divorce due to the fact that nothing was in my
name. I have lost my husband and my sense of security. I have
gotten no help from lawyers. Do you have any advice to help me pull
my life back together? _ J.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: The good news is that you have gotten out of that
situation. You need to stay away from men for a while. My guess is
that you don't trust your judgment anymore.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how long you knew this charm school graduate before
you married him. I suspect not very long. For right now, you need
to focus on being self-sufficient. Understand that all of us have
been fools for love at one time or another, but it is important not
to continue the pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Find a job if you don't have one. Become emotionally and
financially self-sufficient and give yourself some time.
</P>
<P>
   Now is a great time for you to take a course or do some
volunteer activities. You'll feel smarter and a lot more useful.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Here's a tip for everyone involved in transporting illegal drugs
over interstate lines: Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia says
buy hard luggage.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in the context of things state agents can and cannot do
to you under the Fourth Amendment prohibition against
``unreasonable searches and seizures.''
</P>
<P>
   The current jurisprudence of criminal procedure holds that a
police/border patrol/FBI agent may:
</P>
<P>
   _Conduct a search of your home, body, or personal effects if
they have a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   _Conduct a frisk or ``pat-down'' of your body without your
consent or a warrant if you have given them ``reasonable
suspicion'' to do so.
</P>
<P>
   _Peek into your open windows and/or root through your garbage
cans without your consent or a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   _Detain you at the border but only to question you or check
citizenship status.
</P>
<P>
   _Fly over your backyard in their big, black ``X-Files''
helicopters looking for your hash crop without consent or a
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   _Give your luggage to Cheech the drug-sniffing dog without
consent or a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The things police cannot do to you and your bags, absent your
consent or a warrant, are measured against your ``reasonable
expectation of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's case before the Supreme Court, Bond vs. United States,
was about whether you have a reasonable expectation of privacy when
you place your drugs in the overhead compartment of a Greyhound
bus.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dewayne Bond and his drugs left California on a bus
traveling to Arkansas at approximately 65 miles an hour. Bond had a
``brick'' of methamphetamine in a soft bag he stowed in the
overhead compartment. The bus was pulled over in Texas and border
patrol agent Cesar Cantu boarded the bus for a routine immigration
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   As you know from the handy guide above, Cantu's behavior was
limited to asking questions and checking documents. But once he did
so, Cantu made his way back to the front of the bus, squeezing and
feeling the luggage in the overhead compartments.
</P>
<P>
   Cantu felt Bond's brick and grew suspicious, Bond consented to a
search, drugs were found, and Bond confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Bond tried to suppress the drugs (and resulting confession) on
the grounds that Cantu's fondling of his bag violated his Fourth
Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches. Both the
district court and the Fifth Circuit disagreed, and Bond got 57
months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The question before the Supreme Court Tuesday was whether public
bag-squeezing by state officials constitutes a search under the
Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The court must locate this case within a continuum of existing
case law by deciding whether Cantu's act was closer to permissible
garbage-rooting or impermissible frisking. And that will turn on
the rather mushy notion of what we consider ``private'' when we
take our bodies and our stuff out for walks in public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Bond's attorney, Carolyn Fuentes, tries to analogize the Bond
facts to a frisk. She says we expect people to move our luggage on
overhead racks, but we have no expectation they will squeeze and
feel it, just as we don't expect strangers to squeeze and feel us
(unless we're in Paris).
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Scalia is itching to put forth his ``reasonable
expectation of privacy'' theory, and it's this: We don't expect
reasonable, polite people to squeeze our overhead bags any more
than we expect reasonable, polite people to peep in our windows.
</P>
<P>
   But, he continues, the privacy standard isn't limited to our
expectations of nice people. He hypothesizes ``nasty passengers''
who joyfully squeeze strangers' bags. Why have an expectation of
privacy that excludes them?
</P>
<P>
   (Scalia returns to this theme several times and it puzzles me
does he really believe the world to be so teeming with nasty
bag-squeezers that they create a reasonable social expectation that
it happens?)
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer, inspired perhaps by Bond's unsolicited
confession to Cantu, almost immediately confesses that he
frequently flies to Boston and pushes other people's bags around
the overhead bins in order to shove his own in. He asks how one can
expect privacy in those bags if everyone is moving them.
</P>
<P>
   To prove that irony is alive and thriving in the Supreme Court,
Bond asserts that Cantu's search was excessive because his drugs
were so well disguised _ the brick was wrapped in duct tape until
the package was oval. Then wrapped in a pair of pants. Then packed
in a canvas bag.
</P>
<P>
   Cantu's search had to have been wildly intrusive to discern the
brick under all that illegal concealment of an illegal substance.
Fuentes gets impressively aggrieved on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia tells her flat out that if she's asking for a test based
on ``degree of manipulation,'' he's unlikely to go along. Kennedy
is bothered because the case law says the subjective purpose of the
searcher is irrelevant, yet Fuentes' test seems to require it. She
replies that the case is not about the ``motive'' of the squeezer
but the ``manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, we may reasonably expect strangers to move our
bags for any number of reasons but not to ``squeeze and shake''
them, as Cantu did. Put another way, Bond's contention is that bags
should only be stirred, not shaken.
</P>
<P>
   It's at this point that Scalia interrupts to tell Fuentes that
he'd ``feel a lot sorrier for your client if there weren't an easy
way to avoid this. It's called hard luggage.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony Kennedy is hung up on the fact that Bond never
asked Cantu to stop searching his bag and is unimpressed when
Fuentes suggests border guards tend to have a rather intimidating
air of authority. Kennedy asks how you can have a reasonable
expectation of privacy if you refuse to avail yourself of the power
to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia cuts in to ask whether fellow passengers have the right
to sniff your luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey A. Lamken represents the solicitor general's office, and
he reels off long, long sentences, frequently without breathing. He
almost immediately gets tangled up in a colloquy with Kennedy over
whether Bond might have some civil tort remedies against
bag-squeezers. He says Bond has suffered no harm. Kennedy tells him
Bond's attorney will probably beg to differ since her client is in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   A gloriously funny moment arrives when Scalia asks: Suppose
identifying the item in the bag would have required pulling and
squeezing beyond foreseeable pulling or grabbing by other
passengers? Since honesty is a virtue, Lamken replies, ``Then we
would lose.'' To which Scalia rejoins, ``Then you may lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Souter tries to press him on the difference between
``touching and looking'' for Fourth Amendment purposes. We
reasonably expect strangers to look at us or our stuff. We do not
expect them to touch us.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy wonders if the issue is the length of time the officer
takes to manipulate the bag. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asks him
to read something from the record, and Lamken scrambles to find it,
emitting a sigh so loud it almost wakes Justice Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer warns (echoing Scalia's earlier point) that it would be
``a mistake to generate a jurisprudence of hard squeezes.'' Unless
this is Charmin Court.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens reels off a list of hypotheticals that
leave Lamken breathless: What if Bond kept his bag in his lap
(can't touch); what if he kept it under the seat (also can't
touch); well what if he was sharing the space under the seat (still
can't)? What, Stevens asks, about that shared compartment
underneath the bus?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not understanding the situation you're describing,''
replies Lamken.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never ride on buses? Only airplanes?'' asks Stevens.
Lamken replies that this compartment can presumably be searched if
other passengers touch the bags.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia: ``How about if only the driver can touch the bags? If he
takes them out, one by one. 'Jones! Jones!' This is a slow bus.''
Lamken looks like he's been beaten to within an inch of his life
with blunt hypotheticals.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the court draws the line between ``good touch'' and
``bad touch'' today, one pragmatic point is clear: If you ever have
to pick which justice to sit beside on a plane, go with Ginsburg.
Breyer is a self-confessed luggage-mover, and Scalia may well be a
closet luggage-sniffer.

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD
 WAR 
</HEADLINE>

 RETRANSMITTING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 and INHERITING-3 FOR
 THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE BY NORMAN
 LEVINE 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

   &UR; (ALSO MOVING IN ``K'' CATEGORY. / SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE)
 &UR; The author examines the Republican ``Conservative Moralist'' and
 &UR; ``Conservative Realist'' positions in the debate over the
 &UR; direction of American foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Foreign Policy Debate of 2000 is a cascade of ink not
limited to the battle of the journals. It has become a bonanza as
well for the publishing industry as authors from different research
institutes flood bookstores and libraries with their tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious outlet for discussions of international
affairs is the bimonthly magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' which
specializes in the disputations of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace, and his intellectual soul mate, Bill Kristol, editor of
the ``Weekly Standard'' journal, co-wrote an article in ``Foreign
Affairs''called ``Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,'' in which
they wrote: ``Finally, American foreign policy should be informed
with a clear moral purpose, based on the understanding that its
moral goals and its fundamental national interest are almost in
harmony . . . The remoralization of America at home ultimately
requires the remoralization of American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   `GREAT FATHER FIGURE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows that democracies do not fight each other,''
writes Robert Kagan, who may be considered the leading advocate of
the Conservative Moralist congregation. ``American democracy should
be expansionary, and the U.S. should be more assertive and activist
in enlarging the frontiers of democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Ronald Reagan as the great father figure of American
foreign policy. Not only was Reagan skeptical of international
organizations, but he also understood the necessity for the U.S. to
act unilaterally and to intervene into the affairs of another
country on the grounds of American national interest. Reagan had an
intuitive grasp of hard power, or military force.''
</P>
<P>
   REALISM AND MORALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kagan traces his intellectual ancestry to Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join realism and moralism,'' Kagan said, ``and so did Teddy
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson, for all his genius, even though he
desired to make the `world safe for democracy,' was willing to
sacrifice American sovereignty to a world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``TR (Teddy Roosevelt) would not have done that, but recognized
the need to use U.S. power unilaterally to spread American ideas
and values. Reagan was part of the TR (Roosevelt) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, has published a book, ``Freedom Betrayed,'' that reads
like a hymn to the American system.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ledeen, the democratic revolution has passed
through two periods: The first was the American Revolution of 1776,
and the second is America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A proselytizing Democrat, Ledeen attaches himself to the Wilson
who sought to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' and ``Freedom
Betrayed'' presents the United States as a revolutionary power, a
``chosen nation'' for converting the world to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of Conservative Moralists is open to theological
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan, Kristol and Ledeen abandon the principles of George
Kennan's ``containment policy'' through which America won the Cold
War. The containment policy was essentially a static program, for
it conformed to a bipolar world, and it assumed that both the
Soviet Union and the United States would remain on their sides of
the Iron Curtain, while Washington waited for the decay of
Stalinist Communist imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood of Conservative Moralism wants to replace the
static nature of the containment policy with a form of democratic
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the post-Cold War world is a monopolar one in which
the United State is preeminent, that limits to American
expansionism no longer exist, this College of Cardinals seeks to
root the democratic flag in such far-away places as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (countries that few Americans even know
are on the map) _ all of which, not incidentally, are enormously
rich in oil and natural-gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign-policy gurus have not proved their claim that
unilateral intervention into the affairs of a sovereign country is
an effective means of installing democracy in a nation. Government
through the consent of the people arises only when other supportive
institutions exist, such as a free press, an independent judiciary
and a population committed to the principles of civil rights, and
these cannot be imposed by paratroopers descending from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY OR CAPITALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the prophets of Conservative Moralism do not clearly
indicate which they wish to export _ democracy or capitalism.
Michael Ledeen, however, does have the courage of his faith, for he
wishes to export the Reagan Republican Platform of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freedom Betrayed,''Ledeen defines the democratic
revolution: ``Today it means waging war against the growing power
of the preeminent modern institution: state bureaucracy . . That is
why the call to slash the size of government is such an integral
part of the democratic revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between the American Constitution and
the Republican platform of 1980: Although it is patriotism to ask
American soldiers to fight for the Constitution, it is bottomless
greed to ask them to fight to imperialize the Reagan 1980 campaign
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to position itself as the final arbiter of the Great
Debate, ``Foreign Affairs'' has devoted its January-February 2000
issue to the Republican side of this argument. In this issue,
Condoleezza Rice wrote the lead article, ``Promoting the National
Interest,'' an exposition of the Conservative Realist position. In
the March/April 2000 issue, ``Foreign Affairs''will follow up with
the Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   NATION COMES FIRST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice has deep roots in the Bush dynasty because she worked as a
Russian specialist on the National Security Council under President
Bush and presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft. A book by Bush and
Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed,'' refers to her as extremely
competent and knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emphasizing one of the major principles of Conservative
Realism, Rice upholds the primacy of national interest over
international organizations and norms. The theory of ``universal
human rights'' is a wonderful ideal, but here also national
interest takes priority over the banner of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russia, Rice supports the expansion of NATO to
include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The United States
should not be deterred by Russian anger because of the ballooning
of NATO into real estate once controlled by Soviet armies.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet specialist to Bush favors U.S. support for the
continued independence of the Ukraine and other countries in
Central Asia that seek to protect their sovereignty from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   REBUILD MILITARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea region is of vital importance for U.S. interests
because of its huge oil and natural-gas reserves. In this region of
the globe, the policy of containing the Soviet Union is replaced by
the policy of dismembering Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing President Clinton for cutting the defense budget,
Rice wants to rebuild the military to throw out the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians and construct a
national missile-defense system. The defeat of the renewal of the
1992 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was correct. In the last
analysis, it is ``hard power,'' the persuasiveness of the bullet,
that determines the fate of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rice favors U.S. participation in all international
organizations because such collaboration is an advantage to the
national interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she favors continued U.S. participation in the
World Trade Organization, because she favors opening markets for
U.S. exports. Trade is an important instrument of U.S. foreign
policy, and the international reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers represents a gain to the United States because it helps
create an entrepreneurial capitalist class in whatever nation
becomes a partner in these commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with China, the former national security adviser
believes, is in American national self-interest because it will
speed economic liberalization, and the emergence of an aggressive
capitalist phalanx could act as the springboard for the sprouting
of political democracy. Unlike Clinton, however, Rice does not view
China as a ``strategic partner'' but as a ``strategic competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Realists want to maintain Taiwanese
independence, and they image themselves as the party of the right
on the China issue. In essence, they want to create an East Asian
``rollback theory'' in the style of John Foster Dulles, keeping
China out of Taiwan and forcing China out of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   CEASE BEING WORLD'S POLICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her new position at Stanford University, Rice launched has
her most spirited diatribes against the Clinton administration on
the question of humanitarian intervention. She points to the
failure of such action in Haiti and to the ineffectiveness of
multilateral humanitarian intervention in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States exerts hard hegemonic power in the
world, it should not act as the earth's ``globocop.'' Rice does not
believe that it is within the national interest of the United
States to play the universal gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Rice an authoritative voice from the Conservative
Realist pew, but the probable ghostwriter on foreign policy for
Gov. George W. Bush. There is no difference in substance between
the Rice essay and a speech on America's position in the world that
Bush gave to kick off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
Reagan, agrees with Rice, particularly on the need to protect U.S.
sovereignty and to build an anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was defeated,''
Kirkpatrick confessed. ``I worked for five years at the U.N., and I
can tell you that votes in the General Assembly are often stampeded
and ill-informed. There are over 150 members in the General
Assembly, and the vast majority have no experience with nuclear
weapons, and so their votes are not based on fact or experience. It
is wrong to give such a body a literal veto over American
armaments, defense and national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall discussing the issue of the anti-ballistic missile
defense system with Ronald Reagan. The president looked upon a
system which could prevent an attack as a moral imperative because
it would prevent incalculable carnage. He believed that the policy
of MAD _ mutually assured destruction _ was immoral because it left
open the possibility of attack and cataclysmic bloodshed. To be
able to deter such an attack was equal to defending against
unprecedented inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN BEEFS UP HIS TEAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also a member of the Conservative Realist
choir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has added some illustrious names to his
foreign-policy team. Other notable foreign-policy sages now stand
alongside Henry Kissinger in the ex-Navy pilot's camp, and they
include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Larry Eagleberger, Kirkpatrick and R.
James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner of war also looks suspiciously upon mainland
China. Although McCain supports the maintainence of normal trade
relations with China, he looks upon that country of 1.2 billion
people as a rival to the United State in the Pacific Rim, and he
stands firmly for continued independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The November election will undoubtedly witness impassioned
disagreements over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China already enjoys most-favored-nation trading rights with the
United States and a mushrooming trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AT CENTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging China as a potential adversary, McCain wants to link
membership in the World Trade Organization with domestic
liberalization in China. Rather than remain in a state of Clinton
self-denial, Conservative Realists want China to broaden universal
rights, grant religious freedom and cease political repression
before granting it equal representation in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Bush or McCain becomes the GOP
presidential contender, China will become the center of gravity of
the foreign-policy debates. For most of the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House, from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan
and George Bush, the Cold War raged and Republicans looked tougher
on the Soviet Union than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evil Empire'' has disappeared, the bipolar world is a
theme of the past, but the Republicans have also suffered their
losses: They can no longer appear as the knights of anti-communism.
To reinvent their image as Sir Lancelot slaying the Red Dragon,
they are trying to paint Beijing as the Second KGB. Abiding by the
philosophy of ``Wag the Dog,'' if a war does not exist, then it is
necessary to invent one.

 IT'S NICE THAT YOU HAVE A PEN PAL, BUT SLOW DOWN A BIT  
 By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: I'm 17 years old and I've had a few boyfriends.
The guy I'm interested in now is 26 years old and lives in Texas.
He's been my pen pal for more than a year. We've discovered that we
love each other.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, I'm planning on meeting him. Recently he's brought
up the subject of sex. When I go down there, would it be wrong if I
did have sex with him?
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother, I'm sure, would not approve. She says that we
should be friends for two years. I'm sure that back in her day,
young people had sex when they were in love, even though she denies
it. _ W.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I'm not sure of your question. Are you expecting me to
give you permission to have sex with someone you've never met? If
so, you may have come to the wrong psychologist. Regardless, let me
talk you through your situation.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's wonderful that you have a pen pal, and you're
exploring your emotions at arm's length. I would probably be as
excited as you are about meeting him for the first time, but slow
down a bit!
</P>
<P>
   When you meet your pen pal, you should not stay with him. A
chaperoned visit _ perhaps with a friend _ may make you feel a
little safer. The fact is, you don't know this guy. You know the
fantasy of who you hope is, and he knows what his fantasy is of
you. The real people have yet to meet.
</P>
<P>
   My problem with the two of you having sex is not only the age
difference _ in certain states you are legally considered a minor
and he could be accused of statutory rape _ or that you don't
really know him. The fact is _ even if you are madly in love with
him _ after the visit, you will return to finish high school and
he'll go back to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The safest way for the two of you to maintain a long distance
relationship is without sex. It's fine to fantasize, but for right
now I suggest that you get to know each other better _ and not in
the biblical sense. No sex!
</P>
<P>
   The first time you have sex with someone should be very special
and you don't want it to be with a stranger. You want to feel that
you know this person.
</P>
<P>
   I know that you feel you do know him, but take your time. I
promise you that when you do have sex for the first time, whether
it's with this man or not, you want to feel that the person will be
there for you, not only that night, but the next morning and,
hopefully, for a long while to come.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: In June of this year, I found out that my husband
of two years was married to another women in Ohio. When he found
out that I knew, he put a gun to my head and threatened to kill me.
</P>
<P>
   I escaped from this Gulf War veteran and am losing mostly
everything in the divorce due to the fact that nothing was in my
name. I have lost my husband and my sense of security. I have
gotten no help from lawyers. Do you have any advice to help me pull
my life back together? _ J.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: The good news is that you have gotten out of that
situation. You need to stay away from men for a while. My guess is
that you don't trust your judgment anymore.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how long you knew this charm school graduate before
you married him. I suspect not very long. For right now, you need
to focus on being self-sufficient. Understand that all of us have
been fools for love at one time or another, but it is important not
to continue the pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Find a job if you don't have one. Become emotionally and
financially self-sufficient and give yourself some time.
</P>
<P>
   Now is a great time for you to take a course or do some
volunteer activities. You'll feel smarter and a lot more useful.
</P>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Vince Carter's day began at 1 a.m. when, outside the
Boston Harbor Hotel, he received a symbolic embrace from a group of
fans anxious to see him before he went to bed. His day ended _ at
about 9:30 Wednesday night _ almost the same way it began. This
time, he literally found himself in the arms of fans after making a
shot that turned the FleetCenter into a strange chamber of echoes,
gasps, and Pitino rage.
</P>
<P>
   Carter made a 23-foot corner 3-pointer at the buzzer to beat the
Celtics, 96-94. As he shot over Adrian Griffin, the 6-foot-6-inch
Toronto Raptor fell into the crowd as the ball fell into the net.
He was mobbed by fans and teammates. On a night full of irony, you
could say that Carter received love in Boston, the kind of love
that Rick Pitino wants the city to share with his team.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing what great players and their performances bring out
of people. Ten minutes after Carter's shot, Pitino stood at a
podium and said some words that he will surely regret. He lashed
out at the Boston media and ``some fans'' for negativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Bird is not walking through that door, fans,'' the coach
said. ``Kevin McHale is not walking through that door and Robert
Parish is not walking through that door. And if you expect them to
walk through that door, they're going to be gray and old.''
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting is that Pitino chose his words on Carter
Night. I think most Boston fans are smart enough and reasonable
enough to understand that the current Celtics don't have Big Three
capabilities. I would even argue that most fans would be less angry
about a 23-34 record if they had someone like Carter to watch for
41 home games a season.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't understand is how a coach with such a huge
contract can have such a weak record (78-111 in nearly three
seasons). They don't understand the skittish personnel decisions.
They don't understand playoff guarantees, followed by bad
basketball, followed by fan-directed anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had $90 million under the salary cap,'' he
continued. ``I wish we could buy the world. We can't. The only
thing we can do is work hard, and all this negativity that's in
this town sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino went on to mention Yaz, Cooz, Russell, and Rice. It was
sad to watch and listen to. It was insulting, too. Pitino has
nothing in common with the legends he mentioned. His situation is
different. He is being booed because he is not delivering what he
promised. When he arrived in Boston, the Raptors were worse than
the Celtics. His first team won 20 more games than the 1997-98
Raptors. Now, Canada will have a playoff team, leaving the Celtics
with the longest playoff drought in the Eastern Conference (five
seasons).
</P>
<P>
   Canada also has Air Canada, also known as the 23-year-old
Carter. As you can see, the second-year forward is an agitator on
several levels. If he repeats his performance Friday night in
Toronto, when the teams play again, Pitino just might announce his
resignation after the game. Carter may not be ready to fill the
league's vacant Jordan Suite, but the kid who grew up playing the
drums and saxophone is already a terrific player.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Carter entered the FleetCenter, it was obvious
that it would be a weird night. The first clue was in the Toronto
dressing room. Reporters crowded the area, trying to catch a
glimpse of this powerful dunker. What they saw was a
serious-looking kid in glasses. It was Carter. It appeared that he
was more prepared to do a scholarly study on dunks rather than
actually throwing a few down himself.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later he ran onto the court to applause. It was
6:45 p.m., 20 minutes before game time. You scanned the arena and
saw dollops of purple, mostly young people wearing Carter's
purple-and-black No. 15 Raptors jersey.
</P>
<P>
   When Carter ran onto the court for warmups, the first adoring
fan to shake his hand was Ryan Pitino, youngest son of Rick.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity would rise gradually from that moment until the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   First quarter: Carter opens the game with a reverse layup. In
less than a minute, he has 4 points. He tosses in a baseline
fadeaway . . . makes a 3 . . . makes a turnaround jumper over Paul
Pierce . . . puts in a finger roll that his young fans would label
sick and ill (those are compliments); it's a finger roll that will
remind his older fans of George Gervin.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Carter had 16 points. At times in the third and
fourth, he looked preoccupied. Dee Brown, who never left the bench,
knew better. The former Celtic attended college in Jacksonville,
Fla., which is close to Carter's hometown of Daytona. Brown is 31,
8 years older than Carter. But when Brown was in college,
``Everyone was telling me about this kid in Daytona. They were
telling me how good he was going to be. He must have been in the
seventh or eighth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourth quarter: Only 3.2 seconds remain and the Raptors trail by
a point. Carter had 25 points. Not a noisy, gaudy 25. They were the
kind of 25 that could be soundtracked by one of the ballads he
plays on his sax. Carter dribbled in the corner against Griffin. It
looked as if he was taking too much time. No problem. He pulled up,
ignored the hand in his face, and made the long 3. He put his hands
on his hips after he made the shot as if to say, ``What next?''
</P>
<P>
   What's next? By next season, Carter will certainly be among the
NBA's top three players. And by next season, Pitino will certainly
crumble under the weight of what he calls negativity. Before the
coach leaves Boston, I hope he realizes that it was not media and
fan negativity that collapsed on him. No, the problem will be that
he raised expectations and wasn't strong enough to handle it when
his optimistic (and unrealistic) words tumbled on him like a
ferocious avalanche.

resentment against Faulkner, but probably not enough to foul the
sensitive negotiations. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

&HT;     PATAKI TAKES CREDIT FOR GROWTH SURGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JAY JOCHNOWITZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For the first time in more than four decades, New
York state outpaced the nation in job growth last year, and much of
upstate New York shared in the trend, Republican Gov. George Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast to the state's miserable performance in the
mid-1990s when New York ranked 48th in the nation, the Empire State
took 7th place in 1999, according to state Labor Department
statistics unveiled Wednesday by Pataki, Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue and
state economist Stephen Kagann amid much fanfare at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Not unexpectedly, upstate New York as a whole lagged behind the
state but still had a stronger job growth figure than the nation
did _ 2.5 percent compared with 2.3 percent for the United States.
The state rate was 2.9 percent, or about 199,500 jobs. The
strongest-performing area was Putnam County, at 6.4 percent. The
Albany-Schenectady-Troy area reached 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   State officials could not say how the jobs translate into money
and whether there was a corresponding gain in wages and salaries.
Kagann said it is likely to be months before such detail is
available.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that it was unlikely that the state's job
growth could be as strong ``without it being very broad-based,''
including both full- and part-time jobs and a full range from
minimum-wage positions to high-paying manufacturing slots.
</P>
<P>
   While giving a nod to companies for creating the jobs, Pataki
took full credit for creating the climate that brought in the jobs,
pointing to a record of tax cuts and ``fiscal restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to tell government that the policies that worked for
the last five years are going to work for the next three years,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kagann, who claimed an economic forecasting model he developed
had predicted the exact state growth number months ago, supported
the governor's assertion. ``Not only do taxes matter, they matter a
lot,'' said Kagann, whose model predicts job growth as a result of
tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pataki stood by his conservative budget forecasts for
next year, which the Legislature says are about $1 billion short on
the revenue side. ``The state's doing well, but it's not doing as
well from a revenue standpoint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was as impressed with the figures as the governor,
who several times expressed surprise at press questions focusing on
the lower-performing areas like Rochester (1.9 percent) and
Buffalo-Niagara Falls (1.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Calling Pataki's self-congratulatory announcement
``disingenuous,'' Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said New York
state was only now catching up with a national trend that he
credited to White House policies under President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, a Democrat, said that if the state under Pataki had
performed in recent years as well as states like Texas, California
and Florida did, it would have added one million more jobs since
1995. According to Pataki, the state gained nearly 663,000 jobs, a
9.6 percent increase, following a 5.9 percent decline from
1990-1994.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki was elected in 1994 and re-elected in 1998.

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Charisma
Carpenter in a scene from ``Angel.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's usually a recipe for television disaster: Take a beloved
supporting character and turn him or her into a star.
 &HT;    Usually, it reveals that the same quirkiness that made the
character popular as a backup player is downright irritating in a
leading man or woman.
 &HT;    Every so often, however, it works.
 &HT;    Case study: ``Angel,'' which puts ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
bitch-goddess Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) front and center. And
it does so to great effect, with each weekly episode revealing more
of what makes the character tick.
 &HT;    ``Cordelia was just this gratuitous, nasty person on `Buffy,'
especially at the beginning,'' Carpenter says, speaking by
telephone from a Los Angeles studio during a break at a photo
session. ``Towards the end, it got better.
 &HT;    ``Officially, with `Angel,' they had to give more life to the
character,'' she says. ``And they have. She's not nearly as mean
and biting or as quick to go for the jugular as she used to be _
but she's still got an edge, because we need to maintain that
entertainment element of her, her bluntness and way of telling the
truth.
 &HT;    ``On `Angel,''' Carpenter adds, ``we want her bluntness to ring
true, but she still has to be appealing and approachable enough
that the audience can identify with her. That's my challenge in
playing her.''
 &HT;    Cordelia, of course, is a fabulously frustrated actress, one
without a shred of talent. She's also frightfully unlucky in love
and working alongside that ever-brooding vampire, Angel (David
Boreanaz), at his fledgling detective agency.
 &HT;    When the popular WB series kicked off its freshman season last
fall, Glenn Quinn co-starred as Doyle, Angel's amiable guide.
Despite the genuine romantic sparks set off by Doyle and Cordelia,
Doyle soon bit the dust and was replaced by a familiar ``Buffy''
face, Wesley (Alexis Denisof), late of the Council of Watchers and
now both a free-lance demon-hunter and Cordelia's latest verbal
sparring partner.
 &HT;    Before his departure, however, Doyle passed on to Cordelia a
gift that keeps on giving: his visions of people in peril.
 &HT;    ``For Cordelia, the visions are a curse,'' Carpenter says, ``but
one of my favorite lines is a result of the visions. Angel was
brooding about something, and I approached him and said, `In case
you're wondering why my vein is doing the cha-cha ... '
 &HT;    ``Those kinds of lines are the funniest things to say,'' the
actress says. ``It's so much fun to have the visions, as the
character.
 &HT;    ``To act them is hard,'' she adds, ``because I hyperventilate
sometimes when I'm doing the vision scenes. It's like my body
believes that I'm really having a vision or some sort of seizure.
Sometimes I get so lightheaded that my whole body tingles. It's
weird.''
 &HT;    Weird? Carpenter plays a character who shares her home with a
ghost, is employed by a vampire with a conscience, experiences
bizarre visions and was impregnated by a demon _ and body tingles
are weird?
 &HT;    ``I only freak out and say `What have I gotten myself into?'
when they start wanting to slap prosthetics on me,'' the actress
says, laughing. ``I am not OK with that. I'm very claustrophobic _
I'm always asking my makeup artist to cut back on the makeup, and
I'm always threatening my hair stylist that I'm going to cut my
hair because it's so high-maintenance all the time, day in and day
out.
 &HT;    ``I'd rather have the extra hour of sleep than be in the makeup
chair with rollers in my hair, you know?'' Carpenter says. ``In a
way, I guess, I do ask `What have I gotten myself into?' But I am
so grateful that we have the crew we have, that we have the writers
we have, that our fans dig the show so much and that I have a
job.''
 &HT;    Even if that job does keep her hopping.
 &HT;    ``My publicist is waving at me frantically,'' Carpenter says.
``I think I've got to go.''
 &HT;    Before she does, however, the actress expresses one unfulfilled
desire: to see Cordelia get as physically lethal as she is deadly
with a snippy line of dialogue.
 &HT;    ``I want Angel to teach me how to fight,'' she says excitedly.
``Whenever there's a demon to fight, it's Angel and Wesley who go.
Growing up in Sunnydale, I've been around the Hell Mouth. I should
be able to take care of myself and not always be in peril.
 &HT;    ``I think it would be bad-ass if I was bad for one episode and I
got to kick butt,'' she says. ``That would be a dream. I'd love to
be a Faith type.''

 THE TIBURON: THE LITTLE HUNDAI THAT COULD  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If someone asked me to define the word ``funky,'' I'd have to
give them the old
``I-can't-put-it-into-words-but-I-know-it-when-I-see-it'' line. Or,
I'd say, ``the Hyundai Tiburon.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this truly is a funky little sports car.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there aren't a lot of them around, when one does go
by you tend to notice and ask, ``What was that, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   And the two folks I've seen get out of them were . . . well,
they struck me as being on the funky side, too.
</P>
<P>
   And, besides being funky, they weren't tall.
</P>
<P>
   Tall people don't fare well in the Tiburon.
</P>
<P>
   Only by setting the driver's seat into a slightly reclining
position could I get the Tiburon to accommodate my 6-foot frame.
And it doesn't take a genius to figure out what happens when you
hit a big pothole.
</P>
<P>
   While I was preoccupied with my fit inside the car, my good
friend Jerry, a retired
machinist-turned-gunsmith-turned-clockmaker, was more interested in
the Tiburon's fit-and-finish. He lifted the hood and hatchback,
then ran his hands over the body panels and looked at the engine
and pronounced his judgment: ``Whoever made this car knew what they
were doing.'' High praise indeed from a man who was rebuilding
Lincoln, LaSalle, and Cadillac engines back in the '40s and still
machines parts to the 10,000th of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   My problems fitting into a vehicle aren't anything new. In the
past, I've gone into a Honda store prepared to buy a Prelude, a
Toyota store ready to buy a Celica, and a Saturn store ready to buy
a two-door coupe. In each case, sitting in the vehicle _ especially
if it was equipped with a sunroof _ proved impossible. Even
plopping into Audi's much-acclaimed TT coupe left me hunched over
trying to see overhead traffic lights through the narrow
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, part of the problem is me, but part is with these
autos' designs. They are perfect fits for most folks under
5-feet-10.
</P>
<P>
   If the Tiburon fits you, however, it could be one of the neatest
buys on the market.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a base price tag of $13,999 and a 10-year,
100,000-mile warranty (five years bumper-to-bumper and rust
perforation). In its favor, it also offers unique styling,
surprisingly good handling, a neat-but-not-luxurious interior, and
plenty of oomph from the 140 horsepower produced by its 2.0-liter,
4-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
   Our test version had a sunroof, big-time sound system, rear
spoiler, and leather accoutrements that pushed the price near
$17,000.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? It's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Think you can't drive a 5-speed manual? This is the smoothest
I've ever tried. The main reason is that the engine revs don't
immediately fall off when you ease off the gas to shift, allowing
the engine and transmission to meet smoothly in the next gear. I
always pride myself on smooth shifts but rarely have I found
seamless shifting so easy to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Lift the hatchback and there's room for several weeks' worth of
groceries, the dry cleaning, and whatever else you want to toss
back there. Lower the lid and it's all hidden by sheet metal and an
almost unnoticeable cover.
</P>
<P>
   Buzzing around town, which is what the Tiburon does best, you'll
get nearly 30 miles per gallon with great performance. It does
0-to-60 in 8.5 seconds, but the perceived quickness is even better
than that.
</P>
<P>
   From the driver's seat, looking over the hood is reminiscent of
sitting in a classic Triumph Spitfire. Then there was the color _ a
yellow that harked back to Chrysler's Super Bees of the late '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Or as the lady who rolled down her window in front of
Melrose-Wakefield Hospital when I popped out at a red light to slam
down the hatchback said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the color of your car . . . and I love the car. What is
it anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai Tiburon. A name worth remembering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The handling was sensational on those occasions when I could
let it go on a winding road.
</P>
<P>
   --The square headlight coverage pattern was unique and seemed to
give this myopic driver outstanding night vision.
</P>
<P>
   --The wipers (front and back) gave clear, clean consistent
visibility in misty and greasy road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The cupholders pulled out of the front console and blocked
access to the radio controls and also put the cup's contents in
jeopardy of a flying fist during gear changes.
</P>
<P>
   --The driver's seatbelt and jammed in its guide.
</P>
<P>
   --For three days, every time I hit the right directional signal
at night, I also managed to turn off the headlights, making the
driver in front of me wonder why I was flashing my lights.
</P>
<P>
   --And I could not find a spot to put a turnpike toll ticket,
except under a strap on the sun visor.

<P>
   BUENOS-AIRES-EXHIBIT (New York) _ ``Buenos Aires 1910'' is the
latest ripple in a wave that has been undulating through art,
architecture and entertainment for almost a generation: the rise of
The City as an icon for cultural globalization. In museum shows,
scholarly books and MTV dance marathons, not to mention tourism
promotions, individual cities are being recast as the neighborhoods
of one vast cosmopolitan condition. Images of Moscow, New York,
Prague, Brasilia, Berlin, Vienna, Lisbon, Chicago, Havana, Dublin,
Lagos, Macao, Barcelona and others are converging like segments of
an ever-expanding Baedeker map. The Buenos Aires show, on view at
the World Financial Center, adds a few new folds. By Herbert
Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   GUASTAVINO-CEILING (New York) _ In a Guastavino tile ceiling,
the sum of a thousand right angles is a curve worthy of nature.
True, the ceilings bespeak meticulous craftsmanship with their
intricate coursing, usually in a telltale basket-weave or
herringbone pattern. True, they evoke the architecture of
Catalonia, where the tradition grew of spanning large spaces with
thin, multilayered tile-and-mortar vaults. But what is most
appealing about the ceilings produced in New York in the early 20th
century by the Spanish architect Rafael Guastavino y Moreno and his
son, Rafael Guastavino y Esposito, is their sublime defiance of the
rectilinear city. Today New York has a chance to fall in love again
with Guastavino. By David W. Dunlap.

   1. WHY DOES THE MEDIA TREAT THIS POLLSTER LIKE A GOD?, by Joshua
Micah Marshall
</P>
<P>
   A little-known independent pollster based in Utica, N.Y., John
Zogby rocketed to fame by correctly predicting the results of the
1996 presidential election. Like all religions, the cult of Zogby
relies on myths about his feats and denial about his failures.
Meanwhile, Meanwhile, pundits, reporters and chat show hosts now
routinely genuflect to him.

   2. A PENSIVE BRADLEY WRITES THE FINAL CHAPTER, by Jacob Weisberg
</P>
<P>
   It is striking how un-desperate Bill Bradley sounds in the face
of imminent defeat. It may be explained by the strange quality of
interiority that has characterized his campaign from the outset.
Bradley has always viewed running for president as an opportunity
for personal growth and character development. He's staying in the
race for another week to achieve a sense of completeness as he
comes to grips with the experience. To put it a bit cruelly,
Bradley views his unsuccessful presidential campaign as a book that
needs a last chapter.

   3. SUPREME COURT GUIDE TO DRUG-SMUGGLING AND BAG-SQUEEZING, by
Dahlia Lithwick
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ponders whether you have a reasonable
expectation of privacy when you place your illegal drug stash in
the overhead compartment of a Greyhound bus. Here's a tip from
Justice Antonin Scalia: Buy hard luggage.

   4. TIME TO CLOSE THE `APPRECIATED PROPERTY' LOOPHOLE, by Michael
Kinsley
</P>
<P>
   Is there any reason the government should care whether you give
a charity $10,000 of stock or $10,000 in cash _ care enough to
reduce your tax bill by two or three thousand dollars for choosing
to give the stock? None that I have ever heard. But it's the kind
of
</P>
<P>
   ridiculous ``arrangement'' that gets into the tax code
unintentionally and then can't be gotten rid of.

   BUENOS-AIRES-EXHIBIT (New York) _ ``Buenos Aires 1910'' is the
latest ripple in a wave that has been undulating through art,
architecture and entertainment for almost a generation: the rise of
The City as an icon for cultural globalization. In museum shows,
scholarly books and MTV dance marathons, not to mention tourism
promotions, individual cities are being recast as the neighborhoods
of one vast cosmopolitan condition. Images of Moscow, New York,
Prague, Brasilia, Berlin, Vienna, Lisbon, Chicago, Havana, Dublin,
Lagos, Macao, Barcelona and others are converging like segments of
an ever-expanding Baedeker map. The Buenos Aires show, on view at
the World Financial Center, adds a few new folds. By Herbert
Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   GUASTAVINO-CEILING (New York) _ In a Guastavino tile ceiling,
the sum of a thousand right angles is a curve worthy of nature.
True, the ceilings bespeak meticulous craftsmanship with their
intricate coursing, usually in a telltale basket-weave or
herringbone pattern. True, they evoke the architecture of
Catalonia, where the tradition grew of spanning large spaces with
thin, multilayered tile-and-mortar vaults. But what is most
appealing about the ceilings produced in New York in the early 20th
century by the Spanish architect Rafael Guastavino y Moreno and his
son, Rafael Guastavino y Esposito, is their sublime defiance of the
rectilinear city. Today New York has a chance to fall in love again
with Guastavino. By David W. Dunlap.

&HT;     SCIENTISTS PLAN BIOLOGICAL HISTORY OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly a century ago, the steamship Albatross
patrolled the far reaches of wild San Francisco Bay, collecting and
classifying marine life as part of a nationwide scientific mission.
It was the first major study of Bay life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the prestigious California Academy of Sciences is launching
a much larger endeavor, this time a four-year $800,000 study to map
the nearly 1,000 underwater species that inhabit the deep, shallow
and tidal waters of the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Out of it will come a new knowledge of the ecological health of
the Bay, say scientists, who hope to learn which places in
Carquinez Strait, Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay and the central and
southern Bay are good habitat for marine life.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also want to locate the problem areas _ now
muddier, warmer or more polluted than in previous decades _ so they
can recommend fixes.
</P>
<P>
   A big bonus of the study will be the first field guide published
by the academy of the Bay's vast array of fish, crabs and oysters,
down to the lowly worms that dig in the bottom muds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a fundamental understanding of what native
species are here and where they occur,'' said Terrence M. Gosliner,
the provost and senior curator of the academy. ``We don't even know
what we're losing at this point because it's happening so rapidly.
We can't preserve our biological diversity if we don't know what we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists prize biological diversity, the number of native
species present in an ecosystem, because it means a flourishing,
dynamic Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Some native species, those that evolve over time like the
Sacramento River's chinook salmon and, on land, the California
clapper rail, don't live anywhere else on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strong moral commitment to preserve the native
species,'' Gosliner said. ``Their preservation really tells us
about the health of the Bay ecosystem. Every time one of those
native species disappears, the health of the ecosystem diminishes
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the academy was founded in 1853, its scientists have
discovered at least 10,000 species of plants and animals worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Albatross, under the auspices of the then-U.S. Fisheries
Commission, arrived in the Bay in 1912 and spent two years
collecting data. All of it has been published, and is available at
the academy, a nonprofit institution that receives city money to
operate the Steinhart Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the study, all the information gathered in last 150
years by the academy will be placed on computers and be available
on line.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, one-third of the Bay has been filled, destroying
the bulk of the wetlands that once provided habitat for aquatic and
land animals.
</P>
<P>
   Dredging, reducing the amount of fresh river water and
discharging toxic chemicals and sewage also have harmed the Bay's
marine life, the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's core of 25 scientists intends to use the past
studies to portray a biological history of the Bay, where the
natives species lived, when the exotic species came and how they
all spread or diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay has about 200 non-native species, some dumped
purposefully, some arriving in ship's ballast water or on hulls,
some coming on their own as ocean waters warm.
</P>
<P>
   From the Manila clams arriving in the 1940s to the Chinese
mitten crab, the green crab, the Asian clam and the New Zealand sea
slug of the 1990s, they compete for food and sometimes prey on the
natives.

<P>
   Joining the study will be Andrew Cohen, a biologist at the San
Francisco Estuary Institute, and James Carlson, a marine biologist
at Williams College in Massachusetts, both experts in invasive
species.
</P>
<P>
   Compiling a list of Bay fishes will be John McCosker and Tomio
Iwamoto from the academy and Bob Lea, a biologist from the state
Fish and Game Department. Peter Moyle, a fisheries biologist at the
University of California at Davis, also will work on the study.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific teams from the National Ocean and Atmospheric
Administration will test the marine life for toxins. San Francisco
State's Romberg Tiburon Center will measure circulation. The Bodega
Marine Laboratory will monitor flow and currents.

 &HT;    FLAGGING WAR ON WASTE GETS ELECTION-YEAR LIFT
 &HT;    With WASTE-WATCHDOG and WASTE-EXAMPLES. For release Sunday,
March 5.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As John McCain struggles to win over a majority of
Republicans, his presidential drive may breathe new life into the
flagging crusade against waste in government.
</P>
<P>
   In the current a flood of federal revenue, many Republicans have
abandoned the vows of thrift taken when they won majority control
of Congress six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Joining their Democratic colleagues last year, they packed
spending bills with highway projects, weapons contracts and museums
for their home districts. At the same time, congressional oversight
of the massive federal bureaucracy is considered spotty at best.
</P>
<P>
   Now McCain has built a constituency, in part, by rallying voters
who want a major overhaul, including curbs on special-interest
campaign contributions and the ``pork barrel'' projects that often
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the military, and I know the Air Force was forced to
take C-130s they didn't ask for,'' said Don Meno, an Army colonel
who works at the Pentagon, as he left a McCain rally last weekend
in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The C-130s, transport planes that cost $60 million apiece, are
consuming scarce defense dollars, Meno said. Twenty of the aircraft
were ordered at the behest of Newt Gingrich when he was the
Republican House speaker. The planes are built by Lockheed Martin
in his Marietta, Ga., district.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has focused on the congressional ``pork'' issue and
tapped into the movement spawned by Texas billionaire Ross Perot.
In fact, a national survey by McCain's pollster, Bill McInturff,
showed that 24 percent of McCain supporters voted for Perot four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittmann, a resident scholar at the Heritage Foundation
and a McCain adviser, said the Arizona senator's position cuts
across party lines. ``I think that the attack on pork barrel
spending is part of a broader reform message that resonates among
the American people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about trillions or billions of dollars in
spending, that's too abstract,'' he said. But take a specific
project for a congressional district, such as studies of chicken
manure, Wittmann said, ``and people can comprehend that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McCain has had little success defeating programs in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, you could get trichinosis from the last couple of
budget bills that have been passed, from all the pork,'' Wittmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the public is outraged enough to take
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public is upset with government'' and excess
spending, said James Thurber, a political scientist at American
University. But with a glut of revenues, the slower growth in the
size of government, and a thriving economy, people are otherwise
content, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the McCain critique) is an argument that goes
to as wide a population as it may have in the past,'' Thurber said.
</P>
<P>
   So powerful was the McCain reform message in the early going
that his rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, repositioned himself
as ``the reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush even attempted to turn McCain's anti-pork crusade against
him last week by airing ads knocking the senator for opposing some
breast cancer research. McCain responded that he had voted against
only those programs that circumvented the ``normal review process''
to divert funds to the districts of ``powerful'' lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of spending is the glue that holds spending bills
together, said Thurber. He pointed to last year's highway bill,
which was expanded by 25 percent to include projects for almost
every congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said that Congress fails to monitor the way the
money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oversight is never fun on the Hill,'' Thurber said. He
graded both parties ``F'' for failing to systematically check up on
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Wittmann offered a similar assessment of the congressional
record, but he argued that the public can be stirred by a reform
message such as McCain's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a deep belief that politics as usual has to be
changed,'' he said. ``I think that sentiment is really animating
the American electorate.''

 &HT;    WASHINGTON WASTE LAMPOONED A to Z
 &HT;    With WASTE. For release Sunday, March 5.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some people scowl or shrug at what they see as
profligate spending of taxpayer dollars for marginal or ineffective
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Martin L. Gross does something else. The retired college
professor has made a second career out of combing through thousands
of pages of federal budget documents to discover exactly where
those dollars go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could cut this government down by 30 to 40 percent in a week
and deliver twice as many services,'' boasts the author of several
irreverent books, including his latest, ``The Government Racket
2000,'' an ``all new'' expose of Washington waste ``from A to Z.''
</P>
<P>
   On his latest list:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lavish new federal courthouses costing as much as $218 million
(in Boston) or $86 million (in Jacksonville, Fla.). A government
audit of courtrooms found that they were used for trials only 27
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than $100 billion in gasoline tax money invested in the
``generally failed light-rail system.'' Gross cites transportation
expert Wendell Cox's estimate that the rail system has decreased
road congestion by only one-half of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Special ``demonstration'' projects, costing more than $9
billion, added to last year's highway authorization bill by
lawmakers for their home states. Among the projects are $12 million
for a new visitor center in West Virginia, $4.4 million to beautify
Route A1A in Daytona Beach, Fla., and $4 million for a parking
facility in Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than $4 billion a year for 127 different programs in 15
different agencies, all with the same aim of helping teenagers.
``The answer is to combine the 127 programs into four,'' he writes,
and save ``at least $3 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Defense funds may be low and Air Force ranks reduced, but
Andrews Air Force Base, Md., added a third golf course ``mainly''
for federal civilian employees and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal program to allow people to ``adopt'' wild horses
to save them from starvation on the western plains has a humane
ring to it, but the cost to taxpayers has been $250 million. A
review by the Associated Press revealed that some owners pay the
$125 adoption fee, wait the required year and sell the ponies to
slaughterhouses for $700 each.

 &HT;    NATION'S TOP WASTE-WATCHER CONFRONTS EUPHORIA OF SURPLUSES
 &HT;    With WASTE. For release Sunday, March 5.
 &HT;    Eds: Repeating a story first moved Feb. 16.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finding waste in the government might seem about as
easy as finding sand at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for David M. Walker is that nowadays, the folks he
works for aren't very interested in all that sand.
</P>
<P>
   As comptroller of the United States, Walker has the sometimes
thankless task of heading the agency that is the investigating arm
of Congress. His General Accounting Office is the chief watchdog
for exposing waste and mismanagement throughout the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   He has a staff of 3,275 of workers who churn out some 1,500
audits, investigations and testimonies each year on everything from
how much the Pentagon pays for screws to the solvency of the Social
Security system.
</P>
<P>
   But currently, a deluge of budget surpluses has undercut some of
the urgency of his work.
</P>
<P>
   When Walker presented a list of 61 potential reforms and program
eliminations to the Senate Budget Committee a few weeks back, some
senators didn't wait to hear him speak before they launched into
spirited defenses of their pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hearing illustrated the difficulty of making some
changes,'' Walker said philosophically in an interview later.
</P>
<P>
   An impeccably attired 48-year-old whose wire-rimmed glasses and
orderly office fit the image of the nation's top auditor, he
pointed out that he only makes suggestions. It's up to the
lawmakers to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, we work for 540 politicians, and they must be
accountable to the American people,'' he said. ``Reasonable people
can and do differ.''
</P>
<P>
   The former partner and global manager in Atlanta for the
accounting firm Arthur Andersen, Walker systematically studied the
terrain during his first 15 months on the job. Last month he
announced his plan to streamline his 77-year-old agency's $378
million annual operations, setting off grumbling within the ranks.
He keeps his staff on their toes by showering them with e-mails,
starting around 6:30 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   He has also met with almost every member of Congress, not to
mention the secretaries of waste-plagued federal departments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the economic boom, Congress and the executive
agencies may not be very receptive to the comptroller's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he's going to feel like a skunk at a picnic and
sometimes he's going to feel more popular, but that's his job,''
said Paul C. Light, director of governmental studies at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington research center. ``And he's got
to keep hacking on it and hacking on it and hacking on it.''

<P>
   TV-OLD-VALUES (Undated) _ Despite its high-tech set and clanging
music, ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' offers the veneer of a
return to comfy old values, to the days when quiz shows were king
and people pulled together to cheer on their champions. Even its
immense success is a throwback, uniting the country in a way that
is nearly impossible in this age of 500 channels and fragmented
audiences. Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' was
typical of the network in putting the sleaziest possible spin on a
trend, as it reveled in the caveman ethos of the marriage contest.
But both the benign quiz show resurgence that ABC's ``Millionaire''
has led (several clones and counting) and the blatant sexism of the
Fox show are symptoms of a deeper retro impulse. By Caryn James.

   BRUCE-WILLIS-FILMS (Undated) _ If Bruce Willis feels
``unappreciated,'' to quote his character from ``Die Hard,'' it's
easy to understand why. ``The Sixth Sense,'' the twist of an
otherworld thriller, was one of the biggest hits of 1999. The movie
has earned six Oscar nominations, including deserved acknowledgment
of young Haley Joel Osment and Toni Colette, as the mama lion whose
belief in her tormented son is steadfast. Yet Willis's considerable
effort in that film went unnoticed by the Academy. By now, he may
feel that the most memorable line from ``The Sixth Sense'' _ ``I
see dead people'' _ refers to the way Oscar voters feel about him.

Der Beek and Ashton Kutcher, among others, as wet-behind-the-ears
recruits in Stetsons and bandoliers who take on a band of

   SHANDLING-ALIEN-FILM (Hollywood) _ Garry Shandling plays an
alien in the movie ``What Planet Are You From?'' _ his character
has been sent to impregnate an Earth woman and bring back the child
as part of a plot to take over the universe _ he has been shorn of
the outward appurtenances of manhood and reduced to wearing a
Freudian clip-on. This mechanical apparatus produces hydraulic
whining noises during lovemaking, though most of the whining in the
picture still comes from Shandling. It is all about him, after all.
The film, directed by Mike Nichols, also stars Annette Bening and
John Goodman as a sort of jumbo Javert who is onto the scheme. It

   &UR; THEATER &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   BOYD-GAINES-THEATER (New York) _ Boyd Gaines emerged from his
dressing room after a matinee of ``Contact,'' famished and drained.
He apologized for the time he had taken in collecting himself. It
is fortunate that Gaines did not make a persuasive enough case
against himself, for his moving performance as Michael Wiley, the
highly successful if suicidally lonely New Yorker of the show's
title piece, is one of the most emotionally rewarding facets of
``Contact.'' That his face is familiar to regular theatergoers _ he
won Tony Awards in 1989 and 1994 for ``The Heidi Chronicles'' and
``She Loves Me'' _ deepens the audience's own contact with the
production. The play being so popular has moved to the Vivian
Beaumont theater, where it is in previews before officially
reopening on March 30. By Peter Marks. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEBORAH-YATES-THEATER (New York) _ From the moment she enters in
that arresting yellow dress, it is clear that what is happening is
not just another striking theatrical performance. It is the
uncommon but unmistakable emergence of a star. In the new Lincoln
Center dance-play, ``Contact,'' reopening at the Vivian Beaumont
Theater after a sold-out run at the Mitzi E. Newhouse, Deborah
Yates dares you to take your eyes off her. And not just because she
can fly through the air without an upswept blonde strand slipping
out of place or because she makes complex swing combinations look
as easy as the box step. It is because Yates commands the stage
with an authority that never seems arrogant, combining a playful
grit with an elegant grace that makes you want to know more about
her. By Robyn Pogrebin. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   PORGY-AND-BESS (Undated) _ ``Porgy And Bess'' comes to the New
York City Opera this week, so it is a good time to celebrate the
man largely responsible for the opera's resilience: DuBose Heyward,
the author of the 1925 novel ``Porgy.'' Of course there are those
fabulous Gershwin tunes, but no other Gershwin show has proved
revivable, and in no other Gershwin show do the songs embody
dramatic characters, even when sung out of context or played
without the lyrics. By David Schiff. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FLEA-THEATER (New York) _ Until recently, the 80-seat Flea in
Manhattan has been thought of mainly as an Off Off Broadway
theater. Its productions have included Mac Wellman's ``Infrared,''
``Chere Maitre,'' starring Irene Worth, Rudy Stern's Theater of
Light and ``Benten Kozo,'' a Kabuki play, which won an Obie. Now it
is becoming known downtown as a dance venue hoping to give some
competition to more established spaces like P.S. 122, Dixon Place,
the Joyce SoHo and the Kitchen. This month the Flea is presenting
``Get Up! Two,'' a free festival of short dances by more than 15
choreographers that will run Tuesday nights at 8:30 through March
21. By Kevin Giordano. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

<P>
   AMERICAN-SHOWS (London) _ When it comes to theatrical invasions,
there is a new one here worth signaling: the influx of American
shows, several of them in their original productions. Think of it
as a long-overdue attempt to redress what some might call a
theatrical imbalance, because the traffic, of course, generally
heads the other way. On Broadway, some kind of history was made
last spring when eight English or Irish stagings _ including those
of several American plays, ``The Iceman Cometh'' for starters _ all
opened within 10 weeks. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   DALLAS-SYMPHONY (Undated) _ Tell a New Yorker that the symphony
orchestra in Dallas, Texas, is 100 years old, and the reaction will
probably be surprise. The Dallas Symphony Orchestra would like to
change that. True, being 100 years old in Dallas is a little
different from being 100 years old in, say, Philadelphia (where the
orchestra is celebrating its centennial this year, as well). The
DSO's history has followed a rollercoaster track of highs and lows.
By Anne Midgette. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCIARRINO-MUSIC (New York) _ ``Recitativo Oscuro,'' the title of
the concerto by Salvatore Sciarrino that Maurizio Pollini will play
this week at Carnegie Hall, with Pierre Boulez and the London
Symphony, is consistent with others in this composer's recent
output, where ideas of night and darkness often lurk. But the
embodiment of such ideas here is far more incisive, more vehement
and, indeed, louder than has been usual for Sciarrino. By Paul
Griffiths. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-SYMPHONY (Undated) _ Pierre Boulez's four concerts with
the London Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in Manhattan
beginning Friday are, in their way, the closing of a book. The
title of this book might be ``An Age of Exploration,'' and we have
been turning its pages for about 100 years. There will be new
pieces by Salvatore Sciarrino, Peter Eotvos, Olga Neuwirth and
George Benjamin, but none will offer groundbreaking methodology or
send music into some unexplored orbit. They will make sounds,
maneuver in time and hope that we like what we hear. By Bernard
Holland. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHOSTAKOVICH-MUSIC (New York) _ The full houses and rapturous
critical response that greeted the Emerson String Quartet's recent
Shostakovich cycle at Alice Tully Hall gave further evidence that
Shostakovich, a giant of 20th-century music, may yet be accorded,
in the 21st, the recognition long withheld out of irrelevant
geopolitical and musico-political concerns. Now the Emerson's
wonderful performances of all 15 quartets are available in a
Deutsche Grammophon recording. By Richard Taruskin. (Moved). &QL;

   SHANGHAI-SYMPHONY (Shanghai, China) _ Last year the Shanghai
Symphony Orchestra, as it has been called since 1953, celebrated
its 120th anniversary. As the nation's oldest symphony orchestra,
it has done more to promote the development of symphonic music in
China than any other institution. Its claim to the title ``best
orchestra in the Far East,'' bestowed in the 1930s, is long past.
But if judged on the basis of perseverance and dedication in the
face of seemingly insurmountable odds, the Shanghai Symphony stands
alone. By Sheila Melvin and Jindong Cai. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   CARNAVAL-BRAZIL (Salvador, Brazil) _ Carnaval in Salvador, the
state capital of Bahia, is purely a street carnaval, different from
the Folies Bergeres-like televised festivities that take place in
Rio de Janeiro. The music played on top of the trio eletrico _ it's
usually the popular new Brazilian samba-reggae or axe music _ has a
direct relationship to the street and takes part in a kind of
natural selection: each year carnaval starts with dozens of songs
written specifically for the festivities, and by the end of the
week that repertory has been narrowed to a handful. The trio
eletrico is the medium, and the street decides. By Ben Ratliff.

   DYLAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ When Bob Dylan was an acerbic young folk

high-art world. Yet last fall, nearly 40 years after he made his
first records, Dylan was declared one of the greatest artists of
the 20th century by Andrew Motion, the British poet laureate. And
now the composer John Corigliano, commissioned to write a song
cycle for the soprano Sylvia McNair's Carnegie Hall recital on
March 15, has produced ``Mr. Tambourine Man: Seven Songs of Bob
Dylan,'' a 35-minute song cycle. By Allan Kozinn. (Moved). WITH

April 1 he returns to the Kitchen, in Manhattan, where he first
performed a short dance in a 1974 series that also featured the

   TURKEY-ART (Istanbul, Turkey) _ There is bad news for anyone
planning to visit Turkey this year. The velvet-lined case that
houses the country's most famous artifact, the glittering Topkapi
dagger, will be empty. Nor will visitors be able to see the curved
battle sword that hung from Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror's hip when
his army captured Constantinople in 1453, or the inlaid
ebony-and-ivory throne from which the vast Ottoman Empire was once
ruled, or the dazzling emerald-studded turban decoration that awed
visitors to the court of Sultan Ahmed I in the 17th century. The
good news, however, is that these objects and more than 200 others,
some of which have never before left the Topkapi Palace, will be
missing because they will be on tour through the United States.
They are part of one of the most ambitious exhibitions of Ottoman
treasures ever assembled. The exhibition, called ``Palace of Gold

   RENZO-PIANO-ARCH (Paris) _ Renzo Piano chuckled as he remembered
how he and Richard Rogers were ``young boys, really young and quite
bad boys'' in 1971 when they won the architecture competition for
the Georges Pompidou Center with a design that they considered a
parody of technology. Even now, at 62, Piano, a good-natured
Italian, seemed amazed that France allowed two young foreigners _
he was 33 and his British partner was 37 _ to challenge the sober
18th-century stone facades of eastern Paris with an immense
metallic structure variously described (by its critics) as a
refinery or an ocean liner and (by its architects) as ``a Jules
Verne spaceship that can't fly.'' The Pompidou Center, which opened
in 1977, proved immensely popular and today it (italics)is(end
italics) a monument. Piano in turn made his name and collected
architectural honors, including the highly regarded Pritzker Prize
in 1998. By Alan Riding. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT'S THIRD WORK TRIES DIFFERENT ANGLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a dog biting your pants leg, James Champy just won't let
go.
</P>
<P>
   First, the management consultant invents reengineering with his
book, ``Reengineering the Corporation.'' He tells us to go through
every process, every procedure, every traditional
way-it's-always-been-done system and tweak it until it runs faster,
smoother and more profitably. His book hits bestseller status,
coins a buzzword and, with his consulting work, starts a corporate
movement.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Champy sees that even though many are trying
his ideas, few are implementing them as he had hoped, so results
are mixed. Out of frustration, he blames management for poor
performance and writes ``Reengineering Management'' to contend that
the concept isn't flawed; only those trying to manage it are.
</P>
<P>
   Now he presents good management from a different angle. Champy
is writing about good and bad managers, and how they came to be. He
cites successful leaders and hopes to nurture the potential of
others.
</P>
<P>
   One gets the feeling that he's trying to create the type of
manager necessary to implement his ideas _ to prove that those
ideas work.
</P>
<P>
   Building strong leadership is the premise behind ``The Arc of
Ambition: Defining the Leadership Journey'' (Perseus Books, 272
pages, $26).
</P>
<P>
   This work is well-written, although many of the same people _
Michael Dell, Ray Krok, Steve Jobs _ are analyzed and highlighted
as they are in hundreds of management books.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is the cohesion with which these people are tied
to the ideas presented. The book is thought-provoking, not just
another string of bios.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is that many of the subjects _ Cesar Chavez,
Nelson Mandela, William Jefferson Clinton _ don't pop up in your
typical management/leadership books. They add an interesting
dimension to the ideas on defining leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the credit for this fresh air _ perhaps most of it _
must go to Champy's co-author, Harvard Business School Professor
Nitin Nohria. The work has an international insight that Nohria
likely brought to the table. It also has a classical feel. In one
paragraph, the authors hail the life of English Romantic poet John
Keats, in the next, Starbucks founder Howard Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   And although scholarly, the book contains a good dose of the
real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambition started out as a pedestrian notion derived from the
Latin word `ambitionem,' meaning to walk around soliciting votes,''
Champy and Nohria write. ``But its reality can be fierce and its
results momentous.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors contend that ambition can be traced in an arc that
rises and falls in stages. Those stages include:
</P>
<P>
   - See what others don't. Among those who did so are Dell, John
Mackey and the Wright brothers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Follow a steadfast path. Case studies include George Lucas,
Mandela and Sam Walton.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seize the moment. Leaders who did so include Krok, Robert
Johnson and Martin Luther King.
</P>
<P>
   _ Temper ambition. This means setting goals while ensuring
disciplined execution. Those who didn't include Clinton and Alfred
Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inspire with a greater purpose. Among the examples: Chavez,
Mohandas Gandhi and Monsanto's Robert Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   Other stages of ambition include not violating values, keeping
control by giving it up, changing or dying, and leaving gracefully.
Names from Abraham Lincoln to Peter Lynch are included in this
group.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the book works, despite its well-worn theme. Maybe
good management can't be overanalyzed.

   ``The 75 Greatest Management Decisions Ever Made ... and 21 of
the Worst''
</P>
<P>
   By Stuart Crainer
</P>
<P>
   AMACOM, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   This is a fun read, looking at management from a
sometimes-offbeat perspective. Business and management writer
Stuart Crainer goes back in history _ all the way back to 100 B.C.
in Thebes at one point _ to uncover great management decisions.
Most examples are a bit more recent, from Michael Dell selling PCs
directly to consumers to the Grateful Dead allowing fans to tape
their concerts. Crainer offers lively examples of excellent
management decisions and how they affected our lives.

Teams''
</P>
<P>
   By Larry E. Senn and John R. Childress
</P>
<P>
   Leadership Press, $25
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard Business Review study found that 75 percent of
managers polled were unhappy with change initiatives at their
companies. Larry Senn and John Childress suggest that most
corporate changes are focused on the operational and technical side
and ignore the human side. Their book focuses on the best way to
communicate with employees about the changes many companies are
facing.

and Investing Now for a Secure Future''
</P>
<P>
   By Martha Priddy Patterson
</P>
<P>
   Penn, $19.95
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent of U.S. women expect to receive retirement
benefits, and those who do will usually get half of as much as
their male colleagues, writes attorney and KPMG Director Martha
Priddy Patterson. That fact alone will have many wanting to buy
this book. Patterson, who specializes in employee benefits law,
writes that women must build retirement funding separate from an
employer or Social Security. She explores the various avenues.

&HT;     AUTHOR OF `ENGLISH PATIENT' TURNS ATTENTION TO TROUBLED
HOMELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 5)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CASEY SEILER  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ From F. Scott Fitzgerald and Truman Capote on
down, the shelves are stacked high with the biographies of writers
who grabbed the brass ring _ fame! money! Hollywood! _ only to
watch it turn into a noose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is not to take it very seriously,'' said novelist
Michael Ondaatje, speaking by telephone from his home in Toronto.
``(Fame) can do a lot of damage. But if one has a certain intent
that's private when you're working, it certainly helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Ondaatje knows what he's talking about: His 1992 novel, ``The
English Patient,'' hit the literary equivalent of the trifecta. An
alternately grim and lyrical tale of love during wartime, the book
received adulatory reviews (including a Booker Prize), earned solid
sales and _ miracle of miracles _ inspired a faithful film
adaptation that dominated the 1996 Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very lucky to go through the filmmaking process with
people who were both talented and honorable,'' said Ondaatje, who
discussed Anthony Minghella's film after a screening Wednesday
night at the State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Ondaatje, 56, is married to the nonfiction writer Linda
Spalding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather talk about the film than about myself,''
Ondaatje said, ``so (the film's success) affords me a nice kind of
disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before ``The English Patient,'' Ondaatje had been exploring
fame as a theme in his work. His 1976 fact-based novel ``Coming
Through Slaughter'' describes trumpeter Buddy Bolden's descent from
musical acclaim to madness and obscurity. (``There are no prizes,''
the book concludes darkly.)
</P>
<P>
   ```Slaughter' was a book about the dangers of fame, and I feel
much the same way today,'' Ondaatje said.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, the writer's work has gone global. He
revisited his native Sri Lanka in the 1982 family memoir ``Running
in the Family.'' His 1987 novel ``In the Skin of a Lion''
reimagined the boomtown industry of his adopted Toronto; several
characters from that story traveled to Italy for ``The English
Patient.'' Ondaatje's four collections of poetry include ``The
Cinnamon Peeler'' and ``Handwriting.''
</P>
<P>
   Slated for release May 1, Ondaatje's new novel, ``Anil's Ghost''
(to be published by Knopf), returns to Sri Lanka. But instead of
the lush colonial years depicted in ``Running in the Family,''
Ondaatje has set his story against a modern landscape of political
unrest and officially sanctioned violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure which was more difficult,'' Ondaatje said. ``With
`Running in the Family,' there's always the danger of encountering
relatives ... but one kind of feels able to describe your own
stories, as long as you're going about it with a generous spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Ondaatje, the sense of obligation is stronger when he's
creating a fictional character. ``You're more responsible in
fiction,'' he said. ``You're entering someone else's world
entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   He's gearing up for another kind of obligation: the forced march
of pre-publication interviews and book tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The readings, I enjoy _ I'm not an antisocial type of
person,'' he said. ``But I think writers are an odd mix of hams and
the warily private. Don DeLillo is a very private person, but then
he writes a 600-page book. It's a very curious thing.''
</P>
<P>
   After the success of his last novel, Ondaatje understands the
publishing world's expectations for this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangely, that hasn't bothered me,'' he said. ``I think I was
able to turn it off when I came back to writing. I feel very good
about this book, (but) I don't think it's going to have anything
like the success of `The English Patient.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessary to hit that kind of grand slam again.''

EARLY HUMANS BUILT HUTS 500,000 YEARS AGO

<P>
   We know that Homo erectus used stone tools. And now it seems
likely that our ancient ancestor built shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese archaeologists have discovered the remains of what is
believed to be the world's oldest artificial structure on a
hillside at Chichibu, north of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The site has been dated to half a million years ago, a time when
Homo erectus lived in the region. It consists of what seem to be 10
post holes, which form two irregular pentagons thought to be the
remains of two huts. Thirty stone tools were found scattered around
the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice find and it does sound important,'' says Chris
Stringer, head of the human origins group at London's Natural
History Museum. ``If this is correctly dated and correctly
interpreted, it is the first good evidence from 500 000 years ago
of a hut structure made by these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the discovery, the oldest remains of a structure were
those at Terra Amata in France, from around 200,000 to 400,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese site was discovered during the construction of a
park on a flat piece of terrain with a commanding view of a river.
After digging through about 2 meters of river deposits, an
archaeological team organized by the local board of education found
a layer of volcanic ash in which the shallow post holes appear to
have been dug.
</P>
<P>
   The holes were filled with loose material, which was clearly
distinct from the volcanic layer, says Kazutaka Shimada, curator of
the Meiji University Museum in Tokyo. ``They had well-defined
edges.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the holes form two pentagons 1-3 and 1-7 meters across.
According to the board of education, which announced the find last
week, the holes are roughly equidistant, but the ones on the south
side are slightly farther apart, perhaps for an entrance. A total
of 30 stone implements were found around the site, seven of them
within the pentagons themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are crude cutting instruments made of chert and
shale,'' Shimada says. ``They have clearly been worked.''
</P>
<P>
   As for dating, Shimada says the volcanic layer is between
500,000 and 600,000 years old. The alluvial layer covering it is
more than 400,000 years old, making the remains about half a
million years old.
</P>
<P>
   Ofer Bar-Yosef, an anthropologist at Harvard University, says
Japanese dating techniques using volcanic ash are usually reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have post holes, this is a rather exceptional situation
in terms of what we know about hominid archaeology,'' says John
Rick, an anthropologist at Stanford University. ``Half a million
years ago, we don't have any concept of what our ancestors were
capable of doing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The remains could help explain how Homo erectus lived and
hunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evidence that they built structures but how permanent
this was we don't know,'' Stringer says. ``They were
hunter-gatherers and they had to move where the resources were. Who
knows whether this was a shelter they stayed in one week, or one
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick says that, if the find is confirmed, it will be interesting
because it shows that hominids could conceive of using technology
to organize things.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the idea of actually making a structure, making a
cultural space, a place where you might sleep,'' he says. ``It
represents a conceptual division between inside and outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Yosef agrees that if the find stands up, it would add to
mounting evidence that hominids living 500,000 years ago were more
sophisticated than many anthropologists believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me _ the cognitive ability to predict
what you'll need was already embedded in the human mind.'' &QL;

   Fish play follow-the-leader to find food. If one fish knows what
it's doing, the rest of the shoal will follow it, says a Canadian
biologist.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Reebs of Moncton University in New Brunswick trained
shoals of golden shiners to expect food at a certain place and time
each day in their tanks. Then he replaced some or all of the 12
fish in each shoal with untrained counterparts. Shoals containing a
few experienced individuals spent much more time in the feeding
area than shoals with no trained fish.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was stronger when there were more fish that knew
about the food, but Reebs was surprised to find that a single fish
could persuade its shoal mates to follow and leave the shady area
of the tank where they would normally stay all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected that the 11 fish would have too much inertia to be
entrained by just one leader,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Reebs isn't sure how the informed fish tell others to follow. He
thinks that perhaps they make particular movements to signal their
intention or release chemical cues in the anticipation of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reebs has made the first step in showing that fish can
communicate knowledge about foraging opportunities and thereby
influence the behavior of the whole group,'' says biologist Brian
Wisenden of Moorhead State University in Minnesota. &QL;

   Iodized salt could have caused a drop in men's sperm counts
since the 1950s. Iodine is added to salt because it is vital for
brain development but, according to American scientists, iodine
appears to be linked to falling sperm counts.
</P>
<P>
   American scientists say that iodine deficiency, while stunting
brain development, also appears to boost sperm counts. Our bodies
need iodine to make the thyroid hormone thyroxine, which is vital
for developing brains. But in some parts of the world crops contain
little iodine. A deficiency can cause impaired mental development,
so iodine is added to salt.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s James Crissman of the Dow Chemical Company in
Michigan and colleagues at the University of Illinois in Urbana
looked at data showing a sharp drop in sperm levels around 1960.
They worked out that the men's average date of birth was 1924 _
when iodized salt was introduced in America.
</P>
<P>
   To test the link, Crissman's group raised female rats on an
iodine-deficient diet and mated them with healthy rats. The
offspring were subsequently weaned by their iodine-deficient
mothers and later fed low-iodine diets. He found that the offspring
had larger testicles and produced more sperm than normal rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ended up with testes twice as big as normal,'' Crissman
says.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sharpe of the Medical Research Council's Reproductive
Biology Unit in Edinburgh says there are cases of men with
underactive thyroids having enlarged testicles. But he is
skeptical. ``Sperm count data are so variable,'' Sharpe says.
</P>
<P>
   Crissman warns against cutting down on iodine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a danger people could get exactly the wrong message
and decide that sperm counts are more important than brain
development,'' Crissman says. &QL;

   Could a pair of tights beat cellulite?
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret, a U.S. lingerie chain, has filed a patent
covering a treatment for cellulite using chemically impregnated
pantyhose tights. The company claims the pantyhose can treat
cellulite _ the unsightly ``orange peel'' fatty deposits that some
women develop beneath the skin of their thighs and buttocks. It is
not yet known if the company plans to launch a product using this
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The European patent (EP 955 043) was filed by Victoria's Secret
of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, a company that runs 800 stores in North
America. But the company has refused to confirm whether or not it
intends to launch a product using the technology. In fact, it has
so far refused any comment.
</P>
<P>
   The patent covers a treatment for cellulite using ``hose
material that is worn tightly on the skin.'' It says a compound
called theophylline acetate (THA) _ previously administered orally
to treat bronchial disorders such as asthma _ is bonded to nylon
with an organic polymer called PEI, which is usually used as an
adhesive in inks and dyes. The THA is doped with silantriol, a
silica-based compound which Victoria's Secret says has been shown
to ``increase the penetration of certain chemical compounds that
are not easily passed into the skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The PEI binds strongly to the THA and silantriol when the tights
are not being worn. But when they are clinging tightly to human
skin, sweat is released, the pH of the fabric rises, and friction
with the skin generates heat. This breaks the ionic bonds with PEI,
allowing THA and silantriol to permeate the skin. To work, the
tights must be worn for at least three 8-hour days. Washing the
tights with a light detergent does not affect the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret does not explain how the chemicals remove
cellulite. Susan Jebb, a scientist specializing in human nutrition
at the Medical Research Council in Cambridge, has investigated many
slimming aids, including creams for rubbing on cellulite. She is
skeptical about claims that chemicals can help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general view is that it is the massage that helps, not the
cream,'' Jebb says. ``But when women pay a lot for creams, they are
more likely to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   In its patent, Victoria's Secret reports that a dozen volunteers
wore the tights for 30 days. The firm says measurements confirmed
by ultrasound scans have shown a 2- 5-centimeter reduction in the
circumference of volunteers' thighs.
</P>
<P>
   It also claims that volunteers' thighs appeared smoother, with
less fatty tissue on the hips. Formerly tight jeans, it reports,
``felt baggy and loose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jebb cautions: ``Short-term size reduction in the thighs
tells nothing about the long-term reduction of body fat.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear why Victoria's Secret is so reluctant to discuss
its plans for the technology. But if the tights do go on sale, the
end results might finally settle the burning question: Is it the
chemical content of a slimming cream or massaging it in that
accounts for any reduction in thigh size?

<P>
   We know that Homo erectus used stone tools. And now it seems
likely that our ancient ancestor built shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese archaeologists have discovered the remains of what is
believed to be the world's oldest artificial structure on a
hillside at Chichibu, north of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The site has been dated to half a million years ago, a time when
Homo erectus lived in the region. It consists of what seem to be 10
post holes, which form two irregular pentagons thought to be the
remains of two huts. Thirty stone tools were found scattered around
the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice find and it does sound important,'' says Chris
Stringer, head of the human origins group at London's Natural
History Museum. ``If this is correctly dated and correctly
interpreted, it is the first good evidence from 500 000 years ago
of a hut structure made by these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the discovery, the oldest remains of a structure were
those at Terra Amata in France, from around 200,000 to 400,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese site was discovered during the construction of a
park on a flat piece of terrain with a commanding view of a river.
After digging through about 2 meters of river deposits, an
archaeological team organized by the local board of education found
a layer of volcanic ash in which the shallow post holes appear to
have been dug.
</P>
<P>
   The holes were filled with loose material, which was clearly
distinct from the volcanic layer, says Kazutaka Shimada, curator of
the Meiji University Museum in Tokyo. ``They had well-defined
edges.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the holes form two pentagons 1-3 and 1-7 meters across.
According to the board of education, which announced the find last
week, the holes are roughly equidistant, but the ones on the south
side are slightly farther apart, perhaps for an entrance. A total
of 30 stone implements were found around the site, seven of them
within the pentagons themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are crude cutting instruments made of chert and
shale,'' Shimada says. ``They have clearly been worked.''
</P>
<P>
   As for dating, Shimada says the volcanic layer is between
500,000 and 600,000 years old. The alluvial layer covering it is
more than 400,000 years old, making the remains about half a
million years old.
</P>
<P>
   Ofer Bar-Yosef, an anthropologist at Harvard University, says
Japanese dating techniques using volcanic ash are usually reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have post holes, this is a rather exceptional situation
in terms of what we know about hominid archaeology,'' says John
Rick, an anthropologist at Stanford University. ``Half a million
years ago, we don't have any concept of what our ancestors were
capable of doing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The remains could help explain how Homo erectus lived and
hunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evidence that they built structures but how permanent
this was we don't know,'' Stringer says. ``They were
hunter-gatherers and they had to move where the resources were. Who
knows whether this was a shelter they stayed in one week, or one
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick says that, if the find is confirmed, it will be interesting
because it shows that hominids could conceive of using technology
to organize things.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the idea of actually making a structure, making a
cultural space, a place where you might sleep,'' he says. ``It
represents a conceptual division between inside and outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Yosef agrees that if the find stands up, it would add to
mounting evidence that hominids living 500,000 years ago were more
sophisticated than many anthropologists believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me _ the cognitive ability to predict
what you'll need was already embedded in the human mind.'' &QL;

allowing THA and silantriol to permeate the skin. To work, the
tights must be worn for at least three 8-hour days. Washing the
tights with a light detergent does not affect the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret does not explain how the chemicals remove
cellulite. Susan Jebb, a scientist specializing in human nutrition
at the Medical Research Council in Cambridge, has investigated many
slimming aids, including creams for rubbing on cellulite. She is
skeptical about claims that chemicals can help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general view is that it is the massage that helps, not the
cream,'' Jebb says. ``But when women pay a lot for creams, they are
more likely to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   In its patent, Victoria's Secret reports that a dozen volunteers
wore the tights for 30 days. The firm says measurements confirmed
by ultrasound scans have shown a 2- 5-centimeter reduction in the
circumference of volunteers' thighs.
</P>
<P>
   It also claims that volunteers' thighs appeared smoother, with
less fatty tissue on the hips. Formerly tight jeans, it reports,
``felt baggy and loose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jebb cautions: ``Short-term size reduction in the thighs
tells nothing about the long-term reduction of body fat.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear why Victoria's Secret is so reluctant to discuss
its plans for the technology. But if the tights do go on sale, the
end results might finally settle the burning question: Is it the
chemical content of a slimming cream or massaging it in that
accounts for any reduction in thigh size?

`WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM?': POWER AND ABILITIES FAR BELOW THOSE OF
MORTAL MEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(jt) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What Planet Are You From?'' represents a breakthrough of sorts
for Garry Shandling. He couldn't be less of a commitophobe than his
character is here. He's out to impregnate a woman and marry her,
the polar opposite of the fearsome, paranoid creeps he's played on
television and in stand-up routines.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the woman he finds gives birth to a son, he has
to disappear. So not everything has changed, although this time
he's leaving because he's an alien whose mission is to find a woman
to bear him a child he can take back to his home planet. One of the
things that remains the same is that whenever Shandling exposes
that picket fence expanse of teeth, something's wrong; he looks as
if the fading memory of a bad smell lingers.
</P>
<P>
   The inhabitants of his planet ``are a product of cloning,'' says
the on-screen text at the beginning of this uneven comedy. ``Their
reproductive organs have shrunk and disappeared. They have no
emotions.'' They also have no women and are all clad in gray,
brushed-wool Nehru jackets, the kind of outfit Keenen Ivory Wayans
would wear if he became an airline pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The mission gives Shandling a chance to be direct, although his
come-ons are the product of instructions you would hear in a more
enlightened infomercial. The pick-up lines he uses, given to him by
Graydon, his leader (Ben Kingsley, who delivers every line with a
quince-jam affect), are on the order of ``Your footwear is quite
stylish.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrives on Earth after transporting himself onto a plane
that's still in flight and causing so much trouble no one bothers
to ask where he came from, he takes the name Harold Anderson and
goes to work as a loan officer at a bank. He's not picky about
women, although his bank co-worker Perry (Greg Kinnear) is so
sleazy and desperate that Harold's insistent come-ons are innocent
by comparison. The womanizing Perry is so self-absorbed that his
features sag with boredom whenever someone else opens his mouth,
unless he sees a way to take advantage of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Perry cruises for dates at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, to
which he takes Harold. Susan (Annette Bening), a recovering
alcoholic who has passed through a number of careers and
boyfriends, catches Harold's eye. She's now a freaked-out real
estate agent, a profession that has become Bening's on-screen
specialty, although she's much saner here than she was in the same
job in ``American Beauty.'' This movie feels cold when she's not on
screen; she's so much the emotional center of ``Planet'' that her
resemblance to the Columbia Pictures logo comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The blend of cravenness and manipulation that fuels office
politics _ part of the story mechanics of Shandling's ``Larry
Sanders Show'' _ becomes a motif here. Several observations play
out in the film, chief among them that people talk past one
another, and no one is really listening. Harold, the outsider, is
the only one who takes in what other people say, if only so he can
try to make sense of it.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of Shandling in this movie, which isn't
surprising, since he is one of its writers. The combination of fear
and spirituality that can be found if you pay close attention to
his work surfaces throughout ``Planet.'' At a climactic point
Harold muses ruefully, ``It's through conflict that we learn about
ourselves,'' the kind of thing you'd expect to hear if Emily
Dickinson ran a group-therapy session.
</P>
<P>
   The movie clears space for Shandling to work the room. Sitting
at a bar and commiserating with a fellow drinker, he sails into a
riff about aliens that sounds like a bit he would do sitting next
to David Letterman. He finds a way to squeeze somestand-up into
the picture, just so the experience of acting in a movie isn't
totally alien to him.
</P>
<P>
   It fits that he would write a romantic comedy about another race
seeking world domination from the alien's point of view. Harold is,
in the end, just a guy trying to please his boss. His travails
include the organ with which he has been fitted to do his job,
which makes as much noise as aircraft landing gear when activated.
And it is activated a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planet'' has an almost beatific fastidiousness. It's as if
someone took a dust cloth and a bottle of Clean to Phoenix, the
film's setting, before the director, Mike Nichols, and his crew set
foot in the area. (With its wide-open desolation, Phoenix works as
the place an alien would find inviting.)
</P>
<P>
   The film is droll and organized; in their meticulousness,
Nichols and Shandling are a little too much in sync. Even the
schtickiest elements are free of mildew; when Linda Fiorentino, as
Perry's vampy wife, shows up, the va-va-voom drumbeat that
accompanies her is so muted that it has a world-music feel to it.
Nichols stages the movie with a languid deadpan, so that
Shandling's slight remoteness isn't jarring; it becomes a piece
about small-scale reactions to the absurdity of the everyday. The
set-up allows ``Planet'' to leer at women and then ridicule that
impulse.
</P>
<P>
   It has also cannily been structured as an ensemble work, a
series of set pieces in which the characters react to Harold's
plainspokenness. The boldness comes from the cast as the
characters' apparent rationality unravels scene by scene. The
masterly John Goodman is a relentless FAA investigator whose zeal
to uncover the truth plants entirely the wrong idea in the head of
his wife (Caroline Aaron), and her patience is dwindling. Judy
Greer is a seemingly normal flight attendant whose anxieties emerge
as Harold gets to know her better. Nichols' instinct for casting is
a boon; the talented and watchable cast also includes Richard
Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the flakiness of Earthlings infects Harold as he
spends more time among them; he can't trust himself anymore. It's
``The Man Who Fell to Earth'' played for laughs. Unfortunately,
``Planet'' is just as cold conceptually. Shandling has developed
into a fine actor over the years, but he's finnicky and brittle
here. Nichols drapes his own dry imperiousness over the script, and
the result is a romantic comedy without a romance. This movie wants
to be sweet and dark at the same time, but it is as distant as a
planet's satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``What Planet Are You From?'' is rated R (Under 17
requires accompanying parent or guardian). It includes alien sexual
apparatus, nudity and adult language related to Shandling's
mission.

REUNITING FOR THE ROCK OF AGES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To quote his Byrds song ``Renaissance Fair,'' David Crosby
sometimes looks around these days and says, ``I think that maybe
I'm dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the happiest guy you're gonna talk to today,'' Crosby, 58,
said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of amazed I'm alive, let alone doing this well,'' he
said. ``So yeah, it's all very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is good in large part because Crosby _ a veteran of rock's
highs and lows since the '60s _ is sober and strong and playing
with his old friends in a reunion tour of Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP;
Young, the early rock supergroup.
</P>
<P>
   He and Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young launched the
tour Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
CSNY have a Monday date at Compaq Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crosby promises their fans about 30 songs in three hours, not
counting an intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still real excited about playing music,'' he assured.
``We still want to crank it up and rock. We still have pretty much
the same value systems we've had all along and stick up for the
same kind of things.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if any of the four ever went away. All have had solo
successes, and Crosby is even an author, having written about rock
stars' political activism in ``Stand and Be Counted'' (Harper,
$25), new in stores.
</P>
<P>
   He's also part of the rock band CPR (along with Jeff Pevar and
Crosby's long-lost son, James Raymond), which will finish a new
album after the CSNY tour ends in April.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not as if Crosby needed a reunion. Already a two-time
member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (with the Byrds and CSNY),
he's one of rock's greatest living icons _ though the ``living''
part was often in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime drug-abuser, Crosby reached a turning point when he
spent a year in the Texas Department of Corrections during the
mid-'80s on a drug and weapons arrest. There, he endured an
agonizing ``cold turkey'' withdrawal from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, Crosby spent a short time at a halfway house
in Houston and joined Nash at a show at a local club before
returning to his home in California.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's had 14 years of drug-free living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in Huntsville (Texas), I think, probably saved my
life,'' he said. ``That's where I quit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very hard way to do it, but I don't regret it at all.
It was necessary. I was in terrible shape until that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet going straight wasn't enough. Crosby wouldn't have survived
without a liver transplant in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Nash also has had travails. Last year he broke both legs in a
boating accident. When the CSNY tour was announced in October, Nash
was in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Graham's doing great now, man,'' Crosby said. ``Our
biggest problem is to get him to slow down. He's got this `it's
only a flesh wound' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hurt bad, no question. But he's a brave guy who doesn't
want to admit he's in pain, and he works really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, CSN have recorded and toured together much more
than CSNY. Young didn't join until after CSN's self-titled debut
disc in '69, followed by CSNY's ``Deja Vu.''
</P>
<P>
   Both were huge hits, but the group splintered in the mid-'70s,
embarking on solo projects and occasional blends such as Crosby and
Nash's joint recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from some brief reunions, CSNY has remained apart, never
touring again until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rare event, man, and you don't want to miss it,''
Crosby said.
</P>
<P>
   Having Young back on stage brings ``a completely different
energy,'' Crosby said. ``It's like sticking your finger in a wall
socket. Whooo!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we weren't energetic without him. But Nash and
me by ourselves, Neil on his own, Stephen with his blues band _
those have a completely different chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``CSNY brings out stuff in all of us that only that combination
can bring out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say CSNY doesn't still play acoustic songs, buoyed
by their trademark rich vocal harmonies, as well as some non-CSNY
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this tour, we go as far back as Buffalo Springfield,''
Crosby said, referring to Stills and Young's '60s band. ``We do
`For What It's Worth' and `Mr. Soul,' sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   So far no Byrds songs have taken flight, ``but I'd love to try
`Eight Miles High' with these guys,'' Crosby said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no solo sets. ``About as far as it goes is Nash and I
do (CSN's) `Guinevere,' just the two of us,'' Crosby said. ``We'd
love to do more solo stuff, but then it'd be a four-hour show.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, they also play new songs from CSNY's ``Looking
Forward'' album.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love playing new material,'' Crosby said. ``It's not that
we don't love playing the old stuff. We do. But the new stuff keeps
us alive and moving forward. We don't wanna be like a jukebox.''
</P>
<P>
   The band members compiled their joint and solo songs before the
tour, finding more than 900 between them. They whittled those down
to 50 or 60 for the road, spread over different nights.
</P>
<P>
   One omission fans have noted so far is the CSN hit ``Suite: Judy
Blue Eyes.'' But Crosby said the song will pop up on tour, ``I
guarantee it.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't see this as CSNY's last hurrah. He'd love it if the
group stuck together.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our 50s, all family guys, are we too old to rock 'n'
roll?'' Crosby asked. ``Look at Chuck Berry, who's about 10 years
older and can rock anybody off the stage. I don't know where you
can draw a line.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I figure is, I'll do it until it's not fun, and I'm
having a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   His personal life isn't bad, either. Within a short span in
1995, Crosby's wife, Jan, gave birth to a son, Django, and he met
James Raymond, a son whom he put up for adoption when he became a
father in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   The day after their meeting, Raymond's wife gave birth to
Crosby's first grandchild. That's not to mention the two children
born to Julie Cypher, partner of rocker Melissa Etheridge, with
friend Crosby as sperm donor.
</P>
<P>
   Fans had speculated the dad was Brad Pitt or other young stars
until Crosby's identity was revealed in January _ to the surprise
of many.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get some kidding about that still, but I think it's calming
down,'' he said. ``I see the kids pretty regularly. We're all
friends, and they're great kids.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether his rock 'n' roll ``family'' will continue, he
won't predict. ``But my guess is there's a chance,'' Crosby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're making some of the best music I've heard in my
life, and everybody seems to be having a blast. Things have
changed, and they haven't. It's still powerful: It's very good, and
I love it.''

`THE NEXT BEST THING': OH, YOUR DADDY'S GAY, AND YOUR MAMA'S A
YOGI 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something happens to Madonna when she stops singing, dancing and
posing and is forced to play a screen character who speaks in
plain, everyday English. The extraordinary drive that made her a
world-famous entertainer becomes stifled, and the personality that
wafts off the screen is a curt, cool cookie who, even in misty-eyed
moments, conveys traces of a sour self-absorption.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Best Thing'' Madonna is paired with her pal, the
English actor Rupert Everett, who exudes a different sort of chill.
(He often suggests a grown-up Little Lord Fauntleroy on the verge
of a tantrum, his curved lower lip dipping into a petulant scowl.)
But if the chemistry they stir up is closer to dry ice than fire,
it's genuine in its way. It is the shared knowledge of two
narcissists who have been around the block often enough to be able
to puncture each other's own romantic illusions without wincing.
And at his liveliest, Everett displays a flouncing comic flair that
brings out Madonna's playful side.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, directed by John Schlesinger from a screenplay by
Thomas Ropelewski, Madonna and Everett portray less exalted
versions of themselves trading remarks that suggest a sharpened
variant of their desultory banter in a recent Vanity Fair cover
story.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna is Abbie Reynolds, a Los Angeles yoga teacher who has
been romantically burned too many times by men who have used those
dreaded words ``It's me, not you'' to wriggle out of relationships
that have lost their zing. Everett is Abbie's gay best friend,
Robert Whittaker, an aging Hollywood party boy and live-in gardener
at the estate of two wealthy older gays who spend afternoons
arguing about whether Ethel Merman or Betty Hutton was the
definitive Annie Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   In its early scenes ``The Next Best Thing'' shows promise as a
sophisticated screwball comedy about romantic love, parenthood and
sexual orientation in contemporary Los Angeles. But about halfway
through, the story takes a disastrous turn and heads away from
comedy into the land of suds and sorrow. Any psychological
credibility the movie has built up is quickly dissipated, as it
turns into a stumbling, poor man's ``Kramer vs. Kramer.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is smartest when it is examining the stresses on a
complicated friendship that turns momentarily erotic with fateful
consequences. After the funeral of a mutual friend who died of
AIDS, Abbie and Robert get wildly drunk and have sex in a scene
that cleverly parodies a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers dance sequence.
Although they experience some morning-after tension, the incident
is quickly forgotten until Abbie discovers she is pregnant. Robert,
on receiving the news, almost faints on the spot but recovers his
equilibrium. And with great enthusiasm the two friends decide they
should live together and bring up the child.
</P>
<P>
   As Abbie and Robert go about telling their friends the news, the
movie becomes a shrewd comic barometer of social attitudes in
contemporary Hollywood. In the niftiest moment of farce, Robert
helps Abbie get revenge on Kevin (Michael Vartan), a boyfriend who
has just dumped her, by posing as his flamboyantly effeminate
lover, visiting the recording studio where Kevin works and
embarrassing him in front of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie takes the first of many wrong turns when it
abruptly cuts from Abbie's delivery of their son, Sam (Malcolm
Stumpf), to six years later, when Sam is an adorable boy who is
just beginning to ask his parents ticklish personal questions.
Until then, we are led to believe, everything has been just peachy,
with the three living in bugs-in-a-rug bliss. Sam is that ludicrous
Hollywood fantasy, a model child who never gets sick, never loses
his temper and loves everybody all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble arrives in the form of Ben (Benjamin Bratt), a hunky New
York investment banker who strolls into Abbie's yoga studio one
day, takes a lesson and quickly falls in love with her. Robert
becomes increasingly miffed as Ben plays daddy to Sam during their
picture-postcard beach outings. And when Abbie and Ben announce
their plans to marry, the question of Sam's future becomes a
bitterly divisive issue.
</P>
<P>
   At this point the movie throws in a plot twist that makes the
question of custody 10 times knottier. It also suddenly changes our
perceptions of Abbie by demonizing a character the movie had
presented as a likable good sport. The movie's remaining shreds of
credibility are destroyed once Ben makes some inexplicable career
decisions. Only Hollywood could dream up an investment banker who
looks and sounds like a macho street fighter but speaks in the
warm, fuzzy vocabulary of a New Age guru. (He actually talks about
taking sick companies and making them well.)
</P>
<P>
   Although one can only surmise how the movie went wrong, ``The
Next Best Thing'' plays like a film whose creators feared at one
point that the story was too small and familiar, and frantically
cooked up some extra plot to add narrative juice. The moment the
movie loses its lighthearted spirit is the moment it loses touch
with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``The Next Best Thing'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It includes sexual situations, frank sexual dialogue
and partial nudity.

IT'S TAYE DIGGS AT HIS `BEST' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE BEST MAN'
</P>
<P>
   Think of this as a black ``The Big Chill,'' with former college
classmates reuniting years later, this time for a wedding in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case in ``Chill,'' contrivance dictates that almost
everybody has become wildly successful, from a TV director (Nia
Long) to a superstar jock who's getting wed (Morris Chestnut) to
Harper, an author who is the title character (Taye Diggs).
</P>
<P>
   Harper is basking in his first book deal for a novel that's a
thinly veiled account of their college days. Its release isn't due
until after the wedding, but advance copies fall into his friends'
hands.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly seize upon their surrogates in the book, with
messy, confrontational results _ especially when the groom realizes
his bride slept with his best man during school days.
</P>
<P>
   What ensues is a romantic comedy with unpleasant tangents, such
as the groom's fiercely violent temper tantrums, for which the film
has too much tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan also is depicted as a strange other world. Instead of
the diverse city we know it to be, it's populated almost
unanimously by black men and women who have every speaking part in
the film, down to the tiniest bit player.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Malcolm Lee (cousin of Spike Lee, who produced), the
cast is superb, especially Diggs, the charismatic lover of ``How
Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a much meatier part as he desperately tries to disarm
the emotional bombs of his book and as he's torn between his
longtime girlfriend and a seductive former classmate (Long).
</P>
<P>
   You might say that Harper is the one waiting to exhale _ at
least until he can get his friends hitched.
</P>
<P>

   `AN EXTREMELY GOOFY MOVIE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This direct-to-video Disney effort is ambitious and surprisingly
good.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Disney movies made for video, it's a sequel to a
theatrical hit, in this case 1995's ``A Goofy Movie,'' which made
$35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the creaky old character of Goofy is immersed in
relatively hip and contemporary sensibilities, thanks to his
teen-age son, Max.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Goofy is a constant embarrassment to Max. Yet he
prevails via good-hearted doggedness, despite being prone to
pratfalls (much like the late Jim Varney's Ernest character).
</P>
<P>
   Here, Max is off to college, and Goofy suffers from empty-nest
syndrome _ and losing his job. So he enrolls in Max's college
himself (an unforgivable intrusion, but without it there's no
movie).
</P>
<P>
   On campus, ``Extremely Goofy'' tries to have it both ways,
keeping Max very much a kid while advancing him toward adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The chief kid-bent is making Max a champion skateboarder.
Defying an arrogant upperclassman, he competes in extreme sports at
this college, where students don't seem to have graduated to cars
yet.
</P>
<P>
   On the more savvy side, the film offers charming coffeehouse
scenes with a sassy Beat poetess (voiced by Vicki Lewis of
television's ``News Radio'').
</P>
<P>
   Having its hopelessly dated dad doesn't deter the film's lively
spirits. At college, Goofy sparks disco-era nostalgia as he
partners in dance with a librarian voiced by Bebe Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   Pauly Shore gives voice to Max's impish pal, while Jason Marsden
and Bill Farmer return as the voices of Max and Goofy,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The animation is fluid, and the backgrounds are handsomely
detailed. The song score also is strong, with Pat Benatar covering
Timbuk 3's ``The Future's So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades''
andBritish trio Cleopatra giving a new spin to ``Right Back Where
We Started From.''
</P>
<P>
   The material also is on a soundtrack album called ``An Extremely
Goofy Movie Dance Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 stars.

<P>
   &LR; `STIGMATA' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This ``Exorcist'' wannabe bristles with visual dazzle but bogs
down in cliches and a murky narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Byrne plays a troubled priest whose bosses at the
Vatican seem even more corrupt than those of ``Godfather III.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne travels to the United States to investigate a stigmata
phenomenon, in which a young Pittsburgh hairdresser (Patricia
Arquette) suddenly and inexplicably suffers the same wounds Christ
had on the cross, with nail holes erupting on her wrists and lash
marks on her back.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the priest also should investigate why Pittsburgh
suffers from constant, drenching rains throughout the film.
</P>
<P>
   It's so rainy that you might also brand the film as a ``Blade
Runner'' wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might simply call it all wet.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly violent, albeit in a highly stylized way that
substitutes bloody eye candy for true terror. In effect, this is an
overblown music video geared toward gore-heads.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it's quite mindless, making no attempt to justify its
bizarre metaphysics.
</P>
<P>
   Arquette's affliction _ somehow transmitted by a relic she
received in the mail _ owes less to stigmata than to the demonic
possession of ``The Exorcist,'' a truly horrific film that dared to
make sense.

QUEEN OF `SCREAM' GETS SILLY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She may reign as the current Queen of ``Scream,'' but
Neve Campbell hopes her horror-movie fans will be laughing at her
soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the extremely silly ``Drowning Mona,'' whihc opens this
weekend, Campbell trades both her dramatic persona from Fox's
``Party of Five'' and her terrorized teen-turned-fem-avenger in the
hit ``Scream'' film series for something considerably lighter and
ditzier.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Drowning Mona,'' Campbell, 26, plays the
eager-to-be-married Ellen. Her fiance, Bobby (Casey Affleck), is
one of several suspects in the death of Mona, the town's crabbiest,
most unpopular resident (Bette Midler).
</P>
<P>
   It's a kooky role _ one Campbell loved playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely!,'' she said, the first of many times she used that
word during the next half-hour. ``(It was) a lot of fun and really
light. I laughed a lot. It was fun to play someone really
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Campbell's Ellen, while no rocket scientist, is among
the brighter residents of the small town of Verplanck, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mona'' co-stars Jamie Lee Curtis, as a waitress who wears
miniskirts with sneakers and smokes while serving food, and Danny
DeVito, the local sheriff who is also Ellen's dad. (The town's so
small, sleepy and second-rate that the sheriff's official car is a
battered subcompact.)
</P>
<P>
   However much fun she had goofing around on the set _ ``The film
is so absurd and ridiculous that you cannot take it seriously in
any way,'' she said _ Campbell admitted she had her doubts about
trying something so different from the roles that have turned her
from struggling Canadian actress into Hollywood star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really scary straying from the things you know and people
like you doing,'' she said. But she insisted the work is more
important to her than fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to grow is important to me, above and beyond my
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor, you're always growing. When I'm 80 years old, if
I'm still acting or still alive, I'll still be learning and
growing. That's a process, and you have to keep that moving no
matter what people want to keep you as.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In person, Campbell looks younger than her age, but her attitude
and dress are mature and subdued. Her dark hair (with one slightly
auburn streak) is pulled back.
</P>
<P>
   A bulky grey turtleneck sweater and heavy wool skirt add some
softness, and a little diamond clip and antique earrings lend a
touch of class.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite her youth, Campbell is a seasoned veteran. ``Party of
Five'' is in its sixth (and rumored to be last) year. Campbell had
done several films before the original ``Scream'' in 1996 led to
fame. Since then, she has had the two hit Scream sequels and the
cult bad-girls film ``Wild Things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working professionally since I was 15, for 11
years,'' she said. Before that, she was a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a classical ballerina; that was my first career. That's
all I thought about and never thought about acting at all.''
</P>
<P>
   She trained at the National Ballet School in Toronto, where she
grew up. But she had a rough time. In recent years, she has blamed
her time there for the physical aches and pains she lives with,
including arthritis and hip problems. She finds acting ``much
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With dance, you're in the classroom every day, and you're
constantly struggling and aware of the competition, where _ for me
at least _ as an actress, I'm not struggling to become better than
someone next to me. I'm struggling to become better than I was the
day before, which feels a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was surprised when she found out ``Scream 3'' and
``Drowning Mona'' would come out so close to one another, but she
figures it won't make much difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very different kinds of characters in different kinds
of films for different audiences. So I think it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox has not said ``Party of Five'' will end after this
season, that's what Campbell expects. With Miramax announcing that
``Scream 3'' is the last of that series (we'll see), she would be
left without her two mainstays.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, (the show's) been fantastic for me. ''Party of
Five's`` the reason I got into the States, and it's been my first
big thing here, and it's been a way for me to use my (acting)
muscles every day, which is great. ''Scream`` was fantastic and had
great success and really helped me career-wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm elated to kind of empty the cup, so I can fill it
again. The last six years have been insane. The most I've had off
is two weeks each year. Every time I have a hiatus, I did one or
two films. This time I was doing ''Scream 3,`` ''Drowning Mona``
and ''Party of Five`` at the same time. That was insane.''
</P>
<P>
   She already has her next film lined up, working for independent
film director Alan Rudolph (``Choose Me,'' ``Trouble in Mind'') on
a movie in Berlin called ``Investigating Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's, like, a no-money, lots of fun, actor's piece, which I'm
really looking forward to. It's going to be really experimental and
creative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything planned after that. If I want to take a
break, I'll do that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the conversation turns, or rather attempts to turn, to her
private life, Campbell handily deflects the thrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to keep stuff like that out of the press. I'm just
at a place where that's (only) for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first become famous we feel like we have to be
absolutely honest about everything. I'm not saying I'm being
dishonest right now, but we feel the need to give our hearts to
everybody, and say this is who I am. But you end up affecting your
loved ones, your family members. You have to learn not to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Campbell married aspiring actor Jeff Colt, but the
couple divorced in 1998. And although she comes from Toronto, her
mother and older brother, Christian, also an actor (``Trick'') live
close by in Los Angeles. Her father and younger brothers still live
in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   On the set of ``Drowning Mona,'' Campbell found herself paired
with Affleck, who has one of the leads in the movie although his
relative-newcomer status didn't warrant top billing. She did share
with him what she's learned about the business and fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to be condescending and say this is what you
do,'' Campbell said. ``I just talked to him about my own
experiences and how I've responded in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of in different places because I've been doing
(''Party of Five``) so my face has been out there in public a
little bit more than Casey's.''
</P>
<P>
   So, does that mean she feels old and wise now? The silliness of
the question surprises and tickles her. She giggles as she answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, I felt old and wise five years ago, and I look
back, and I knew nothing.''
</P>

 &HT;    Gary Nicklaus is a hunter, fisherman, outdoorsman, pet lover
and. . .he golfs too.
 &HT;    By Alan Tays
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida _ Showing off the grounds of the
Jupiter home he shares with his fiancee, Heather McDonough, Gary
Nicklaus points out the nesting boxes he made for wood ducks, a
once-threatened species, and marvels at the female wood duck's
penchant for flying almost full speed into the nesting box's entry
hole.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the house are the mounted heads of seven game animals
killed by Nicklaus. There are two whitetail deer, a mule deer, a
warthog, a kudu (a species of African antelope), an impala and a
sable antelope. Roaming the house are two more-fortunate animals:
Chili, the couple's 4-year-old female boxer, and Hugo, their
1-year-old Maine coon cat.
</P>
<P>
   In the driveway on a trailer is a 19-foot Action Craft flats
fishing boat. ``That was the present I bought for myself right
after I got this,'' Nicklaus says, pulling out a money clip that is
the first tangible evidence of what he does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Gary Nicklaus _ hunter, fisherman, outdoorsman, fiance, pet
owner _ also plays golf.
</P>
<P>
   This year, at the age of 31, he finally has made it full time to
the stage his father, Jack, dominated for almost three decades. In
December, on his ninth attempt at making it through PGA Tour
qualifying school, he shot a 63 in the final round at Doral to earn
his Tour card.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's all about,'' he says, holding out the money
clip that signifies PGA Tour membership.
</P>
<P>
   Two ``things'' come with being Gary Nicklaus: ``the Sports
Illustrated cover thing'' and ``the Jack's son thing.'' So let's
get them out of the way early.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 16, Gary appeared on the cover of the March 11,
1985, Sports Illustrated dressed in tennis shorts and a golf shirt,
hitting practice balls. ``The Next Nicklaus,'' the headline read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the day it came out,'' said Toby Harbeck, Gary's
golf coach at The Benjamin School. ``We had it in the car and we
were driving to a match and he was looking at it and shaking his
head. I said, 'What are you shaking your head about?' He said,
'This is not the way it was supposed to be.' It was supposed to be
an article about the whole family. It ended up being all about him.
I know Jack wasn't very pleased with Sports Illustrated, because it
put a lot of pressure on Gary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great honor to be on the cover,'' Gary said last
month, ``but I had not any merit to be there. I mean, Tiger, he won
three U.S. Juniors, three U.S. Amateurs, and I don't know how old
he was the first time he got on the Sports Illustrated cover, but
he wasn't 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of attention that I really didn't want. I was a
sophomore in high school; my wants and desires were not to be a
public figure at that age. It was more to go fishing and chase
girls and do whatever sophomores in high school do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary's oldest sibling, brother Jackie, 38, the first ``Next
Nicklaus,'' thinks the SI cover ``turned his attention away from
golf. I think it kind of spooked him a little bit. He understood
that there was an expectation for Gary now, and he spent a lot of
time with his friends at college and enjoyed his college life at
Ohio State.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The SI cover thing,'' of course, was all about ``the Jack's
son thing.'' And Gary's take on that subject is ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been his son for 30 years and I've had a lot of attention
everywhere I've gone,'' Gary told reporters in December during his
father's annual ``State of the Bear'' address. ``If I have not
learned to deal with it, then I've got a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely I want people to recognize me as Gary Nicklaus. But
if I go out and win the Grand Slam this year, I'm still Jack
Nicklaus' son.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough about Golden Bears. It's Gary we don't know jack
about. What kind of a guy is he?
</P>
<P>
   He's a tool guy _ ``pretty much a Home Depot and a Craftsman
guy.'' He's been that way since he was a kid. Both his mother,
Barbara, and sister, Nan O'Leary, say the young Gary was constantly
taking things apart, but not putting them back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to fix things,'' Gary said. ``I've got my tool bench
out there (in the garage) with probably a pretty impressive
collection of tools for a person who isn't in the profession of
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   You picture him dialing an 800 number after watching an
infomercial for the latest and greatest in screwdrivers or ratchet
sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said with a laugh, ``but I do fall prey sometimes to
other infomercials,'' pointing to a rotisserie cooker on the
counter. Gary, by the account of Heather, Nan and Barbara, is a
pretty fair cook, too.
</P>
<P>
   At Ohio State, where Gary followed his father, even pledging at
the same fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta, he met McDonough. She was a
freshman and he was an upperclassman. They met in a hospitality
tent at his father's Muirfield Village Golf Club. ``I asked her
out, we had a good time and then she dumped me,'' Gary said,
teasing Heather. Gary went on to marry his high school sweetheart,
Jill Moffitt, but their two careers (Jill is a dancer who toured
with Madonna and danced in the Broadway show Cats) proved
incompatible and they divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Heather, who grew up in Cincinnati, began dating again.
With Heather working in Miami, where she is director of special
events for the local chapter of the American Red Cross, their
careers don't get in each other's way.
</P>
<P>
   Gary also met Rob Sample at Ohio State. Sample, the Golden Bear
Golf vice president in charge of the Nicklaus-Flick Golf Schools,
roomed with Gary for a year. He remembers Gary as an excellent
student, a fan of Buckeyes football and Jimmy Buffett and a great
guy to have around when a party was being planned. ``He was always
there to help out,'' said Sample, who also calls Gary ``the best
friend anyone could have. If I needed him now, he'd drop everything
and be there.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of support can be extended to strangers, too. After
winning The Office Depot Father-Son tournament in Naples, Gary and
two friends came upon a couple with a flat tire. They fixed the
flat, prompting the couple to write a thank-you letter that was
published in the Naples Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The one question that keeps coming up about Gary's golf game is
this: Did it come too easily? Did he work hard enough at it? Did
tool benches or flats boats or wood ducks or Ohio State football
games get in the way too often? Are any of those things the reason
it took him nine trips to qualifying school before he graduated?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at it as Gary (taking) nine years to qualify
for the PGA Tour,'' Jack Nicklaus said. ``I think Gary has tried to
qualify for the PGA Tour realistically (only) the last three years.
I don't think his golf game was capable of qualifying for the PGA
Tour until the last two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack thinks Gary made a breakthrough when he committed to
playing the European Tour in 1998 and the Nike Tour in 1999. ``That
elevated his ability to play golf,'' he said. ``You can't get
better unless you play.''
</P>
<P>
   Not playing well, however, almost led Gary to give up playing.
During one trip home from Europe after some bad performances, ``I
talked to my dad and said, 'I'm going to finish out the European
Tour, but after that, I don't think I'm going to play anymore. What
opportunities are there within Golden Bear and within our
organization?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gary's game improved when he returned to Europe, and he forgot
about quitting.

   Gary gives Jack credit for offering advice without being _ no
pun intended _ overbearing. ``As I've gotten older,'' Gary said,
``he has tended to let me do things my own way. He's still my dad,
and he still likes to make sure he's there for me. If there are
things he thinks I might want his advice on, he'll let me know.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Jack, Gary says, who subscribes to Mark Twain's
observation: ``When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I
could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be
21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to always say that about how smart his father got when
he got older,'' Gary said of Jack and Jack's father, Charlie
Nicklaus. ``I've always thought (Jack) was pretty smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary pinpoints his breakthrough as the final round of Q-school
in December at Doral. He was on the bubble, not a sure thing to
make it without a spectacular final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played solid all week,'' he said, ``but when I got to the
final round it was like, all right, this is why I've spent the last
2 1/2 years on the European and Nike tours. It was weird, because
all of a sudden I had this sense that I belonged here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first hole, he hit ``a perfect tee shot, a perfect second
shot to about 4feet and made the putt for birdie. ``There was
absolutely zero nerves the entire day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary says there are a couple of things he might do differently
over the past nine years. ``If I had separated my play time from my
work time and managed my time a little better, I probably would
have been out there (on Tour) a little earlier,'' he said. ``If you
have time to do something, then fine, but don't take time away from
your practice to do the fun things. Wait until you get home. Play
hard when you get home, but work hard when you're on Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbeck sees Gary as a take-charge guy, a quality he displayed
right from the beginning of their relationship, when Benjamin
needed a golf coach. ``He said to me after his first year, 'Why
don't you coach golf?''' Harbeck said. ``I said, 'I don't know
anything about golf.' he said, 'I'll teach you everything you need
to know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gary has made the cuts in half of the six events he has played
this year. ``I've just got to start putting better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Gary always will have the satisfaction of
knowing he made it to this level on his own. ``He showed a lot of
guts to me in the second qualifier when he shot 68 the last round
when he was on the bubble and when he shot 63 in the last round of
the final qualifier,'' Jack said. ``It's not something his dad can
do. He's got to do that for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years after the Sports Illustrated story, Harbeck read a
letter in the magazine referring to fathers and sons who had been
on SI covers. Gary and Jack weren't mentioned, and Harbeck wanted
to correct the error. But he also added another thought. ``I also
said you'd hear the Nicklaus name again,'' he said, ``and it
wouldn't be Jack.''

 &HT;    MILITIA MAN'S APOLOGY JOLTS LEBANON'S AMNESIA
 &HT;    With Photo.

<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ It came in a newspaper advertisement, but it
jolted Lebanon like a flashback from a forgotten nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a former member of a Christian militia took out ads
apologizing for war crimes during the 15-year civil war that ended
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to apologize, apologize to all those whose executioner
I was or who were my victims,'' wrote Assaad(CQ) Shaftari. ``I
apologize for the ugliness of the war and what I did during the
civil war in the name of Lebanon, the 'cause' or 'Christianity.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope,'' he wrote, ``is that my call be understood as the
only way out of the Lebanese ordeal. Souls will then be purified of
hatred and rancor, from the pain of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaftari was an officer in the Lebanese Forces, the largest
Christian militia in the bloody sectarian fighting. He was high up,
though not in the top tier of Lebanon's war-makers.
</P>
<P>
   His ads were not the only reminder of a war many want to forget.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Lebanese government formed a committee to
determine the fate of 17,000 people who ``disappeared'' during the
long-running conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Even as hundreds of Beirut buildings still stand as
artillery-riddled shells, many Lebanese have adopted what they call
an ``amnesia'' about the war.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon still has no national war memorial for the tens of
thousands who died. Those involved gave themselves a blanket
amnesty for war crimes in 1992, and stayed in influential
government posts.
</P>
<P>
   Many Lebanese here call the war the ``War of the Others,''
implying that responsibility lies with the Israeli, American,
Syrian or other armies that trooped through between 1975 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Shaftari disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in the lobby of a posh Beirut hotel, Shaftari spoke
with three foreign journalists for the first time since the
apology. Dressed in a dark blue suit and tie, with a white sweater
vest, the balding 44-year-old looked like the electrical engineer
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say it was the 'War of the Others,''' he said. ``It
was our real war.''
</P>
<P>
   But, there has been little effort to assess blame for the
massacres and destruction that took place. There is no talk of a
truth commission, as was used in South Africa or Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the war still wield power, sit in parliament or
occupy government ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no power base from which to launch this cleansing,''
said Paul Salem, a political analyst and candidate for the Lebanese
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the political reluctance to cast blame on the
powerful, many average Lebanese want to focus on rebuilding, rather
than the days of horrifying shellings and kidnappings. At the same
time, they remember who their enemies were and hold grudges.
</P>
<P>
   Salem and others believe it would be helpful to sort out the
ugly past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there is a need in terms of social society and
rebuilding trust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaftari said he was not a fighter in the war. He was a
commander whose orders lead to deaths. He would not say how many.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot. You don't want to know,'' he said, raising his
eyebrows. ``There is no difference between one and 10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Shaftari was deputy leader of his militia.
</P>
<P>
   History records both sides committing civilian massacres, but
some of the most notorious belong to the Christians.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Black Saturday'' in 1975, Christians seized from the
streets and executed about 350 Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Shaftari's boss, Elie Hobeika, was blamed for leading the
killing of more than 700 Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila
refugee camps in 1982. That killing became notorious because
Israeli troops watched from a rooftop and aided with illumination
flares.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 12 years, Shaftari became involved with a European
peace group his wife, Marie, introduced to him.
</P>
<P>
   He said a tell-all book recently published by one of Hobeika's
bodyguards was too seedy and commercial a way to address the war.
He wanted to set an example for real reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scored an immense blow in favor of memory,'' wrote
political commentator Michael Young in Beirut's Daily Star
newspaper. ``Lebanon has been built on a foundation of
state-sponsored amnesia. Yet, in a few hundred words, a former
militiaman exposed this as inane, disclosing how foul the wartime
legacy could be.''
</P>
<P>
   But, not all are as quick to praise Shaftari.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe him. He is a liar,'' said Subhiya Faris, 55,
whose husband and three sons have been missing since they were
taken from their car by Christian forces in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she joins about 35 other relatives of the missing who
demonstrate outside a government building once a week. They want to
know officially what happened to their loved ones, though most
figure they are likely dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our constant struggle we have been able to bring about an
official admission that there is an issue of the kidnapped,'' said
Wadad Helwani, leader of the families group.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Mustafa, was taken from her home in 1982 by men who
claimed to be with the Lebanese military. He was a teacher, active
with the Lebanese communists. He also organized neighborhood bomb
shelters and neighborhood support programs during the 1982 Israeli
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks her husband was probably killed, but she and the
other survivors want the government to find out for sure. Until
that happens, apologies from people like Shaftari will not matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough for him to apologize,'' she said. ``He has to
ask to be forgiven.''

 &HT;    ISRAELI CHIEF RABBI EXPECTS POPE TO ASK FORGIVENESS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's chief rabbi Thursday said Pope John Paul II
should ask forgiveness for church silence during the Holocaust when
he visits later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope is expected to visit Israel and the Palestinian areas
for six days beginning March 30. It will be his first trip here as
Pope, and the first trip here by any Pope since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a series of protocol squabbles concerning the
visit have highlighted age-old Jewish anxieties about the Pope and
Catholicism. Israel and the Vatican only established full
diplomatic ties in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau said he welcomed the Pope and
said the frail 79-year-old pontiff has traveled the world
repeatedly condemning anti-Semitism. Lau, a Holocaust survivor from
Poland, said the Pope understands the horrors of the Holocaust
because he is also from Poland.
</P>
<P>
   But, Lau said the Pope's scheduled visit to Jerusalem's Yad
Vashem Holocaust museum should include a plea for forgiveness on
behalf of the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Lau referred to a 1998 church committee that renounced the
silence of individual Catholics during the Holocaust. Lau and other
Jewish leaders objected that the committee had not gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asking for forgiveness at Yad Vashem will be more
satisfying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the wartime Pope Pius XII had remained silent and
therefore ``stood in the blood'' of innocent Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``To not deny the Holocaust means telling the truth,'' Lau said.
He said the 1998 committee was ``chapter one'' and that he was
``waiting for chapter two.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadie Abunassar, a spokesman for the Vatican's millennium
activities in the Holy Land, answered that Catholics should not be
repeatedly asked for apologies for the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should continue with apologies, apologies,
apologies,'' he said. ``We have to think of reconciliation. Real
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pope has labeled 2000 as a holy year, stressing repentance.
It is expected that he will offer at least limited church apologies
later in the month on several historical matters.
</P>
<P>
   Historic friction between Jews and Catholics has come up
frequently as Israel prepares for the Pope's pilgrimage. A small,
but vocal, minority has expressed objections to the papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Lau began his news conference Thursday, a handful of
extremists stood outside his offices with signs accusing the Pope
of being an anti-Semite.
</P>
<P>
   The protestors said they were related to the outlawed Kach
movement, a militant, anti-Arab group representing a tiny fringe of
Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, more than 2,000 rabbis signed a petition asking
the Pope to respect the Jewish Sabbath, which runs from Friday
evening through Saturday evening, during his tour.
</P>
<P>
   Lau, also, called on the Pope to minimize his travel on the
Sabbath so that observant Jews among the Israeli police and
security will not have to work. He said, for example, the Pope
should not use a helicopter to travel from Jerusalem to Nazareth, a
two-hour drive away, so that pilots of air force escorts can get
the day off.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials reacted with outrage last month when the Pope
met with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. The two
approved an agreement between the Vatican and the Palestinian
Authority that Israelis interpreted as a challenge to Israeli
authority in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Israeli objections are similar to misgivings that
some Israelis had about hosting the thousands of Christian pilgrims
who came here for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that Jews have seen Christianity, often
Catholicism, used as the justification for anti-Jewish activities
from the Crusades a thousand years ago to modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Muslims have expressed doubts about the papal
visit. Ibrahim Sarsur, head of a branch of the Islamic Movement in
Israel, said the Pope should issue an apology for massacres of
Muslims during the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pope is using his visit as an opportunity to enhance
inter-faith relations with both Jews and Muslims. Father Peter
Vasco, a member of the seven-person council that oversees Middle
Eastern holy sites, said that the overall atmosphere is good.
</P>
<P>
   He downplayed the objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are isolated incidents,'' he said. ``Certainly, we're
not surprised at it. At the same time we realize it's not the
majority opinion of the Israeli people.''

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   8 Oscar nominations: picture, actor (Kevin Spacey), actress
(Annette Bening), director, original screenplay, cinematography,
film editing, original score. The ever-more-remarkable Spacey plays
a man caught in a midlife limbo in this scarily disturbing,
daringly hilarious, well-written and well-acted comedy-drama. It's
a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the Beautifully Screwed
Up. (ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Agnes Browne'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anjelica Huston
</P>
<P>
   and Marion O'Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   Treating Irish culture like a theme park, the makers of ``Agnes
Browne'' never miss a chance to smear local ``color'' on the
screen: beery pub singalongs, a soundtrack reeling with pipes and
fiddles, and that overly familiar icon, the noble, working-class
mum raising a passel of kids by her lonesome. It isn't a total
disaster. It's just a wasted opportunity, a mediocre time-killer.
(SM) One hour, 32 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' R (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson
</P>
<P>
   and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: original score. A finely made adaptation of
Frank McCourt's popular memoir of growing up in poverty and death
in Ireland. Fans of the book will enjoy seeing their favorite parts
re-created onscreen. Others, who don't have the memory of McCourt's
lyrical prose whispering in their heads, might wonder what the fuss
is all about. (SM) 2 hours, 26 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beach'' R (violence, profanity, sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Leonardo DiCaprio
</P>
<P>
   and Virginie Ledoyen
</P>
<P>
   A secondhand plot. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a restless young man
who travels with other aimless, privileged young people to a hidden
paradise _ then screws it up. It's hard to get attached to
characters who care about only one thing: their next moment of
pleasure. The cinematography makes the most of exotic locations.
But all the beauty in the world can't camouflage the film's
gorgeous emptiness. (SM)1 hour, 59 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: director, supporting actress (Catherine
Keener), original screenplay. It's a loopy original. John Cusack
plays a quirky file clerk who discovers a door that leads into the
noggin of actor John Malkovich. Toying with big concepts _ the
nature of identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire, the
illusion of free will, it's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And often hysterically funny. (SM)1 hour, 52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Giovanni Ribisi,
</P>
<P>
   Vin Diesel and Ron Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered descendant of ``Wall Street'' and ``Glengarry
Glen Ross,'' this study of muscle-mouthed stockbrokers aiming to
make their first million before getting their first wrinkle pays
onscreen tribute to those two movies. It's a bracing reminder that
greed is still good _ so long as you don't get caught when you
pretzel the rules. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' R (sex, profanity, nudity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hilary Swank
</P>
<P>
   and Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actress (Hilary Swank), supporting actress
(Chloe Sevigny). This intense true story of Teena Brandon, a
21-year-old woman who believed she was a man. After cutting her
hair and reversing her name, she hung out with some hard-drinking
rednecks in rural Nebraska, which didn't work out. The movie is a
bit low-budget, but it's still a remarkable film. (ERG)1 hour, 54
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   7 Oscar nominations: picture, director, adapted screenplay,
supporting actor (Michael Caine), art direction, original score,
film editing. John Irving adapted his own novel. In the first half,
Dr. Larch (Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal abortions in
his Maine orphanage. In the second, less-engaging half, Larch's
protege, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), runs off to learn about the
world. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Drowning Mona'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Danny DeVito,
</P>
<P>
   Bette Midler, Neve Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   As we get to know Mona (Bette Midler) through flashbacks, we
quickly understand why nobody is disturbed by her demise. It turns
out that the Yugo in which she took a header into the Hudson River
had its brakes sabotaged. Police Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito)
begins investigating her murder, and finds that everyone in town
had something against Mona. (Hap Ernstein, Palm Beach Post)1 hour,
30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' R (scenes of strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore
</P>
<P>
   and Stephen Rea.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actress (Julianne Moore), cinematography.
Neil Jordan's somber, velvety and often sensual adaptation of
Graham Greene's novel explores love both physical and spiritual.
While the movie doesn't skimp on humid clinches and bared skin, it
also summons up the intangible mysteries of sacrifice and devotion
to a higher power. (SM)1 hour, 49 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' PG (mild violence and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver
</P>
<P>
   and Alan Rickman.
</P>
<P>
   It'll beam you up, up and away. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and
Alan Rickman lead a small band of has-been sci-fi TV show actors
lured by misguided aliens into helping them save their far, far
away galaxy from an invasion of evil bug-lizards. Though it starts
slowly, ``Quest's'' completely cornball humor sometimes scores
direct hits. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity, drug content,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: supporting actress (Angelina Jolie). Two
fine actresses, two fine performances. Based on Susanna Kaysen's
memoir about the two years in the '60s she spent at a mental
hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone reminiscent of
``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' Winona Ryder steadies the
movie, but Jolie provides the fireworks as a charismatic sociopath.
(ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   4 Oscar nominations: picture, supporting actor (Michael Clarke
Duncan), adapted screenplay, sound. A manipulative but meticulously
crafted, absorbing and beautifully acted adaptation of Stephen
King's prison novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose
latest prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Duncan, has mystical
powers of healing. (SM)3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanging Up'' PG (profanity and mild sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Diane Keaton,
</P>
<P>
   Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   Breezily written by the Ephron sisters and briskly directed by
Diane Keaton, the movie's ads want you to believe it's a
side-splitting sibling comedy about three sisters (Keaton, Meg
Ryan, Lisa Kudrow) trying to connect. However, it's really an aging
parent-confused adult child story in which Ryan tries to be all
things to her dying dad (Walter Matthau). (ERG) 1 hour, 32 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' R (profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Vicellous Reon Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: actor (Denzel Washington). Washington
delivers his best performance in years as pugilist Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter, the middleweight contender wrongly imprisoned
for nearly 20 years in a triple murder. Though ably directed, the
film contains some fabrications to tell this otherwise compelling
true story. (Bob Longino)2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino
</P>
<P>
   and Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   7 Oscar nominations: Picture, actor (Russell Crowe), director,
adapted screenplay, cinematography, film editing, sound. Crowe, the
hot-tempered cop in ``L.A. Confidential,'' gives an astonishing
performance. He plays Jeffrey Wigand, a real-life cigarette
industry consultant who blew the lid off the tobacco industry. Al
Pacino plays the ``60 Minutes'' producer dogging the story. (ERG)1
hour, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' R (profanity, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julianne Moore
</P>
<P>
   and Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: supporting actor (Tom Cruise), original
screenplay, song. A mesmerizing tapestry about broken families,
love and forgiveness. Unfolding at fever pitch and studded with
small miracles of acting, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's
movie is exhilarating and exhausting, the sort of thing you live
through as much as watch. The payoff is well worth it. (SM)2 hours,
59 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip'' PG (violent content and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frankie Muniz,
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the late Willie Morris' best-seller about growing up in
small-town 1940s Mississippi, this family film is a gentle
remembrance of how things can pass from our lives but never really
leave us. Nine-year-old Willie (``Malcolm in the Middle's'' Frankie
Muniz) is a shy only child whose life changes when his mother
(Diane Lane) gives him a Jack Russell puppy, despite dad's (Kevin
Bacon) objection. (ERG)1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Next Best Thing'' PG-13 (profanity, partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Madonna
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue, the melodramatic situations, the performances all
scream ``Phony!'' Madonna and Rupert Everett play best pals (she's
straight, he's gay), who end up raising a child together. Some bad
movies, of course, are perversely enjoyable. This isn't one of
them. (Robert W. Butler, Kansas City Star) 1 hour, 40 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' R (profanity, drug use, sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ice Cube
</P>
<P>
   and Mike Epps.
</P>
<P>
   A dumb comedy. The best that can be said for this sequel to
``Friday'' is that, unlike the first flick, the characters don't
spend most of the movie sitting on the front steps yakking and
getting stoned. They go elsewhere to get stoned. Lamely written,
it's a reminder that, while complex, mature and funny
African-American comedies are being made, there's always a market
for flatulence and dog poop jokes. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black'' R (profanity and sci-fi violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vin Diesel
</P>
<P>
   and Radha Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry aliens, stupid humans: the usual. ``Pitch Black'' is just
the latest sci-fi rip-off of ``Aliens,'' packed with caricatures.
In the movie's last hour, writer-director David Twohy pretends to
explore his stick figures' moral choices, and he forgets to deliver
the thrills. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 47 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games'' R (sex, violence, nudity, and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Charlize Theron
</P>
<P>
   and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   When it's good, it's very good, but when it's bad. ... Ben
Affleck plays an ex-con who poses as his former cell mate in order
to bed babelicious Charlize Theron and gets caught in a nasty mess
with her psycho brother (Gary Sinise), who wants him to help rob a
casino. With John Frankenheimer as the director, the movie is
always watchable, but sometimes it's just plain ludicrous. (ERG)1
hour, 45 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' R (profanity and strong horror violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette and Neve
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a scream anymore, but it's a decent wrap-up of the
series. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette
are all back and on the Hollywood set of ``Stab 3,'' ducking the
knife-swings of a killer clad in the familiar Halloween get-up. The
new movie isn't as clever with its clues as the others, but it
manages to wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the
trilogy in satisfying fashion. (SM)1 hour, 56 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis,
</P>
<P>
   Haley Joel Osment
</P>
<P>
   and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   6 Oscar nominations: picture, director, supporting actor (Haley
Joel Osment), supporting actress (Toni Collette), original
screenplay, film editing. A surprising, spine-tingling gem.
Eight-year-old Cole (Osment) can see restless phantoms with their
skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film that speculates on
what the relationship between the restless dead and a liaison to
the living world might be. (SM) 1 hour, 47 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp
</P>
<P>
   and Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: cinematography, art direction, costumes.
Tim Burton's film is a blend of scary swordplay, witchcraft and
self-spoofing humor. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane, who
investigates a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy Hollow. The
movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's single-minded
attacks, which don't spare men, women or children. (SM) 1 hour, 45
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' PG (mild peril and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chevy Chase.
</P>
<P>
   A lame kids movie about Syracuse, N.Y., schoolkids trying to
extend one out-of-school snow day into two. Chevy Chase plays a TV
weatherman suffering all kinds of humiliation and Chris Elliott
appears as the ominous Snow Plow Man with bad teeth. (Robert
Denerstein, Denver Rocky Mountain News) At metro theaters. 1 hour,
30 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geena Davis,
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lipnicki and
</P>
<P>
   the voice of Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: visual effects. Based loosely on E.B.
White's 1945 children's book, Stuart is a 3-inch-tall
computer-animated wonder voiced by Michael J. Fox. He brushes his
teeth, gargles and aw-shucks smiles with such convincing visuals
you'll swear he's the next best critter since ``Babe.'' But his
movie, at first charming and angelic, turns into slapstick. (Bob
Longino) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet and Lowdown'' R (profanity, sexuality and alcohol abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn
</P>
<P>
   and Samantha Morton.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actor (Sean Penn), supporting actress
(Samantha Morton). This jazzy little doodle of a mockumentary is
middling Woody Allen and, as such, mildly likable once you get past
the insistent whiff of self-justification. Penn is superb as a
legendary (and fictional) jazz guitarist in the 1930s who's an
angel with a guitar in his hands and a louse the rest of the time.
(ERG)1 hour, 35 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon,
</P>
<P>
   Jude Law and
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   5 Oscar nominations: supporting actor (Jude Law), adapted
screenplay, art direction, original score, costumes. A handsome but
flawed adaptation of novelist Patricia Highsmith's twisty thriller.
Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels to Italy to bring
back a rich man's son but ends up adopting his lifestyle and
committing murder. (SM)2 hours, 18 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tigger Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature with
</P>
<P>
   Tigger, Pooh, Baby Roo, Piglet, etc.
</P>
<P>
   This charming animated feature clearly knows its intended tot
audience and takes care of them. The irrepressible, ever-bouncing
Tigger goes searching for his family and discovers his real family
isn't necessarily other Tiggers. Pooh, Piglet, Baby Roo and the
whole A.A. Milne gang are back, as are the Sherman brothers (``Mary
Poppins''), who wrote the sprightly songs. As Tigger himself would
say, it's tiggerific. (ERG) 1 hour, 16 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' R (for a scene of risque nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Broadbent
</P>
<P>
   and Allan Corduner.
</P>
<P>
   4 Oscar nominations: original screenplay, art direction,
costumes, makeup. You don't have to be a fan of Gilbert and
Sullivan's operettas to enjoy it. But a love of the theater can
help you appreciate Mike Leigh's meticulously detailed valentine to
performers of the 19th century. (SM)2 hours, 39 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks and Tim Allen .
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: song. More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than
families have seen in years. Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim
Allen) and old and new characters are locked in a delightful story
of toy rustling and what it means to love a child. It sports an
inspired, hilarious script and stunning visuals. (Bob Longino) 1
hour, 25 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waiting Game'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Terumi Matthews
</P>
<P>
   and Will Arnett.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Ken Liotti's affectionate tribute to
20-something thespians in Manhattan is briskly paced and has a few
glimmers of wit. But mostly it serves up familiar stuff. It's a
movie catering to a very limited group _ basically, other aspiring
actor/waiters who share the same lingo, dreams and frustrations.
(SM)1 hour, 21 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The War Zone'' Unrated (specific sexual abuse,
</P>
<P>
   nudity, violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ray Winstone
</P>
<P>
   and Tilda Swinton.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by actor Tim Roth, a seemingly normal family, living on
the desolate coast of Devon, is beset by secrets and lies that lead
to total breakdown. The teen son (Freddie Cunliffe) suspects his
father (Ray Winstone) is having sex with his older sister (Lara
Belmont). A brutal, challenging film that asks you to take a risky
journey. (ERG) 1 hour, 38 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``What Planet Are You From?'' R (sexual situations, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Garry Shandling
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``I Married A Stand-Up From Outer Space.'' A strangely
desperate and unfunny comedy about a galactically equipped alien
and his mission to breed with Earth women. Poor Annette Bening
plays one of the women; Garry Shandling, who also co-wrote and
produced this mess, is the R-rated extra-terrestrial. (Stephen
Whitty, Newhouse News Service) 1 hour, 40 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whole Nine Yards'' R (sexuality, nudity, and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Perry
</P>
<P>
   and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   A comedy with a body count and familiar mafioso premise, but
with enough twists to eventually overcome its familiarity. Bruce
Willis stars as a hit man. As in ``The Sixth Sense,'' he doesn't
seem to mind playing genial straight man to his funnier cast mates:
Matthew Perry, Patricia Arquette and Kevin Pollak. (SM)1 hour, 43
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boys'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Douglas,
</P>
<P>
   Tobey Maguire
</P>
<P>
   and Frances McDormand.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas plays scruffy, scattered English lit professor
Grady Tripp in director Curtis Hanson's (``L.A. Confidential'')
well-written version of Michael Chabon's novel. Part satire and
part coming-of-age tale of a man in his 50s, the film is full of
episodes and digressions that are as interesting as the final
destination. It's also a feast for actors, who make the most of
tiny, telling moments. (SM)1 hour, 57 minutes. B

 &HT;    Southern inns to build a dream on
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 05.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A really great inn is more than somewhere to spend the night. It
is a warm place where you are pampered and fussed over _ in short,
made to feel like a welcome guest. The inn might be country cozy or
elegantly upscale. Here are some old favorites and new discoveries
from recent travels _ and a few we're dreaming of visiting.
</P>
<P>
   FIVE OLD FAVORITES
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gastonian, Savannah, Ga. The elegant 17-room inn on East
Gaston Street, two blocks from Forsyth Park, is two 1868 Regency
Italianate mansions connected by a green and tranquil courtyard.
Sumptuously decorated and filled with fine English antiques and a
Waterford chandelier in the dining room, the home is a showplace of
elegance and good taste. Speaking of good taste, breakfasts are
gourmet Southern repasts, afternoon tea is served with
complimentary wines, and cordials await in the parlor at night.
Innkeeper Anne Landers, a former Atlantan who bought the inn in
1996, presides with meticulous attention to details. Rooms, all
with working fireplaces, are appointed with Oriental carpets and
antiques (some are upper-crust English in character, while others
are pure Americana), and most feature Jacuzzis. Turndown service
includes pecan pralines and white linen floor mats beside the bed.
$295-$350. Information: 1-800-322-6603 or www.gastonian.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Balsam Mountain Inn, Balsam, N.C. The best feature of this
comfortable 50-room inn, opened in 1908, may be the two-level
veranda on which one can rock and relax, gazing at surrounding
mountains. In 1990, innkeeper Merrily Teasley began restoration of
the neoclassical Victorian structure perched on a hilltop. Inside
are restored hardwood floors, bead board walls, antique wicker and
Victorian trim. A double-sided fireplace in the spacious lobby
keeps the place cozy in winter. Rooms feature bentwood or painted
iron beds piled with down comforters (but no TVs or phones). Some
baths have antique claw-foot tubs. A full breakfast is included;
lunch and dinner are available. $90-$150.
</P>
<P>
   1-800-224-9498 or www1.aksi.net/(tilde)cmark/balsam.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kendall Manor Inn, Eufaula, Ala. This elegant
bed-and-breakfast _ lovingly restored by Barbara Lubsen and her
husband, Tim _ is one of the crown jewels in a town that boasts
more than 700 architecturally significant structures dating to
1836. The National Register home two blocks from downtown is a
favorite stop on the annual Eufaula Pilgrimage (coming up April
7-9). Staying at Kendall Manor Inn is like stepping back a century
_ but with queen and king beds, telephones with dataports, heat and
air conditioning, indoor plumbing and a television (if you want one
brought to your room). Built by cotton magnate James Turner
Kendall, the home was completed in 1872. Architectural highlights
include the ruby-red Czechoslovakian glass sidelights for the
massive front door, Italian marble mantels and French gold-leaf
cornices and mirror frame in the front parlor. A carved walnut
staircase leads to the second floor. Topping it all is an
arch-windowed belvedere that provides vistas for miles. $99-$129.
334-687-8847.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Inn at Merridun, Union, S.C. Affable innkeepers Peggy and Jim
Waller and their yellow tabby, J.D., personify Southern
hospitality. Their 1855 Greek Revival inn _ a National Register of
Historic Places property with stately Corinthian columns _ is
secluded on nine woodsy acres off a busy highway. The Wallers are
gourmet cooks whose talents are apparent at the bounteous
breakfasts, highlighted by blueberry pancakes for ``dessert,'' and
elegant candlelight dinners at additional cost for overnight guests
by reservation only. Each of the five distinctively decorated
bedrooms has a private bath, including Lucy's Garden Retreat with a
Jacuzzi tub. $79-$119. 864-427-7052.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Casablanca Inn, St. Augustine, Fla. Listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, this 1914 Mediterranean Revival home
in the oldest American city's historic district offers panoramic
views of Matanzas Bay and traffic _ some of the horse-and-carriage
variety _ along Avenue Menendez. Guests take breakfast on the
porches that catch the breeze from the bay. Rooms are decorated
with antiques and some have Jacuzzis _ but no TVs or phones.
Bicycles are available at no cost to guests. Special touches
include a never-empty plate of homemade cookies and a help-yourself
fridge stocked with soft drinks and beer. Read about the resident
ghost on the Web site, www.casablancainn.com. The inn is within
walking distance of St. Augustine's historic attractions and
restaurants. $89-$199. 1-800-826-2626.
</P>
<P>
   FOUR RECENT FINDS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cypress Inn, Conway, S.C. The 12-room Cypress Inn on Elm
Street is the only B&AMP;B in the historic district, and its location
overlooking the Waccamaw is ideal: The Riverfront Tennis Center is
across the street, and next door is Conway Marina, where you can
rent canoes and paddleboats. Although modern, the three-story inn
evokes the 19th century. The rooms, decorated with antique
furnishings and designer fabrics and wall coverings, feature
Jacuzzi tubs. The front porch, lined with rockers, overlooks a
small private marina. Pitchers of lemonade and iced tea await
guests. $95-$140. 1-800-575-5307
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pensacola Victorian, Pensacola, Fla. This restored Queen Anne
Victorian _ with hardwood floors and paneling and sparkling
chandeliers _ was once the dream home of ship captain William
Hazard Northup. Each of the four bedrooms has a different
decorating scheme. The location is within walking distance of the
Seville Historic District, with its living history village, and
downtown, which has been revived with trendy boutiques, art
galleries and restaurants on Palafox Street, the main north-south
corridor, and surrounding streets. Innkeeper Barbee Major's hearty
breakfasts include egg-based casseroles, waffles and a wonderful
broccoli and chicken quiche. Rates $65-$100 through March 31;
$75-$120 April 1-Nov. 1. 1-800-370-8354 or
www.pensacolavictorian.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Applegate Bed and Breakfast, Dillsboro, N.C. Your hosts Andree
and John Faulk will make you feel like a favorite cousin come for a
long overdue visit. A footbridge over Scott's Creek links inn
guests with 30 or so shops in the village and excursions on the
Great Smoky Mountains Railroad. Sumptuous breakfasts are served on
an enclosed patio. After breakfast, John cranks up his restored
1949 John Deere tractor to take guests on a hayride. Eight smartly
decorated rooms and suites. And a sweet mutt named Punky. $70-$90.
828-586-2397.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Red Rocker Inn, Black Mountain, N.C. Yes, there really is a

   ``The Lodge features porches and balconies that overlook the
Tennessee River and a magnificent mountain backdrop,'' Mohney says.
``The innkeepers, the McGriff family, think of everything in terms
of simple comfort. From the bed linens to triple-milled soaps to
the assortment of reading materials, everything in our cozy but
spacious room was choice. In one of the three downstairs sitting
areas (full of plump, comfortable chairs and sofas) were tidy
shelves of select books as well as an extensive video library. And
the food! Tender filet mignon with garlic mashed potatoes for
dinner; fluffy eggs, homemade biscuits and warm bread pudding
drizzled with peach compote for breakfast. Gorham's Bluff offers
the ultimate cocooning weekend.''

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One wonders if HBO is politically attuned enough to
intentionally premiere ``If These Walls Could Talk 2,'' an
anthology film focusing on lesbian relationships, two days before
California voters get their say on Proposition 22, a slice of
political chicanery so breathtakingly hateful that The New York
Times ran a front-page story shaking its editorial head that
something that pettily vindictive could even find its way onto a
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely anyone watching the movie will be swayed from
their position on the proposition, intended to forever nullify the
legality of gay marriages in the state, but should that happen,
good on `em. Certainly, a sizable audience seems promised: The
first film, about abortion, was the most-watched program in the
history of the pay-cable network (it's since been eclipsed by ``The
Sopranos,'' which airs an hour before the film).
</P>
<P>
   The film, ostensibly set in one house over the course of several
decades, is split into three sections, each titled after their
respective era: ``1961,'' ``1972'' and ``2000.'' The first segment,
written and directed by Jane Anderson, is the best, a wonderfully
subtle piece of storytelling and, coincidentally, a poignant
argument as to why it's a little unfair that gays can't have some
arrangement making their relationships legally binding.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Redgrave gives a genuinely moving performance as Edith,
an older woman whose longtime companion, to borrow a phrase from a
past decade, suffers a stroke. Since she's not technically related
to her ``friend,'' hospital personnel won't let her see the patient
and are mildly dismissive of her personal tragedy when the woman
dies.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse when a nephew to the deceased, a good-intentioned
schnook (Paul Giamatti) who barely knew his aunt, shows up to
settle the matter of the estate. The deed to the house is only in
the decedent's name, so he basically sees Edith as a little more
than a squatter on his property. For her part, Edith is aghast to
see that the only relatives her bird-loving lover had are vultures,
picking over the contents of the home for gewgaws to truck back
home.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a lot to the '70s vignette, written by Sylvia and
Alex Sichel and directed by Martha Coolidge. It's about a college
student (Michelle Williams of ``Dawson's Creek,'' following in
Jessica Biel's footsteps in terms of scandalizing her WB fans), who
becomes interested in a ``masculine'' lesbian (Chloe Sevigny,
turning the tables on her ``Boys Don't Cry'' role) to the dismay of
her friends.
</P>
<P>
   Even discounting the story's implausibility _ young lesbians
should have endured unfair rushes to judgment that they wouldn't do
it themselves _ it still doesn't add up to much.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Anne Heche, Ellen DeGeneres' partner,
``2000'' is a comedy of manners about the brave new world of
lesbian procreation. DeGeneres and Sharon Stone play an
affectionate couple trying to figure out the best way to get
pregnant _ with the Internet, sperm is handily just a mouse-click
away.
</P>
<P>
   The segment plays kind of the same way Heche acts _ it tries
really, really hard to be kookily lovable. It looks like all
involved had a blast making it; there's not quite as much fun in
watching it. And Heche really blows it by neglecting to include a
scene that seems a no-brainer _ DeGeneres would've been an absolute
hoot as the nervous-nelly ``father'' at the childbirth scene. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``If These Walls Could Talk 2.'' &QL; 
What: Anthology film in the popular series exploring women's
issues, this one about the lesbian experience. &QL; 
Who: Ellen DeGeneres, Sharon Stone, Vanessa Redgrave, Michelle
Williams, Chloe Sevigny. &QL; 
Where: HBO. &QL; 
When: 9 tonight. Also March 8, 13, 16, 21 and 25. &QL;

   DESTIN, FLA. _ ``The world's luckiest fishing village'' reels in
not only anglers but families who bask in the sun on sugar-white
beaches, splash in the Gulf of Mexico's clear emerald waters and
queue up to feast at tried-and-true seafood haunts such as Harbor
Docks. Families flock to attractions such as the Track Recreation
Center with go-carts, bumper boats, bumper cars and minigolf;
Rollin' Wheels Skate Center; and the ever-funky Big Kahuna's, an
entertainment complex that includes a water park, a 54-hole
minicourse with jungle theme, Little Kahuna's Kiddieland, go-carts
and Grand Prix track. When you've tired of the beach, you can spend
hours at Morgan's Family Entertainment Center at the Silver Sands
Factory Stores. Morgan's is a two-story complex with dining on the
lower level (wood-fired pizzas, rotisserie chicken and baked goods)
and a fantasy playland with a Jules Verne theme just up the
escalator. Plus, the family will enjoy sailboat cruises,

</P>
<P>
   ISLAND, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   From ankle to toe, this foot-shaped island is packed with fun
things to draw families. For starters, 12 miles of beaches are the
main draw. Several stables offer guided tours, and some have
special kids' packages and pony rides. Plus, there are ample
opportunities for golf, tennis and water sports. Families also
enjoy the popular dolphin cruises offered by several tour
operators. A good starting point is the Hilton Head Island Chamber
of Commerce Welcome Center on U.S. 278, on the way into town.
Accommodations run the gamut from motel rooms under $100 a night to
weeklong stays in beachside condos for $1,000 and up. For hungry
kids, you can't beat Crazy Crab in Harbour Town and Crabby Nick's
on U.S. 278. Information: Hilton Head Chamber of Commerce,

   The Big Easy is an easy-to-like family destination with the
fabulous Aquarium of the Americas, the Audubon Zoo (see the rare
white alligators), riverboat excursions on the mighty Mississippi
and the terrific Louisiana Children's Museum. And it's not hard to
avoid the sleaze of Bourbon Street; you'll be pooped by dark
anyway, after a day of activities. Kids get caught up in the scene:
wolfing down sugar-dusted beignets and hot chocolate at Cafe du
Monde, watching street performers in Jackson Square, riding the St.
Charles streetcar and taking horse-drawn carriage rides through the
French Quarter. Expect to pay at least $100 (and potentially far
more) for a room. Le Richelieu, Hotel Provincial and Holiday Inn
Downtown-Superdome are reliable, moderately priced choices. Your
dining options are endless. Kid-friendly restaurants include the
Court of Two Sisters (go for Sunday jazz brunch), the moderately
priced Gumbo Shop on St. Peter Street, just off Jackson Square, and
Ralph and Kacoo's on Toulouse. Information: 504-566-5011, New

   HUNTSVILLE, ALA.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the appeal
of this space-age destination where rocket boosters that put men on
the moon were developed. The U.S. Space &AMP; Rocket Center is just the
place for would-be astronauts and their families. You can see Imax
shows about space, take a guided bus tour of NASA's Marshall Space
Flight Center and get a close look at the real Apollo 15 module
that hauled men to the moon. The rocket center spans the distance
between sci-fi space fantasy and sophisticated NASA reality, with
more than 60 interactive exhibits and 1,500 pieces of space
hardware. Downtown Huntsville has a variety of moderately priced
hotels close to the center, including the Radisson Suite Hotel,
several Holiday Inns, Hilton, Marriott and Ramada. Many offer
suites and family specials, with separate bedrooms for children and
parents, for $80 to $120 per night. The center's Galaxy Food Court
serves moderately priced hamburgers, grilled chicken sandwiches and
other American foods. Space center information: 256-837-3400;

   The much-anticipated carousel in Coolidge Park is merrily
spinning 'round on the north shore of the Tennessee River. The
carousel's hand-carved and painted menagerie include a horse, fish,
giraffe, cat, elephant and frog. Across the river are the Tennessee
Aquarium, where the exhibit ``Venom: Striking Beauties'' opens
Friday, and 3-D Imax Theatre, where ``Dolphins'' opens April 1.
BellSouth Park, the new home of the Chattanooga Lookouts minor
league baseball team, also opens April 1 in the riverfront area (on
the hill behind Imax). Nearby, the Southern Belle Riverboat plies
the river from Ross' Landing. Just up the street is the Children's
Creative Discovery Museum. Little boys (and their dads) will love
the International Towing &AMP; Recovery Museum. The all-suite Residence
Inn by Marriott is right in the middle of the action. Hungry? Fun
restaurants in the vicinity include T.G.I. Friday's and Cheeburger,
Cheeburger. Round out your stay with visits to the Chattanooga Choo
Choo (you can even spend the night in a restored Pullman car, and
there's an indoor pool at the Choo Choo Holiday Inn). Close-by

   JEKYLL ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Even the name sounds like fun. Once the playground of the rich
and famous, now the historic island is an affordable haven for
families. Even in summer (high season), it is possible for a family
to stay on the beach for less than $100 a night. And most
restaurants are reasonably priced and cater to families. In
addition to 10 miles of beach, you'll find Summer Waves Waterpark
(open daily Memorial Day through Labor Day), 63 holes of golf,
tennis courts, miniature golf, bicycle rentals (to explore 20 miles
of paved trails), horseback riding, fishing, dolphin tours and
sight-
</P>
<P>
   seeing. Be sure to tour the island's National Historic Landmark
District to learn about the days when it was a ``millionaires'
village.'' Trolley tours leave 10 a.m.-3 p.m. daily from the Museum
Visitors Center on Stable Road, where free exhibits describe
Jekyll's history. You can also clip-clop through the district in a
horse and buggy. Information: 1-800-841-6586 or

   Think of historic Fontana Village Resort as summer camp for the
whole family. The rustic and charming resort has a lakeside
swimming pool with water slide as well as an indoor pool, a marina
with boats to rent, fishing, 20 miles of maintained mountain biking
trails, minigolf and an activities center with equipment for
archery, badminton, tennis, volleyball, shuffleboard and
horseshoes. Stay at the 94-room Fontana Inn or one of the 200
cottages. Built in the early 1940s by the Tennessee Valley
Authority to house construction workers building Fontana Dam, the
town was turned into a sprawling family resort after World War II.
A visit to the 19th-century Gunter Cabin and Museum in the center
of the village offers a glimpse into bygone days. Lodging rates are
highest in summer: inn $79 and $149; cottages $89-$189 (the new
two-bedroom, two-bath cottages with fireplace and whirlpool are
$209). Peppercorn Restaurant in the Inn is a full-service
restaurant. The Village Cafe is great for a quick lunch. The

<P>
   ``Cover Me,'' klutzily and with only a smidgen of verity
subtitled ``Based on the True Life of an FBI Family'' (even the
network's press material gets it wrong), opens with a firecracker
series of quirky, funny scenes. We see Chance (Michael Angarano),
an 11-year-old kid frantically driving his injured dad Danny (Peter
Dobson) from danger in the family Rolls-Royce. Next, there's dad
(in a flashback) quixotically rejecting his infant son in the
hospital maternity ward and later (in another flashback) accepting
him _ when the boy accidentally shoots him.
</P>
<P>
   Danny's a Fed, who has enlisted his entire family to help him in
his fight against crime. He gets mad when his teen daughter's
boyfriend finds her hidden wire while groping her, then accusingly
turns to his other daughter: ``You were supposed to be her
backup!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had cheerleading,'' she shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, not long after that, ``Cover Me'' _ developed and
executive-produced by Shaun Cassidy, whose last series,
``Hollyweird,'' was canceled before it hit the air _ devolves into
a more stock, conventional crime melodrama, albeit one with a twist
or two. Whatever ``true story'' this is based on, plenty of
artistic license has obviously been taken _ Danny drags Chance to
meetings with mob bosses, where he's a witness to a shootout (the
reason Danny has deputized the whole brood is explained, but hardly
convincingly).
</P>
<P>
   It's one part ``The Smith Family,'' the short-lived series
starring Henry Fonda as a family-man/cop, the tone of which shifted
from lighthearted to harder-edged midway through its run, and one
part ``Hart to Hart,'' with the droll crime-fighting couple (itself
cribbed from the ``Thin Man'' film series). The oddball touches are
necessary, given such a far-fetched premise, but there needs to be
more.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson is charismatic enough, and Melora Hardin is a charmer as
his wife, Barbara, but if the second episode is anything to go on,
``Cover Me'' deteriorates into shtick and formula darn quick. In
order to break a case, Danny has to go undercover and flirt with a
sexy swindler; Barbara has to go undercover to flirt with a nerdy
one _ and she isn't thrilled at the inequity of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Narration, used to get us through the dodgier plot points in the
pilot episode, is already redundant by episode 2. Basically,
``Cover Me'' stumbles between two bar stools: It's not quite
credible enough to entertain action fans and not quite
idiosyncratic enough to win over fans of esoterica and black
comedy. &QL;

   ``Life-Size,'' tonight's ``Wonderful World of Disney'' offering,
is programmatic Disney piffle celebrating those twin Mouse House
virtues of consumerism and sentiment. Even a semi-novice actor like
supermodel Tyra Banks is above a role like that of Eve, a
Barbie-style doll come to life, much to the astonished chagrin of
young Casey (Lindsay Lohan), who was hoping to resurrect her late
mother instead. It gets worse, however, when her workaholic pop
(Jere Burns, too intense for this kind of material) befriends the
living doll.
</P>
<P>
   Though she chirps merrily about being a role model for girls and
having been an astronaut and policeman, Eve can't even type (the
film does allow, at least, that this is something of a flaw). She's
an ace, however, on clothes and makeup.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a queasy subtext about office sexual politics
that'll no doubt thrill the kids. And this being a Disney
production, of course, there are the requisite shopping and dancing
montages. And when Eve asks about water coming from Casey's eyes,
it's a sure bet she'll be tearing up before the end of the movie,
as well. Audiences, however, will likely be spared from the same
fate. &QL;

   `SMELLS AND BELLS' OF LENT CAN'T BE FOUND ON THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   By Diana Butler Bass
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost deviant to say so, but traditional church
appears to be making a comeback among computer-savvy baby-boomers
and Generation Xers. In contrast to the disembodied spirituality of
cyberspace, people seem eager for sensual religious experience _
kneeling, incense, bread and wine, congregational singing. The more
``smells and bells'' the better. Thus, the Internet actually
creates a need for human connection to the divine. The stuff of
traditional religion cannot (yet) be experienced over the Web. It
exists only in musty old buildings whose wood is scented with
decades of candle smoke. Those old buildings are sacred space,
places where the human and divine have touched for generations.

CLINTON URGES CONGRESS TO BREAK LOGJAM ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARC LACEY and ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to two high-profile incidents of gun
violence this week, President Clinton said Thursday that he would
call legislative leaders to the White House on Tuesday to try to
``break the logjam'' on gun-control legislation that has been tied
up in Congress since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation on Capitol Hill showed few signs of bipartisan
cooperation. Frustrated Senate Democrats vowed to break off pieces
of the bottled-up legislation and add them as amendments to other
bills. In the House, Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., blamed
Democratic leaders for being the obstructionist ones and suggested
alternatives of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate approved different gun-control bills after
contentious debates last year. Lawmakers in the two chambers,
however, deeply divided on the restrictions, have yet to reconcile
them in conference. The issue could become a prime issue in the
fall elections as Democrats, who generally support tighter
restrictions, criticize Republicans for not uniting behind the
president's approach.
</P>
<P>
   In convening a session at the White House on Tuesday, Clinton
sought Thursday to bring the issue of gun control to the forefront
following heightened public concern after the shooting death of a
six-year-old girl in Michigan by a classmate, as well as a
Pennsylvania man's shooting rampage that left two men dead and
three others wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two incidents were very troubling, and they have
individual causes and explanations, and doubtless will require
individual responses,'' Clinton told reporters. ``But they do
remind us that there is still too much danger in this country, and
that for more than eight months now, Congress has been sitting on
the common-sense gun safety legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that if a trigger lock had been installed on
the gun used by the Michigan boy, as the legislation calls for, the
incident might not have happened.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, which Clinton criticized for
blocking reform, accused the the president of playing politics with
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all politics,'' said Wayne LaPierre, executive vice
president of the National Rifle Association. ``These were horrible,
tragic situations. The president is trying to profiteer on
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on the issue, Clinton interrupted two speeches devoted
to other topics this week to react to the shooting incidents in
Michigan and Pennsylvania. He said the deaths make the case for
legislation even more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Describing his reaction to the shooting at the elementary
school, Clinton told NBC: ``As a parent, I was heartbroken, and
then I was angry. I thought how did this child get the gun in the
first place. What's a six year old doing with a gun?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that gun control legislation would not
eliminate the problem of gun violence, which he said claims the
lives of 13 children every day. But he said tighter laws would
drastically reduce the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a silver bullet that will solve it overnight? No,''
Clinton said. ``Can we save a lot of lives, including a lot of
children, 13 every day _ 13 funerals a day? You bet we can, and we
ought to.''

DALLAS MOM IS TAKING OUT THE TRASH TV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone with even a passing interest in television knows that Fox
is in trouble again, having pegged itself yet again as the network
most likely to put absolutely anything on the air as long as it
generates ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to a Fox publicist recently on an entirely different
matter, I couldn't help but ask what it's like to work for the
network; whether, with all due respect, she didn't personally feel
drenched with the slime that seems to ooze out of the programming
brains of the company.
</P>
<P>
   She paused and said, sure, at times she feels like her superiors
are profit-mongers with no sense of integrity, dignity or class.
But, on the other hand, doesn't that cover all of television?
Aren't they merely trying to stay with the pack?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this was her way of defending the company that cuts her
checks, or justifying her contributions to sleaze-peddling. Or is
there a ring of truth to what she's saying?
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail came in the other day from a 37-year-old wife and
mother of four who lives in Dallas but works in Fort Worth. Anna
Donovan is a college-educated world traveler who recently plopped
down more than $200 to send her preteen children to a performance
of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater at Bass Hall in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing worse than keeping young minds away from the
arts,'' she wrote. ``Dance, music, whether it's pop concerts with
the Backstreet Boys or the Dallas Symphony, it should all be there
for the taking, because it opens up the minds and more importantly,
the senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Her point is that television, while never considered an art form
among fine artists, is an art because of its ability to communicate
to the masses in a creative way.
</P>
<P>
   She ``uses'' television rather than ``watches'' it, she wrote,
and has tried to encourage her children to do the same. It's
working, she thinks, because, while their selections aren't always
what she'd like to them to be, their viewing hours are minimal, and
they watch shows that challenge their minds and their environments
instead of ``sitcoms where the only goal is a laugh no matter the
expense.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent talk by phone, Donovan said she was happy that
her oldest son, who is 12, joined the condemnation chorus over
Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?,'' and not because
questions surfaced about the so-called millionaire, but because the
program itself was so sexist and void of redeemable value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also tell my kids that television is entertainment and it's
revenue-driven,'' she says. ``So certain choices are being made
based on that criteria. I mean, my son saying that this was
something that didn't lure him, I was pretty impressed. We escaped
that one, at least, because the battle is always to win out over
this evil intruder.''
</P>
<P>
   The evil intruder, actually, is commerce, which could be linked
to any industry. Like any business, no network is out to lose
money. But where should a line be drawn?
</P>
<P>
   I recall a conversation a few years ago at a Dallas hotel with
Jamie Kellner, who has had tremendous success getting The WB off
and running. He spent a great portion of an hour talking about
positioning and brand name and narrow-casting, saying that The WB
was the TV version of radio and that everyone _ NBC, CBS, ABC,
everyone _ ought to get on board if they were to survive what
television would become as we head into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner sounded like a businessman, not the head of a creative
entity who cared all that much about art.
</P>
<P>
   But for that matter, as the Fox spokesperson said, class is a
matter of perception. Maybe Fox merely gets caught because of its
rep.
</P>
<P>
   It was NBC that, on the night of David Letterman's comeback show
on ``Late Night,'' purposely scheduled Howard Stern, a media hound
who had ridiculed Letterman on his radio show. NBC considered it a
good counterprogramming move; others thought it was tasteless.
</P>
<P>
   And CBS? It aired a JonBenet Ramsey miniseries, ignoring the
fact that the murder case hasn't been solved and that there's
little to report other than innuendo. (The miniseries, as expected,
won its time period.)
</P>
<P>
   People used to complain that TV's problem was that it was
squarely aimed at the minds of 12-year-olds. Now, thanks to
Kellner's The WB, it seems aimed at the hormones of 14-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   So we get wrestling and monster truck shows and series about
foul-mouthed rappers called ``Shasta McNasty,'' because UPN execs
are convinced those will draw young men and increase the network's
advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you do, says the Fox publicist, when your competitors
are killing you in the ratings and your job is at stake? The ``high
road,'' as she put it, ``isn't going to pay the rent.''
</P>
<P>
   In a multiple-channel environment, and at a time when parents
are out of the home more than in it, leaving children alone to
watch what they please, we are raising a generation that will be
conditioned to think that tasteless reality programming is quality
TV. It's the old adage that if you only drink dirty water, you come
to think it tastes fine.
</P>
<P>
   As for Anna Donovan, she is convinced that television is this
intruding force that's more bad than good simply because it's
designed that way in the current competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't give up on TV by watching whatever and letting our
children watch the trash,'' she says. ``TV as baby sitter is
cliche. But isn't that what happens when parents just give up on
trying to make TV good again by watching the tasteless stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   I can't say that a majority of parents have given up caring.
But, judging from the responses logged to this office shortly after
the ``Marry a Multi-Millionaire'' fiasco, they are certainly
growing weary of fighting the intruder.

TEXAS DEMOCRATIC STATE REPRESENTATIVE LABELS GORE A FRAUD

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas State Rep. Lon Burnam has angered some
fellow Democrats by writing that Vice President Al Gore is a fraud
and a willing accomplice to foreign policies that have led to the
``rape, torture and mutilation of women and children across the

<P>
   Burnam, D-Fort Worth, made the assertions in a one-page

involvement in distributing the letter and said some of Burnam's
comments are offensive.

   Burnam, in an interview on Wednesday, said he believes that Gore
is a fraud by claiming to work to protect the environment. Gore's
voting record while in the U.S. Senate, Burnam said, suggests
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Burnam did not elaborate in his newsletter when he described
Gore as an accomplice to criminal acts. But he said in the
interview that Gore must share the blame for atrocities committed
in Latin America, including the rape and torture of women and
children. Those crimes were committed by paramilitary groups
trained by Americans as part of a foreign policy supported by Gore,
Burnam said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley stands head and shoulders above Al Gore, not just
in stature, but politically as well,'' Burnam wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bradley said the candidate did not authorize
the letter, which was mailed as a political advertisement by
Burnam's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Bradley's national campaign headquarters are ``very
disturbed'' by Burnam's assertions, said Kristen Ludecke, Bradley's
deputy press secretary in West Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mailing was not authorized by this campaign, and it is
certainly not a sentiment shared by Bill Bradley,'' Ludecke said,
adding, ``The language in the mailer is offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of Gore's campaign headquarters in Nashville, Tenn.,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is classic political-attack literature that has no place
in a Democratic campaign,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley's supporters would do better to focus on
(Bradley's) positive record, rather than defame Al Gore,'' Hattaway
said.
</P>
<P>
   As co-chairman of the Bradley-for-president campaign in Tarrant
County (Fort Worth), Burnam said he mailed ``less than a thousand''
of the letters to Bradley supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Burnam, who is unopposed for a third term in office, said he
knew his written comments about Gore would upset members of his own
party.
</P>
<P>
   He said the newsletter was meant to wake up ``Democrats who are
complacent about what the Democratic Party is responsible for when
it comes to suffering in the Third World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no better than the worst Republicans when it comes to a
lot of foreign policy issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burnam said he will only support Gore if he becomes the
Democratic Party's presidential nominee _ and ``not a day before.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Burnam's assertions that Gore is partly responsible
for rapes and tortures, Russell Langley, executive director of the
Tarrant County Democratic Party, said: ``We certainly wouldn't go
along with that.''

 &HT;    ISRAELI CHIEF RABBI EXPECTS POPE TO ASK FORGIVENESS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's chief rabbi Thursday said Pope John Paul II
should ask forgiveness for church silence during the Holocaust when
he visits later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope is expected to visit Israel and the Palestinian areas
for six days beginning March 30. It will be his first trip here as
Pope, and the first trip here by any Pope since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a series of protocol squabbles concerning the
visit have highlighted age-old Jewish anxieties about the Pope and
Catholicism. Israel and the Vatican only established full
diplomatic ties in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau said he welcomed the Pope and
said the frail 79-year-old pontiff has traveled the world
repeatedly condemning anti-Semitism. Lau, a Holocaust survivor from
Poland, said the Pope understands the horrors of the Holocaust
because he is also from Poland.
</P>
<P>
   But, Lau said the Pope's scheduled visit to Jerusalem's Yad
Vashem Holocaust museum should include a plea for forgiveness on
behalf of the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Lau referred to a 1998 church committee that renounced the
silence of individual Catholics during the Holocaust. Lau and other
Jewish leaders objected that the committee had not gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asking for forgiveness at Yad Vashem will be more
satisfying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the wartime Pope Pius XII had remained silent and
therefore ``stood in the blood'' of innocent Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``To not deny the Holocaust means telling the truth,'' Lau said.
He said the 1998 committee was ``chapter one'' and that he was
``waiting for chapter two.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadie Abunassar, a spokesman for the Vatican's millennium
activities in the Holy Land, answered that Catholics should not be
repeatedly asked for apologies for the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should continue with apologies, apologies,
apologies,'' he said. ``We have to think of reconciliation. Real
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pope has labeled 2000 as a holy year, stressing repentance.
It is expected that he will offer at least limited church apologies
later in the month on several historical matters.
</P>
<P>
   Historic friction between Jews and Catholics has come up
frequently as Israel prepares for the Pope's pilgrimage. A small,
but vocal, minority has expressed objections to the papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Lau began his news conference Thursday, a handful of
extremists stood outside his offices with signs accusing the Pope
of being an anti-Semite.
</P>
<P>
   The protestors said they were related to the outlawed Kach
movement, a militant, anti-Arab group representing a tiny fringe of
Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, more than 2,000 rabbis signed a petition asking
the Pope to respect the Jewish Sabbath, which runs from Friday
evening through Saturday evening, during his tour.
</P>
<P>
   Lau, also, called on the Pope to minimize his travel on the
Sabbath so that observant Jews among the Israeli police and
security will not have to work. He said, for example, the Pope
should not use a helicopter to travel from Jerusalem to Nazareth, a
two-hour drive away, so that pilots of air force escorts can get
the day off.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials reacted with outrage last month when the Pope
met with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. The two
approved an agreement between the Vatican and the Palestinian
Authority that Israelis interpreted as a challenge to Israeli
authority in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Israeli objections are similar to misgivings that
some Israelis had about hosting the thousands of Christian pilgrims
who came here for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that Jews have seen Christianity, often
Catholicism, used as the justification for anti-Jewish activities
from the Crusades a thousand years ago to modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Muslims have expressed doubts about the papal
visit. Ibrahim Sarsur, head of a branch of the Islamic Movement in
Israel, said the Pope should issue an apology for massacres of
Muslims during the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pope is using his visit as an opportunity to enhance
inter-faith relations with both Jews and Muslims. Father Peter
Vasco, a member of the seven-person council that oversees Middle
Eastern holy sites, said that the overall atmosphere is good.
</P>
<P>
   He downplayed the objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are isolated incidents,'' he said. ``Certainly, we're
not surprised at it. At the same time we realize it's not the
majority opinion of the Israeli people.''

HOT SHOTS GOLF 2 ELIMINATES USUAL PROBLEMS WITH VIDEO GOLF GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's one sport that vid-game companies still scratch their
heads over on how to make it cool for kids _ much less
knuckleheaded adults like me _ it's golf.
</P>
<P>
   It takes hours to figure out most golf games, even the
supposedly kid-friendly ones. Gotta line up the player just right.
Gotta aim just so. Gotta do some sort of mathematical equation to
make the guy hit the ball. Then, for some reason, I always wind up
missing it. Sorry, but I just don't have the patience. I like to
win every once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   That was what was so great about Hot Shots Golf, PlayStation's
very cool, very oblivious-user-friendly golf title from last year.
The sequel, Hot Shots Golf 2 (Sony for PlayStation, $40), is even
better.
</P>
<P>
   All the problems with the usual golf games are nonexistent here.
You don't have to know golf mechanics, don't have to be an engineer
to figure out what iron you wanna use, and an algebra lesson isn't
necessary to whack the ball.
</P>
<P>
   You do, however, have to wanna have fun. The characters are
funny and colorful and goofy, and the commentary's equally a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   But Hot Shots 2 is anything but dumb. The graphics, for example,
are as crisp and detailed as any golf PC game, and while the
courses aren't Tiger Woods material, they're challenging enough to
keep your mind boggled and your fingers blistered. Which is more
than I can say for most other golf games.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ridden in a cab _ especially in New York _ knows
that, well, cabbies are just a different breed of people. A round
of applause for Sega for cleverly exploiting these guys with its
great new Dreamcast title, Crazy Taxi (Sega for Dreamcast, $50, all
ages).
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is one of the most original titles to come
along in a while _ and what makes it so cool is that it's so true,
to an extent. But I always have a better time playing a game that's
based on reality than a far-fetched game that features cat-eating
zombies.
</P>
<P>
   The object of Crazy Taxi goes something like this: You're a
hot-shot cabbie trying to make as much cash in one day as ya can.
To do this, obviously, you have to pick up as many fares as
possible, figure out where they wanna go and the shortest route to
get there, then drop 'em off at their destination; so it's not just
driving around knocking trash cans over, you've gotta be able to
read maps.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say you don't get to trash stuff, because you do.
You'll probably get points slashed for it, but you can drive
through yards, hit other cars and terrorize pedestrians. Mmmmm,
hurts so good.

UNIVERSAL STUDIOS ESCAPE TRIES TO MATCH THEME PARK STALWART DISNEY
WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by ORLANDO-ATTRACTIONS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Among the guests crowding the floating dock of
the new resort hotel Portofino Bay, hoping to hitch a water taxi
over to the Universal Studios theme park, was a young boy, hopping
from foot to foot as he waited impatiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``So how do you think this place stacks up against Disney
World?'' an older man asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Downtown Disney has more stuff for kids to do than
CityWalk, but I like the roller coasters better over here,
especially the Incredible Hulk,'' the youngster said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hulk,'' my 13-year old daughter piped up. ``And the
beds.''
</P>
<P>
   Beds may seem a strange point of comparison _ if you haven't
seen the ones at Portofino Bay, the first on-site hotel at what is
now called ``Universal Studios Escape.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you haven't seen the luxurious Portofino _ not to mention
a 650-room Hard Rock Hotel slated for opening late this year, the
Islands of Adventure theme park that debuted last summer, and the
ever-expanding collection of nightclubs known as CityWalk _ you may
not not realize this about Orlando's Universal Studios Escape: The
park is giving notice they're ready to rival their more-established
neighbor, Walt Disney World, as a ``complete vacation destination.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after spending years known as Orlando's ``other'' theme
park, Universal Studios now apparently intends to compete head-on
with Disney World, which has grown to include Magic Kingdom, Epcot,
MGM Studios, Animal Kingdom, Downtown Disney and 17 on-site hotels,
containing a staggering 27,000 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   But back to those beds. Each of Portofino's large rooms is
equipped with tall, wood-framed beds, covered with feathery white
duvets and soft, giant pillows. The first thing my daughter did
when we entered the room was jump into the middle of all that fluff
and announce that she wanted to take a nap. (She never takes a
nap.)
</P>
<P>
   As a mother, I worried about the pizza sauce she accidentally
dripped on one of those snow white clouds, and the fact that she
insisted on wearing the equally white pique bathrobe to Portofino
Bay's dramatic Roman aqueduct-style pool, complete with water slide
and a sand beach on one end.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the pool, however, this luxury hotel seems more plush
than playful. (Although the Hard Rock Hotel will be nearly as
expensive, it will have a more casual atmosphere; the third
Universal hotel, the 1,000-room Royal Pacific Hotel due to open in
summer 2001, will also be on the upscale side.)
</P>
<P>
   The Portofino has been designed to look like a village of softly
colored pink, tan and gold townhouses, built around a harbor.
Inside, crystal chandeliers grace the lobby, and deluxe rooms with
large tile baths and dressing areas with double marble sinks are
standard. It would be a perfect choice for any of the tens of
thousands of newlywed couples who make central Florida the
honeymoon capital of the world _ or business executives on expense
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   At the harbor, guests can catch a water shuttle headed for
CityWalk and the Universal theme parks. They can also choose to sit
at one of the tables out on the tile and brick-paved piazza at
Trattoria del Porto, eating brick-oven pizza or pasta and sipping
wine served from painted china crocks. Or, they might hoist a beer
at the Thirsty Fish tavern, where strolling musicians play
accordions and violins.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't eat at the more formal restaurants _ the gourmet
Delfino Riviera and the American Bar, where the specialties are
caviar, champagne and salmon _ but they looked very elegant,
despite no requirement for jackets or ties.
</P>
<P>
   Open only since mid-September, the 750-room luxury resort is
still a bit of a work in progress. A third pool, more gift shops
and a full-service spa were not yet open on our recent visit.
Restaurant service was slow this winter, and though the staff
seemed to want to be helpful, they were sometimes clueless about
such simple things as how late the pools were open and which park
had an early opening.
</P>
<P>
   Brand-new landscaping currently distracts from the scene. But,
given all that, in another year or two, the grounds will rival the
lush and always neat settings over at Disney.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the world's best-known theme parks are bound to spark
comparisons, especially when they are less than 20 miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just say Disney is more kid-friendly,'' my daughter insisted
when asked for help in comparing the two parks.
</P>
<P>
   Both theme parks offer exclusive guest privileges to those who
stay on site, including early admission to their theme parks,
special bus and boat transportation, charge cards that bill
everything back to your hotel, priority seating at select
restaurants and shows, and complimentary package delivery back to
your room (for all those heavy souvenirs you collect early in the
day).
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Universal offers guests staying at on-site resorts
``front-of-the-line'' access to many of the most popular
attractions during the first hour of regular operations. Disney
offers the ``fast pass,'' a come-back-later deal that gives guests
with multiple day admission passes immediate entry at a designated
time if they are willing to come back in an hour or so.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also sells ``E-passes'' for $10, that allow on-site hotel
guests to ride many of the biggest and best attractions at Magic
Kingdom for three hours after the park closes _ and nearly empties
_ on certain nights. (Just in case you want to ``do Splash
Mountain'' seven times in less than an hour, like we did.)
</P>
<P>
   Other points of comparison include:
</P>
<P>
   Universal's Islands of Adventure's Jurassic Park River Adventure
is a lot like Disney's Animal Kingdom's thrill ride, Countdown to
Extinction _ except that you take a boat at Jurassic, a jerking and
careening jeep at the Kingdom. (Jurassic has the 5-story T-Rex, but
Countdown is more intense and scary in the dark; dinosaurs can jump
out at you and you could be destroyed by an asteroid at any
moment.)
</P>
<P>
   At Magic Kingdom, visitors ride through the hundred-acre woods
in a honey pot to join the adventures of Winnie the Pooh; at Seuss
Island, one of Universal's Islands of Adventure, you can follow the
adventures of the Cat in the Hat from a gently spinning sofa. Seuss
Island also has red fish and blue fish you can ride through the
air, much like you ride Dumbo the Flying Elephant over at Magic
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Animal Kingdom's new whitewater-raft ride, Kali River Rapids, is
a round rubber raft ride that takes you through a rain forest with
waterfalls and through mythical ruins as well as the ruins of a
stripped logging camp, leaving you soaked-to-the-skin. Over at the
Islands, there is Popeye &AMP; Bluto's Bilge Rat Barges, a similar ride
that leaves you just as wet, at least from the knees down.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls (Universal) and Splash Mountain
(Magic Kingdom) both take you on whimsical adventures before
plunging you over a tall, steep waterfall that's certain to soak
you through at the end. (While the big drops are comparable,
Dudley's scenery pales in comparison with the splendid Mountain.)
</P>
<P>
   A kid-friendly centerpiece of Downtown Disney, the entertainment
complex, is the gigantic Rain Forest Cafe. Universal's CityWalk
counters with Hard Rock Live Orlando, which has a 2,200-seat
amphitheater on the roof hosting nationally known artists.
</P>
<P>
   Both parks offer one really outstanding new ride.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Rockin' Roller Coaster combines a smooth, high-speed
roller coaster with blasting rock music and flashing neon lights. A
stretch limo equipped with lots of stereo speakers whips you
through downtown LA traffic to the (very loud) tune of an Aerosmith
concert. The assault on your sense is such that I honestly did not
realize that we turned completely upside down three times until I
rode the Rockin' Roller Coaster a second and third time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Universal's Amazing Adventures of Spider Man, billed
as ``the greatest ride ever built,'' is truly amazing _ the first
themed thrill ride to combine vehicles that whip you around, hurtle
you through space and drop you through the dark with startling 3-D
action and on-fire special effects. (The science of illusion works
magic when Spider Man comes swinging down from a tall skyscraper,
right into your lap.)
</P>
<P>
   Disney's IllumiNations, the laser show and fireworks at Epcot's
World Showplace, hasn't changed much for its millennium
celebration, but it still takes the prize for best special effects.
It's rivaled only by another Disney show, Fantasmic, a spectacular
new light show reflected off screens of spouting water.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer spectacle, Disney can't match Universal's Cirque
du Soleil, the musical circus/theater. This show immerses you in a
surrealistic dream where gymnasts fly gracefully on colorful silk
scarves _ looking much more like birds than acrobats _ and soar off
trampolines impossibly fluid. Mime characters are both comic and
tragic here, and cycling clowns perform upside down and sideways on
an intricate, very-near-magical stage, that's inside a white circus
tent.
</P>
<P>
   So which park is for you? After four visits in five years, we
still favor Disney by a bit, but Universal is definitely moving up.
Let's just say they make an extraordinary package, and we aren't
close to getting our fill of any of them, yet. Guess, we'll just
have to keep going back.

entertainment column.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Annette Bening
with Garry Shandling in a scene from ``What Planet Are You From?'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    If you have trouble picking out Annette Bening at the Academy
Awards on Mar. 26, here's a tip: She'll probably be the only one
who brings a small suitcase.
 &HT;    ``If I went into labor pains, I'd go straight to the hospital,''
she says. ``And some friends suggested I ought to have my overnight
bag under my seat or have a medical team around me wearing tuxedos,
or at least sit among a bunch of actors who have played doctors in
movies.''
 &HT;    Yes, Bening is due to produce Baby Beatty number four on or
around that date. But even if she doesn't, it will still be a big
night for the Beatty clan: She's favored in the Best Actress stakes
for her over-the-top performance in ``American Beauty,'' while
husband Warren Beatty will receive the prestigious Irving Thalberg
Award, a tribute to his long career as a Hollywood star, producer
and director.
 &HT;    Bening hopes she makes it, because she's thrilled with the
success of ``American Beauty,'' a quirky suburban drama/black
comedy on which first-time director Sam Mendes spent a miserly _ by
today's budgets _ $15 million.
 &HT;    ``We all worked for virtually union scale (around $1,000 a
day),'' Bening says. ``We made it thinking only a few people would
ever get to see it, never in our wildest dreams imagining it would
do so well and become so hugely popular.''
 &HT;    ``Hugely popular'' it was, not to mention critically acclaimed
and, of course, Oscar-nominated, to the tune of eight nods
including Best Picture, Best Actor (Kevin Spacey) and Best
Director.
 &HT;    In person, Bening is less driven than the obsessive,
martini-guzzling real-estate agent she plays in the movie, and a
whole lot smarter. Prettier, too _ she is one of those women who
improves with pregnancy. Wearing virtually no makeup, she looks
serene and beautiful as she sits, dressed all in black with a black
pashmina shawl wrapped around her stomach, to talk about the
performance that might bring her an Oscar.
 &HT;    ``When I first read it I had some sort of intuitive
understanding of her,'' the actress says. ``I found it difficult
and challenging, yet this was a woman I sort of felt I knew or had
known. I grew up as a teen-ager in the California suburbs, and
maybe I babysat for her or saw her in the supermarket, or I had
been shown a house by her.
 &HT;    ``She was a woman trying to have it all, trying to live the
American dream,'' Bening adds. ``But, after shooting each day, I
made certain I didn't take her home with me. Then, after seeing the
film for the first time, I thought, `Oh God, is that who I really
am?'''
 &HT;    Her next film is a good deal more lighthearted. ``What Planet
Are You From?'' will open March 3, directed by Mike Nichols and
written by actor/comedian Garry Shandling, who also stars as an
alien who lands on earth, takes one look at Bening and announces,
``I want to sleep with you and get you pregnant.''
 &HT;    ``I read Garry's script and laughed out loud,'' Bening recalls.
``I loved it, and told Garry I'd like to be in the film. It's about
people trying to connect, and how we all desperately want to find
love and find a way to make a family _ and how tricky that is.''
 &HT;    Shandling is an old friend of Beatty's, which came in handy
during an extended honeymoon scene he shared with Bening.
 &HT;    ``I felt very comfortable doing the scene,'' Bening insists with
a broad smile. ``Garry says he called Warren for advice on how to
do the love scene, but if he did I wasn't aware of it. I giggled
through it the whole time, and Mike also kept giggling.
 &HT;    ``I've done other nude scenes, and directors usually clear the
set,'' she adds. ``On this one they invited everyone to watch, and
we did it on a bed on a high platform.''
 &HT;    As for the baby to come, Bening _ already the mother of
8-year-old Kathlyn, 5-year-old Ben and 3-year-old Isabel _ says
there won't be any sequels.
 &HT;    ``We've been married for eight years,'' she says, ``and this is
definitely my last child. I'm the youngest of four children, and
Warren and I always said we'd have more than two. But I know when
it's enough.''
 &HT;    If she makes it to Oscar night, she admits her thoughts will be
divided between the baby and the bauble. Her toughest competition
is likely to come from Hilary Swank, the virtual unknown nominated
for her tour-de-force performance as a woman disguised as a man in
``Boys Don't Cry.''
 &HT;    ``Hilary's performance was inspiring,'' Bening admits. ``But I
still want to win. Anyone who says they don't care about Oscar is
lying.''
 &HT;    Many actresses have expressed admiration at Bening's ability to
juggle motherhood with a thriving career, a trick which many others
have found difficult. She gives the credit to having a lot of help
at home _ including Beatty, who she says not only has never
pressured her to choose between career and motherhood, but also has
become a veteran diaper-changer.
 &HT;    Besides, she says, combining acting and mothering isn't as hard
as it would be if she were in most other professions.
 &HT;    ``I have a great job to have with kids,'' she says, ``because I
can stop and start and take large chunks of time off. I feel very
lucky that I can do both. I love my work, and my kids are
fantastic.
 &HT;    ``And I've had enough babies by now to know when it's physically
and emotionally right for me to start work again,'' she adds.
 &HT;    Her Oscar-night outing will be a bit unusual, Bening says,
because as a rule she studiously avoids public scrutiny when she's
pregnant.
 &HT;    ``But I'm enjoying the fact that my new movie is coming out,''
she says, ``and `American Beauty' is having such a wonderful second
life.''
 &HT;    And if she has to leave in the middle of the show, she says, her
husband will leave with her, Thalberg Award or no.
 &HT;    ``I would never have married a man who would not have been able
to make the right kind of decision in that situation,'' Bening
says. ``He'll be with me at the hospital.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ From F. Scott Fitzgerald and Truman Capote on
down, the shelves are stacked high with the biographies of writers
who grabbed the brass ring _ fame! money! Hollywood! _ only to
watch it turn into a noose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is not to take it very seriously,'' said novelist
Michael Ondaatje, speaking by telephone from his home in Toronto.
``(Fame) can do a lot of damage. But if one has a certain intent
that's private when you're working, it certainly helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Ondaatje knows what he's talking about: His 1992 novel, ``The
English Patient,'' hit the literary equivalent of the trifecta. An
alternately grim and lyrical tale of love during wartime, the book
received adulatory reviews (including a Booker Prize), earned solid
sales and _ miracle of miracles _ inspired a faithful film
adaptation that dominated the 1996 Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very lucky to go through the filmmaking process with
people who were both talented and honorable,'' said Ondaatje, who
discussed Anthony Minghella's film after a screening Wednesday
night at the State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Ondaatje, 56, is married to the nonfiction writer Linda
Spalding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather talk about the film than about myself,''
Ondaatje said, ``so (the film's success) affords me a nice kind of
disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before ``The English Patient,'' Ondaatje had been exploring
fame as a theme in his work. His 1976 fact-based novel ``Coming
Through Slaughter'' describes trumpeter Buddy Bolden's descent from
musical acclaim to madness and obscurity. (``There are no prizes,''
the book concludes darkly.)
</P>
<P>
   ```Slaughter' was a book about the dangers of fame, and I feel
much the same way today,'' Ondaatje said.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, the writer's work has gone global. He
revisited his native Sri Lanka in the 1982 family memoir ``Running
in the Family.'' His 1987 novel ``In the Skin of a Lion''
reimagined the boomtown industry of his adopted Toronto; several
characters from that story traveled to Italy for ``The English
Patient.'' Ondaatje's four collections of poetry include ``The
Cinnamon Peeler'' and ``Handwriting.''
</P>
<P>
   Slated for release May 1, Ondaatje's new novel, ``Anil's Ghost''
(to be published by Knopf), returns to Sri Lanka. But instead of
the lush colonial years depicted in ``Running in the Family,''
Ondaatje has set his story against a modern landscape of political
unrest and officially sanctioned violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure which was more difficult,'' Ondaatje said. ``With
`Running in the Family,' there's always the danger of encountering
relatives ... but one kind of feels able to describe your own
stories, as long as you're going about it with a generous spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Ondaatje, the sense of obligation is stronger when he's
creating a fictional character. ``You're more responsible in
fiction,'' he said. ``You're entering someone else's world
entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   He's gearing up for another kind of obligation: the forced march
of pre-publication interviews and book tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The readings, I enjoy _ I'm not an antisocial type of
person,'' he said. ``But I think writers are an odd mix of hams and
the warily private. Don DeLillo is a very private person, but then
he writes a 600-page book. It's a very curious thing.''
</P>
<P>
   After the success of his last novel, Ondaatje understands the
publishing world's expectations for this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangely, that hasn't bothered me,'' he said. ``I think I was
able to turn it off when I came back to writing. I feel very good
about this book, (but) I don't think it's going to have anything
like the success of `The English Patient.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessary to hit that kind of grand slam again.''

&HT;     GROUP FIGHTING ANTI-GAY INITIATIVE UNLEASHES NEW AD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CAROL NESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Opponents of Proposition 22 are going for the
jugular with an explosive new television advertisement that
compares support of the anti-gay marriage initiative with a
gay-hating fringe group from Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prop. 22 won't save a single marriage, but it will hurt gay
people. That's what it's intended to do,'' a voice-over says as a
small image expands to fill the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The ad shows a photo of protesters holding signs reading ``God
hates fags'' and ``Fags burn in Hell.'' The opponents of the
California ballot measure say the protesters are followers of the
itinerant Baptist minister Fred Phelps of Topeka, who frequently
demonstrates at gay parades and other events.
</P>
<P>
   ``No discrimination,'' is the message in the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image you will see is jolting. It's meant to be. Prop. 22
is jolting to many Californians,'' said Mike Marshall, manager for
the campaign against what is known as the Knight Initiative. The
measure, which will appear on Tuesday's ballot, is sponsored by
state Sen. William ``Pete'' Knight, a Republican from Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people vote yes, they are going to hurt someone they know
who is gay or lesbian,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yes on 22 campaign responded by calling the new ad part of
an increasingly negative campaign waged by the opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equating millions of Californians who believe marriage should
be kept as between a man and a woman with extremist groups from out
of state is grossly offensive and inflammatory,'' said Yes on 22
spokesman Robert Glazier.
</P>
<P>
   He called the tactic desperate.
</P>
<P>
   The new ad hit the airways in most California cities Tuesday
night in a late-campaign effort to sway support for the initiative.
Polls since October, including two new ones this week, have shown
that slightly more than 50 percent of Californians favor
Proposition 22, and slightly under 40 percent oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Gay marriage is not legal in California or any other state, but
the initiative prohibit California from recognizing gay marriages
conducted in other states, should they become legal.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: 18,000 Boeing engineers can't be wrong
 &HT;    By Lynn Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For many of the 18,000 engineers and technical workers
who walked off their jobs three weeks ago, their strike against the
Boeing Co. is not about money, but about the soul of the company,
its future, and whether it will remain the world's pre-eminent
manufacturer of commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Airbus outpaced Boeing in the sale of new aircraft.
This year, the early trend is the same. What many engineers see in
this reversal is a company that has sacrificed the development of
innovative designs and superior quality for short-term, bottom-line
results. What Boeing has also sacrificed, these engineers say, is
respect for the technical workers who over 84 years have helped
build the company into the industry's undisputed leader.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been more surprised at the success of the strike than
the engineers themselves. As a group, engineers are typically
conservative in politics and anti-big labor. The Society of
Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, or SPEEA,
represented only 40 percent of the eligible workers prior to
Boeing's contract offer in December. Those numbers swelled to 60
percent by the time the strike was authorized, and nearly 80
percent of all eligible workers walked off the job.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's management seemed so confident that the strike would
collapse that none of its executives even made a public statement
until the fifth day of the strike. Last August, Boeing CEO Phil
Condit personally intervened in negotiations with the machinists'
union to announce what he said was the best contract in the
industry. Boeing was making the offer, he said, because it wanted
world-class workers to build its world-class planes.
</P>
<P>
   When the top executives finally commented on the SPEEA strike,
the remarks were of the bloodless, ``we feel this was a good
offer'' variety. Said an engineer, ``Even a gesture on Condit's
part, to say what we meant to the company, would have gone a long
way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing's responses throughout the negotiations have been
remarkably tone-deaf. A week after the start of the strike, Boeing
Vice President for People Jim Dagnon sent every engineer and
technical worker a summary of the contract they had just voted
down, presumably under the impression that they hadn't actually
read it.
</P>
<P>
   For many engineers, it was Boeing's hard-line approach to the
negotiations, and particularly its failure to offer even the
smallest of concessions to a federal mediator brought in to avert
the strike, that drove them onto the picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Hance, a flight controls analyst, echoes the sentiment of
many of the strikers that the issue is respect: ``I'd like to see
some indication from the company that we're valued employees, that
we're an asset and not an expense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many date Boeing's focus on the bottom line to the company's
merger with McDonnell Douglas two years ago. The subsequent
consolidation and reorganization shrunk profits at the same time
production of new planes broke down. But in its rush to concentrate
on efficiency, the company began a pattern, engineers say, of
short-sighted decision-making that ends up costing Boeing more in
the end.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer involved in airplane certification to the FAA
recalled how management overrode an engineering recommendation
because of concern about short-term costs. When the plane failed
the FAA tests in exactly the way the engineers had predicted,
Boeing made the changes.
</P>
<P>
   This engineer posed a hypothetical question to Boeing
management: ``Do you take the advice of your technical people?
Engineers have experience over time. But the pressure on management
now seems to be to make light of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally troubling to many engineers is Boeing's unwillingness to
take risks in developing new planes. Innovations in lighter
materials and computer avionics await a new generation of planes.
If Boeing contents itself with making only derivatives of existing
models, the technical work will become less interesting and less
important and Boeing will no longer be able to attract the
highest-quality engineers. One of the jokes on the Internet last
week was a caption that read ``Boeing 2016'' _ the year of Boeing's
centenary _ beneath a picture of Airbus's new superjumbo plane.
</P>
<P>
   Many engineers chose to work at Boeing because of its reputation
for building the best airplanes in the world. When politicians come
to town and praise the Boeing jet that flies them around the
country, these engineers don't see a blatant appeal to a
special-interest group; instead, they roar their approval. They're
proud of the quality of their work, proud of Boeing's historical
contribution to the defense of the country, proud of the safety
record of their planes.
</P>
<P>
   These engineers are also highly educated and skilled technical
workers in a technology-driven economy. They live in the city
where, two decades ago, Bill Gates introduced his own version of
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Boeing engineers with 15 to 20
years of experience typically see their salaries leveling off while
the veterans of Microsoft and dozens of the other software
companies and dot.coms in the region see their salaries go ``nearly
vertical,'' in the words of a former Boeing engineer who now works
for a small software firm.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between old-school Boeing, with its
military-modeled hierarchy, and the new high-tech firms is
instructive. Microsoft has few levels of management between top and
bottom. Executives are visible and accessible. At Boeing, even many
first- and second-level managers share the engineers' frustration
at trying to be heard by Boeing's upper echelons.
</P>
<P>
   Although a strike is a blunt instrument, many engineers felt
that it was the only way to give the company a wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many surprises in this, one of the nation's longest
white-collar walkouts, none may be more lasting than the engineers'
discovery of their own unity and strength. Although SPEEA had been
toughening its rhetoric and making the protection of benefits the
centerpiece of its demands, the union could not have orchestrated
such a large strike without a deep discontent among the employees.
Forced by management into an adversarial relationship almost none
wanted, the engineers have vowed not to be the latest example of
the company sacrificing long-term excellence for short-term
savings. For three weeks, professionals with virtually no
organizing experience have been staging spirited rallies, carrying
placards and warming their hands over burning barrels. In the
process, these self-described conservatives have had their
world-view turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Conley, an acoustics engineer with 20 years' experience at
Boeing, admits that he's still a little uncomfortable ``mixing it
up with the machinists, the Teamsters.'' But he said the outpouring
of support from them during the strike has changed his view of
labor forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never look at a picket line in the same way,'' he said.
``This has changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hance, the flight controls analyst, echoed Conley's conversion.
``The company made a point of saying we're not family anymore.
Well, when you're out on the picket line at 2 a.m. and the
machinists come out to support you, you realize who your family
really is. And that you can't replace family.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the face of labor in the new millennium.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Nunn still valuable to U.S. interests
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Friday's Atlanta Constitution)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Late last month in a ceremony little noticed outside
Washington, D.C., the State Department paid tribute to a man better
known for his association with the Department of Defense _ Sam
Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   The former Georgia senator and ex-chairman of the Armed Services
Committee received a high honor indeed, the Ralph Bunche Award for
Diplomatic Excellence, for exemplifying the traits of creativity,
leadership and character reminiscent of the venerated
African-American statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn a diplomat? Yes, in the words of Undersecretary of State
Thomas Pickering, Nunn was a visionary in fashioning a bipartisan
consensus on Capitol Hill concerning national security issues _ an
achievement in diplomacy even though Nunn performed the feat on
U.S. soil. Also, Pickering pointed out, Nunn worked with State's
career officers to foster diplomatic readiness within the
department, because he thought that was no less important than
military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn raised some questions about seizing diplomatic initiatives
in his own remarks:
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we develop a preventive diplomatic fund in the State
Department that would allow millions to be spent in predictable hot
spots like Kosovo to prevent wars rather than waiting for billions
to be spent to fight wars? Should we lead a world effort to buy all
excess nuclear materials to head off the nightmare of nuclear
terrorism?''

   Those certainly seem like sound suggestions. Perhaps Nunn, in
his spare time away from his Atlanta law practice and Georgia Tech
professorship, could flesh them out for this or a future
administration. Inside the government or out, he's still a valuable
guy to have around.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Reduced penalty more suitable
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Friday's Atlanta Constitution)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Major League Baseball's new independent arbitrator
Shyam Das has lightened the penalty imposed on the Atlanta Braves'
John Rocker by Commissioner Bud Selig. That's just as well. The
original monthlong suspension and $20,000 fine were excessive.
</P>
<P>
   To put the fuss over Rocker in perspective, he didn't violate
league rules on drugs as a marginal New York Yankee outfielder did
(for the umpteenth time). He didn't poleax an opposing player and
put him in the hospital as a Boston Bruins enforcer did. Granted,
he embarrassed the baseball establishment, but that pales beside
the mortification of the NFL over the arrest of a Baltimore Ravens
linebacker in a double murder.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker just gave the world a piece of his mind, an unsavory
piece to be sure. His interview-tirade in Sports Illustrated was
puerile, insulting and spiteful, but he is entitled to express his
opinions freely. All the baseball people who were appalled by his
remarks were entitled to rebuke him, but Selig overdid it.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a mark of Braves players that they handle
themselves in an exemplary fashion, both on the field and off.
Rocker plainly let his teammates down on that score, but he is
young and immature, certainly not irretrievable.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, the Braves organization had the good sense
to arrange a diversity- and sensitivity-training session for its
players this week. Sad to say, Rocker couldn't take part.
</P>
<P>
   But now he can rejoin the Braves at spring training camp, no
doubt wondering how he, the prodigal, will be received. The best
object lesson he could get would be their tolerance and willingness
to forgive his gratuitous slurs.
</P>
<P>
   He'll need their solidarity when the season starts and the
Braves venture to hostile ballparks.

 &HT;    Stage-struck hopefuls wait _ and wait
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the main characters of ``The Waiting Game'' are waiters and
waitresses. But the movie title really refers to the time they
spend at casting calls and auditions. See, they don't consider
themselves members of the service industry, but great actors in
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Ken Liotti's affectionate tribute to
20-something thespians in Manhattan is briskly paced and has a few
glimmers of wit. But mostly it serves up familiar stuff. It's a
movie catering to a very limited group _ basically, other aspiring
actor-waiters who share the same lingo, dreams and frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Terumi Matthews plays Andi, whose best pal, Lenny (Will Arnett),
is tempted from his long-term relationship by would-be model
Shannon (Taylor Stanley). Meanwhile, Derek (Eddie Malavarca)
worries about his impotency with women and starts to wonder if he
should try his luck with gay colleague Joe (Dwight Ewell).
</P>
<P>
   The movie's most promising plot line follows Andi's growing
attraction to construction worker Franco (Michael Raynor). The
twist is, she was secretly hired by his girlfriend to hit on him at
a bar as a sort of ``fidelity test.'' At first, Franco passes just
fine. But gradually the two are drawn together.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, if you've seen just about any romantic comedy
ever made, it's clear from the start that Andi and Lenny are Best
Platonic Friends who will realize by the final reel that they
should be more than that. It's a shame the flick sticks to formula,
because Raynor is a far more magnetic actor than Arnett.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatis personae include pompous Dan (Daniel Riordan), who
stages a lethally long one-man show that spotlights his lousy
technique. It's a Bad Theater scene we've seen in too many other
movies.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Dan rages at an unimpressed Hollywood casting
director. I think we're supposed to agree with Dan's righteous
passion. It's hard to do, because the character (and perhaps the
actor playing him) is annoying and not especially talented. We're
supposed to like him just because he's an actor. If that makes
sense to you, this is your kind of movie.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    A family secret set to explode
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The War Zone'' is the most Bergman-esque movie to come out
since the great Ingmar Bergman stopped making movies.
Actor-turned-director Tim Roth (``Pulp Fiction'') shares the
reclusive Scandinavian master's fondness for complex, painful
topics, remote, desolate landscapes and bruisingly emotional
close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The film is set on the barren Devon coast of England, where it
seems always to be a dark and stormy night (or a dark and stormy
afternoon or a dark and stormy morning). The constant chill,
however, momentarily disappears when we enter a semi-quaint cottage
isolated above the crashing waves. Inside, Mum (Tilda Swinton) _
hugely, placidly pregnant _ is sitting around with her peevish,
big-eyed teenage daughter, Jessie (Lara Belmont), and Jessie's
peevish, acne-ridden younger brother, Tom (Freddie Cunliffe). From
another room comes a scuffling sound, like a large animal rooting
around garbage. It's Dad (Ray Winstone), the sort of bluff, beefy
average Joe you expect to see at a soccer match.
</P>
<P>
   A normal enough family tableau, you might think. You'd be wrong.
Tom (as in peeping?) has come to suspect that his father is having
sex with his sister. The evidence builds with beguiling ambiguity.
Is Tom right, or is it just his own raging adolescent hormones
fixated on his flirtatious sister? Alas, one wrenching,
almost-impossible-to-watch scene tells the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Winstone, who did Bad Male Duty so effectively in Gary Oldman's
``Nil by Mouth,'' is monstrously credible. So is Swinton, in a role
that calls for her almost to sleepwalk through much of the movie.
But much praise must go to Belmont and Cunliffe, both making their
feature debuts. And to Roth, who uses their inexperience to bring
out their fearlessness and vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The War Zone'' shows how secrets and lies can lead to a
family's collective nervous breakdown. Challenging and disturbing,
it asks its audience to take a risky journey. If you're in the mood
for Adam Sandler, best look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The War Zone''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-

   Starring Ray Winstone and Tilda Swinton. Directed by Tim Roth.

coarse language.1 hour,

   PINOCHET (London) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet was allowed to fly
home to Chile Thursday after Britain dropped extradition
proceedings against him and put an end to his 16 months of house
arrest in England. The decision to free the 84-year-old former
dictator was announced by Home Secretary Jack Straw, who told the
House of Commons that he was ending the complex legal and judicial
case because of the failing health of Pinochet. Four European
countries had been seeking the general's extradition, with Spain
wanting him returned to Madrid to stand trial on charges of torture

   BOSTON _ What do Duke Ellington, Alan Greenspan, and Aristotle
have in common? Genius, yes. (We'll grant Al some leeway here.)
Beyond that, each is a featured player in a popular course being
offered on a Boston campus this semester.
</P>
<P>
   One course is 30 years old and imaginatively combines community
service with classroom study. Another is a year old and like its
subject, the stock market, could scarcely be trendier. A third is
brand new and stylishly untrendy: a course on early American jazz,
taught by a Mozart scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The courses, chosen not entirely at random, sample the variety
and popularity of what's being taught at area colleges at any given
time.

   Literature and Arts B-80: The Swing Era
</P>
<P>
   Examines American jazz from the early 1930s to bebop. Considers
sociological issues and the relationship of swing-era jazz to
classical music and popular song, to place swing's achievements
into a broader historical and musical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I call a mean tune!'' Robert Levin shouts out over
the closing bars of ``Hocus Pocus,'' a 1934 Fletcher Henderson cut,
featuring the incomparable Coleman Hawkins on tenor sax. Levin then
fires up a CD dub of a Louis Armstrong recording he inherited from
his father, a jazz buff.
</P>
<P>
   For the next hour, the perpetual-motion Harvard prof cannot seem
to stand _ or sit _ still. Bouncing over to the piano, Levin bangs
outs a Bach prelude followed by some Jelly Roll Morton licks.
Strutting around the Sanders Theatre stage in front of 560
students, he dips his shoulders and wags his fingers in classic
hepcat style to a peppery clarinet solo by Buster Bailey. Close
your eyes and you can almost smell the Cotton Club circa 1937.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're figuring out what makes this music tick as well as
connecting to it emotionally,'' Levin tells his audience, a mixed
bag of Harvard students and AARP types who are auditing.
</P>
<P>
   For Levin, a classically trained keyboardist who studied with
Nadia Boulanger, ``The Swing Era'' represents a chance not only to
branch out into more of a pop-music idiom but to expose a younger
generation, in a serious and scholarly way, to the recordings he
grooved on as a kid in Queens, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple reason I'm doing this is that I'm crazy about the
music,'' says Levin, whose piano-thumping lecture style has been
packing them in all semester. ``But that's not reason enough. The
fact is, this is the first truly mass popular music in US history.
I want students to get a real insight into the aesthetics of swing,
the way they'd view a painting in a fine arts course or read a poem
in a literature class.''
</P>
<P>
   The course benefited from an early buzz around campus, in part
because Levin also teaches a popular course on chamber music and is
famous for his energy and showmanship. For most of the students in
L&AMP;A B-80, Bix Beiderbecke and Benny Goodman belong as much to
ancient musical history as Beethoven and Liszt do. But as they're
learning, American music didn't start with Jimi Hendrix and Miles
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah Trierweiler, a freshman from Denver, was initially drawn
to Levin's course because it fills a core requirement. ``I listen
to mostly KISS-108 stuff,'' says Trierweiler, ``but not a lot of
jazz. This looked like fun, though. Levin is pretty quirky, too. He
dances around a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Bolton, a junior from Alabama, grew up near New
Orleans listening to '60s and '70s rock. Now, she digs
jazz-influenced groups like Phish. ``I wanted to understand the
background more,'' says Bolton, who concedes that Levin's use of
terminology is ``tough to follow at times.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart and soul of Levin's lectures are close audio analyses
of classic swing tracks. Lectures on Goodman and Ellington
incorporated repeated playings of ``King Porter Stomp'' and ``Mood
Indigo,'' performed by different bands with different arrangements.
Like any good jazzman, though, Levin is an inveterate improviser. A
discourse on Ellington's recording of ``Take the A Train,'' for
instance, segued into a brief history of the Manhattan subway
system.
</P>
<P>
   Says Levin, ``My secret goal is to build students' listening
libraries, the way others bought `Rubber Soul' or `Born in the
USA.' Because once you've got these recordings, you'll listen to
them. I'm on a cultural crusade here.'' Move over, Bruce.

   Course requirements include 10 to 12 hours per week of community
service. In light of classic philosophical and theological texts,
students address the relationship of self and society, the nature
of community, the mystery of suffering, and the practical
difficulties of developing a just society.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All things being equal, there is almost no chance Kristin
Kusmierz would have crossed paths with Michael Brady during her
college years. Or wanted to. Kusmierz is a BC junior from North
Kingstown, R.I. Brady is a 44-year-old, HIV-positive substance
abuser from Scituate who never went to college and who is ``pretty
much on my last chance right now,'' Brady says.
</P>
<P>
   BC's PULSE course is nothing if not a great equalizer, though.
And so one day last week, Kusmierz and Brady took a stroll together
around Shattuck Hospital in Jamaica Plain, where Brady is a patient
in the Living and Recovering Community program (LARC) and Kusmierz
works as a student volunteer through the Victory Programs agency.
The two found more in common than either might have dreamed of four
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not like a conversation between a college student and a
dope fiend,'' Brady recalled afterward. ``We talked about the
virus, about substance abuse and her maybe going into human
services after she graduates. It's nice to hear what a student has
to say to someone who's been on the street for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusmierz nodded. ``To actually see people living with the virus
teaches you more than any book can,'' she said, seated in a cramped
hospital conference room with two fellow PULSE students and half a
dozen LARC patients. ``In class, we focus on how to live your life,
how to develop a system of meaning that builds a community. It's
much easier to internalize something when you read it and see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusmierz is one of 300 BC students enrolled in the program this
year, continuing a tradition established in 1970. In weekly section
meetings, students discuss writings by Aristotle, Rousseau, and
Locke along with contemporary authors like Charles Taylor and
Jonathan Kozol. They also keep detailed journals, diaries that
often provoke soul-searching examinations of what personal and
social responsibility truly mean.
</P>
<P>
   The course has seldom been more popular. About 150 students were
turned away this year for space reasons, despite the heavy reading
load and community-service requirement. Program director Donald
McMenamin says word of mouth is his best recruiting tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids hear from other students who say it's the most
important course they've taken at BC,'' says McMenamin. ``They
start out thinking they're going to change the world, and they
leave realizing how much they've been changed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   In class, McMenamin and his colleagues push students to relate
what they're reading to issues they've encountered in the field.
Thus a recent discussion of Taylor's ``The Ethics of Authenticity''
prompted McMenamin to ponder the relationship between the
individual and society, asking students if there were anything like
a shared definition of the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does your concept of the dream correspond to that of the
people in the placement agencies where you work?'' he inquired.
``If the good life is going to be achieved,'' he argued, ``all the
voices must be at the table. If we exclude some of those voices, we
risk impoverishing our notion of what is authentic.''

 &HT;     POLLS GIVE McCAIN THE EDGE IN N.Y. PRIMARY  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For the first time, presidential hopeful John
McCain is leading in all three major New York polls among likely
Republican voters as he and George W. Bush face off in the days
before the state's March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, 20 points behind Bush six weeks ago, now has a 6- to
7-point lead over the Texas governor in polls released Wednesday by
Zogby International, Quinnipiac College and the Marist Institute
for Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time,'' said Quinnipiac pollster Maurice
Carroll. ``McCain was like a blip on the screen just a few months
ago. What you've got is a (GOP) establishment versus this McCain
aura.''
</P>
<P>
   In all three polls, McCain's edge was above the statistical
margin of error among likely GOP primary voters. Marist had McCain
over Bush by a 51-44 percent edge; the poll was taken Feb. 28-29
and has a margin of error of 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac showed McCain at 47 percent to Bush's 40 percent, in
a poll done Feb. 22-28. That poll had a 6-point margin of error.
Zogby's daily tracking survey showed McCain at 44.1 percent and
Bush at 38.4 percent, with a margin of error of 4.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's forces responded with two new ads downstate focusing on
the environment and breast cancer. Bush's state chairman, Gov.
George Pataki, also took a swing at McCain, calling the Arizona
senator's voting record as ``anti-New York, anti-Northeast as
anybody's in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a difficult fight, and we appreciate that,'' Pataki
added. But voters, he said, ``are going to take a look at the
candidates and come out and vote for Governor Bush because they'll
see that he has the record and the vision for America, and Senator
McCain does not. That's what it comes down to in an election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's radio spot on breast cancer features survivor Geri Barish
of Long Island. The ad marks the first time Bush has attacked
McCain for voting to cut federal funding for breast cancer
research, which was included in a 2000 appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's camp responded by blasting Bush for distorting the
senator's record of support for breast cancer research and said he
voted against funding that was part of a ``pork barrel'' package.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a hit for the second ad, paid for by a group called
``Republicans for Clean Air'' and touting the governor's
environmental record in Texas. The Sierra Club pronounced the
television ad ``full of half-truths.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fletcher said the campaign had nothing to do
with the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Among likely Democratic voters polled, Vice President Al Gore is
holding on to his comfortable lead over challenger Bill Bradley,
the former senator from New Jersey. In all three surveys, Gore
carried at least a 19-point edge.

   Kusmierz noted that as people focus more on individual freedoms
and less on how their actions affect others, the dividing line
between haves and have-nots sharpens. ``As long as large segments
of society can't realize their definitions of the good life,'' she
said, ``programs like LARC will exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The voices heard around a hospital conference table last week
were authentic, all right, painfully so. Amid the sobering talk of
viral loads and T-cell counts, though, there was also laughter. And
that constituted a learning experience in itself.
</P>
<P>
   John Miller, a LARC patient from Dorchester, glanced at Richie
Moriarity, a sophomore from Maryland, and said that if he could
give these BC kids one gift, it would be ``an awareness of drug
addiction. Because there's always a line to cross, and I crossed
it. Once you cross it, you can't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Moriarity smiled back. ``Being at BC gives you a warped sense of
reality,'' he said softly. ``Everyone there is fortunate. Everyone
has plenty of money. It knocks me off my feet every day I come over
here. It's like _ '' Moriarity glanced around the table _ ``hel-lo,
Richie. Welcome to the real world.''

   EXP 88S: Understanding the Stock Market
</P>
<P>
   Students will begin to develop an understanding of and an
appreciation for the fundamentals of stock market investing, doing
so within the realm of larger social, demographic, political, and
economic contexts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what a margin is?'' asks Timothy Stratford in a
basement classroom of Braker Hall. ``No one?''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine students sit on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' says Stratford, writing ``THE MAGIC OF MARGIN'' on a
blackboard. ``Now, the whole premise of what I'm about to tell you
is that you should never do it, but it's crucial to know about.'' A
hand goes up. ``Yes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Greenspan said today he was unconcerned about margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Stratford laughs. ``Did he say why?'' he asks, tapping the
board. ``OK, here's my concern,'' continues Stratford. ``It's
buying stock with money you don't have. It's the biggest disaster
you can do. Mutual funds do it because they can get in and out of
stocks quickly. You can't. Any questions?''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began week six of an unusual course offered by Tufts
University's Experimental College. Call it Greenspan 101. From
calculating interest rates to shorting tech stocks, the course aims
to demystify the Dow while equipping students with the basics of
portfolio building. Chaucer? Organic Chem? Forget about it. The
cheer you hear is tuition-strapped parents yelling, ``Finally, a
course with a return on investment!''
</P>
<P>
   Stratford, an ex-bartender who logged 17 years as a broker, was
likewise cheered when 200 students showed up for the course last
spring, six times the number he could accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who don't get in beg me for a seat.'' says Stratford,
now teaching the course for the third time. ``If I were a broker
and 180 prospective clients showed up, I'd be thrilled. But I'm not
trying to sell them anything here.''
</P>
<P>
   The students, most of whom admit they don't know NASDAQ from
NASCAR, must write brief application essays. ``Like learning to fix
my car and cook a turkey,'' wrote one, ``learning about the stock
market is one of those goals that I've had for a while but haven't
gotten around to addressing.'' Gushed another, ``I only know that
those mysterious numbers that flash by right before the commercials
on the national news excite me more than any other possibility in
my life.'' Ah, youth.
</P>
<P>
   Two students have brought parents to class. Drew Carlton, a
senior from Shaker Heights, Ohio, took the course last fall. An
experienced day trader, Carlton knew as much about Internet trading
as Stratford did, maybe more. Still, says Carlton, ``I liked it
because it's a lot more relevant than most college classes. This is
something everyone should know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Robin, a senior psychology major from Long Island, knew
nothing about investing before this semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about to graduate, and I thought I'd better take one
course in something relevant,'' says Robin. Her midterm assessment?
``It's given me a basis for reading the business page every day,''
she says. ``Some things are still unclear, though, like inflation
and interest rates or _ '' join the club, Jennie `` _ what actually
moves the stock market up and down.
</P>
<P>
   If Stratford preaches anything, it's the value of patience and
discipline. Strategies like dollar cost averaging _ investing small
amounts consistently to capitalize on market fluctuations _ are
emphasized over picking the next hot dot-com stock or go-go mutual
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Says Stratford, ``Some of these kids want to make money, some
have parents who think this is good stuff to know, and some want to
walk into job interviews and not sound like idiots.'' He smiles.
``I'm here to help them all.''

 &HT;    Religious leader fighting for gay rights to speak at rally
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Rev. Mel White, the gay clergyman who last
fall met with the Rev. Jerry Falwell in an effort to bridge the gap
between gays and religious conservatives, will speak at a Dayton
rally March 11.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, sponsored by a coalition of local gay and lesbian
advocacy groups, also will include Dayton City Commissioner Mary
Wiseman, who last year led an unsuccessful attempt to amend the
city's anti-discrimination ordinance to include gays, the poor and
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   The Soulforce Justice Rally, at Faith United Church of Christ,
takes its name from White's national effort to promote nonviolent
gay advocacy efforts. It includes workshops, videos and a Web site,
www.soulforce.org.
</P>
<P>
   White, 60, a former ghostwriter for Falwell and Pat Robertson,
is a minister with the Metropolitan Community Church. In October,
after his meetings with Falwell at his church in Lynchburg, Va.,
Falwell pledged to tone down his anti-gay rhetoric, although he
still maintains that homosexuality is a sin. In November, White was
arrested outside a church in Nebraska, where he led a protest in
support of the Rev. Jimmy Creech, who was cut off from the United
Methodist Church for presiding at the union of a gay couple.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton event has been organized by Faith Church, Parents and
Friends of Lesbians and Gays, the Dayton Lesbian and Gay Center,
and other churches that are supportive of the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   It comes on the heels of the December defeat of Wiseman's
amendment, and the realization that the gay community needs to
build bridges between the black community and the faith community,
according to Wiseman. Her amendment faced strong opposition by
black clergy.
</P>
<P>
   She has not ruled out proposing the amendment again, in a form
that might be more acceptable to its detractors. ``We continue to
try to keep the dialogue going,'' she said. ``We understand there's
a lot of work to be done.''

<P>
   KINGSTON, Mass. _ Spring is hardly in the air, but bee school is
already up and, well, buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 beekeepers and beekeeping wannabees have gathered at a
local community center for a session, ``The Life Cycle of the Honey
Bee.'' You can almost hear the hum in the air, the anticipation of
bee season, which begins in earnest next month when bees come out
of their hives and embrace spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to talk about our favorite insect, the honeybee,''
says the guest lecturer, Marshfield beekeeper Vicki McDonough.
Notebooks fall open and ballpoint pens click. Nobody says they
prefer the rival bumblebee, for example, or perhaps the yellow
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   No, in this crowd, honeybees R them.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, honeybees R a lot of people these days.
</P>
<P>
   While this particular bee school _ a seven-week introduction to
beekeeping _ is sponsored by the Plymouth County Beekeepers
Association, interest in beekeeping seems to be growing across the
country. County bee clubs in Massachusetts report rising
memberships. Subscriptions to American Bee Journal _ the
Illinois-based trade magazine for beekeepers _ are up.
</P>
<P>
   What's the attraction to bees? It's not an economic interest,
that's for sure. A serious nationwide problem with
honeybee-attacking mites over the last decade has discouraged many
professional beekeepers who were involved in beekeeping for honey
production or who managed colonies for crop pollination.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, more and more, ``it's people interested in doing it
recreationally,'' says Joe Graham, editor of the American Bee
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   They're people interested in what Howard Scott, who runs the
Kingston bee school and has published a small volume called ``Bee
Lessons,'' describes as ``the poetical wonder of bees.'' He's seen
folks who ``are tired of the rat race'' discover a meditative,
Zen-like quality in this hobby rooted in nature and the outdoors
and the community that bees create.
</P>
<P>
   One of Scott's students, Lou Eyster, runs an insurance agency in
Framingham and owns three hives at home in Norwell. Sure, the
honey's sweet, he says, but that's not why he raises bees. ``To be
honest, it's an escape,'' he says. ``It relaxes me. I'm fascinated
by the bees, and at the same time, you don't have to deal with a
lot of people. You go out there and watch them bring in the pollen,
and nobody bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Hatton of Pembroke plans to start up two hives, not only to
pollinate her flowers and create more robust blooms but also
because, quite simply, she admires honeybees: ``I like the idea of
natural creatures that give something back by pollinating.'' With
their well-defined division of labor, their regal leadership, and
their furious work ethic, she says, honeybees have invented ``a
perfect society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no handouts,'' she says. ``If you don't participate,
there is no point in having you.''
</P>
<P>
   Birgit Deweerd of Bedford, vice president of the Middlesex
County Beekeepers Association and a recreational beekeeper,
describes her infatuation with the insects in her self-published
book ``Let Me Tell You About the Bees'' and lectures about bees at
garden clubs and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know that if you move a hive a few inches to the side,
the bees won't find their way back?'' she asks. ``They are so
oriented to the original spot. If you know their way of life, you
can anticipate their behavior and treat them like a bunch of farm
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the informal nature of beekeeping, there are no
statistics on how many people are suiting themselves up in
protective bee veils and tending hives. You don't need a license to
be a beekeeper, just some basic equipment like a standard wooden
beehive, a single, all-purpose tool that pries open the hive cover
and pulls out the frames, and a package of mail-order bees.
</P>
<P>
   Beekeeping is not a particularly expensive hobby. For $46, you
can buy a package of 3,000 bees, including a queen, and a starter
hobby kit in a beekeeping catalog sells for $109.95.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is beekeeping time-consuming. Scott calls it ``the lazy
man's hobby'' because all an amateur beekeeper needs to do is
medicate the bees against mites and observe the hive now and then
to be sure the eggs are healthy and the bees thriving. ``The bees
do all the work,'' he says. ``You just go out in September and
extract the honey.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of today's beekeepers, tending hives and observing
honeybee activity is ``kind of a therapy,'' says Al Carl, chief
apiary inspector for the state of Massachusetts. ``It's a
back-to-the-earth thing,'' he says. With bees, ``You are dealing
with a population that is not going to say to you `Have a nice
day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Anderson-Dargatz understands this phenomenon so well she
has written a novel about it, ``A Recipe for Bees'' (Harmony
Books), which was published last month in the United States and a
year ago in Canada, where it was well received.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson-Dargatz is married to a beekeeper, and her novel
describes a character whose bees ``were more a calling than an
occupation,'' whose bookshelves were filled with ``books about the
art of beekeeping, the biology of bees, myths and legends
associated with bees.''
</P>
<P>
   She was surprised by how much the book's beekeeping passages
resonated with readers. ``When I was giving readings from my book,
there seemed to be a whole lot of people coming to see me who were
involved in beekeeping, and they spoke about it not in farming
terms but in poetic terms,'' she says in a telephone interview from
her home in British Columbia. ``They used a lot of metaphor, almost
as if I was discussing beekeeping with a poet. After all, handling
the hive is about engaging all five senses. On a winter's day when
the sun comes out, they fly out and look like these wonderful amber
jewels.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, the freelance writer and small-scale beekeeper who
organized the Plymouth County bee school, is also taken with the
poetry of bees. ``Bee Lessons,'' which he published himself last
year, is an imaginative interpretation of things he has learned
from observing the insects, with 41 conclusions or bee lessons, as
he calls them. These include: ``It's satisfying to work for the
greater good''; ``By dividing up the work, more gets done''; and
``Produce more heirs than you need to insure survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Scott thought the book would do well at state fairs
and beekeeping meetings, but it turns out urban folks like it, too.
He printed 3,000 copies and ``I'm close to sold out,'' he says,
with many sales made at bookstores in Cambridge. To be sure, he
heard from one woman who acknowledged she bought it because its
bright yellow cover matched her kitchen. But more typical, he says,
is the feedback he got from a minister ``who called up and said,
`There are 50 sermons in this book.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, 55, started keeping bees nearly 20 years ago, and now ``I
seem to have become the person I dreaded I'd become'' _ the
beekeeping equivalent, he says, of the railroad buff who can't stop
talking timetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``My excuse is I like it more and more,'' he says. ``Beekeeping
is a strange world and a different world, with all different values
and constructs.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a Wharton-trained economist who for a dozen years owned a
Quincy office supply business. There are many parallels, he says,
between the beehive and the business world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the way they all work for the good of the hive, for
example,'' he says. ``Bees actually wear their wings out in the
summer, and will sting when the hive is threatened, and die for
it.'' There is their strong sense of community, for example, their
industriousness, and their tendency to move around the corporation.
Every worker bee does many jobs during a lifetime, from cleaning
cells to processing honey to foraging for nectar and pollen. (Bee
Lesson 9: ``The best way to achieve job satisfaction is variety.'')
</P>
<P>
   Now, like most of his students, Scott's thoughts are turning to
spring. Once in a while, he goes to his backyard and puts his ear
to his hives to hear that reassuring faint hum that means his bees
have made it through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides robins and croci, bees are an important sign of
spring,'' he writes in his book. ``Sightings of active bees
proclaim that the insects have made it through another harsh winter
and that the greening of the countryside will soon begin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bee Lesson 40: Ah bees, Ah life.''
</P>

 &HT;    Guide gives a big boost to natural wonders of the Southeast
 &HT;    By Howard Pousner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation published its
first Directory of Birding and Nature Festivals in 1995, it listed
about two dozen events. This year, the 76-page guide lists more
than 200 events nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The growth, says Peter Stangel, director of the foundation's
regional office in Atlanta, mirrors mushrooming interest in birding
and nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Festivals are a win-win for people and birds,'' he says,
referring to the knowledge festivalgoers gain about the natural
world that surrounds us and the festival proceeds that typically
benefit conservation.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case with the Florida Birding Festival and Nature
Expo in Clearwater, Fla., which has earmarked $20,000 in proceeds
to help Pinellas County secure Shell Key. The pristine, 180-acre
barrier island, at the mouth of Tampa Bay on the Gulf of Mexico, is
home to countless varieties of shorebirds.

`DROWNING MONA': CAUTION: FALLING YUGO ZONE AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the pulpy comedy ``Drowning Mona,'' Bette Midler, as Mona
Dearly, looks a mess, with a dye job the color of Tang, similar to
the faded taffy hue of the Yugos that dot the front yards of
Verplanck, the tiny upstate New York town where the movie is set. A
series of crude shots _ some of which are very funny _that pop the
small cast of yokels right between the eyes, ``Mona'' is a dreary
crash of malapropisms and slapstick maimings wrapped very loosely
around a murder mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Mona is sent to her doom in a brakeless Yugo launched off a
mountain road. (Someone may have believed that ``Hurtling Mona''
wasn't as good a title.) Mona was meaner than a werewolf under a
full moon; she drew blood every time she opened her mouth. (Her
last name was a bad joke.) So many people in town dearly wished her
dead that even in this little burg there's no shortage of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drowning Mona'' is kind of a mystery, although the real
mystery is that anybody cares enough to find out who killed her.
Leading the investigation is Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito), the
constable with a keen interest in Broadway musicals. The film
reunites him with Midler, his ``Ruthless People'' co-star, but this
time around he's the only person who didn't want the victim dead.
(He seems to be the only reasonable person in town.)
</P>
<P>
   The real victims here are the characters, who've been impaled on
their own Herculean pursuit of bad taste. Three Dog Night songs
have been unleashed on the soundtrack, which must have been scored
by K-Tel record company.
</P>
<P>
   And there are more bad hair days than you'd see at a monster
truck rally. William Fichtner, whose turn as a voluble strong-arm
cop was one of the many acting high points in last year's film
``Go,'' is Mona's husband. His bravery as an actor is heartening.
</P>
<P>
   Fichtner's hair is teased into a gruesome tumbleweed; he wears
one of those '70s white-guy Afros with mutton-chop sideburns
obscuring the sides of his face. He must have taken his ladykiller
look from a Tom Jones album cover, or at the very least from
Engelbert Humperdinck. He regards everything with the same
intensity, including an episode of the television show ``Cops'' he
watches while being tongue-lashed by his wife. ``They've cornered
the shooter,'' he says, incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Nick Gomez, is working in a much more
conventionally structured narrative situation than he has in his
previous pictures (``New Jersey Drive,'' ``Laws of Gravity''). It's
not enough that the film is full of soiled white trash. Almost
everyone in ``Drowning Mona'' is dumber than he needs to be,
resulting in several different types of slack-jawed stumblebums.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Thomas, who plays Mona's son, Jeff, is the film's most
idiotic character. Having lost a hand in a way that's as mysterious
as Mona's murderer, Jeff is seen at one point trying to strum a
guitar with his stump. The laughs can come fairly quickly, mostly
at Jeff's expense. Then there's Bobby Calzone (well played Casey
Affleck), Jeff's partner in a landscaping business in which Jeff's
participation comes mostly in the form of making fun of Bobby's
sensitivity, especially toward his fiancee, Ellie (Neve Campbell).
</P>
<P>
   Everything in the movie is treated as an object for gags, and
that includes the cast. The movie goes beyond antisentimentality,
really. This may be an efficient way to make a comedy, but it's not
heartless enough.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Drowning Mona'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It includes violence, angry adult language and cruelty
to small animals.
</P>

`GHOST DOG': PASSIONS OF EMPTINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(jt) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,'' Jim Jarmusch tries to
do to the samurai epic and the gangster movie what he did to the
western in ``Dead Man'' (1997), his dreamy, elegiac deconstruction
of cowboys-and-Indians mythology. Like a postmodern magpie,
Jarmusch likes to scavenge shiny bits of pop-culture flotsam _
mobsters in their sharkskin suits, gaudy cartoon animals, sleek
imported luxury cars, iridescent CD's _ and weave them into quirky,
ramshackle habitations.
</P>
<P>
   Here he is aided immeasurably by the RZA (pronounced RIZZ-ah),
one of the hip-hop masterminds behind the Wu-Tang Clan, whose
dreamy, collagist approach to sound nicely mirrors Jarmusch's cool,
allusive visual style. Whether the film's use of music will help
make it accessible to audiences is an open question. Jarmusch is an
acquired taste, and a lot of people seem to find him unpalatable.
For each viewer who revels in the artistry of his slow, disjunctive
scenes, his carefully composed frames and his penchant for
symbolism, there is another who sees only artiness.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most resistant moviegoer may be provoked by ``Ghost
Dog.'' Indeed, the best way to appreciate this fascinating but
uneven film may be to resist it, to watch it unfold in the
persistent, persistently thwarted expectation that it will erupt
into the hip-hop Mafia shoot-'em-up it stubbornly refuses to be.
There is a lot of violence, but not much action; a plot involving
vengeance, jealousy and double-crossing, but not a great deal of
suspense. Jarmusch choreographs his killings with somber
stateliness. His blood-drenched climax has an almost ritualistic
inevitability, like the end of a Jacobean revenge tragedy or a
Kurosawa film.
</P>
<P>
   He has composed a ruminative, bittersweet visual essay on
brutality, honor and tribalism, which may frustrate audiences
expecting hyped-up intensity, fast-paced thrills or a story that
makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   But frustration can be a stimulus to thought, an aspect of
discipline, which is one of the themes of ``Ghost Dog.'' Its
subtitle refers to an ancient Japanese warriors' manual called
``Hagakure,'' passages of which fill the screen like intertitles in
a silent movie and which also come to us in the gruff, sad voice of
Forest Whitaker. Whitaker plays the title character, a modern-day
samurai pledged to serve a master named Louie (John Tormey), a
Mafia soldier in a decrepit, nameless American city.
</P>
<P>
   Louie's bosses are a wheezing klatch of capos and consiglieres,
compared to whom William Hickey's geriatric don in ``Prizzi's
Honor'' looks as vigorous and decisive as the young Vito Corleone
in ``The Godfather, Part II.'' These wasted, diminished figures _
call them the Mezzo-Sopranos _ can barely make the rent on their
ratty private club. They don't seem to be involved in any illegal
business or much of anything besides deciding whom to kill next.
Almost by default _ he has carried out a hit in the presence of the
chief mobster's daughter _ they decide to kill Ghost Dog.
</P>
<P>
   Ghost Dog's world is an abstract, allegorical place, where cars
have license plates from ``The Industrial State'' and ``The Highway
State.'' From ``Hagakure,'' the film quotes the standard Buddhist
teaching ``form is emptiness; emptiness is form,''and Jarmusch
sometimes seems intent on demonstrating the truth of this
observation. He is rescued from his worst impulses largely by the
RZA's score and by Whitaker's witty, moving performance. Jarmusch
has told interviewers that he conceived the character Ghost Dog
with Whitaker in mind, and it's hard to think of another actor who
could play a cold-blooded killer with such warmth and humanity, or
who could manage to be at once a mythic hero and a lonely young man
with only books, music and pigeons for company.
</P>
<P>
   Ghost Dog also finds some human companionship. His entanglement
with the mobsters is paralleled by his blossoming friendship with a
young girl, Pearline (Camille Winbush), and a French-speaking
ice-cream salesman, Raymond (Isaach de Bankole). The meandering
back-and-forth between these characters lends the movie some of the
low-key, absurdist humor that animated Jarmusch's first two
features, ``Stranger Than Paradise'' and ``Down by Law.''
</P>
<P>
   It will not have escaped your attention that Ghost Dog is a
black man who refers (and, at great cost, defers) to a white master
and who is pursued by a mob because of his improper attention to a
white woman. The revenge plot may be rooted in samurai legend, but
Jarmusch also clearly intends for us to pick up a more disturbing
and less exotic resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghost Dog'' is about race relations much in the way that
``Dead Man'' was about the genocidal dispossession of the Indians
in the 19th century: unmistakably, but also obliquely. What are we
to make of a middle-aged Mafioso doing a spastic Dean Martin
shuffle in front of his bathroom mirror while he raps along with
Public Enemy's ``Cold Lampin' With Flavor''? Or Ghost Dog's violent
encounter with two white hunters in camouflage war paint that looks
a lot like blackface? Images like these feel like the fever dreams
of a culture obsessed with racial distinctions yet unable to think
clearly about what race is or even to decide whether it is real.
This movie seems to suffer from a similar indecision about itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,'' has been rated R
(Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It is
drenched in blood and saturated with ambiguity.

`LOUIS PRIMA: THE WILDEST': JUST A GIGOLO? LOUIS PRIMA AS A BIT
MORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in ``Louis Prima: The Wildest,'' Don McGlynn's buoyant
documentary portrait of Las Vegas' reigning 1950s musical clown,
there's a television clip of Prima and his wife at the time, Keely
Smith, goofing their way through ``That Old Black Magic.'' After
delivering the song in rapid-fire call-and-response bursts, the
pair suddenly skid into farce, bumping foreheads as Smith adopts a
sour Southern twang and crosses her eyes, while Prima bends the
lyric into a fat joke. ``You're the blubber I have waited
for/You're the weight that fate had me created for.''
</P>
<P>
   These irreverent high-velocity travesties in stage shows that
had the spontaneity of wild parties made Prima a beloved figure
among the Las Vegas cognoscenti in the mid-'50s. The onstage
horseplay of Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack and later of Sonny and
Cher owed a great deal to Prima, whose image as a cut-up, roaring
songs in a raw vocal rasp and blowing maniacal trumpet squeals
against a frenzied beat established his public image as a raucous
musical jokester.
</P>
<P>
   But as the movie documents, Prima was much more than a symbol of
Las Vegas in its early incarnation as a swinging boom town Babylon.
At his best, he suggested a playful Italian-American answer to
Louis Armstrong. His frantic jump-blues recordings also prefigured
rock 'n' roll. His credentials as a proto-rocker were further
certified when his famous pogo-beat version of ``Just a Gigolo''
joined at the hip with ``I Ain't Got Nobody'' was recorded in the
1980s by David Lee Roth.
</P>
<P>
   The film is generously studded with excerpts from variety show
appearances featuring Prima, his band and Smith, the fourth of his
five wives and his most famous singing partner. Smith, with her
Prince Valiant haircut and poker-faced, faintly disapproving
attitude toward her husband's high jinks, was Prima's ideal comic
foil, and after the couple separated in the early '60s, Prima's
career never recovered. He died in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis Prima: The Wildest'' arrives at a moment when Prima,
Dean Martin and other old-time Las Vegas lounge lizards are being
lionized as heroes of a renascent, martini-swilling culture that
looks back at the bad old days of Las Vegas with the same
rose-colored nostalgia with which others remember the Beach Boys as
embodying the California dream. Also contributing to Prima's
resurgence have been his appearances on the movie soundtracks of
``Casino,'' ``Swingers,'' ``Big Night'' and ``Analyze This.''
</P>
<P>
   If the movie doesn't delve deeply into Prima's personal life
beyond offering some family background and noting his five
marriages and his reputation as a womanizer, it finds much to
examine in his music. Of Sicilian descent, Prima was born in New
Orleans, where he soaked up the sounds of local street bands and
the Mardi Gras party spirit at the same time he was hearing Italian
opera in his home. Once he took up the trumpet, he became one of
the first swing band leaders to embrace the blues.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a songwriter whose most famous composition, ``Sing,
Sing, Sing,'' became a Benny Goodman signature. Later, working with
the honking saxophonist Sam Butera and his band, he made music that
had strong undercurrents of rock 'n' roll. In the '40s, he also
began recording novelties with Italian slang and subject matter
that helped inspire an ethnic Italian-American subgenre. The
mingling of African-American and Italian influences in his music
was so deep that on his recordings the blues shuffle beat and
tarantella fused as one.
</P>
<P>
   If all these musical and cultural crosscurrents are audible in
the movie's well-chosen excerpts, the documentary never begins to
give us a sense of the man behind the music. All it really tells us
is that Prima was a fun-loving guy and catnip to women and leaves
it at that.

RARAE AVES: AUDUBON AT AUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The climate in Scotland is very good for books,'' Francis
Wahlgren, the head of Christie's books department in New York, said
with a smile. ``It's damp and cold.''
</P>
<P>
   He was commenting on the the fine condition of four giant
volumes of John James Audubon's ``Birds of America,'' which had
been in a Scottish house since 1909 before being consigned to
Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   The leather-bound set is the star lot in Christie's March 10
sale, ``Important Natural History Books.'' It took Audubon 11
years, from 1827 to 1838, to publish the 435 hand-colored, etched
and aquatinted plates in these volumes.
</P>
<P>
   The set will be on view Saturday through Thursday, and even an
amateur can see that the color is vibrant and there has been little
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   The set is known as a ``double elephant'' because of the size of
its sheets of thick rag paper: each sheet measures 39{ by 19{
inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were the largest single sheets produced at the time,''
Wahlgren said. Audubon insisted on this size because he wanted the
birds to be depicted life size. ``You can almost feel the feathers
on these birds,'' he said. ``These plates are the icons of
ornithology.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird books have been published at least since the 16th century,
but in terms of sheer artistry almost nothing can match Audubon's
``Birds of America,'' except, perhaps, Audubon's original
watercolors, which are in the permanent collection of the New-York
Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a master of brilliant color, detail and lifelike
movement,'' said Angela D. Mack, a curator at the Gibbes Museum of
Art in Charleston, S.C., who has organized a show of 42 original
Audubon watercolors from the society's collection, opening at the
Gibbes on March 31. ``Audubon is known for his innovative style of
combining a range of different techniques and mediums.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy for Audubon to sell his engravings in the early
1800s. Nor was it easy to buy them. His original clients had to
subscribe to a series to receive his bird plates, and they were
delivered in installments, five engravings at a time. Wahlgren said
a shipment usually included one very large bird, one medium-size
bird and three small birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a subscriber, you would have had to put in the equivalent
of $1,000, which at that time would have been a lot of money, for a
set, before binding,'' Wahlgren said. Each plate was meticulously
engraved after Audubon's watercolor drawings by William H. Lizars
of Edinburgh or by Robert Havell Sr. and Jr. of London. A few
colors could then be applied by aquatint, and the rest were
hand-painted.
</P>
<P>
   The man who ordered the four-volume set now at Christie's was
George Lane Fox of Yorkshire, England, a friend of the prince
regent whose greatest interests apart from birds were racing and
gambling. The Audubon set remained in his family until 1909 and
then went to John, Fourth Marquess of Bute, whose son is consigning
the present set.
</P>
<P>
   Other subscribers to the original edition included Charles X of
France, Queen Adelaide of Britain (wife of William IV), Earl
Spencer and several Americans: Daniel Webster, P.J. Stuyvesant,
John P. Wetherells and Henry Clay. Only about 200 double-elephant
sets were made; at least 70 have been destroyed. They rarely come
up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a complete set in seven years,'' Wahlgren said.
``The last complete copy that came up for auction was in 1993 here
at Christie's, and it sold for about $3 million. The record price
for a full set is $4 million.'' The estimate for this set is $2
million to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years double-elephant sets have been broken up, and
individual sheets are sold at art galleries for $2,500 to $150,000.
``Birds of America'' was later reissued in smaller-format volumes
known as octavo editions, some of which are also in Christie's
March 10 sale, at estimates a fraction of the double-elephant
set's.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``No copy surpasses the first,'' Wahlgren explained.
</P>
<P>
   Audubon was preoccupied with birds practically from birth.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in 1785 in Haiti, the son of a French captain who
was an agent for a French mercantile company and his Creole
mistress. Less than a year after his birth, his mother died, and
his father took him back to Nantes, France, to be raised by his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   He was legally adopted but received only a minimal education. He
spent most of his time collecting bird specimens in the countryside
for stuffing and drawing. He was a self-taught artist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1803 the family's fortunes declined. Napoleon was seeking
army conscripts, so Audubon, then 18, is said to have fled with his
father to America. They settled in Pennsylvania. In 1808 he married
the daughter of a wealthy neighbor and moved to Louisville, Ky. He
tried his luck as a merchant but failed.
</P>
<P>
   He became obsessed with the exotic birds he found in the
wilderness and devised a method to mount the birds on wires to draw
them in more lifelike poses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He propped them in positions they would never have had in
nature,'' Wahlgren said. ``But you do get a feeling of movement and
life in them.'' Audubon drew his birds out in the field, depicting
them on branches of native American plants. Both plants and birds
are identified in the plates by their Latin and common names.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally he would add a view of the site, even an American
city, in the background. ``These were artistic decisions, and it
makes the compositions more interesting,'' Wahlgren said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1820 Audubon went bankrupt and left for Louisiana on a
flatboat. He worked as an itinerant artist, doing mostly portraits
and leaving his wife to support and raise their two sons.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have come into his own as a painter of birds while
working in Mississippi and Louisiana, but he was unable to get his
work published in America. In 1826 he traveled to England to find a
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying himself as an American woodsman, he won support from
British ornithologists who admired his work and from titled
families who enjoyed listening to his lectures and seeing his
frontier costumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a 19th-century romantic figure, creator of his own
myth, an artist-naturalist, an artist explorer, an
artist-publisher, an entrepreneur, a writer and an
environmentalist,'' said Holly Hotchner, a former director of the
New-York Historical Society's museum.
</P>
<P>
   In time he succeeded in selling subscriptions to his bird series
to the families in the great English country houses. Having secured
an engraver, he returned to America to continue drawing and
painting.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1830s he visited South Carolina, often staying with the
Rev. John Bachman in Charleston. Bachman's sister-in-law, Maria
Martin, helped him paint in the backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   It is the 42 watercolors of South Carolina birds that the Gibbes
Museum will show later this month. Mack, the curator, said she
planned to show the original drawings next to a double-elephant
folio on loan from the College of Charleston so visitors can
compare the originals to the engravings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show where the books come from,'' she said.

   AMEL LARRIEUX: ``Infinite Possibilities'' (Epic/550 Music).
</P>
<P>
   Undulating vamps, the glassy tinkle of electric piano and
playful phantom choruses surround Amel Larrieux on her debut album.
</P>
<P>
   Larrieux, who sang with Groove Theory in the mid-1990s, is part
of the high-minded pop-soul movement spearheaded by Erykah Badu and
Lauryn Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In songs she wrote and produced with her husband, Laru Larrieux,
she sings about ambition, loneliness, reclaiming self-esteem and
staying true to her soul; her syncopated phrasing links the songs
to jazz or gospel.
</P>
<P>
   But the sparse, coolly synthetic production _ some songs barely
state the beat _ places Larrieux's supple, girlish voice in an
inner domain that's all her own, where her prismatically multiplied
voice offers counsel and comfort.

<P>
   LONDON _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet was allowed to fly home to Chile
Thursday after Britain dropped extradition proceedings against him
and put an end to his 16 months of house arrest in England.
</P>
<P>
   A Chilean military plane lifted off from Waddington Royal Air
Force Base in Lincolnshire at 1:10 p.m., just hours after the
decision to free the 84-year-old former Chilean dictator was
announced by Home Secretary Jack Straw.
</P>
<P>
   Straw told the House of Commons that he was ending the complex
legal and judicial case because of the failing health of Pinochet.
Four European countries had been seeking the general's extradition,
with Spain wanting him returned to Madrid to stand trial on charges
of torture dating from his authoritarian rule of Chile from 1973-90
in which more than 3,000 people died or disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to ambassadors of the four countries released
Thursday morning, Straw argued that the general's declining health
had produced a ``memory deficit'' that would have compromised his
ability to understand charges and direct his attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these impediments, Senator Pinochet would be unable to
follow the process of a trial sufficiently to instruct counsel,''
Straw said in his letter to the Spanish mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have had difficulty in understanding the content and
the implications of questions put to him and would have inadequate
insight into this difficulty,'' the letter continued. ``He would
have difficulty in making himself understood in replying to
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pinochet case will be remembered and cited long after its
swift and undramatic end Thursday. Its most significant legacy is a
fundamental change in international law that gives universal
jurisdiction to the prosecution of crimes that are considered human
rights atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has established beyond question the principle that those
who commit human rights abuses in one country cannot assume they
are safe elsewhere,'' Straw told parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Straw had first signaled his intention to make Thursday's move
in January after medical tests conducted by four British
specialists claimed that the general was unfit to stand trial.
Spain, France, Belgium and Switzerland challenged that finding, and
Straw was subsequently ordered by a three-judge panel of Britain's
High Court to send the four governments the records of the
examination.
</P>
<P>
   None of the governments or human rights organizations that had
mounted legal challenges to Pinochet's release pressed to bring an
appeal in the scant time available before Pinochet could leave
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There was clearly an effort to get him out of the country with
as little attention as possible. A convoy of police vehicles and
motorcycle outriders escorted the limousine carrying the former
Chilean dictator from the suburban enclave south of London where he
had been living and sped the 150-mile distance to the airbase.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet left the Surrey residential estate south of London by a
road that skirted the main exit, where protesters and the press
were camped out.
</P>
<P>
   In 5 a.m. darkness, the Chilean Air Force Boeing 707 that had
been parked at Brize Norton Royal Air Force Base in Oxfordshire
since late January flew unannounced to the Waddington field.
</P>
<P>
   In two decisions, the Law Lords of the House of Lords, Britain's
highest court, ruled that Pinochet was not immune from prosecution
even though he was head of state at the time that the alleged
crimes against humanity took place.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To rights groups, the rulings that emerged in the Pinochet case
amounted to a coming of age for international law, a framework that
has gradually shifted from the notion that states do not interfere
in each other's affairs to a belief that human rights transcend
domestic jurisdictions. Amnesty International said Thursday that
the case represented the greatest advance for international law
since the Nuremberg trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible disappointment for Pinochet's thousands of
victims that he will not face trial in Spain,'' said Reed Brody,
advocacy director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, which
has been among the groups pursuing the case. ``But the very fact
that he was arrested and that his claim of immunity was rejected
has already changed the calculus of dictators around the world. The
Pinochet case signified the beginning of the end of their
impunity''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That new principle has already seen its first application. Last
month, the former president of Chad, Hissene Habre, was arrested in
Senegal where he has been living in exile since 1990 and charged
with responsibility for political killings, torture and the
disappearances of opponents. The human rights groups that assembled
the evidence against Habre said they were drawing on the legal
precedent established in the Pinochet case.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was originally arrested on Oct. 16, 1998, while he was
in a London clinic recuperating from back surgery. British police
made their surprise move in response to an application from a
Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, seeking Pinochet's extradition to
Madrid to stand trial on charges of genocide, torture, kidnapping
and murder in connection with the disappearance of 3,197 people in
the years after he seized power in a coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, considered something of a maverick in the Spanish
judiciary, had gathered his evidence during an investigation into
the so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the 1970s. There was
no expectation at the time that his unorthodox move to arrest
Pinochet would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government, though forced by circumstance to pursue
the case, has shown little enthusiasm for the case from the outset,
and Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, said Thursday that,
``I will respect Straw's decision.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet won his first legal battle to overcome the charges in a
ruling by the High Court, which upheld his claim to sovereign
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   But in a ruling that was to create the case's legacy, the Law
Lords later overturned that decision, saying that being a head of
state did not excuse crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The case returned to the House of Lords after one of the
original judges, Leonard Hoffmann., was found to have had an
association with Amnesty International, a party to the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the second Lords' decision, on March 24, 1999, was even more
emphatic on the principle than the first, although it drastically
reduced the number of charges, narrowing the scope to torture and
conspiracy to torture. The case then moved on to the validity of
the actual extradition order itself, which was upheld by a London
magistrate last October and remained under appeal with a hearing
scheduled for this March 20.
</P>
<P>
   In the one appearance in court that Pinochet was obliged to
make, on Dec. 11, 1998, he maintained the defiant attitude he had
adopted from the beginning, saying that he did not recognize the
jurisdiction of any court outside Chile to try him and that he was
innocent of ``all the lies of Spain.'' He later described himself
as ``England's only political prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   At every hearing and court date, throngs of supporters and
opponents have angrily faced down one another from behind
barricades, trading taunts and jeers and displaying flags and
placards with accusatory slogans and pictures of missing friends
and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 months, the general has been living under 24
hour police custody with his wife Lucia in a rented mansion in one
of London's exclusive southern suburbs. He has had periodic visits
from Chilean supporters and other backers in this country, the most
visible and voluble of whom has been former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   She has argued that rather than holding him in custody, Britain
should extend its gratitude to Pinochet for the support he gave the
country in 1982 during the Falkland Islands war with Argentina.
``His reward by this government,'' she told reporters Thursday on
the steps of her Belgravia home, ``was to be held prisoner for 16
months.''

   Sela Ward has spent so much of the season suffering exquisitely
as Lily Manning on ``Once and Again'' that it's nice to see her
enjoying herself a little bit in the romantic comedy ``Catch a
Falling Star.'' Alas, here the suffering is left up to the rest of
us.
</P>
<P>
   Ward plays a petulant Hollywood actress who storms off a set on
location in New England after she catches her slick screenwriter
fiance in a dalliance with her stand-in. She winds up in a small
town, where she takes on her most challenging role _ a regular gal
_ and befriends some locals, including the hearty waitress with
some dreams (Rebecca Jenkins) and particularly the soft-spoken
fella (John Slattery) trying to keep the struggling steel mill from
going under. She comes to understand that the modest lifestyle
embodied in this town is more ``real'' than her Hollywood
theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Can you count the cliches in the last paragraph? Throw in some
sloppy plotting and character motivations, as well as hackneyed
scripting (He: ``You got a certain big-city something-or-other, but
not entirely! I like it!'' She, after they're smitten: ``I'm lost
without a script!''), and you have a production leavened only by
Ward's presence. Besides, ``Notting Hill'' did all this last year.
Falling star? Ward doesn't know the half of it. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Catch a Falling Star.'' &QL; 
What: Romantic comedy about a famous actress finding love in a
small town. &QL; 
Who: Sela Ward, Rebecca Jenkins, John Slattery, Jane Curtin. &QL;

`IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK 2': THROUGH THE YEARS, WOMEN WHO LOVE
WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)

<P>
   With white hair pinned on top of her head in old-fashioned
braids, Vanessa Redgrave gives one of the most exquisitely
understated performances of her career as a lesbian bereft of her
house as well as her heart's love when her partner dies.
</P>
<P>
   Though Marian Seldes is only on screen for four minutes in this
first segment of the trilogy ``If These Walls Could Talk 2,'' she
is every bit as eloquent as the lover whose relationship remains a
social taboo in their day, 1961.
</P>
<P>
   And Chloe Sevigny, in the segment set in 1972, is also
mesmerizing as a radically different character, a shirt-and-tie
wearing woman ostracized by lesbian feminists at the local college
who think she is selling out to the male world. In this layered,
sophisticated performance, Sevigny does not act like a man, but a
woman acting like a man.
</P>
<P>
   These matchless performances soar above the movie's predictable,
agitprop writing and self-satisfied attitude. The film, about three
lesbian couples, is a sequel to HBO's 1996 trilogy about abortion,
which was far more powerful dramatically (and remains its
highest-rated original movie).
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessor, ``If These Walls Could Talk 2'' concerns
women who live in the same house at different times. Yet as it
moves from the delicate Redgrave story to the more daring Sevigny
era and on to the present, in which Ellen DeGeneres and Sharon
Stone play a couple who want a child, each segment becomes more
didactic and proud of its very existence. It would be easier to
praise ``If These Walls Could Talk 2'' if the film weren't so eager
to praise itself.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the best segment comes first. With her Valkyrie
stride and demure housedresses, Redgrave's Edith is a picture of
dignity. Seldes, better known for playing witty divas, creates a
rich character in just a few perfectly created scenes here. In a
Dutch-boy haircut and pants, her Abby is a sweet-natured
bird-watcher.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with the women at the movies holding hands as
they watch the scene in ``The Children's Hour'' in which Shirley
Maclaine is horrified to realize she may, after all, be in love
with Audrey Hepburn. They walk home to the house they have shared
for 30 years and Edith makes tea while Abby fills a bird feeder in
the yard, creating a picture of such tender domesticity and
devotion that when Abby has a stroke and dies, viewers are likely
to feel the loss along with Edith.
</P>
<P>
   But that is when the episode, written and directed by Jane
Anderson (``The Baby Dance''), becomes blunt and begins to demonize
heterosexual society. Abby's nephew has inherited the house, which
was in his aunt's name, and Edith is cruelly dispossessed even
though she has paid half of the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   The nephew's materialistic wife rushes through the house
claiming precious figurines of birds from Abby's collection. Their
young daughter is sympathetic to Edith, clumsily making the point
that bias is taught, not innate.
</P>
<P>
   But through it all, Redgrave is a wonder of restraint. Though
Edith keeps her anger under wraps, we can see on Redgrave's
impassive face how deep her pain goes. When she sings ``Bye Bye
Blackbird'' over the image of an empty room at the end, she has
earned this heartbreaking moment and the audience's understanding.
</P>
<P>
   That first segment works because viewers feel inside the
characters' lives as well as their house. The second and third
stories feel voyeuristic, and not only because there they include
detailed sex scenes. Psychologically, we are looking at these
people from the outside, peering in through the window.
</P>
<P>
   The 1972 segment makes the point that prejudice exists even
within minority groups. Michelle Williams of ``Dawson's Creek''
plays Linda, a college student who goes with her lesbian housemates
to a local bar, where they scorn Amy ( Sevigny) and other
masculine-looking women. It is unsurprising that Linda falls for
Amy and learns it's OK to be tolerant of other kinds of lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   But Sevigny is fascinating to watch in a role that is the flip
side of the one she plays in ``Boys Don't Cry.'' In that film (for
which she got an Academy Award nomination), she is a young woman
who falls for a woman masquerading as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Here she is in the male role, with men's clothes, a motorcycle
and slicked-back Elvis hair. But with her shoulders held up broadly
and her pelvis thrust out, her exaggerated body language makes it
clear that Amy is a woman, not a woman trying to pass as a man.
</P>
<P>
   The third episode, written and directed by Anne Heche, is
strained and precious, and so overshadowed by her highly publicized
real-life relationship with DeGeneres that the segment seems one
more move in their personal public relations campaign. DeGeneres
and Stone's characters visit a sperm bank, try to buy sperm over
the Internet and sterilize a turkey baster, yet never escape their
real-life personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate that I can't get you pregnant,'' DeGeneres says. She is
so smug and pleased with herself for saying it that the character
disappears. Stone acts giddy in a role that seems its own public
relations gambit: she is Sharon Stone the movie star lending her
clout to an enlightened cause.
</P>
<P>
   The sex scenes in these last two segments are calculated to draw
attention as they head toward that murky line between respectable
cable and cable-in-the-middle-of-the-night. But the point the film
tries to make in its heavy-handed way is not about sex. HBO has
been promoting ``The Sopranos'' with a tag line that suits this
film better: ``Family Redefined.''

U.N. OFFICIAL CONCERNED ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The United Nations' top human rights official
expressed deep concern here Thursday over what she called a
``deterioration'' in China's human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about three areas: freedom of expression,
freedom of religion and freedom of association,'' said Mary
Robinson, the high commissioner for human rights, at a news
conference following meetings with senior Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   Her critical assessment came less than three weeks before the
annual session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission, starting on
March 20 in Geneva, where the United States is offering a
resolution censuring China's rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson declined to comment on the resolution. Her remarks here
may bolster the U.S. case, but the resolution has little chance of
passing, diplomats say, because China can muster a majority of
countries to oppose it as unwarranted meddling in its internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings Thursday with Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen and
other officials, Robinson presented her concerns about developments
over the last year and a half. These included the arrests and
lengthy prison sentences given to democracy advocates, what
Robinson termed ``a notable clampdown on religious expression,''
and the repression of labor organizers and the Falun Gong spiritual
movement.
</P>
<P>
   She gave the Chinese government a written report detailing
violations of international rights standards and listing numerous
individuals who have been imprisoned without fair legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time that Robinson spoke, the Foreign Ministry
said in a regular press briefing that only the people of China had
the right to judge whether their rights were worsening or
improving. ``The Chinese people are satisfied'' with the freedoms
they enjoy, said a ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzhao, calling on the
high commissioner to cooperate with China ``on the basis of mutual
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a former president of Ireland, was clearly mindful of
China's prickliness and offered praise for what she called the
country's continued progress in ``economic and social rights'' and
efforts to improve criminal procedures. But she was frank in her
critique of China's record in the core freedoms and legal
safeguards enshrined in international declarations.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had hoped for agreement this week on a long-discussed
program of technical cooperation with China, to study how its laws
and criminal practices can be brought into compliance with the two
international rights covenants that China has signed but not
ratified.
</P>
<P>
   No such agreement was announced Thursday, but Robinson said she
had been assured that the Chinese expect to sign on to the program
later this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robinson said she was encouraged that China's parliament had
begun discussions about the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights, which China signed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But she said no such progress was evident in the case of the
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed in 1998, and warned
that China would have to make wide-ranging changes to bring its
legal practices in line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
   Among other needed changes, Robinson said, China's notorious
system of ``reform through labor,'' in which accused criminals and
opponents of the state are sent to labor camps for up to three
years without a trial or basic legal protections, would have to be
phased out.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government's own figures, as of 1997 some
230,000 people were held in such labor camps, and the government
has given no public sign that it would seriously consider
abolishing the system.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said she had been alarmed to hear of proposals for a
new law to govern the reform-through-labor system, as though that
would raise its international legitimacy. ``Bad law can be a
tyranny,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was in Beijing attending a U.N. workshop on human
rights in Asia. The Chinese press on Thursday featured the workshop
as a sign of progress and carried President Jiang Zemin's message
of congratulations to the forum in which he praised the global
development of human rights _ in keeping with the cultural
traditions and needs of each country.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has made tremendous efforts on the human rights front,
and it has achieved successes that have astonished the world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after the U.S. State Department in its annual rights
report castigated China for regressing last year, China issued its
own report on human rights violations in the United States like
racism and the mistreatment of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   China's papers have prominently covered the controversial trial
in New York of police officers who shot to death Amadou Diallo, a
West African immigrant, and were acquitted of all charges.

 &HT;    Today's anchors might be the last of their breed
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ New millennium. New anchors. Count on it.
</P>
<P>
   The current troika of network anchors has reached the age when
most people think about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   None has indicated a desire to step down yet. All are energetic
news hounds. But sooner or later _ probably in the next five years
_ change will come for the first time in nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   An entire generation has grown up with Tom, Peter and Dan. It's
almost impossible to think of NBC, ABC and CBS newscasts without
them. Network news is so stamped with their personality and style
that a change at the top will fundamentally alter the broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newscasts are very definitely personality-driven,'' says
Ken Bode, former NBC and CNN political reporter and now the dean of
Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. ``That's
part of the reason they've been kept alive. The anchors are the
essential brand of those programs, not the newsgathering or the
presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   And today's anchors have been around a long time, in most cases,
longer than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The last anchor shake-up occurred in 1983, when Peter Jennings
became solo anchor of ABC's ``World News Tonight'' following Frank
Reynolds' death. That same year, Tom Brokaw took the reins of ``NBC
Nightly News'' after a brief partnership with Roger Mudd. The first
change in the current generation of anchors came in 1981 and was
the most profound. Walter Cronkite, the most trusted man in
America, departed a year ahead of schedule so that ``The CBS
Evening News'' could give Dan Rather the job. It was the end of an
era, a shift from avuncular to brash.
</P>
<P>
   That seismic shift, as dramatic as it was, successfully
established three new anchors, but it came at a time when
television news was a totally different beast. The evening
newscasts were the only game in town, reaching a whopping 72
percent of the viewing audience. CNN was in its infancy, and the
Internet wasn't a factor. Because of the dominance of network news,
it was easier for rising anchors to get the experience, credibility
and star quality they needed.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are three major cable news channels _ CNN, MSNBC and
Fox News _ and the combined network share of the audience for the
Big Three's evening news has shrunk to 46 percent. Internet news is
available in more than half of U.S. homes. With so many places for
viewers to get their news now, the influence of network news and
the people who report it has diminished, and nobody is emerging as
heirapparent to the anchors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard now to establish the kind of unique role that Dan
had coming up at CBS,'' says Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News.
``We have some terrific people coming up through the ranks, but
becoming the dominant reporter of your generation, the way Dan did,
is not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who are the designated successors? Surprisingly, nobody
officially and only one unofficially. A few years ago, NBC made no
secret of the fact that it was grooming Brian Williams to replace
Brokaw, now 60 and the youngest of the three. But then Brokaw,
nicknamed Duncan the Wonder Horse for his tireless work ethic,
either changed his mind or gently reminded his bosses he wasn't
ready to leave. Williams now anchors his own news program on NBC's
cable news outlet MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people coming up we feel very strongly about who would
be suitable heirs,'' says Bill Wheatley, vice president of NBC
News. ``Brian continues to get invaluable experience. He's
anchoring a high-quality national news program on MSNBC, and he has
been called upon numerous times to anchor for NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams is no longer the shoo-in he once was. Other names
bandied about include ``Today'' host Matt Lauer and ``Dateline
NBC'' host Stone Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   If the 68-year-old Rather decided tomorrow to take up fishing
fulltime at his Lake Travis getaway, who would replace him? White
House reporter and Sunday anchor John Roberts is the front-runner,
although not officially. Also mentioned are former White House
reporter Scott Pelley and Tim Russert, host of NBC's top-rated
Sunday morning program ``Meet the Press.'' Bryant Gumbel, anchor of
CBS's ``The Early Show,'' is a possible contender, too.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Friedman, executive producer of ABC's ``World News
Tonight,'' says that if Jennings were to quit today, ``Good Morning
America'' anchor Charles Gibson likely would get the nod _ although
perhaps not permanently. Gibson, as Friedman pointed out, is only
seven years younger than Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some grooming going on here, but there's still
time,'' Friedman says. ``Naming names makes it awkward, so I won't.
Besides, as smart as you are and hard as you try to plan these
things, it's never that neat. It's possible there are reporters
toiling away out there who will come to our attention and become
good anchormen.''
</P>
<P>
   If a woman is to join the next generation of network anchors,
ABC's Diane Sawyer seems the most likely candidate. After working
horrendous hours salvaging ``Good Morning America'' while
continuing her work on ``20/20'' at night, surely Sawyer deserves a
shot at the top job.
</P>
<P>
   However, Friedman was reluctant to confirm Sawyer as a
possibility, using the terms ``anchorman'' and ``anchor guy''
repeatedly. He says there's nothing wrong with having a woman
anchor, and viewers clearly like Sawyer. But he noted that Barbara
Walters' partnership with Harry Reasoner failed, as did Connie
Chung's brief tenure with Rather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe when the time actually comes to make that decision, they
will consider a woman,'' says Barbara Cochran, president of the
Radio-Television News Directors Association in Washington. ``It
seems to me that any network executive looking at talent will see
women who are very compelling and who have substantial experience.
There's clearly a role for a strong woman. Look at the prime-time
newsmagazines and morning shows. They all have women anchors who
make huge contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   It may or may not be coincidence that the network news divisions
are presided over by men. Perhaps in the future, a woman will
occupy one of those top spots, which could increase the chances of
a woman becoming solo anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Although most news executives refuse to name names of possible
candidates, they readily tick off qualities they will look for in
the next anchors. First and foremost, they want reporting
experience and lots of it, although there is no longer an emphasis
on print reporting. Rather is the last anchor to start out in
newspapers. The networks do want anchors whose TV reporting
includes a wide range of beats and locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives you an enormous background of knowledge, and that
adds to the credibility, which is so important,'' Friedman says.
``There's also the likability factor _ the feeling this is a decent
guy you'd like to talk to. I don't think blinding good looks is
critical. You just have to look decent and be a good
communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd think since anchors are so important to the newscasts, the
networks would be training and promoting the next ones. The fact
that they aren't has led some to wonder if the newscasts themselves
are heading for extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes time for Brokaw to retire, maybe they'll just
retire his jersey,'' says Northwestern's Bode. ``Maybe they'll say,
`We can't imagine continuing the broadcast without Brokaw, but we
do have MSNBC.' Brian Williams already has a show on MSNBC. They'll
have to examine very seriously whether there's any reason to
continue the network evening news.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, news executives think there will always be a
need for a dependable half hour that summarizes the day's events
and provides context.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newscasts aren't the overwhelmingly dominant voice they
once were,'' says CBS's Heyward. ``But there's still a strong need
for someone who can be the gatekeeper for all this information.
It's ironic that the same proliferation of choices that has eroded
the power of the evening news also has solidified the role, because
you need someone to make sense of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say the newscasts won't change. They've already
changed in the post-Cronkite era.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're no longer considered the broadcast of record,''
Heyward says. ``They've moved away from headlines and now place
much more emphasis on original reporting. Sameness once was almost
a virtue; now they all have to distinguish themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And they do that with standing features like CBS's ``Eye on
America'' and ABC's ``Cutting Edge.'' But the format is virtually
the same on all three, including an overview of the day's news, the
standing features and a single longer story. Since CNN and other
cable news networks specialize in the digest news, broadcast
networks are moving toward fewer but longer stories.
</P>
<P>
   Might there be a truly dramatic, formula-busting change when the
next anchors arrive?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, if not sooner,'' says ABC's Friedman. ``Somebody's going
to have to do it. ... It's a question of who's got the courage to
make the change, because you always lose in the short run, and then
you hope to hell you can build yourself back up and surpass where
you were.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with charismatic and richly experienced anchors,
network news is merely hanging on to a shrinking audience. With new
anchors, erosion is likely to worsen. In the past, the ratings
slide was temporary, but the next shift may be more profound. If
so, the next generation of viewers may have only a dim recollection
of the nightly news habit.

 &HT;    MEXICO CITY'S SCARY AIR: CLEANER, BUT STILL FILTHY
 &HT;    For Use Sat., March 4 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Shortly after the dawn of the new year, Mexican
authorities here proudly announced that in 1999 Mexico City had
experienced the cleanest air in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the city was choking on those words.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most polluted metropolises was again shrouded
in smog that clogged nasal passages, stung eyes and made throats
raw. For a few days in early February schools in the southeastern
part of the city were ordered to keep kids indoors to reduce risks
to their young, developing lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted mostly by skyrocketing levels of suspended particles _
microscopic solids in the air _ the government ordered some
industries to cut production by half, and used emergency laws to
pull more old cars off the roads. Officials completely shut down
more than 150 brick-making factories known to sometimes illegally
use old rubber tires as fuel.
</P>
<P>
   People crowded into emergency rooms with respiratory illnesses
as the levels of suspended particles soared to well more than
double what's acceptable for human health. Forest fires near the
city also contributed to the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's true that more than a decade's worth of reforms have
helped reduce some aspects of classic air pollution, said Adrian
Fernandez, the director-general of information and measurement
programs for Mexico's National Ecology Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't like to act too triumphant,'' he hastened to add.
``There is so much more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City and the Greater Valley of Mexico are cursed by a
ring of mountains that trap pollution inside a bowl teeming with
18.5 million people, 4.5 million vehicles and tens of thousands of
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are exposed to a sickening stew of car exhaust and
industrial emissions. Add to that the ingredients of soil blowing
from vast tracts of unpaved land and wind-borne fecal matter
dropped by legions of street dogs. The region's bone-dry winter air
makes pollution even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Relief usually comes only with the spring rains.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last year by the World Resources Institute, a
Washington, D.C.-based research group, estimated that Mexico City
may have the world's worst air for children under 5 years of age.
Researchers here are studying the damage pollution causes to kids;
meanwhile those residents who have the foresight and income buy air
filters and limit their kids' outdoors activities.
</P>
<P>
   When air pollution here began approaching apocalyptic levels in
the late 1980s, Mexico established one of the world's most
sophisticated pollution-monitoring systems and began to enact a
series of reforms. Last year, Fernandez said, measurements showed
that action had indeed paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Major contaminants like carbon monoxide, lead and sulphur
dioxide had dropped within normal levels with only a few exceptions
during 1999. As a result, the city experienced only five days of
full-fledged emergencies last year.
</P>
<P>
   What helped, Fernandez said, was the phasing out of leaded
gasoline use in Mexico. It was completely eliminated in 1997. Heavy
industrial oil, too, contains a third less sulphur now. Two power
plants and a number of other industries in the metropolitan area
have switched to the less-polluting natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   All cars produced in Mexico since 1991 have catalytic
converters. Because many Mexicans can't afford new cars, however,
only about 40 percent of vehicles are equipped with the
pollution-reducing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's 11-year-old ``Today You Can't Drive'' law pulls about
20 percent of the city's older cars off the streets every day. Five
years ago, officials decided to double the program whenever
pollution levels skyrocket as they did earlier this year, pulling
about 40 percent of old cars off the road during emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news, Fernandez said, is that ozone _ the product of
fuel emissions and sunlight - is still an alarming health hazard.
Ozone peaked and remained for several hours at levels considered
well above the healthy norm almost every day last year, Fernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone irritates noses, throats and eyes. People with colds, the
flu or chronic respiratory problems suffer diminished lung capacity
that leaves them gasping for air. When ozone is strong, illnesses
are prolonged and doctors report a higher number of patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day here seems more difficult, especially in the
winter,'' said Altagracia Flores, who is highly exposed to car
fumes six days a week in Mexico City while she sells newspapers at
a curbside stand. ``I've had a cold at least two times a month
recently and every day my eyes feel irritated. Headaches at this
time of year are also more common.''
</P>
<P>
   The other contaminant that still plagues Mexico City's air at
dangerously high levels are suspended particles, the product of
vehicle and industrial fuel emissions, dog droppings and soil
erosion from barren open space that's devoid of trees or grass.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended particles lodge in the lungs and cause acute or
chronic respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Reforestation projects have helped reduce suspended particles
originating from soil, Fernandez said, but the city still needs to
do more work to fill in bare patches of land.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mexico City started a crackdown on pet poop, but
disregard for the law is more common than compliance. And with more
than a million stray dogs roaming the city, it's hard for
maintenance workers to keep pace with the refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said ozone and suspended particles should decline as
more industries and vehicles in Mexico City convert to using
natural gas. Two large natural-gas underground distribution centers
are under construction now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to have a very positive effect,'' he said. ``In
five years, about 90 percent of medium and big industries will be
using natural gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, however, say the prediction is a wild one. At current,
only 12 percent of factories in the Valley of Mexico use natural
gas and two centers won't be enough to fulfill the needs of the
rest, said Luis Manuel Guerra, director of the non-governmental
National Institute of Ecological Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be at least 100 centers,'' said Guerra, a
long-time critic of the government who believes it has moved too
slowly and too inefficiently to curb pollution.
</P>
<P>
   If the government really wants to get serious about pollution,
he said, federal and city officials should team up to convert the
city's crazy-quilt system of above-ground mass transit to buses and
taxis that use natural gas. Right now, thousands of the
privately-owned mini-buses that careen through the city are some of
the worst contaminators.
</P>
<P>
   It costs at least $3,000 to convert a vehicle's gas tank to one
that can use natural gas, Guerra said. But the investment can be
recouped within a few months because the price of natural gas is
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Fernandez said, natural gas is heavily taxed in
Mexico, making it hard to persuade industries or vehicles to
convert. He's been wrestling with Mexico's Treasury Department over
proposals to reform the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra also suggested the government invest in the construction
of artificial lakes near clusters of industries so the humidity
could help capture suspended particles.
</P>
<P>
   Both Guerra and Fernandez agree that more enforcement of Mexico
City's existing environmental laws is also a must.
</P>
<P>
   At least half a million of the 4.5 million vehicles circulating
in the city haven't gone through mandatory smog-control testing,
Fernandez said. Mexico recently gave regular police, rather than
special environmental officers, the power to crack down on this
massive flaunting of the law.

UNIVERSITY SUSPENDS CLASSES TO PROTEST ARRESTS BY PALESTINIAN
FORCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Students and teachers at Bir Zeit University, the
leading Palestinian academic institution in the West Bank, on
Tuesday suspended classes indefinitely to protest arrests of
students by the Palestinian security forces.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests followed an incident on Saturday in which a crowd of
protesting students threw stones at Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of
France during a campus visit.
</P>
<P>
   They were angered by remarks Jospin made in Israel in which he
called attacks by Hezbollah, the guerrilla group fighting to oust
Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, ``terrorist acts.''
</P>
<P>
   The stone-throwing incident embarrassed the Palestinian
Authority. Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, apologized and
ordered an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday and Monday, Arafat's security forces rounded up dozens
of students in and around the university, setting up checkpoints on
approach roads and detaining suspected participants in the stoning
and others said to be active in campus political groups.
</P>
<P>
   Students who were later freed said that some detainees had been
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   After more student protests in West Bank cities against Jospin
and in support of the detainees, the Palestinian police chief, Maj.
Gen. Ghazi Jabali, banned demonstrations without prior police
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Fadel al-Khalidi, an official at Bir Zeit University's office of
student affairs, said 28 students remain in detention out of about
60 who were rounded up. He said students and teachers had suspended
classes until all are released, and that students were holding a
sit-in protest at the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The stone-throwing incident ``is an internal matter for the
university to resolve, without the intervention of the Palestinian
Authority's security forces,'' Khalidi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university will take the appropriate measures, but nothing
will be done until all the detainees are freed,'' he added. ``Those
students have the right to an education.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hind Abdeh, a spokeswoman for the Palestinian Preventive
Security Service in the West Bank, said agents had the right to act
because Jospin had been an official guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university belongs to the Ministry of Higher Education, so
it is natural that the authority should intervene,'' she said.
``The incident involved a guest of the Palestinian Authority.''

   Some other Orlando additions worth noting:
</P>
<P>
   _Disney's Epcot: Several millennium additions make this park
worth a stop before the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Tapestry of Nations parade _ held twice daily at 6:30 p.m.
and 8 p.m. _ is a moving spectacle of 20-foot-high puppets that
float and bob to tribal rhythms. The puppets are archetypal _ some
are fluid as butterflies, others are solid and metallic; drummers
pound on giant wheels of time. It's all clearly about the passing
of the age _ and just a darned good time.
</P>
<P>
   The new Illuminations fireworks at 9 each evening offers a
global blast _ somewhat literally. The earth glows and twirls
around the lagoon while sprays of flares and lasers keep time to a
momentous symphony commissioned just for the show.
</P>
<P>
   The new Millennium Village is a mix of displays, foods and
shopping from around the world. Unlike the Epcot countries, which
were created two decades ago, the new displays sparkle with
technology. In Brazil, for instance, you hold up a paddle to drive
a boat on the Amazon; in Saudi Arabia you can catch holograms in
your hand; in Israel you can ``fly'' over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   _Holiday Inn Family Suites: This new 800-suite motel, near
Animal Kingdom and other Disney Parks, is the next generation of
the popular Family Fun Suites Holiday Inn introduced in Orlando a
few years back. With almost 500 square feet, these new suites are
more spacious, offering separate rooms for parents, plus a sitting
area with a pull-out couch and kitchenette. Facilities include two
pools and a small fitness center, and there are frequent shuttles
to Disney parks.
</P>
<P>
   Suite themes include cinema suites (the spare bedroom includes a
60-inch screen and two comfy recliner chairs with drink holders), a
sweetheart suite (one bedroom plus a spacious heart-shaped
whirlpool tub), a large one-bedroom residential suite with full
kitchen, and a business suite (the spare room is converted to a

 &HT;    SENATE PANEL PASSES RESTRICTIONS ON FIGHTING COCKS
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Agriculture Committee on Thursday
approved an amendment to the Animal Welfare Act that would ban the
interstate shipment of fighting cocks from states where the sport
is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The committee approved the measure introduced by Sen. Wayne
Allard, R-Colo., on a voice vote. It now goes to the full Senate.
Similar legislation is pending in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Humane Society of the United States sees the legislation as
a major step toward banning the sport in all 50 states.
Cockfighting is legal only in Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased with the outcome of this vote,'' said
Wayne Pacelle, senior vice president of the Humane Society. ``We
are that much closer to eliminating the federal loophole that
provides a smokescreen for illegal cockfighting in the 47 states
where the practice is outlawed by state law.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-cockfighting legislation is ``hilarious,'' and Pacelle
is an ``obnoxious person who knows nothing about chickens,'' said
Tomas(cq) L. Booth, a breeder in Odessa, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you going to enforce it?'' asked Booth, owner of
Tommy(cq) Club, a cockfighting pit in Hobbs, N.M. ``Are you going
to send FBI agents to the borders and send a guy to the pen? You
can't even fight the interstate shipment of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Booth said that even though cockfighting has been illegal in
Texas since 1907, he estimates there are eight pits and 24,000
people who engage in cockfighting in the state, with 85 in Odessa
alone. He said the pits get 80 to 90 entries per week, including
some submitted by law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are friends with those guys, we elect them,'' said Booth.
He said he has never engaged in cockfights in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Booth said cockfighters rent hotels, motels or bars to stage
tournaments on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the size of the pit, Booth said, participants are
charged up to $500 to enter as many as seven chickens. Those with
the most successful cocks can win as much as $9,000 per night, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Booth said cockfighting is a ``good, wholesome family sport''
that George Washington and Abraham Lincoln were involved in.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of cockfighting say it's a bloody, barbaric
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The cock's natural spurs are cut off and replaced with
razor-sharp 1-inch blades known as a gaffs, said Pacelle.
</P>
<P>
   The cocks are given stimulants to heighten their aggression,
Pacelle said, and are placed in the 16-foot-square pit.
</P>
<P>
   Like boxers, the chickens deliver blows with the gaffs and use
their wings to block attacks. When one of the chickens falls or
doesn't defend itself, it is put on its feet by a referee. A
knockout is declared when a chicken is unable to stand on its own
three times.
</P>
<P>
   The chicken's lungs or other vital organs are punctured during
the cockfights, Pacelle said. He said a chicken sometimes loses an
eye in a fight, and when that happens, the one-eyed birds are often
matched in a fight known as a blinker derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that there are blinker derbies,'' said Booth.
``But it's very rare for their eyes to get poked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Booth said, ``I don't see you trying to ban boxing or football''
even though those are also barbaric and people are sometimes
killed. He added that in Texas, dogs that are not adopted are put
to sleep and burned in incinerators that people pay for through
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chickens don't have to worry about being golden brown or
extra crispy,'' Booth said. ``They can live to see their
offspring.''

 &HT;    Georgia writer finds France more friendly to noir works
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia writer Henry Joseph has not had much luck with American
publishers so far, but the French love him. Editions Gallimard, the
Paris company that published Albert Camus, has bought world rights
to six of Joseph's novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``My books are published in their Serie Noir collection,'' says
Joseph, 51, who lives on 19 isolated acres in northwest Georgia.
``The first two books, `Bloodwork: The New Rugged Cross' and
`Dinosaur Heaven,' got good reviews over there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bloodwork,'' the only one of Joseph's books published in the
United States, was released in 1994 by Gibbs-Smith. Now out of
print, the film rights have been optioned by My Girl Productions in
Florida. Carter DeHaven (``Hoosiers'') has been asked to develop it
as a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Georgia, ``Bloodwork'' opens with protagonist Jack Lee
finding his best friend hanging from a wooden cross and wearing a
crown of marijuana flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Next out in spring 2001 in France is ``The Well-Spent Death of
Eightball Barnett,'' which Joseph describes as a thriller about a
former political operative who retired under the stress of his own
guilt from a secret government outfit called The Unit. When he
learns he has a terminal illness, he sets out to right some of the
wrongs he has done under the guise of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the action in the novels takes place in Americana, the
location of the expatriate Confederate colony in Brazil. Joseph
spent a year and a half in Brazil and a year in India doing
research, working construction jobs and ``chasing the brass ring of
realization.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph is not the only author who had to go abroad to attract
attention in his native country. Atlanta writer Jim Grimsley's
first novel, ``Winter Birds,'' was published in Germany before
Algonquin Books bought the American rights.
</P>
<P>
   So why do the French like Joseph's novels more than American
publishers do? The French have always loved ``noir'' works, Joseph
says, ``and my books are pretty dark. For another thing, New York
publishing is dominated by corporate `suits,' which has led to an
even narrower middle-of-the-road stance, while my own work has
become more offroad. What I need to do here is to hook up with an
adventuresome editor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New award: Amazon.com has launched the PEN/Amazon.com Short
Story Award in collaboration with the PEN American Center. The
contest invites unpublished writers to submit original short story
manuscripts to compete for a grand prize of $10,000 and publication
at Amazon.com and in the Boston Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   The judging panel is composed of three PEN writers: David
Guterson, author of the award-winning ``Snow Falling on Cedars'';
Jamaica Kincaid, author of ``Annie John'' and ``Autobiography of My
Mother''; and novelist Sherman Alexie, author of ``The Lone Ranger
and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining 16 other PEN literary honors, the PEN/Amazon.com Short
Story Award will be presented at the annual PEN Literary Awards
Ceremony on May 15 at Walter Reade Theatre in New York's Lincoln
Center.
</P>
<P>
   To participate, writers must be over the age of 18 and residents
of either the United States or Canada. Manuscript submissions must
be postmarked on or before March 24. Additional award information
and a complete set of rules can be found at
www.amazon.com/shortstory.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nominations wanted: The Lindberg Awards Committee is seeking
nominees for next year's Stanley W. Lindberg Award, which
recognizes anyone who has contributed substantially to the literary
culture of Georgia through a lifetime body of work. Pat Conroy was
the first recipient of the award, established in 1999 in honor of
the late editor of the Georgia Review. Brief descriptions of
nominees and their work can be sent to Anne Johnson, Georgia Center
for the Book, 215 Sycamore St., Decatur, GA 30030.

PASSION AND PASSAGES WITHIN `THESE WALLS' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If these walls could talk, they'd probably be giggling instead,
along with Sharon Stone and Ellen DeGeneres in their lesbian sex
romp.
</P>
<P>
   Stone and DeGeneres dispense with their clothes and give viewers
equal parts passion and mirth in a bonfire of a sex scene Sunday
night, putting a celebratory exclamation point on ``If These Walls
Could Talk 2.''
</P>
<P>
   I see big numbers for HBO, and I hear VCRs churning, not
necessarily for the most correct reasons. The scene would be a TV
groundbreaker except for the fact that Chloe Sevigny (``Boys Don't
Cry'') and Michelle Williams (``Dawson's Creek'') have at each
other less than an hour earlier on the same program.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, HBO set a still-standing ratings record for its
original films with ``If These Walls Could Talk,'' about pregnancy
and abortion. This Sunday's show, executive-produced by DeGeneres,
is a trilogy of short films about lesbians and changing times.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a pleasure to say that ``If These Walls Could Talk
2'' is delightful, delovely and DeGeneres. But mostly it's
DeGeneres. She has become a gutsy, pioneering force in
entertainment since declaring her lesbianism and deciding to let
the hips fall where they may. Yet her talent usually runs a step
and a half behind her ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The idea here is to set the three stories _ each with separate
casts, writers and directors _ in the same house, which happens to
be occupied by lesbians in 1961, 1972 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The first short film is written and directed by Jane Anderson
(``The Baby Dance''). Vanessa Redgrave stars as a retired
schoolteacher who has been living discreetly with her lifelong
lover (Marian Seldes) and whose world unravels cruelly when Seldes
falls from a ladder and dies.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave is turned away from Seldes' hospital room because she
isn't ``family.'' Then, when Seldes dies, her patronizing nephew
and heir (Paul Giamatti) arrives with his smarmy wife (Elizabeth
Perkins) to claim the house Seldes shared for decades with
Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Martha Coolidge directs a story written by Sylvia Sichel
and set in 1972. Williams plays one of four college coeds, all
lesbian feminists, who now rent the house. Williams' attraction to
a butch lesbian (Sevigny) provokes trouble with Williams'
roommates, who belittle Sevigny's masculine trappings. It also
provokes a sort of crisis of conscience for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres and Stone are a couple living in the house in 2000, in
a comedic segment written and directed by DeGeneres' off-screen
partner, actress Anne Heche. They want to have a baby. When Stone
begins to ovulate, DeGeneres giddily dashes to the sperm bank.
</P>
<P>
   Heche's pun-filled script is light as helium and seemingly
pointless. It barely makes any feints toward fleshing out the two
main characters. But aside from its dishy sex scene with all the
writhing flesh and interlocked limbs _ quick, is that body part
DeGeneres' or Stone's? _ the segment surely does count as
affirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Time has passed since Redgrave's troubles; there are still
references to discrimination in 2000, but the Stone and DeGeneres
characters are living confidently and happily. It's not for nothing
that the two stars rock out at the end, dancing rollickingly over
the closing credits.
</P>
<P>
   The 1961 story is more affecting. If it had been better
directed, it would have been genuinely moving.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson isn't content with the worlds of repressed passion
in Redgrave's exquisite blue eyes. Instead she steers the segment
toward mawkishness, heavy-handedly demanding that the viewer feel
sorry for Redgrave's character. And you will, but you well might
resent being led to it by the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge's middle film is the best, the most complex and the
least self-conscious of the batch. The segment catches lesbianism
at a transitional time, with Williams' character realizing finally
that Sevigny must be herself _ coat, tie, slicked-back hair,
motorcycle and all _ rather than toe the feminist line.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if butch often comes in as svelte a package as
Sevigny, but I do know that hers is the most beguiling performance
in all of ``If These Walls Could Talk 2.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't butch as in masculine swagger. Sevigny's character is
quiet, utterly honest about who she is, and devastatingly sexy. The
backdrop is 1972, but there's something in Sevigny's sleek
self-assurance that smacks of 2000 more than the Stone-DeGeneres
silliness to come.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a romantic tension in the budding affair between
Sevigny and the naive Williams that ought to make this middle film
the real television trailblazer of the batch. When this pair reach
the sheets, the turn-on is too cool and too palpable to be about
the mere configuration of gender.

&HT;     RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT: A NASTY BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 5)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The men who would be president and, therefore, the
world's most powerful head of state have been called liars, cheats,
bigots, cowards and phonies.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Gore-Bradley love feast in Los Angeles last week, the
major presidential contenders prefaced their attacks on one another
with such soothing phrases as ``my good friend'' or ``he's a fine
fellow.'' Then they blasted the heck out of them.
</P>
<P>
   Running for president is a ``nasty, nasty business,'' Jesse
Ventura said last week. And having been a professional wrestler
before he was elected governor of Minnesota, Ventura is an expert
on such enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura says the presidential hopefuls should cease besmirching
the character of their opponents and limit themselves to
discussions of the issues that divide them.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans undoubtedly share that opinion. Of course,
many may derive a certain sinister pleasure from watching
presidential candidates rip one another to shreds. But most
probably recognize that their personal interests would be far
better served by an enlightened debate on such matters as taxes,
education, national defense, health care and America's stance in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the televised Republican debates of recent weeks, George
W. Bush and John McCain often spent an inordinate amount of time
arguing over which of them has indulged more in negative
advertising. On the Democratic side, Al Gore and Bill Bradley
wasted an excessive amount of time on the same issue before last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When the candidates themselves have refrained from besmirching
the character of their opponents, their surrogates have lunged into
the breach with vicious condemnations of opposing candidates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has blasted Bush for cowtowing to the religious right and
two of its patron saints, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, and
indirectly accused the Democratic candidates of paying homage to
racially divisive activists Al Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan. Gary
Bauer, who has supported McCain since withdrawing from the
presidential race, now has asked him to apologize for his remarks
about Robertson and Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   But, in truth, Robertson also should apologize for his unsavory
campaign oratory.
</P>
<P>
   When the McCain forces ridiculed Bush for speaking at South
Carolina's Bob Jones University, whose policies are racist and
anti-Catholic, the Texas governor first cried foul and then wrote a
letter of apology to Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, voters in Michigan and Virginia claimed to
have received telephone calls from McCain activists accusing Bush
of being anti-Catholic. Those calls presumably were retribution for
the ones made by Robertson and other Bush advocates attacking
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has asserted that Gore is dishonest and Gore has charged
that Bradley did little during his three terms in the Senate to
promote the causes he now champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans repeatedly promise to end the ``Clinton-Gore
regime'' in Washington, thus seeking to link the vice president to
Clinton's unsavory sexual adventures that denigrated the presidency
and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Where Bush once was expected to soar to the GOP nomination
without serious opposition, he now finds himself battling a
candidate whose direct manner of speaking has fired the imagination
of many Americans. McCain also has brought into the primaries
independents and Democrats who could provide the GOP with victory
in November.
</P>
<P>
   But the sinking of presidential contests into innuendo, gossip,
and lies is nearly as old as the republic.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a tradition that began in 1796 with the first
presidential clash between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams near the
end of George Washington's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Presidential Campaigns,'' Paul F. Boller Jr.
wrote: ``The first real presidential contest in American history
turned out to be exuberantly venomous. On both sides handbills,
pamphlets and articles in party newspapers denounced, disparaged,
damned, decried, denigrated and declaimed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boller added that Adams and Jefferson remained on good terms
and did not take active part in the campaign of sleaze. Adams won,
but four years later Jefferson defeated him and was elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign of 1804, when Jefferson sought a second term,
the Federalists asserted that he had made an attractive slave named
Sally Hemings his mistress and the mother of several of his
children. Jefferson did not publicly deny the accusation, but he
did do so in private letters to friends.
</P>
<P>
   If the DNA evidence we have today about Jefferson's possible
paternity of at least one of Hemings' children had been available
in 1804, he might have served only one term.
</P>
<P>
   In 1824, the fiery Andrew Jackson was denounced as an adulterer
and bigamist because he and his wife Rachel had married thinking
her first husband had obtained a divorce. He had not done so, and
that provided fuel for Jackson's many opponents. Once the first
husband did obtain a divorce, Jackson and Rachel were remarried.
</P>
<P>
   And so it has gone through the years. Abraham Lincoln, Franklin
D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Dwight Eisenhower,
Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan all have been subjected to brutal
attacks by their political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In the present battle for the presidency, it should be
understood that Gore sometimes exaggerates his credentials but he
is not a liar, Bush is not anti-Catholic, McCain is as good a
Republican as Bush but wants to reform his party, and Bradley
distinguished himself in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Elections permit the people to take part directly in choosing
the men and women who determine the fate of the republic. But the
quadrennial presidential pageant is the World Series, Super Bowl
and Kentucky Derby of politics, and its participants should not
descend into the gutter to gain votes and money.

SIGOURNEY WEAVER TAKES CHARACTER DOWN COMPLEX PATH IN `MAP OF THE
WORLD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alice (Sigourney Weaver), the heroine-narrator of the film
version of Jane Hamilton's 1994 novel, ``A Map of the World,''
tells us in its opening moments that we are about to witness a
woman's descent into a living hell. The boast turns out to be no
exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   The over-stressed, under-appreciated wife of a Wisconsin farmer,
Alice hates her life from the start: Her oldest daughter is an
incomparable brat (``I don't even like her,'' she confides to a
friend), her mother-in-law (Louise Fletcher) is a meddler, and she
hates her job as nurse at the local grammar school.
</P>
<P>
   But things get considerably worse for her when the young
daughter of her best friend (Julianne Moore) is accidentally
drowned in the pond on Alice's farm while under her care, and the
crushing guilt Alice feels brings her to the raw edge of a nervous
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Then the trampy waitress mother (Chloe Sevigny) of a troubled,
possibly abused, little boy comes forward with the accusation that
Alice has been molesting her son; Alice is arrested (with bail set
so high she can't get out of jail) and suddenly finds herself in
the midst of a McMartin/
</P>
<P>
   Wenatchee-style witchhunt.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this film truly chilling is the fact first-time
feature filmmaker Scott Elliott and his writers somehow make every
step of this descent harrowingly believable, and somehow strangely
predestined by various quirks in Alice's character and her overall
dissatisfaction with her
</P>
<P>
   lot.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Weaver's unflinching performance, Alice is, through
most of the film, as unique, fascinating and complex a woman
character as I've seen in a Hollywood movie in some time _
especially in the sequences when she finds that she actually likes
being in jail (``Haven't you ever wanted to be on a desert
island?'').
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it all moves to one of those transcendent, happy
resolutions calculated to have us leave the theater feeling somehow
uplifted by Alice's ordeal. It's highly unconvincing, and a total
non sequitur to all the horror that's preceded it. This is a story
that, for honesty's sake, cries out for an ending as dark as that
of Strindberg's ``Miss Julie.''
</P>
<P>
   One more complaint: The film's many laudatory references to
Oprah Winfrey are also annoying. Granted, being chosen (as ``Map of
the World'' was) an Oprah Book Club novel is considered more
prestigious these days than winning a Pulitzer Prize. But is this
woman really so powerful now that authors and filmmakers feel
compelled to fill their work with cloying tributes to her glory?
</P>
<P>
   A Map of the World. Directed by Scott Elliott. Screenplay by
Peter Hedges and Polly Platt. Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Julianne
Moore, David Strathairn, Louise Fletcher. First Look Films. 127
minutes. Rated R for sexual themes.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli forces killed three suspected Palestinian
terrorists Thursday in a clash in an Arab town in northern Israel,
averting what Prime Minister Ehud Barak said was a plan ``to
sabotage the peace process'' with bomb attacks on Israeli
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Explosions and gunfire punctuated a pre-dawn raid on a two-story
house in Taibeh, an Israeli Arab town southeast of Nazareth, where
authorities said a group of at least five Islamic militants from
the Gaza Strip were preparing explosives for use in Israeli cities.
</P>
<P>
   One man surrendered during the raid, but another two emerged
with weapons and a suitcase that exploded when it was hit by police
fire, according to a police account. The two men were instantly
killed in the explosion, according to the report. A police officer
wounded in the blast later had his foot amputated.
</P>
<P>
   A third man in the house was shot after opening fire on Israeli
troops some 12 hours later. Another may have escaped, but police
Thursday night were searching the ruined building for bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Police, reinforced by counter-terrorist army troops, surrounded
the house in a siege that lasted most of the day and was marked by
sporadic explosions and gunfire. The security forces sent dogs into
the house _ one was killed _ followed by a bomb-sweeping robot. The
stand-off ended when police smashed into the house with an armored
bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, appeared to
corroborate the claim that the dead men belonged to his militant
Islamic group. ``The fall of the martyrs is not a loss, but a
victory for the movement and the Palestinian nation,'' he said in
an Israeli television report from Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
   Their willingness to risk death shows that ``the way is open for
the continuation of the jihad'' against Israel, Yassin said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's raid appears to provide further indications of the
increasing difficulties faced by Hamas in mounting terrorist
operations in Israel. As one Israeli general recently noted, 1999
was the first year in recent times without a single Israeli
civilian casualty from terrorism _ an achievement he attributed in
part to improved intelligence cooperation with the Palestinian
Authority. Israeli and Palestinian security forces have claimed
credit for foiling other alleged Hamas terror plots in the past
year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials in the Palestinian Authority echoed Israeli charges
that the men were Gaza-based members of Hamas. According to Israeli
radio, Israeli police ``are investigating the possibility that they
had help from Israeli Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arab mayor of Taibeh said the occupants of the house arrived
recently and were not known to local residents. He convened the
town council Thursday to discuss a possible prohibition against
renting local properties to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the Right won't use this to eviscerate the
residents of Taibeh,'' said Issam Asaweh, the mayor, speaking in
Hebrew to Israel Radio. ``We have no connection to this. All the
residents condemn this.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's incident took place against a backdrop of rising
tension between Israeli Arabs and the country's Jewish majority. In
a 60-53 vote Wednesday, the parliament endorsed an opposition
motion requiring any referendum on a withdrawal from the Golan
Heights to pass by an absolute majority of all eligible voters _
not just a majority of those who vote on the referendum. Backers
and opponents of the measure said it is intended to neutralize the
impact of Israeli Arabs, who represent some 10 percent of the
electorate and strongly favor a land-for-peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Arab members of parliament have engaged in
increasingly bitter exchanges on a wide range of other divisive
issues, from Israel's nuclear weapons program to Foreign Minister
David Levy's threat to respond in kind to cross-border terror
attacks harming Israeli children. Some Jewish lawmakers challenged
their Arab counterparts' patriotism, and questioned their right to
take part in the parliament of a Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Tibi, one of 10 Arabs in parliament and a Taibeh native,
condemned both the apparent use of his home town as a terrorist
base, and suggestions from some in the Israeli right that
townspeople were implicated in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know all the facts yet,'' said Tibi, referring to
reports that the men belonged to a Gazan terrorist cell. ``But if
it turns out that this is the case, they have made a big mistake,
for us, for themselves, and for the Palestinian cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians must recognize ``the special status'' of Israeli
Arabs as Israeli citizens and a vulnerable minority in a Jewish
state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taibeh lies in the heart of a primarily Arab region of northern
Israel, and its use as a Hamas base would represent further
evidence of a change in strategy for the radical Palestinian
dissidents. Hamas had long avoided compromising Israeli Arab
communities with terrorist activities or recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   But in September, two simultaneous abortive car bombs _ one in
Tiberias, killing the driver, and another in Haifa, killing the
driver and a passenger _ provided evidence of Hamas infiltration of
Israeli Arabs. Police said the bombs were intended for use on
public buses and had been prepared with the aid of Israeli Arabs
recruited by the Hamas office in Amman, which was shut down shortly
afterwards by the Jordanian government.

`NEXT BEST THING' ISN'T MADONNA'S ACTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At some point, Madonna is going to have to face the hard fact
that her particular stardom just doesn't translate well to
feature-length, narrative-based motion pictures. After 15 years of
trying, she still can't transcend her limitations.
</P>
<P>
   She's the queen of music videos, and she's been very effective
playing an extreme caricature of herself in films such as
``Desperately Seeking Susan'' and ``Dick Tracy'' _ and in the movie
version of ``Evita'' (essentially an album of music videos).
</P>
<P>
   But when she tries to play a normal, everyday human being _ as
she does in her latest splashy star vehicle, ``The Next Best
Thing'' _ she's fairly hopeless: not exactly terrible, but
noticeably weak, strained and unconvincing in scene after scene.
</P>
<P>
   She plays Abbie, a single, 40ish yoga instructor with a bad
romantic track record and a fiercely ticking biological clock who _
after one drunken fling _ finds herself unexpectedly pregnant by
her gay best friend, Robert (Rupert Everett).
</P>
<P>
   They move in together, have the child and become exemplary
parents and a more or less happy family _ except for the fact that
Abbie has no sex life, and finds herself unaccountably jealous of
Robert's brief sexual relationships with various men.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to six years later, and the rest of the movie deals with the
crisis that arises when Mr. Right (Benjamin Bratt) _ a handsome,
sensitive, affluent and incredibly straight investment banker _
comes into Abbie's life and this family unit is imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the movie has good intentions and the element of
surprise _ it's never quite clear where it's going at any given
point _ and noted veteran director John Schlesinger (``Darling,''
``Midnight Cowboy'') gives the proceedings a reasonably delicate
touch.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a slightly deeper version of his character in ``My Best
Friend's Wedding,'' Everett also steals almost every scene: he's
funny, self-deprecating and enormously sympathetic in the
distinctive way that's become his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Ropelewski's script is basically a piece of Hollywood
fluff: it trivializes the issues it raises, is rigidly dogmatic in
its political correctness (so, in the last act, Abbie becomes a
stock heavy) and it fails to find any real drama in the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The film also has the handicap of Madonna. You have to admire
her determination, and the vulnerability she exposes _ especially
in a scene that deals with her aging. But she just doesn't have the
kind of charisma that can carry a movie, and she always seems to be
trying too hard.
</P>
<P>
   The Next Best Thing. Directed by John Schlesinger. Written by
Thomas Ropelewski. Cast: Madonna, Rupert Everett, Benjamin Bratt.
Paramount. 107 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual references.

 &HT;    PANEL OUTLINES PLAN TO PROTECT CORAL REEFS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At least 20 percent of the nation's threatened
coral reefs should be declared ``no-take'' ecological reserves by
2010, a federal-state task force said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely critical that we act now,'' said D. James
Baker, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the co-chair of the task force, made up of 11
federal agencies, five U.S. territories, Florida and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for establishing ``no-take'' ecological marine
reserves in at least 5 percent of each major U.S. island group and
Florida by 2002, 20 percent by 2005, and 20 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Human activity in these areas would be restricted, and in some
cases prohibited. The location of the marine reserves would be
jointly set by the federal and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed,
mostly by recent human contact. At the present rate, another 30
percent could be gone within 20 years and roughly 70 percent by
mid-century, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the destruction is caused by anchors crushing the
fragile coral skeletons or pollution killing the microscopic
plant-like organisms that build them, the task force concluded that
since most of the threats are man-made, they can be reduced or
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coral reefs cover about 6,500 square miles, roughly the
size of Hawaii. More than 90 percent are located around U.S.
islands in the Pacific, and the remainder are located off Florida,
Texas and the U.S. island territories in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   They are a source of tourism, fishing and _ increasingly _
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you protect the coral reefs, you are protecting the
economy, you are protecting jobs,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida Keys, for example, the coral reefs are
responsible for about $1.2 billion a year in tourism-related
business such as diving tours, fishing trips, and hotel and
restaurant activity.
</P>
<P>
   Often called the ``rain forests of the sea,'' coral reefs are a
high priority for the Clinton administration, said George T.
Frampton Jr., acting chairman of the White House Council on
Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   This year's budget includes $21 million for coral reef
protection, and President Clinton has requested $25 million for
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Greg DiDomenico, executive director of the Monroe County
Commercial Fishermen Inc., whose territory includes the Florida
Keys, said it was too soon to determine the impact of the marine
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it keeps us from fishing in areas where we have been
historically for 20 or 30 years, it will have a major impact, but
it depends on the places they're talking about,'' DiDomenico said.

`AGNES BROWNE' DANCES TO A LIGHTER BEAT THAN `ANGELA'S ASHES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anjelica Huston's big-screen directorial debut, ``Agnes
Browne,'' is a chronicle of an imperiled Irish family that could
almost be described as a benevolent, feel-good version of
``Angela's Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the earlier film, this one is a period piece whose title
character is a chain-smoking mother (Huston) of a large Irish brood
forced to cope with poverty, ignorance, loan sharks and the lack of
a husband.
</P>
<P>
   But while ``Angela's Ashes'' was as relentlessly bleak a view of
the Irish as has ever been put on celluloid, ``Anges'' has nothing
but affection for its characters and fondness for their quirkiness.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1967 and based on a popular radio series and novel by
Brendan O'Carroll, it picks up Agnes' story as her husband has just
died and _ her widow's pension held up by bureaucracy _ she has to
go to the neighborhood loan shark, Mr. Billy (Ray Winstone), to pay
for the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the episodic script traces her struggles to make ends
meet as a street vendor, her various child-rearing problems, her
relationships with the Church and her Market Street Dublin
community, and her budding romance with a shy French baker (Arno
Chevrier).
</P>
<P>
   Huston's performance is winning, and she also does a more than
credible job of handling her other actors and situations _
especially Agnes' finely drawn friendship with her next-door
neighbor, Marion (Marion O'Dwyer), which is gradually shown to be
the most profound relationship of Agnes' life.
</P>
<P>
   The film's vision of Ireland is not exactly ``The Quiet Man,''
and we do catch glimpses of ugliness throughout the story, as well
as a certain ignorance of sexual matters that is more sad than
funny. But it balances this dark strain with humor, and many
instances of noble self-sacrifice and the kindness of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The film's one drawback is that Huston can't quite bring off her
fairy tale ending involving the singer Tom Jones (with Jones
clumsily playing himself 33 years ago).
</P>
<P>
   It really doesn't work and almost seems to trivialize the story,
leaving us with the uncomfortable feeling that we've just viewed
some episode of a TV sit-com of the era.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes Browne. Directed by Anjelica Huston. Screenplay by John
Goldsmith and Brendan O'Carroll. Cast: Anjelica Huston, Marion
O'Dwyer, Niall O'Shea, Ray Winstone, Arno Chevrier. USA Films. 92
minutes. Rated R for language.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Suiting up for the GOP debate
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warming up for Thursday night's Republican debate in Los
Angeles, John McCain vowed to get past discord over religion and
turn to issues. An increasingly confident George W. Bush worked to
create a sense of inevitability. ``When I'm the nominee, I'm going
to set the tone for the party,'' he said. Thursday's debate is the
final GOP match-up before Super Tuesday, when voters in 13 states
choose Republican delegates. California is the largest prize. Bush
and Alan Keyes will be in person in Los Angeles; McCain plans to
participate via satellite from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE SPARRING BEFORE THE REAL THING
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and John McCain struggled for a late advantage
Thursday heading into the debate. McCain protested an ad suggesting
he opposes breast cancer research and called on Bush to ``get out
of the gutter.'' Bush said the ad only described a proposal on
McCain's own Web page, and added, ``It sounds like Senator McCain
is becoming increasingly angry as the campaign goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   LIKE OLD PALS UP THERE ON STAGE
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of their 90-minute debate, Al Gore and Bill
Bradley reacted in striking contrast to their earlier encounters.
Bradley was remarkably subdued after months of aggressiveness, and
he and Gore expressed agreement on most issues and statements.
After coast-to-coast red-eye flights, both shifted their attention
to the East and New York's crucial primary next week. Gore boarded
an overnight flight to New York, to be followed by visits to
Maryland, Florida, Georgia and Massachusetts. Bradley also flew
east to campaign in New York, Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island.
His campaign has virtually given up on California, where polls show
Gore with a massive lead.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY GOES UP AGAINST `ER'
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley will lay out his case for the presidency in an
unusual five-minute ad airing nationwide Thursday. The spot is
scheduled for broadcast on CBS at 10:54 p.m. PST and EST (9:54 CST
and MST).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Bradley speaking personally to voters about his vision
for the country and the basis of his candidacy and why he would be
a better president,'' said spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
   OPENING A DOOR FOR THE NEXT GERALDINE FERRARO
</P>
<P>
   John McCain said Thursday that the time might be right for a
woman to serve in the White House. At a town hall meeting in
Riverside, Calif., McCain hinted that if he wins the GOP
nomination, he would consider a woman to be his running mate. ``It
would be very legitimate to have a woman vice president,'' McCain
said. ``And perhaps, in the next cycle, a woman president.''
</P>
<P>
   STRONG BONDS
</P>
<P>
   In what he called an emotional reunion, John McCain held a
colorful rally in a large and friendly Vietnamese community that
harkened back to McCain's term as prisoner of war. ``It was my
experience with you that was the defining period of my life,''
McCain told the Vietnamese crowd of about 1,000 in the ``Little
Saigon'' neighborhood. For Hinh Nong, the choice of whom to back in
the GOP presidential race is simple. ``We would still be in North
Vietnam without him,'' said Nong, who spent 18 years as a prisoner.
``There's a bond,'' said Tam Ngoc Ho, a prisoner for 13 years. ``He
was a prisoner like we were.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN EVENT GETS MARINE ATTENTION
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps brass were up in arms Thursday over a cordon of
color guards that participated in a rally for John McCain in
Bakersfield, Calif. McCain stood with a four-man Marine color
guard, all in uniform. But military personnel are not permitted to
participate in political campaigns. Gen. James Jones, the Marine
Corps commandant, reportedly is incensed. He feels the matter is
very awkward for the Corps, according to ABC News, because he
served as a liaison officer to the Senate and knows McCain
personally. There's no evidence of Pentagon involvement.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON, MONDALE GOING WITH GORE
</P>
<P>
   Just prior to the debate, Jesse Jackson endorsed Al Gore.
Jackson said Gore was best able to help Americans continue the
longest period of economic growth in U.S. history. In Minneapolis,
1984 Democratic nominee Walter Mondale said Thursday that he
promised Gore his support recently ``and I guess I'm announcing it
now.'' Mondale plans to appear with Gore in Minnesota next week.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT TIME, PLAY A SAXOPHONE
</P>
<P>
   Stumping for votes on late-night talk shows, George W. Bush and
John McCain tried to entertain, but couldn't match Bill Clinton's
flashy 1992 musical appearance on ``The Arsenio Hall Show.'' Bush,
on David Letterman's show, and McCain, on Jay Leno's, attempted to
turn the comedic tables, but their efforts met with only lukewarm
results.
</P>
<P>
   GET THOSE PHONES OUTTA HERE!
</P>
<P>
   Before the Democratic debate began in cell phone-addicted Los
Angeles, moderator Bernard Shaw laid down the law to the in-studio
audience: Shut the devices off. A great stirring followed in the
audience, as dozens of people reached for their phones. Also on
Shaw's list of no-no's were pagers, signs, ``outbursts'' and
``demonstrations.'' There was one infraction, however: A cell phone
rang during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ON SECOND THOUGHT, BAUER DOESN'T LIKE IT
</P>
<P>
   After first standing by him, conservative activist and former
presidential candidate Gary Bauer urged John McCain to retract and
apologize for critical statements about conservative religious
leaders Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. ``I must in the strongest
possible terms repudiate Senator McCain's unwarranted, ill-advised
and divisive attacks on certain religious leaders,'' Bauer said in
a statement. ``Senator McCain must not allow his personal
differences with any individual to cloud his judgment.'' McCain
said he was ``not backing away from the speech.''
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT EVANGELISTS, DIFFERENT RESPONSES
</P>
<P>
   One of the two religious leaders whom John McCain suggested was
among ``the forces of evil'' is coming to his defense. Jerry
Falwell told a television station in Roanoke, Va., that he doesn't
believe McCain ``hates Christians or hates anybody.'' But the
candidate was criticized by prison evangelist Charles Colson, whom
McCain had praised. In an opinion piece in the New York Times on
Thursday, Colson, a former Nixon White House aide, said by
``exploiting'' Bush's visit to Bob Jones University to gain
Catholic votes, McCain abetted Democrats who want to ``drive a
wedge'' between Catholics and evangelical Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   BE SURE TO KEEP SPENDING IN CHECK, OK?
</P>
<P>
   Except for George W. Bush, the presidential candidates will be
able to spend $40.5 million to seek their parties' nomination.
Candidates who receive federal funds must limit their spending;
Bush, who spent a record $50 million through Jan. 31, is not
accepting federal funds. The Federal Election Commission put the
primary campaign spending limit at $40.5 million, plus an unlimited
amount for certain legal and accounting expenses. Once nominated,
the candidates each will be able to spend $67.6 million on the fall
campaign. Bush, if nominated, is considered likely to accept
federal funds for the general election. The figures are based on
1974 limits, adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   MOVEMENT BACK TOWARD THE CENTER
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, already backed by an unwavering bloc of
conservative voters, has started to go after John McCain's base of
support, appealing to moderates and independent voters by
emphasizing the compassionate side of his conservative message and
stressing issues with broad appeal, such as education. By stressing
the more moderate elements of his agenda, Bush can appeal to more
middle-of-the-road Republican voters in New York and New England
while also beginning his campaign against Al Gore, the likely
Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   HEADS THEY WIN, TAILS THEY WIN
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two companies or individuals made six-figure donations to
both the Republicans and Democrats last year, with AT&AMP;T the leading
corporate contributor, the advocacy group Common Cause reported.
``They give this money for one simple reason,'' said Common Cause
president Scott Harshbarger, ``They want something in return.''
AT&AMP;T, which gave $555,350 to the Democrats and $761,908 to the
Republicans, has opposed efforts to open its cable lines to
competing Internet providers and has fought requests by the Baby
Bell operating companies to offer long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DO WE DO WITH SEAT BELT LAWS?
</P>
<P>
   After a first-grade girl was shot to death in a Michigan school,
George W. Bush struck a delicate balance on the politically
sensitive issue of childproof trigger locks. ``I hope people use
trigger locks,'' he said. But he stopped short of actively calling
for such a measure. He questioned whether trigger-lock laws could
be enforced, and talked about ``trigger lock police knocking on
peoples' doors, saying, `Show me your trigger locks, please?'''
</P>
<P>
   GUNS AND MONEY AND HYPOCRISY CHARGES
</P>
<P>
   As fatal shootings in Michigan and Pennsylvania were capturing
headlines, the rival New York Senate campaigns of Hillary Clinton
and Rudy Giuliani, both supporters of gun control, accused each
other of hypocrisy on gun violence. She had accepted a $1,000
contribution from rap artist Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, who was charged
with gun possession after a nightclub shooting; he accepted a
$1,000 contribution from Charlton Heston, president of the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS AND AIRPORTS AND CRIMINAL CHARGES
</P>
<P>
   Peter Malvey, 34, of Barrington, N.H., who described himself as
a bodyguard for Alan Keyes, was arrested at JFK Airport in New York
for carrying a gun without a proper permit. Officials said Malvey
was at an airline terminal and handed authorities a Glock
semi-automatic pistol. Malvey was arrested on unlawful possession
charges. Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman said Malvey denied
he was carrying any other weapons, but a luggage search found
another pistol, 29 rounds of .40-caliber ammunition, and 109 rounds
of .223-caliber ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN AND JEWS SWINGING TO GIULIANI
</P>
<P>
   A statewide poll in New York released Thursday said Rudy
Giuliani, riding support from white women and Jewish voters, has
taken the lead over Hillary Clinton. The poll from the Quinnipiac
College Polling Institute (3 percentage point margin of error) had
Giuliani ahead 48 percent to 41 percent. But Giuliani leads 51
percent to 37 percent among white women and 48 percent to 38
percent among Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   A REFORMER WITHOUT RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan says he would be
the only true reformer in the race for the White House if John
McCain's and Bill Bradley's campaigns fail. ``I think when Bradley
and McCain fade away, there's only one reform candidate in the
race,'' Buchanan said Thursday. ``There's only one Reform Party,''
he added. ``We will have an agenda of reform that is broader and
deeper than any we've seen this year.''

   Check-In Time
</P>
<P>
   After the success of Metrotech, the office complex in downtown
Brooklyn, N.Y., known for its dedication to showcasing public art,
its developer, Bruce C. Ratner, is once more trying his hand at
creating environments that focus on contemporary art. This time
Ratner is installing art in two new Manhattan hotels opening this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a burning desire to own art, but I like the idea
of art in public places,'' said Ratner, chief executive of Forest
City Ratner Cos., an affiliate of Forest City Enterprises, based in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Forest City Ratner Cos. have invested $5 million in buying and
commissioning new works by artists like Sol LeWitt, Tom Otterness,
Pat Steir and Kurt Kauper. As he did when planning Metrotech,
Ratner collaborated with the nonprofit Public Art Fund, which
organizes displays of art around the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to create a model for other buildings and to
expand the audience for contemporary art,'' said Susan K. Freeman,
president of the Public Art Fund. She said visiting these hotels
would be like spending ``a day in a gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   Art will be everywhere: in each guest room and in public spaces
like lobbies, restaurants and corridors.
</P>
<P>
   For the Embassy Suites Hotel, at 102 North End Ave. in Battery
Park City, LeWitt has created an 11-story mural, 80 feet tall and
130 feet wide, that will dominate an atrium. Called ``Loopy Doopy
(Blue and Purple)'' it is one of the his wall drawings, this one of
undulating lines in cobalt blue and deep purple. The work, painted
on a series of 460 panels, was fabricated in a 20,000-square-foot
warehouse at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
   Stier has been commissioned to create a series of murals for the
Embassy Suites. The largest will be at the ground-level entrance,
and she will also provide murals for the hotel's two restaurants.
The mural in the lobby will have a deep-red line tracing the
history of drawing from pre-Columbian markings through contemporary
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting rooms and guest rooms will have prints by artists
including Roy Lichtenstein, Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Art for the Hilton Times Square, at 234 W. 42nd St., has
purposely been selected for its theatricality, Freedman said. The
marquees for the hotel's entrances on 41st and 42nd Streets will
feature the work of Otterness, a sculptor whose works are among the
most popular at Metrotech.
</P>
<P>
   He is once again using his signature Lilliputian bronze figures,
which will appear to be trying to topple a giant clock that tips
precariously from the marquees toward the sidewalk. His
rambunctious characters continue inside the hotel, with a host of
bronze figures, from diminutive tourists to larger-than-life
moguls.
</P>
<P>
   The ground-floor entrance will feature large-scale photographs
of old Times Square theaters taken by Andrew Moore. The figurative
painter Kurt Kauper has been commissioned to create paintings for
the lobby and a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   A number of artists have been asked to create prints for the
hotel rooms, including well-known names like Mary Heilmann and
Elizabeth Peyton and some lesser-known artists like Sara Sosnowy,
an abstract painter. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Off the Wish List
</P>
<P>
   Last month the National Gallery of Art in Washington announced
that it would exhibit works from the collection of Barney A. and
Pam Ebsworth, St. Louis collectors of American art. Ebsworth, who
retired as the chairman of the travel company Intrav, has donated
several works to the museum over the years. It was understood when
the exhibition was conceived that more donations would be
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as no surprise that this week the gallery has
received three more works from Ebsworth's collection: paintings by
Charles Sheeler, Arthur Dove and Bob Thompson. His choice was based
on knowing what was on the gallery's wish list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barney was sensitive to chose works that would be important to
our permanent collection,'' said Earl A. Powell III, director of
the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheeler, ``Classic Landscape'' (1931), is the first of his
oils to enter the museum's collection and one of his best-known. It
depicts a scene from the Ford Motor Co.'s River Rouge Plant near
Detroit, which the artist visited in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   The Dove work, ``Moon'' (1935), is that artist's second oil on
canvas for the gallery. And Thompson's ``Tree,'' painted during a
stay in Paris in 1962 and derived from Goya's 1799 etchings ``Los
Caprichos,'' will be the first of his works to enter the museum's
holdings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prize by Design
</P>
<P>
   The latest trend among museums seems to be giving prizes. The
Tate Gallery's Turner Prize in London was the first. Then came the
Solomon R. Guggenheim with its Hugo Boss Prize. Just last month the
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art chimed in with its Webby Prize
for Excellence in Online Art.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Cooper-Hewitt, the National Design Museum that is part
of the Smithsonian Institution, has announced that it will be
giving National Design Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The annual prizes will go to five recipients whose work
demonstrates extraordinary vision and contributes to the nation's
quality of life. Unlike the other prizes, these carry no cash
awards. Winners will be chosen from a jury that includes David
Kelly, co-founder of IDEO, the largest industrial design concern in
the United States; the architect Daniel Libeskind; and Martha
Stewart, the home-design guru.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has also appointed a nominating committee of more
than 250 leading design professionals and architects.
</P>
<P>
   The five awards will be divided into three categories: a
lifetime achievement award, a corporate achievement award and three
design achievement awards given to individuals or companies for
exceptional work. Winners and their work will serve as the basis
for educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Design has been left behind over the years,'' said Kay
Allaire, a Cooper-Hewitt board member who is chairman of the
National Design Awards. ``We felt it was important to develop a
prize that would help give more national awareness to design.'' The
first winners are to be announced in November. &QL;

   Kusmierz noted that as people focus more on individual freedoms
and less on how their actions affect others, the dividing line
between haves and have-nots sharpens. ``As long as large segments
of society can't realize their definitions of the good life,'' she
said, ``programs like LARC will exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The voices heard around a hospital conference table last week
were authentic, all right, painfully so. Amid the sobering talk of
viral loads and T-cell counts, though, there was also laughter. And
that constituted a learning experience in itself.
</P>
<P>
   John Miller, a LARC patient from Dorchester, glanced at Richie
Moriarity, a sophomore from Maryland, and said that if he could
give these BC kids one gift, it would be ``an awareness of drug
addiction. Because there's always a line to cross, and I crossed
it. Once you cross it, you can't come back.''
</P>

   Moriarity smiled back. ``Being at BC gives you a warped sense of

so within the realm of larger social, demographic, political, and
economic contexts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what a margin is?'' asks Timothy Stratford in a
basement classroom of Braker Hall. ``No one?''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine students sit on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' says Stratford, writing ``THE MAGIC OF MARGIN'' on a
blackboard. ``Now, the whole premise of what I'm about to tell you
is that you should never do it, but it's crucial to know about.'' A
hand goes up. ``Yes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Greenspan said today he was unconcerned about margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Stratford laughs. ``Did he say why?'' he asks, tapping the
board. ``OK, here's my concern,'' continues Stratford. ``It's
buying stock with money you don't have. It's the biggest disaster
you can do. Mutual funds do it because they can get in and out of
stocks quickly. You can't. Any questions?''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began week six of an unusual course offered by Tufts
University's Experimental College. Call it Greenspan 101. From
calculating interest rates to shorting tech stocks, the course aims
to demystify the Dow while equipping students with the basics of
portfolio building. Chaucer? Organic Chem? Forget about it. The
cheer you hear is tuition-strapped parents yelling, ``Finally, a
course with a return on investment!''
</P>
<P>
   Stratford, an ex-bartender who logged 17 years as a broker, was
likewise cheered when 200 students showed up for the course last
spring, six times the number he could accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who don't get in beg me for a seat.'' says Stratford,
now teaching the course for the third time. ``If I were a broker
and 180 prospective clients showed up, I'd be thrilled. But I'm not
trying to sell them anything here.''
</P>
<P>
   The students, most of whom admit they don't know NASDAQ from
NASCAR, must write brief application essays. ``Like learning to fix
my car and cook a turkey,'' wrote one, ``learning about the stock
market is one of those goals that I've had for a while but haven't
gotten around to addressing.'' Gushed another, ``I only know that
those mysterious numbers that flash by right before the commercials
on the national news excite me more than any other possibility in
my life.'' Ah, youth.
</P>
<P>
   Two students have brought parents to class. Drew Carlton, a
senior from Shaker Heights, Ohio, took the course last fall. An
experienced day trader, Carlton knew as much about Internet trading
as Stratford did, maybe more. Still, says Carlton, ``I liked it
because it's a lot more relevant than most college classes. This is
something everyone should know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Robin, a senior psychology major from Long Island, knew
nothing about investing before this semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about to graduate, and I thought I'd better take one
course in something relevant,'' says Robin. Her midterm assessment?
``It's given me a basis for reading the business page every day,''
she says. ``Some things are still unclear, though, like inflation
and interest rates or _ '' join the club, Jennie `` _ what actually
moves the stock market up and down.
</P>
<P>
   If Stratford preaches anything, it's the value of patience and
discipline. Strategies like dollar cost averaging _ investing small
amounts consistently to capitalize on market fluctuations _ are
emphasized over picking the next hot dot-com stock or go-go mutual
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Says Stratford, ``Some of these kids want to make money, some
have parents who think this is good stuff to know, and some want to
walk into job interviews and not sound like idiots.'' He smiles.
``I'm here to help them all.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds from the northwest will continue to draw chilly air
from eastern Canada into the Northeastern States. Periods of snow
will linger in eastern Maine as ocean moisture circulates around a
slow moving storm center near Nova Scotia. Snow showers will dust
the high ground from the Adirondacks of New York to the Green and
White Mountains of New England. Farther south, most of the interior
Northeast will have a mixture of sunshine and some puffy cumulus
clouds. Sunshine will be ample across the Middle Atlantic States.
</P>
<P>
   A cool rain will fall north of a low pressure center as it moves
from the southern Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee Valley. The
steadiest rain will occur across southern Missouri and northern
Arkansas. A broken band of showers and a few strong thunderstorms
will form in the warmer, more humid air near the western and
central Gulf of Mexico coast.
</P>
<P>
   Dry weather will cover a large area from the east slopes of the
Rockies to the Great Lakes States. The day will begin with areas of
low clouds across the central Plains. Otherwise, plentiful sunshine
will boost temperatures far above the seasonal average across these
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Variable clouds and few showers will surround low pressure near
the southern California coast. The precipitation will be most
prevalent over the higher terrain where some snow may be mixed with
the rain. Farther north, the latest in a series of Pacific fronts
will send rain toward the Pacific Northwest Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for Patterns
</P>
<P>
   Last month was the sixth warmest February on record at Amarillo,
Texas. Also on the list of Amarillo's six all-time warmest
Februarys are 1932, 1954, 1976 and 1999, suggesting a pattern of
about 22 years. History is replete with weather patterns, but most
eventually break down, depriving forecasters of a powerful tool. It
is curious to note that the pattern of warm Februarys at Amarillo
closely follows a rhythm of the cycle of solar maxima. Scientists
have long searched for reliable patterns of weather on earth that
could be directly linked to the cycles of solar output. The search
continues.

SHANDLING'S `PLANET' REVOLVES AROUND CRUDE HUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Comedian Garry Shandling is reportedly the best friend of
Hollywood power-couple Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, which
explains what A-level star Bening is doing in Shandling's D-level
wannabe star vehicle, ``What Planet Are You From?''
</P>
<P>
   But what the heck is Mike Nichols' name doing in the producer
and director's credits of this ghastly unfunny misfire? Not once in
his distinguished career _ not even in his 1975 career nadir, ``The
Fortune'' _ has he made such a witless, low-humor comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a sci-fi sex farce in the tradition of ``Earth Girls
Are Easy'' and ``Invasion of the Girl Snatchers.'' Shandling plays
an agent from a superior, all-male, alien planet sent to Earth to
impregnate an Earth girl: the beginning of the gradual subversion
of our culture from within.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily trained back on his planet and disguised as a banker
from Seattle, he thinks his task will be a snap, but his efforts at
quick seduction are constantly being frustrated by the clash of
sexual cultures, and by a bionic penis, which emits an irritating
humming noise every time he's aroused.
</P>
<P>
   As the Earth girl he finally woos, marries and impregnates,
co-star Bening is so much better than anything else in the film
that she throws it strangely off-balance. This woman is a true
star, and obviously capable of being radiant and endearing in even
the most unlikely company and surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   And Shandling (TV's ``The Larry Sanders Show'') is not exactly
terrible in his first big-screen star vehicle: To a certain extent,
he carries the movie well on his shoulders. If his jokes were even
a little bit funnier and slightly more original, he might have
scraped by and established a career in this (for him) new medium.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie falls disastrously flat. Whole comedy subplots
involving John Goodman as a government airlines investigator on the
alien's trail, Ben Kinsley as the despotic leader of the alien
planet, and Greg Kinnear as Shandling's slimy co-worker in a
Phoenix bank fail to raise even a polite chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the script fails to make anything amusing or satirically
clever out of its rich sexual culture-clash potential, and opts
instead for crude sexist humor, endless penis jokes and even
urinating baby gags. Could this be the same Mike Nichols who made
``The Graduate'' and ``Carnal Knowledge'' and ``Primary Colors?''
</P>
<P>
   What Planet Are You From? Directed by Mike Nichols. Screenplay
by Garry Shandling, Michael Leeson, Ed Solomon, Peter Tolan. Cast:
Garry Shandling, Annette Bening, John Goodman, Ben Kingsley.
Columbia. 100 minutes. Rated R for language and sex jokes.

   `Eyes Wide Shut,' With Extras
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Warner will release ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' Stanley
Kubrick's much-debated film about the outer reaches of sexual
jealousy, on tape and DVD. Videocassette is adequate for taking in
the glossy tribulations of Bill and Alice Harford (Tom Cruise and
Nicole Kidman) after Alice riles Bill with a tale of her lust for
another man and sends him reeling into the night on a round of his
own explorations.
</P>
<P>
   But there being practically no middle ground of critical opinion
when it comes to this film, the added features on the DVD version
($24.98) are interesting, at least to a point.
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews Cruise and Kidman talk about Kubrick, who
died last March, and working on the film, which opened in theaters
in July. In a third interview, Steven Spielberg, who had nothing to
do with ``Eyes Wide Shut'' but occasionally discussed films with
Kubrick, makes some overall comments about the director and his
work.
</P>
<P>
   While the three don't get into much depth or stray from the
guarded critical straight and narrow, viewers are free to make
between-the-lines interpretations on such matters as Kubrick's
obsessive slowness _ for instance, his inclination to shoot some
scenes 50 times or more _ his supposed lack of interest in the
inner lives of his characters and his rather odd way with a story.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics felt the film was wooden. Cruise describes being
totally absorbed in his role, but he does fondly allude to the fact
that the shoot began to run on a bit (a year, in fact). ``Stanley
would say, `We have got to earn every scene with this character,
earn every single moment.' At times we just couldn't get it _ you
know, you don't have that fire burning that day.''
</P>
<P>
   The days were adding up. Cruise had a company to run, scripts to
assess, writers waiting. ``I said, `Stanley, I don't care how long
it takes, but I have to know, are we going to finish in six months?
This after six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he readdressed the issue. ``I said, `Tell me it's going to
be two years, Stanley, I don't care.''' Kubrick replied: `Don't be
ridiculous, Tom. If it takes that long, everything they say about
us is true.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kidman notes that scenes didn't always require 50 takes; Kubrick
could be fast. ``Stanley was always waiting for something to
happen,'' she said. ``Always looking for something that surprised
him or piqued his interest. It was about exploring all facets of it
so he could go into the editing room.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequently that was after many takes. ``He made sure he
discovered everything there was to discover in the material,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg sums up. Kubrick films tend to grow on you, he said,
perhaps to remind viewers not to lock in their judgments about this
one. You have to watch them more than once. With Kubrick, craft was
paramount. ``Nobody could shoot a picture better in history,''
Spielberg says. But Kubrick stories could be frustrating. ``The way
he tells a story is antithetical to the way we are accustomed to
receiving stories,'' he said. Kubrick was always changing the form.
``He was a chameleon. He never made the same picture twice _
different genre, different period, different story, different risk.
The only thing that bonded them was craft.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Hundred and One Nights
</P>
<P>
   Conjuring grand allusions, Agnes Varda salutes 100 years of
movies with scores of clips from films and reflections from the
stars. For example, Marcello Mastroianni argues about bathtub
scenes with Michael Piccoli (left), who presides over the film in a
baronial chateau.
</P>
<P>
   One of the odder movie bits shows Robert De Niro floating along
in a swan boat with Catherine Deneuve to the tune of ``Sentimental
Journey.'' Nevertheless, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,
``whenever Varda galls her audience with such fluff, all she needs
is a clip from `Pickpocket' or `The General' to make things
right.''

   Harper (Taye Diggs) is the kind of novelist who has his book
chosen by Oprah Winfrey's book club and floats in a candlelit bath
full of rose petals. Titled ``Unfinished Business,'' his novel has

re-encounters and has a tryst with in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, his loyal love (Sanaa Lathan) stays true blue,
demonstrating that ``current movies about upscale black characters
have much more solid traditional values than ones about catty white
teen-agers'' (Maslin).

Flanders, takes a poor boy named Nello (Jeremy James Klissner and

to the realization that Nello may be a rich kid after all.
</P>
<P>
   After an unpromising apprenticeship hauling milk for his
grandfather (Jack Warden), Nello is taken in hand by the painter
Michel La Grande (Jon Voight), who sees artistic promise in the
lad. But a charge of arson and eviction into a blizzard don't make
the going easier in a film ``clogged with sticky-sweet pieties
cooed to saucer-eyed tots'' (Stephen Holden).

   Francois Ozon's film begins promisingly with the sounds of
screaming and gunfire disturbing the suburban calm. It seems the
Father (Francois Marthouret) is displeased with his surprise
birthday party. Through flashbacks we meet the Mother (Evelyne
Dandry), a fusser and fretter, and their son (Adrien De Van), who
declares himself gay, and daughter (Maria De Van), who has an
erotic encounter with a rat, jumps out a window and becomes a
paraplegic dominatrix. Though filmed with the look of a television
comedy, ``Sitcom'' can't conceal ``a sour streak that eventually
poisons its humor'' (Maslin).

TENDER `MY DOG SKIP' TUGS AT THE HEARTSTRINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why does the South evoke such nostalgia? The film world has long
embraced its humid atmosphere, struggling to replicate a bygone
world _ culled largely from literature _ where there's not much to
do and nowhere to go yet there's danger and tension lurking beneath
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the film adaptation of Harper Lee's ``To Kill a
Mockingbird'' or the woeful cast of misfits in movies based on
Carson McCuller's ``The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter'' and ``A Member
of the Wedding.'' A gruff, comical friction and begrudging respect
lingered beneath the racial and class lines of ``Driving Miss
Daisy,'' while ``Fried Green Tomatoes'' cast a spell with its
eccentric characters, focusing on the wild moments at the town's
Whistlestop Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Add a pet dog to the mix and the formula proves purely
irresistible. ``My Dog Skip'' is adapted from writer Willie Morris'
simple, elegant and understated memoir of a World War II-era
childhood in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   In it, he recounts the life lessons learned as an only child who
received ``an only dog,'' a Jack Russell terrier he names Skip, on
his ninth birthday. Together, beginning in 1942, the pair comb the
lazy town of Yazoo, where there were ``10,000 souls and nothin'
doin''' except reading the paper for news about America's role in
the war, going swimming, playing baseball and living an idyllic
life today's kids can only dream of.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that bookish, shy Willie (Frankie ``Malcolm in
the Middle'' Muniz) and Skip don't get into mischief. Indeed, for a
town as serene as Yazoo, much happens to the boy, to the
consternation of his gregarious mom (Diane Lane), taciturn dad
(Kevin Bacon) and Willie's friend and neighbor _ golden son and
athlete Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson), who is about to ship out for
active duty.
</P>
<P>
   The film captures the pain of being alone, of failure, anger and
the illusions that shroud the glory of war as well as the code of
honor and ethics that surround the notion of heroism. More, it
shows in its inimitable, quiet way, the hard-won bonds of loyalty
and love that Skip teaches and which are, as Morris says in
voiceover, ``the most lasting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip'' has its lapses, but it kept a preview audience
in tears. As a family film about a boy and his dog, it brings back
memories of ``Old Yeller,'' ``Big Red'' and ``The Incredible
Journey,'' which also taught kids about life, its hardships and
joys, and how important that first beloved pet can be. And it works
because it never tries to be more than the very personal memory
piece it is.
</P>
<P>
   My Dog Skip. Directed by Jay Russell. Written by Gail Gilcriest.
Cast: Kevin Bacon, Diane Lane, Luke Wilson, Frankie Muniz. Warner

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Children taking piano lessons today can choose from
an extensive repertory of elementary-level pieces by the greatest
of composers. Bach and Schumann wrote volumes of such works, though
they had personal as well as pedagogical reasons to do so: both
were doting fathers. Lots of little minuets and dance pieces by
Mozart are ideal for children, which only makes sense: he composed
them when he was a child himself. Beethoven wrote quite a few works
for beginning-level pianists, though he may have been motivated
more by a chance to make extra money than by genuine affection for
children. Still, the Minuet in G and ``Fuer Elise'' have been
played by grateful youngsters ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of providing pieces for students to play continued
in the 20th century with composers like Igor Stravinsky, Dmitri
Kabalevsky, Ross Lee Finney and Gyorgy Kurtag. Bela Bartok alone
composed a whole catalog of teaching pieces including six volumes
of ``Mikrokosmos,'' which begin with simple five-finger exercises
and progress to works of considerable difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   But few works by 20th-century composers are pegged to students
at an intermediate level. That void worried the composer Ellen
Taaffe Zwilich, who is very involved in music education. In 1997
while composer in residence at Carnegie Hall, Zwilich decided to do
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   She approached Judith Arron, who was then the executive and
artistic director of Carnegie Hall, and together they commissioned
10 international composers to write piano works of an intermediate
level. Those who accepted ranged from the imposing Serialist Milton
Babbitt to the composer known as Hannibal, whose music is steeped
in spirituals learned while working in the cotton fields of Texas
and drum rhythms assimilated while living in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces have just been published by Boosey &AMP; Hawkes as the
``Carnegie Hall Millennium Piano Book.'' The volume includes a CD
of all the works, performed by the pianist Ursula Oppens, a
champion of contemporary music. And Thursday night Oppens will
participate with four young conservatory student pianists in a
concert at Weill Recital Hall in which all 10 pieces will receive
their world premieres.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of contemporary intermediate-level works has several
possible explanations. In earlier times amateur music-making
flourished even in middle-class households: if you wanted music in
your daily life you had to make it yourself. That once-vibrant
tradition has never recovered from the invention of the radio and
the phonograph. Another factor may be the increasing complexity and
specialization of 20th-century music, which has tended to put off
audiences and isolate composers.
</P>
<P>
   The void has made it harder for new music to reach people. In
the 19th century amateurs at home and students in conservatories
could immerse themselves in the music of their own time. Today,
after children practice their elementary pieces by Bach and Bartok,
they can generally turn only to earlier centuries for
intermediate-level works.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilich, who inaugurated several educational projects during her
tenure at Carnegie Hall, thought that addressing this ``vacuum in
the piano repertory'' was important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost some noble traditions in our time,'' she said in
a recent telephone interview from her home in Florida. ``As
composers we ought to be able to speak to all different people,
including students and amateurs.'' Arron (who would die of breast
cancer in 1998) agreed completely and secured financial backing
from the Irving S. Gilmore International Keyboard Festival, with
additional support from the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Arron and Zwilich recruited the composers, looking especially at
those who had ``never done this kind of thing before,'' Zwilich
said. Besides Babbitt, the roster includes brainy contemporary
masters like Elliott Carter whose works are known for their
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The other composers in this wildly varied ``Millennium Piano
Book'' are Wolfgang Rihm, the formidable German; Frederic Rzewski,
an American best known for his pummeling, virtuosic 50-minute piano
piece, ``The People United Will Never Be Defeated!''; John
Harbison, whose much-debated opera, ``The Great Gatsby,'' was
recently given its Metropolitan Opera premiere; two Chinese-born
composers, Tan Dun and Chen Yi; and Zwilich.
</P>
<P>
   While seeking diversity in composers, Zwilich adamantly avoided
stipulating just what constitutes an intermediate-level piano
piece. The resulting works range from the fairly playable, meaning
not overly taxing for the fingers and concentration, to the
considerably difficult.

<P>
   Reflecting on the Millennium Book pieces recently in her Upper
West Side studio, Oppens conceded that some of them were quite
hard, Babbitt's in particular. ``It's a fancy, elegant and spiffy
piece, but it's difficult,'' she said. She pointed to four others
that would reasonably be considered of intermediate level by any
student pianist. Rihm's ``Zwiesprache'' is a set of five
meditative, languidly lyrical memorial pieces. Louis Andriessen's
``Image de Moreau'' is a Minimalistic swirl of chords and colors.
Harbison's ``On an Unwritten Letter'' alternates subdued chorale
passages with animated contrapuntal writing in two parts. And there
is Zwilich's ``Lament,'' written in memory of Arron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working on my Fourth Symphony, when the call came from
Carnegie Hall abut Judy's death,'' Zwilich said. ``I sat at my desk
and this thing poured out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Though not challenging technically, she added, the piece is
challenging musically. The pianist must work hard to highlight and
project a slow-moving lyrical line that runs through the work. The
piece also calls for extensive use of rubato, that is, rhythmic
freedom; but the use of rubato has ``a structural meaning and is
not just an expressive indulgence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are works like Chen's ``Ba Ban,'' filled with
swirling figurations, and Rzewski's propulsive ``The Days Fly By,''
which make big effects through modest technical means. There is a
long tradition of such works. Quite a few Liszt pieces lie fairly
easily in the fingers but are calculated to impress. Summing up the
overall level of difficulty in the works, Oppens said, ``the
average is intermediate.''
</P>
<P>
   So, if most of the pieces in this collection are not going to be
played by children in the middle grades, they might be taken up by
college and conservatory students who have steered clear of
contemporary music because of the difficulty involved.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday night's concert, Oppens will perform the works by
Harbison and Tan Dun. Four students who were selected through a
sort of uncompetitive competition will play the other eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carnegie Hall felt that a real competition would be
inappropriate and undoable,'' Oppens said. ``So, I paired the
pieces in groups of two and sent them to four conservatories and
asked each, by whatever means they wanted, to have two students
learn the pieces and submit tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were listened to blindly. Those selected were: Ofra
Yitzhaki, an Israeli pianist pursuing a master's degree at
Juilliard; a Wisconsin native, Kuang-Hao Huang, who is doing
doctoral work at Northwestern University; Kozue Jinnouchi, the
bachelor of music program at the Eastman School of Music, and
Kirill Gerstein, who moved to New York six years ago from Russia
and is now a student at the Manhattan School of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstein recently spent an afternoon at Oppens' studio being
coached in the Rihm and Carter works he will play Thursday night.
The title of Carter's ``Two Diversions'' suggests that the music is
supposed to be diverting. The notes and rhythms are undeniably
tough to master. The music could be called intermediate-level in
that each piece presents a straightforward musical challenge. The
first involves just two elements: a slow lyrical line that threads
through the piece and a contrasting fanciful line that continually
darts about. In the second piece two rather independent voices get
respectively faster and slower at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' Gerstein said before playing the pieces for
Oppens, ``I did find the Carter to be not an easy thing to learn.
It was a good healthy challenge. I learned a lot in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sat down at Oppens' piano that day, he placed on the music
stand a huge rectangle of cardboard on which the pages of the
score, in photocopied reductions, had been pasted so that he would
not have to deal with page turns. He called it his ``road map.''
</P>
<P>
   As he plays, it is clear to Oppens that the young pianist,
tackling his first Carter work, has studied its notes, rhythms and
structure quite carefully. He finds great color in the music. She
feels, though, that he is not making sufficient contrasts between
the two elements in the first Diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ''One line should be slow and steady,'' she explains. ``The
other should be as varied, operatic and imaginative as possible.''
Gerstein's overall tempo is a bit fast, she thinks. ``What you are
doing is real good,'' she adds, ``but it's worth making sure that
the tempi are perfect. The idea is to be exceedingly expressive
without doing things to the tempo itself.''
</P>
<P>
   To help him relax with the music, Oppens, a formidable
technician, offers some self-effacing encouragement. ``I can't
really hear counterpoint anyway,'' she said, ``so I just take turns
hearing each voice, and it works for the listener.''
</P>
<P>
   In another place, where she feels that Gerstein is a bit
constrained, she says, ``That's where I really try to let the hands
be separated and just hope that they will wind up in the same
place.'' Gerstein tries the passage again, and the difference is
striking. His playing is fanciful and the skittish lines finally
evoke the diverting quality of the title.
</P>
<P>
   To Carter, ``Two Diversions'' is an intermediate-level piano
piece. Expanding on why he had not written such works before, he
explained that composers in the highly experimental 20th century
had to labor hard to come up with a distinctive style. ``It's
difficult to write something simplified that represents your
style,'' he said. ``We try to find our own voice and sing;
sometimes we don't sing simply.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerstein found the effort of learning Carter's piece well worth
it. ``At first it was rather confusing,'' he said, ``but I find
that the more I play it and live with it, the more clarity it has
for me. Now it seems just a clean combination of different lines.
It seems to be simple, in a good sense.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That Gerstein has come to that realization and is game to try
other, harder, contemporary works, seems an endorsement for the
Millennium Piano Book project. Zwilich has only one more hope:
``I'd be happy if every composer in the world would get this book,
say, `Gee, I could do better than that,' and sit down and try the
same thing.''

`DROWNING `MONA' FINDS BOTH GOOD HUMOR AND BAD TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   More and more nasty comedies _ whether about romance (the
terribly foul ``Love Stinks''), music (``Detroit Rock City'') or
something altogether different _ have been vying to topple Bobby
and Peter Farrelly's ``Kingpin'' and ``There's Something About
Mary'' from the top of the bad-taste throne.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the contenders are unredemptive, vile treatises on the
worst sides of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   The latest entry, ``Drowning Mona,'' scores high on nastiness,
but it has as many surprisingly funny moments as offensive ones.
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Nick Gomez, reunites Danny DeVito (whose
company also produced the film) and Bette Midler, who starred in
the 1986 hit ``Ruthless People.''
</P>
<P>
   Mona Dearly (Midler) is the most foul-mouthed, ill-tempered
resident of Yerplanck, N.Y., a town full of white trash, Yugo
drivers and bad haircuts. When her Yugo goes off a cliff and sinks
into the lake, drowning the much-loathed woman, the whole community
celebrates. ``I bet property values go up,'' chortles one, while
another quips, ``I've seen people more upset at losing change in a
candy machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Police Chief Rash (DeVito) is called in to
investigate what appears to be a routine accident. But he soon
learns the car's brakes were sabotaged and the death was actually
murder. But since everyone either hated and/or feared Mona, he's
got scads of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   They include Mona's dumb-as-a-post, one-handed son Jeff (Marcus
Thomas), her cheating husband Phil (William Fichtner), diner
waitress Rona Mace (Jamie Lee Curtis) and, at the top of the list,
young Bobby Calzone (Casey Affleck). Bobby is Jeff's landscaping
business partner and harbors serious grudges against both Mona and
her ineffectual, lazy, beer-swilling son, who is about to drive
Bobby to bankruptcy. But Bobby is about to be married to Rash's
beloved daughter Ellen (Neve Campbell), who has her own reasons to
dislike Mona and Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drowning Mona'' sifts through the convoluted lives and
relationships of this group of misfits and, for its first
two-thirds, is quite funny and involving. But like most movies
these days, it doesn't quite know how to tie up its loose ends and
settles more for convenience than ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Drowning Mona. Directed by Nick Gomez. Written by Peter
Steinfeld. Cast: Bette Midler, Danny DeVito, Neve Campbell, Jamie
Lee Curtis, William Fichtner, Casey Affleck. Destination Films. 91
minutes. Rated R for language, violence.

   Grade: B

`HOMO SAPIENS 1900': PERFECTING EUGENICS IS AS HARD AS PERFECTING
PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something intrinsically creepy about the scientific
quest to create a new and improved human being, and ``Homo Sapiens
1900,'' Peter Cohen's unsettling documentary history of eugenics,
mercilessly zeroes in on exactly what that is.
</P>
<P>
   In turning people into laboratory specimens and using genetic
theory to try to breed superior strains of people, scientists play
God by making value judgments about the most desirable human
qualities, usually deemed to be measurable intelligence and
physical endowment.
</P>
<P>
   But the declaration of a hierarchy of human traits leaves those
decreed genetically inferior vulnerable to all sorts of abuses,
from sterilization to outright murder. And as the film makes
abundantly clear, eugenic theory has always been used to justify
the most virulent racism in the name of science. Societies usually
define the ideal human as having the physical characteristics of
the ethnic majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homo Sapiens 1900,'' which opens Friday in New York, is so
solemn that in many places it looks and sounds like a horror film.
Beginning with a scene from ``Frankenstein,'' it is filled with
ominous images of grim know-it-all doctors in white coats,
elaborate diagrams of family trees, and disturbing pictures of the
deformed and mentally ill, photographed to look like monstrous
biological mutations.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the images is a dry, authoritative voice-over
narration by Steven Rappaport, who delivers a fact-filled history
of the eugenics movement from its development in the 19th century
by Sir Francis Galton in England and Gregor Johann Mendel in
Austria to the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   The film's most appalling moment is an excerpt from a silent
film, ``The Black Stork,'' in which Dr. Harry Haiselden, an
American proponent of euthanasia, imperiously tells nurses in a
hospital which fragile newborn babies should be left to die.
</P>
<P>
   From its beginnings, eugenics has intrigued national leaders who
have adapted its theories to suit their political agendas. The
Soviet Union was the center of a shifting debate as to whether
acquired characteristics could be inherited. In its early years,
the brains of gifted artists, scientists and political leaders
(including Lenin) became the fetishized objects of scientific
study, the ideal being to create and produce a society of supermen
in only a few generations.
</P>
<P>
   But later, under Stalin, when the mass production of food and
supplies became an urgent priority, the more grandiose eugenic
theorists were brutally silenced, and the ideal Soviet citizen of
the future became an efficient, obedient cog in a smoothly whirring
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Germany, perfect physical specimens who conformed
to classically defined stereotypes became the genetic goal. But
there, too, eugenic fantasy clashed with social policy. Nazi
Germany's idealization of the family ensured that the notion of
Aryan breeding farms for the production of a master race barely got
off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States the vogue for eugenics in the early 20th
century led to the enactment of compulsive sterilization laws in 20
states by 1907, but the vogue faded because the accompanying
culture was so reactionary.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker, whose 1989 documentary ``The Architecture of
Doom'' explored the relationship between aesthetics and violence in
Nazi Germany, is an outspoken opponent of eugenic science's ``dream
of a measurable man'' and argues that there is still no way to
program or predict actual human achievement.
</P>
<P>
   That may be so. But as modern genetic engineering gallops
forward with one breakthrough after another, the Frankensteinian
impulse to improve the species is as alive as ever. &QL;

   &UR; HOUSE PANEL BLASTS RICHARDSON ON NUCLEAR AGENCY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans and Democrats on a congressional panel
Thursday criticized Energy Secretary Bill Richardson for what they
said was his failure to follow instructions on how to set up a new
agency that would be responsible for the U.S. nuclear weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Service
Committee, told Richardson that the reorganization was designed to
correct the ``confused lines of authority and reporting chains that
have troubled the department since the very beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spence said Richardson has preserved much of the old system
even as he put together the staff for the new semi-autonomous
agency _ the National Nuclear Security Administration _ within the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Spence said he has ``serious concerns'' about Richardson's
decision to ``dual-hat'' Energy Department employees so they also
fill key positions in the new nuclear agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my view that this (dual-hatting) approach is in direct
and clear violation of congressional intent,'' Spence said. He
added that he thinks Richardson intended to ``ensure that the
existing organizational structure, lines of authority and fiscal
and managerial practices of DOE remain intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress ordered the reorganization of the Energy Department
last fall after allegations that China had stolen sensitive nuclear
secrets because of poor security and mismanagement at weapons
laboratories run by the department. Congressional investigators
blamed confused responsibilities and lack of accountability within
the department.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has resisted the reorganization on the basis that it
would reduce his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the special
House panel that oversees the reorganization of the Department of
Energy, said in an interview that Richardson has set up a
management structure that looks ``like Frankenstein's brain on
fire,'' adding: ``We want a simple channeling of authority.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Richardson's plan for the new nuclear agency is ``a
missed opportunity'' to alleviate 20 years of mismanagement of
nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Energy Department's management of the nation's
nuclear weapons programs is a ``bureaucratic kudzu-laden tangle''
that has jeopardized ``our prize nuclear secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., told Richardson that the
department's handling of the country's nuclear weapons laboratories
has been ``abysmal'' and that the new arrangement is going to
``degrade security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're still going to have a situation in which confusion can
reign,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, responding that he did not intend to subvert the
legislation, said only 18 of the 2,014 employees of the new
National Nuclear Security administration hold positions in both the
nuclear agency and the Energy Department. They include attorneys,
field managers, members of a judicial board that resolves agency
disputes and a counter-intelligence official. Richardson said he
``firmly believes'' it is both efficient and legal for him to place
employees with overlapping authority in the new agency and in the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to keep those dual-hatted employees where they are to
avoid duplication,'' Richardson said. ``I have to manage this
agency and I believe this is the best way to avoid duplication.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher told Richardson that six of the 18 people who serve in
double roles are ``actually the very top leaders of the new
organization. That is my concern, some of these people are very key
people and very significant players.''
</P>
<P>
   The intent of Congress was ``not to take the existing agency and
change the name and have them wink at us,'' she said later. ``It
was not our intent to have dual-hatting.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson announced that he is recommending that President
Clinton nominate Air Force Gen. John A. Gordon as the first
director of the new nuclear agency for a three-year term.

`PEOPLE' SUCCESSFULLY MESHES HUMOR AND WAR-TORN BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yugoslav director Jasmin Dizdar's colorful first feature opens
in a burst of energy and never lets up.
</P>
<P>
   It's about melting-pot London and a group of residents whose
lives run parallel and perpendicular, no matter what their
ethnicity. The film refers comically and tragically to the war in
Bosnia and the refugees who land on the city's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it has a vibrancy, offbeat optimism and hope despite its
subtext of prejudice, pain, isolation and death.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes between immigrants and the British are comically,
painfully and sometimes heartbreakingly observed.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a subversive strain at play under the vibrant and
colorful surface of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Its characters fight, get high, rebel and learn a lesson about
another way of life, sometimes falling into star-crossed love.
Dizdar elicits a messy, restless, bright and barmy look at the
world and its universal enlightening lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The inhabitants of the London melting pot include Griffin (Danny
Nussbaum), a teenager who is into drugs but gets a second chance
when a freak coincidence literally drops him into another world;
Portia (Charlotte Coleman), a doctor and daughter of rich political
parents, falls in love with poor Bosnian refugee Pero (Edin
Dzandzanovic); and Dr. Mouldy (Nicholas Farrell), a harried man on
the verge of losing his children to a disgruntled ex, finds
salvation in a Bosnian couple going through trauma over an unwanted
birth (the baby is the product of a war rape).
</P>
<P>
   Like the writer Hanif Kareishi (``My Son the Fanatic,'' ``My
Beautiful Laundrette''), Dizdar humorously compares and contrasts
extremes in economics and lifestyles and looks at the west through
the eyes of an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   He successfully meshes an enjoyably superficial romantic comedy
along the lines of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' with a
neo-realistic drama of war-torn Bosnia more reminiscent of
``Welcome to Sarajevo.''
</P>
<P>
   Dizdar never resorts to preaching and gives his characters the
chance to find a new hope as well as a new war in their battle for
a place and acceptance in a new world.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful People. Directed and written by Jasmin Dizdar. Cast:
Charlotte Coleman, Charles Kay, Linda Bassett, Nicholas Farrell,
Rosalind Ayres. Trimark Pictures. 107 minutes. Rated R for
language, violence.

listed in Priceline.com has grown into a running feud. Northwest
for several months has offered special low fares from Atlanta on
its own website, a protest to the fact that it can't do so on
Priceline because of an exclusivity clause negotiated by Delta. On
Wednesday the battle escalated when Northwest rolled out an ad
saying Delta ``won't allow Atlanta to receive competitive Priceline
fares.'' Delta has retaliated by offering specials on its website
on flights from Northwest hubs. (Thurston, Atlanta

&HT;     NEW EVIDENCE SURFACES IN CASE OF MISSING ATHEIST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Blood traces recovered from an Austin storage unit
have reinforced federal authorities' belief that militant atheist
Madalyn Murray O'Hair and her two adult children were dismembered
there after being kidnapped and killed in 1995, according to a
federal court document.
</P>
<P>
   The document, filed in U.S. District Court in Austin, said
laboratory analysis of bloodstains ``resulted in the identification
of DNA of human origin'' that matched the DNA of ``two of the
missing Murray-O'Hair family members.''
</P>
<P>
   If true, the claim represents the first concrete evidence that
O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and daughter Robin Murray O'Hair
were slain after they vanished from San Antonio in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy affidavit filed last spring, federal investigators
accused three men _ David Waters, Gary Karr and Danny Fry _ of
abducting and killing the O'Hair family for $500,000 in gold coins.
And they have accused Waters and Karr of then killing and beheading
Fry, whose nude body was found on a Dallas riverbank two days after
the O'Hairs vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Karr has been charged in connection with the O'Hair
disappearance, but Waters has not. Neither man has been charged
with the death of Fry.
</P>
<P>
   However, Waters has been convicted of being in a felon in
possession of ammunition and of violating his probation on a state
theft conviction. He currently is in prison.
</P>
<P>
   While federal authorities have amassed a circumstantial case,
they have neither a witness to slayings of the O'Hairs nor bodies
to prove they are dead. Waters, who once worked for O'Hair, has
said the three disappeared as part of a long-planned getaway.
</P>
<P>
   The latest motion containing the new revelations was filed by
federal prosecutors in response to Waters' request for the return
of his personal property seized in the raid on his Austin apartment
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The document also accuses Waters and Karr of collaborating in
other crimes, including the theft of guns and other property at an
Indianapolis home in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name, telephone number and e-mail address of this same
Indianapolis homeowner-victim was found in a spiral notebook during
the search of (Waters') residence on March 24, 1999,'' the motion
reads.
</P>
<P>
   It further says a .22-caliber pistol authorities say was found
in Karr's Detroit apartment in March 1999 was traced by its serial
number back to the homeowner in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion for return of his property, filed from a Texas
prison, Waters lists hundreds of items taken from his residence
last spring, ranging from a pack of cigarette papers to a
serrated-edged knife.
</P>
<P>
   After months of deliberation, U.S. District Judge Paul Borman
threw out critical evidence Monday in a weapons case against Karr.
He ruled Karr had not given the police or federal agents permission
to search his Detroit apartment in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The police say they found two guns and charged Karr with being a
felon in possession of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Borman's ruling that the guns cannot be used as evidence may
lead to a dismissal of the charges, clearing the way for Karr to be
brought to Texas, where federal authorities are eagerly awaiting
his arrival to question him about the O'Hair and Fry cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no firearms case, I assume they'll try to bring
him to Texas. Practically speaking, he can't fight it,'' said
Karr's federal public defender, Richard Helfrick.
</P>
<P>
   The only delay may be an appeal of Borman's ruling. If the U.S.
attorney in Detroit does not appeal, Karr's next stop will likely
be Austin, where last year a federal grand jury indicted him in the
kidnapping and extorting of $500,000 from the O'Hair family.
</P>
<P>
   Karr has admitted what he maintains was a minor role in the
disappearance of the O'Hair family.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring he gave FBI agents a detailed map of a Hill Country
ranch, showing where the bodies of O'Hair and her children
allegedly were buried.
</P>
<P>
   However, a search of the site proved futile.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who is serving two prison terms for other crimes, has
denied any role in the O'Hairs' disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair gained fame when she carried her fight against prayer in
public schools to the Supreme Court, winning a case there in 1963.
She also founded and ran an atheist organization, the United
Secularists of America, which is located in Parsippany, N.J.

   GHANIKHEL, Afghanistan _ The merchants at the big opium bazaar
here are crying the blues, what with sales so low and prices down
by half.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Wahab picked up a few chunks of his unrefined goods, which
look like dried-up cow pies. He put the opium on his scale and
measured the weight with lead balances. A year ago he was getting
$140 per kilogram (2.2 pounds); now he gets $62.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't make a profit at these prices,'' he complained, just
before closing his shop for noontime prayers. ``What am I supposed
to do for money? Rob people?''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the ruling Taliban militia, who finally seem to
be putting limits on the drug trade. They have much to accomplish.
In 1999 Afghanistan's crop of raw opium amounted to a record 5,070
tons _ about 75 percent of the global yield.
</P>
<P>
   In Ghanikhel, where opium is sold as openly as onions, the
traders grumble about a crackdown on their best customers, the
nearby laboratories that make the drug into morphine and heroin.
``With the labs dismantled, there are no buyers,'' Wahab said.
</P>
<P>
   While that is an overstatement, business in this dusty, decrepit
bazaar of two dozen shops and one main street has certainly
slumped. Store roofs are made of straw and look ready to cave in.
Donkeys prowl about. One long-dead dog was lying near a vegetable
seller's pushcart. Flies fluttered in crazed loops above its
carcass.
</P>
<P>
   However modest in looks, this bazaar has long been a commercial
hub for the surrounding provinces, where beautiful pink and white
poppies flourish. Ghanikhel is about 20 miles from the city of
Jalalabad, just a few hours' drive from the Khyber Pass. Decades
back, this opium market was built at a discreet distance from any
paved road _ a precaution largely unneeded during most of
Afghanistan's freewheeling history.
</P>
<P>
   Wahab, 45, wears a large blue turban made more vivid by his long
white beard. He is what some might call a wholesaler. Farmers sell
him the gummy opium they milk from the swollen poppy pods. He in
turn sells the dried-out drug to people with the means to refine
it. While Wahab is considered prosperous in Ghanikhel, the biggest
money in the opium trade is made by distributors far closer to the
retail end.
</P>
<P>
   Wahab's shop, like most others, is a room barely 10 feet square.
He keeps the sample cakes of opium in a small heap near a tea
kettle. His money is stashed in an ammunition box. There are no
lights. The floor is covered with a threadbare rug, the walls with
bright cloths. On a recent Sunday he was bored. He said he had not
sold a thing all day.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Syed Nabi, strolled by. He makes money as a broker,
steering farmers to the merchants. ``The Taliban have been checking
the trafficking routes,'' he said indignantly. ``With opium you're
OK. But with heroin, a few people have been arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a nasty turn for those whose livelihoods depend on
poppies. Afghanistan has endured 21 straight years of war.
Irrigation canals have been destroyed, and the soil has been
booby-trapped with land mines. Farmers don't have much going for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do understand that the Taliban have a dilemma,'' said
Bernard Frahi, head of the U.N. Drug Control Program in Pakistan
and Afghanistan. ``They can't institute a full-fledged eradication
program. They tell us that'd lead to a revolt.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Taliban have done nothing so drastic as to outlaw
drugs, despite condemning them as anathema to the sacred teachings
of Islam. But they have sporadically shut down processing labs and
made a show of burning heroin in bonfires.
</P>
<P>
   Their most important action against drugs came in September.
After insistent pleading from the United Nations, the Taliban's
supreme leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, ordered farmers to cut poppy
cultivation by a third. The spring harvest will tell the tale, but
early reports indicate that at least in some regions the militia
have enforced the decree.
</P>
<P>
   Mullah Omar, a pious Muslim with one eye and three wives, has
issued similar commands before, but these went by the wayside. The
man is under conflicting pressures. The Taliban began conquering
territory in 1994, but 10 percent to 20 percent of the country
remains outside their control. A crusade against drugs would be
unpopular. Poppies fill many pockets, especially those of local
warlords with more than a passing interest in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Taliban themselves have enjoyed revenues
from the opium business, taxing the lucrative poppy harvest the
same way they do other crops and collecting a second assessment as
the drugs are transported. Each year, the levies amount to $10
million to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations does not recognize the Taliban as a
legitimate government, but on the poppy issue the Taliban's supreme
leader seems to be issuing a challenge: put up or shut up.
</P>
<P>
   After reducing poppy cultivation, ``we will look to the reaction
of the world community,'' read Mullah Omar's September decree. If
other nations provide ``economic assistance in lieu of this
opium,'' the campaign against the poppy will continue.
</P>
<P>
   As Frahi of the United Nations cautiously said: ``We live in a
difficult reality. If we're to succeed, we have to address the
problem of poverty in Afghanistan in a systematic way. For that, we
need funding and donor support, and most of the world wants nothing
to do with the Taliban.''
</P>
<P>
   The ins and outs of global politics are lost on the average
poppy farmer. Near Ghanikhel, green sprouts have busted through the
ground and reach toward the sun. People are desperately poor.
Earnings from poppies are threefold those from wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers have no choice but to plant poppies. They live in
debt and need to borrow to make it from year to year. Lenders
demand that they plant the more profitable crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I know what I grow is poison to other people,'' said a
sharecropper who uses the single name Khalil. He pointed into the
distance. ``I can't get a loan unless I do what those men tell me,
the ones who live in the good houses with the big gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Such contrition is uncommon, however. After all, this is
Ghanikhel. Poppy-growing has been part of the culture for
generations. ``This is what my ancestors planted,'' said Khyber
Gul, 28, standing in a pasture with his little son. ``This boy will
plant it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gul has not obeyed Mullah Omar's decree _ and he had some advice
for the Taliban: ``If they want to destroy my poppies, they can.
But if this is what they do to people, I promise one thing. They
won't be around forever.''  &QL;

`TRASH CULTURE': THE INTERSECTION OF HIGH AND LOW CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In our culture of recycling, it's not surprising to learn that
``Clueless'' was based on Jane Austen's ``Emma'' or that
``Apocalypse Now'' was based on Conrad's ``Heart of Darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   In his addled new book, which traces the connections between
``canonical works of art'' and ``trash culture,'' the scholar
Richard Keller Simon adds to these well-known examples a host of
additional cases. He argues that ``Dumb and Dumber'' is ``a film
version of `Don Quixote' for kids,'' that ``Rambo: First Blood,
Part II'' is ``a contemporary variation on Homer's `Iliad''' and
that ``Seinfeld'' is a ``kinder, gentler'' adaptation of the
Etherege play ``The Man of Mode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek,'' he asserts, is ``a contemporary variant on
`Gulliver's Travels,''' recapitulating Swift's ``inquiry into the
nature of civilization, the use of allegory, the elaboration of the
fantastic voyage, the problem of reason and emotion.'' ``Friends,''
he insists, is ``Much Ado About Nothing'' ``transplanted to a New
York City coffee shop, with Ross and Rachel as the inexperienced
lovers Hero and Claudio, Chandler as the witty Benedick, Monica as
the outspoken Beatrice, Joey as the worldly Don Pedro and Phoebe as
a generic Shakespearean fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Simon demonstrates a clever knack in ``Trash Culture''
for finding parallels between classic texts and contemporary works
of entertainment, he completely undercuts his thesis _ that ``we
are surrounded by stories that echo, repeat, revise and adapt the
entire history of literature'' _ by indulging in faulty logic,
self-serving omissions and absurd generalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Simon completely ignores the role that mythic archetypes and the
collective unconscious might play in explaining the persistence of
elemental stories throughout history: Jung does not figure in his
arguments at all, while Joseph Campbell is relegated to a single
mention in passing. He shrugs off the fact that essential aspects
of the human condition are obviously going to be addressed by
successive generations of artists and naively assumes that if two
texts share certain ingredients they must be related to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Simon makes the ludicrous argument, for instance, that talk
shows featuring Jerry Springer, Ricki Lake and Geraldo Rivera
frequently take their ``inspiration from Tennessee Williams, in
particular the tangled sexual dynamic acted out by Stanley
Kowalski, his wife, Stella, and her sister, Blanche Dubois in ``A
Streetcar Named Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the talk show's great subject, the unrepentant male
stud surrounded by the women with whom he has had sex, without
regard for the consequences,'' Simon writes. ``In Williams' play
Stanley beats his wife and rapes his sister-in-law, while Stella
puts up with the abuse because she does not want to lose the great
sex and Blanche _ herself a sexual rule-breaker with a preference
for underage boys _ thinks she can control Stanley by flirting with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Some variant of this conflict plays over and over again on the
talk show circuit, where two sisters or three cousins or four best
friends or five girls in the neighborhood learn that they have been
sleeping with the same man who has betrayed them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly obtuse interpretations are littered throughout ``Trash
Culture.'' Simon describes ``Sense and Sensibility,'' ``The House
of Mirth'' and ``Madame Bovary'' as ``cautionary tales and guides
for young women readers,'' then goes on to argue that they are
precursors to Cosmopolitan magazine, another guide for young women
that in his warped opinion also happens to be ``a brilliant
modernist text, what would have resulted if Marcel Duchamp had
thrown a hand grenade into the great courtship novels of the 19th
and 20th centuries, then pasted the fragments together.''
</P>
<P>
   In another chapter, Simon reduces ``Star Wars'' to ``a
commentary on the evils of our own side's war in Vietnam'':
``Luke's struggle with his father, who has gone over to the side of
the militaristic empire,'' he writes, ``reflects the experience of
many draft-age young men who struggled with their pro-war fathers
over the morality of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Oliver Stone's 1986 movie ``Platoon,'' which does deal
with Vietnam, Simon regards it as ``a more brutal version'' of
``Henry IV, Part I,'' showing a young man, much like Prince Hal,
torn between two role models, ``a fanatical super warrior who lives
for bloodshed and a pleasure-loving fighter with no illusions about
the nature of war.'' Having thus linked the film with Shakespeare's
famous play, Simon goes on to mock Stone's own suggestion that he
based the movie on his own experiences as a soldier in Vietnam,
sarcastically commenting, ``as if he were Prince Hal!''
</P>
<P>
   Such stupefying failures of reasoning are exacerbated in this
volume by Simon's sloppy scholarship _ he identifies the author of
the classic book ``The Vision of Tragedy'' as William (instead of
Richard) Sewall _ and his penchant for making silly, willfully
provocative assertions. He announces that ``Star Wars'' appears to
have ``replaced the Bible as the urtext of our civilization'' and
hails The National Enquirer as ``postmodern tragedy, an
extravagant, minimalist celebration of the death of the subject
made available in collage or montage form.''
</P>
<P>
   In setting forth such absurd arguments, Simon is not bravely
staking out new territory, as he repeatedly says he is doing. After
all, there is little bias against popular storytelling in the
academy today, as he continually suggests: the intersection of high
and low culture has been a favorite topic among scholars for
decades, and treating ``trash culture'' texts as worthy subjects of
analysis has long been a favorite practice of deconstructionists.
All Simon is really doing in this book is recycling those familiar
arguments, and more often than not in a particularly inept fashion.

AGENT MAKES HIS WORK THE FAMILY'S BUSINESS IN `COVER ME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike some kids, 11-year-old Chance Arno knows exactly what his
father does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. Thus, on family car trips, he and his sisters play
back-seat games more intently than most. Instead of shouting
``blue'' when a blue car passes, they're apt to say: ``Late-model
Ford Mustang, female Caucasian, 28 to 32, brown hair, slight build,
cat lover.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention to detail makes Dad proud. He's Danny Arno: FBI
agent, lounge singer, devoted father. OK, unconventional father.
The sort who asks his 16-year-old daughter to get close to a
mobster's son so she can pump him for information, then goes all
conventional on her when he realizes how close she got.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it the downside of involving the wife and kids in the
family business. But the downside of not being involved is ickier.
To quote the philosophical adolescent, Chance: ``In the movies,
people die because they know too much. But in life, it's usually
the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   So Danny not only tells his family what he does. He trains them
in what he does. It has been his mission ever since his partner and
his partner's wife were executed by the bad guys. Danny figures if
the woman had known her husband was infiltrating organized crime,
she'd have had a contingency plan.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a flimsy premise on which to hang a series, but
Shaun Cassidy, teen-heartthrob-turned-TV-producer, makes ``Cover
Me,'' premiering Sunday on USA Network, one of the more enjoyable
new shows of this or any season.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Dobson is part Elvis, part wack job, completely
captivating as Danny Arno. Think of him as the flip side of Tony
Soprano. And even though we're assured ``Cover Me'' is based on an
actual ``FBI family,'' it makes about as much sense as having the
low-fat topping on a hot-fudge sundae. But Dobson sells it
beautifully, like the law-abiding con man he plays. When taking a
family photo in 1984, he decides it's time to give Chance a piece,
so he puts his service revolver in the boy's hands. After Chance
accidentally ventilates Danny's overcoat, Danny instructs his son
in the subtler points of gunplay: ``When you do it again, empty
your load. Never let the other guy return fire. Otherwise, you'll
end up deader than vaudeville. Understand? Empty your load!
Attaboy. Kiss me. Now let's go to church.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not how every father would have handled the sitch. But
Danny Arno is different. Sort of like the guy at work who never
smiles. Mysterious. Scary. Odd. And Dobson, with a smirk and a
wink, makes it work. Besides, this is TV, where we go to escape
reality and embrace people like Barbara, Danny's wife, sometimes a
homemaker, sometimes a stockbroker, always whatever the job
requires. Always. Played with sexy devotion by Melora Hardin, she's
a bit Joan Severance, a bit Sela Ward: the mom from central casting
who can play all the parts. The kids _ Michael Angarano as Chance,
Antoinette Picatto as Ruby, Cameron Richardson as Celeste _ are
cute and typical siblings, until duty calls. Make that when Daddy
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Cover Me: Based on the True Life of an FBI Family. One-hour
drama series about an undercover FBI agent who involves his wife
and three children in his job. Starring Peter Dobson, Melora
Hardin, Cameron Richardson, Antoinette Picatto and Michael
Angarano. Premieres Sunday on USA Network. Parental guideline
rating: TV-14.

 &HT;    AUSTIN TAX CENTER HANDED $28 MILLION TO UNKNOWN COURIER
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last fall, a courier arrived at the security gate
outside the Internal Revenue Service Center in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was a substitute worker unknown to the IRS security
guards, the courier was allowed onto the grounds without being
asked for identification. Once inside the fence, he called the
processing center and an IRS employee came out to give him $28
million in checks, again without asking for his identification.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the courier was legitimate, and he ferried the
deposit safely to the Federal Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the incident was cited prominently at a congressional
hearing this week as the U.S. General Accounting Office issued a
sharply critical assessment of IRS operations.
</P>
<P>
   GAO associate director Gregory D. Kutz, who headed the tax
agency study, confirmed Thursday that courier episode occurred in
Austin in September while he was monitoring the tax service center.
</P>
<P>
   Security lapses are not new to the IRS. The GAO, which is the
non-partisan congressional watchdog agency, last year reported that
a district office in Dallas routinely handed over millions of
dollars in bank deposits to bicycle messengers.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has tightened its policies since then, Kutz said. But,
he added, ``it's a big decentralized organization'' where policies
are ``difficult to enforce'' nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Roberts, chief of support services in Austin, said Thursday
that reforms were instituted soon after GAO informed officials
about the courier incident.
</P>

   ``Now we get i.d. badge numbers from the courier company and we
verify the driver has the i.d. badge and we match it against our
records,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Austin IRS officials played down the risk that was
involved. ``That deposit, if it's not totally checks, it's almost
all checks, and they're all endorsed strictly for Internal Revenue
Service deposit,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Hall, chief of planning and analysis for the Austin
facility's submission processing center, said the courier who was
not asked for identification had the proper documentation for the
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago, the Austin center was criticized by the
GAO for having no perimeter fence. One has since been installed.

   How About McGarden?
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Winter Garden Theater won't be changing its name
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization,
which owns the theater, said Thursday that his company had ended
discussions with General Motors about changing the name of the
Winter Garden, home to ``Cats,'' to the Cadillac Winter Garden, or
some variation thereof, in exchange for corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   No explanation was given for the abrupt end to the discussions,
which had been continuing for about three years and which seemed to
be close to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came just a day after the Roundabout Theater
Company announced it was selling off the name of the historic
Selwyn Theater, its new home, to American Airlines, a deal that was
greeted on Broadway with a mix of approval and skepticism. The
airline will pay $8.5 million (and, one would hope, a lifetime
supply of free peanuts).
</P>
<P>
   As for the Winter Garden, Schoenfeld offered no additional
comment, and a call to GM was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Vamoose, `Vanya'
</P>
<P>
   The new name notwithstanding, it's apparently taking a little
longer than expected to get the Selwyn _ er, the American Airlines
Theater _ ready for takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The theater formerly known as the Selwyn, at 229 W. 42nd St., is
in the midst of a $21 million overhaul but nonetheless was
scheduled to open its doors on April 11 for the first preview of
``Uncle Vanya.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes word that the construction isn't proceeding as quickly
as expected, and that the company is in discussions with the
Nederlander Organization to shift the run of ``Vanya'' to the
Atkinson Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Haimes, the artistic director of the company, said that the
possible move was a precautionary measure to assure that the show
opens by the Tony deadline, which is May 3.
</P>
<P>
   A shift would not be completely unexpected; the company had
already delayed the opening once. Still, it is sure to be a
disappointment for the Roundabout, which had planned an array of
events around its opening. The timing, too, is not ideal, coming
just after the American Airlines deal.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective shift of ``Vanya'' is made possible by another
production decision: ``Enigma Variations,'' which opened on Feb. 24
in Toronto, will not come to Broadway this season. The production
had mainly favorable reviews in Toronto, but its producer, Emanuel
Azenberg, has decided to pass on bringing the show to the Atkinson,
where it was tentatively scheduled to open, opting instead to take
it to London. ``The economics over there are stultifyingly
different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   London productions are generally much cheaper than those in New
York, owing to Broadway's famously steep labor and landlord costs.
Azenberg said he was considering a possible autumn run in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Club
</P>
<P>
   The staff of the Manhattan Theater Club can be excused for
feeling a little emotionally drained. In the last six weeks, after
all, it has closed one production (``Y2K''), transferred a second
to a commercial run (``Fuddy Meers'') and watched as the prospects
of a third (``The Wild Party'') were dashed by a round of sub-par
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tuesday night's opening of ``The Tale of the Allergist's
Wife'' provided a spurt of invigorating energy for many at the
theater club. The play, an urban comedy by Charles Busch, received
a round of strong notices.
</P>
<P>
   Particular praise was saved for Linda Lavin, who plays Marjorie
Taub, the Sartre-quoting depressive at the play's center. It is a
character that this veteran New York actress says she understands
instinctively.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman loves the drama of her life,'' Lavin said, adding
with a laugh, ``I know this woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama of Lavin's life may get even more high-stakes in
coming weeks. The reviews for ``Allergist'' have given rise to talk
of a longer run, with producers reportedly inquiring about two
mid-size Broadway houses where the current tenants are doing
moderate business.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those rumors pan out or not, Lavin is expected back on
Broadway next spring in rotating revivals of Neil Simon's
``Brighton Beach Memoirs'' and ``Broadway Bound,'' reprising her
Tony-winning turn as Kate Jerome, the narrator's long-suffering
mother. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coming Attractions
</P>
<P>
   Two ambitious new additions to the spring schedule were
announced this week.
</P>
<P>
   Both are off-Broadway. At the New York Theater Workshop the
artistic director, James C. Nicola, said two newly rewritten works
by John Guare would be performed in repertory in May. They are the
plays formerly known as ``Gardenia'' and ``Lydie Breeze,'' first
produced in 1982 and both about the lives of a group of friends in
a 19th-century utopian commune.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was well liked back then, but after directing a
well-received version of both plays in Washington in 1983, Nicola
said he had become convinced that they constituted ``a 20th-century
American classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the plays are being combined into one cohesive five-hour
script, reworked by Guare, to be played over two nights, and
renamed ``Lydie Breeze, Part 1: Bulfinch's Mythology'' and ``Lydie
Breeze, Part 2: The Sacredness of the Next Task.'' (There will be a
quiz.)
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise reprise is under way at the Irish Repertory
Theater, where the artistic director, Charlotte Moore, announced
that ``Our Lady of Sligo,'' a hit at the Royal National Theater in
London in 1998, would arrive in April.
</P>
<P>
   The play, by Sebastian Barry, is part of a series of
biographical works about his family. The ``Lady'' in question is
Barry's grandmother, a part to be played by the Irish star Sinead
Cusack. Max Stafford-Clark will direct.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from London, Cusack described the character as
``damaged and damaging,'' traits familiar to characters of many
recent Irish dramas. Why are her countrymen so ripe for humor and
pain? ``I think that's a universal condition,'' Cusack said. ``The
Irish are just more overt.''

LOVE REIGNS IN LESBIAN TRILOGY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   If only the people who hate homosexuals _ excuse me, who hate
homosexuality _ were forced to watch ``If These Walls Could Talk
2,'' maybe they'd realize they really have nothing to fear from
homosexuals. And, consequently, one thing less to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after HBO looked at three women dealing with
unexpected pregnancies, Sunday's ``If These Walls Could Talk 2''
takes the same approach examining the lesbian experience: Three
short films about people living in the same house during different
time periods.
</P>
<P>
   The first, in 1961, involves two women deeply devoted to each
other for more than 50 years. But when one of them (Marian Seldes)
suffers a stroke and dies, the other (Vanessa Redgrave) encounters
a society that, while not exactly uncaring, cluelessly and
inexorably works to negate their special relationship at every
turn.
</P>
<P>
   The second film features Michelle Williams of ``Dawson's Creek''
as Linda, a college student living in the house with three lesbian
friends in 1972. Curiously, the friends, all radi-
</P>
<P>
   cal feminists, feel threatened and intimidated when Linda falls
for a woman with very masculine tendencies, played by
Chlo &UR; gfumlaut &LR; e Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   Part 3 takes us to present day, with Fran (Sharon Stone) and Kal
(Ellen DeGeneres) sharing the house and desperately trying to have
a baby. Where the ``1961'' segment is sad and ``1972'' eye-opening,
``2000'' is mostly a hilarious capper to a sensitive trilogy that
deserves a wide audience, simply because we can all use an
occasional reminder that people who love are so much better off
than people who hate.
</P>
<P>
   If These Walls Could Talk 2. Ninety-minute anthology film about
lesbians living in three different time periods. Starring Vanessa
Redgrave, Michelle Williams, Chloe Sevigny, Ellen DeGeneres and
Sharon Stone. Sunday on HBO. Parental guideline rating: TV-MA.

12 DIE IN AMBUSH OF RUSSIAN RIOT POLICE IN GROZNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EKAZHEVO, Russia _ Rebel fighters ambushed a column of Russian
riot police Thursday in Chechnya's ruined capital Grozny, killing
12 and wounding 31, a Russian television station reported.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Chechnya's separatist president, Aslan Maskhadov,
vowed to keep fighting and promised a drawn-out and costly
conflict, Russian troops suffered their worst losses in Grozny
since driving out the rebels last month.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen opened fire in broad daylight as the column moved through
a heavily guarded highway north of the center, Russian NTV
television reported. The station showed the bodies of several
soldiers on stretchers on a street in Grozny, and quoted a doctor
at a Russian field hospital as confirming the casualties. It gave
no information about rebel casualties in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how the rebels had been able to set up an ambush
in Grozny, where Russian police and troops conduct regular
house-to-house checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fired at us from all sides,'' a wounded Russian police
officer told NTV. ``We took up defensive positions and shot until
help came.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops interviewed in Grozny last week said that as many
as 500 rebels were still in the city, which was largely destroyed
by a two-month long siege and heavy fighting that ended when most
of the separatists retreated to the mountains in southern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops closed Grozny in February to prevent rebel
fighters from moving in and out of the city. But the past few days
small groups of residents were allowed to go on foot to see what
could be salvaged from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, after federal troops seized the mountain town of
Shatoi, the last main separatist stronghold, Russian generals
declared victory in Moscow's five-month military campaign against
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev urged his troops not to
relax, saying up to 3,000 diehard Chechen rebels would never give
up. The men in the Russian column attacked Thursday, made up of
riot police who had just arrived from Moscow, apparently failed to
heed the message.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov, in an interview on the Web site of US-funded Radio
Liberty, disputed Russian claims of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of 25,000 volunteers who took up arms, 23,000 remain,
23,500. The fighting will go on for a long time,'' Maskhadov said.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov also proposed holding peace talks with Moscow. But
Russia's Acting President Vladimir Putin, who has vowed to wipe out
the last Chechen rebel forces, dismissed the idea of talks with a
man Moscow accuses of aiding and abetting the kidnapping gangs who
terrorized the Caucasus region until Russian troops invaded
Chechnya in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before political talks with Maskhadov can start, we need to
resolve the criminal side of the matter,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia portrays its war in Chechnya as a struggle against
terrorists and bandits, but human rights monitors have accused
federal troops of abuses against civilians. Moscow Thursday said it
was inviting United Nations rights chief Mary Robinson to the North
Caucasus. Robinson has been one of the most vocal critics of
Russia's campaign.

OIL MINISTERS AGREE PRODUCTION SHOULD INCREASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With the high cost of oil and gasoline spreading alarm
through western economies, oil ministers from Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and Mexico _ all among the world's major exporters _ met
here Thursday and agreed that production should be increased to
stabilize prices, but they declined to make firm commitments on the
timing or the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Oil market traders interpreted the absence of such commitments
as an indication that producers may not meet demands by the United
States and other oil-consuming nations for a substantial increase
in output.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices, which have risen to nine-year highs in recent weeks
and jumped 4 percent on Wednesday, ended little changed Thursday on
the vague outcome of the oil ministers' meeting in London.The
London price of Brent crude for April delivery rose to $29.47 a
barrel before settling back to $29.22, up 10 cents. In New York,
oil for April delivery briefly rose to $32.15 a barrel before
retreating to settle at $31.69, down 8 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is to meet in
Vienna on March 27 to decide whether to increase production or to
maintain the present reduced output, as some exporters led by Iran,
Libya and Algeria are demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC still has moderates and still has price hawks,'' said
Peter Gignoux, an oil analyst with Salomon Smith Barney here. ``We
still need to get a consensus'' for the Vienna meeting, he said.
``I think we are looking at high oil prices for a bit to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi oil minister, Ali Naimi, acknowledged Thursday that
``there is need for additional production. The issue is when and
how much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uppermost in our minds is to maintain stability in the
market,'' he said, but he refused to specify the likely scope of a
production increase. ``I think the number will be put forward when
we finish our consultation with all other members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are seeking the number, you are not going to get it
today,'' he told reporters. He also declined to say whether he was
aiming at a specific price level and would not comment on
suggestions that producers want oil prices in the United States to
sink below $25 a barrel. ``We are going to leave that up to the
market for now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates at the discussions here have said privately they
expect production to be increased next month by 1 million or 1.2
million barrels a day. The United States would like to see
production increase by 2 million to 3 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   World oil consumption runs at around 77 million barrels per day
but, since OPEC agreed deep production cuts last March, production
has dropped to 75 million barrels a day. The shortfall of 2 million
barrels a day has tripled oil prices since December 1998, when they
had fallen to $10, the lowest in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Retail gasoline prices have reached an average of $1.421 per
gallon in the United States, the world's biggest oil-consumer, and
there is some expectation they will reach $2 by the summer driving
season, when demand is highest.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. energy secretary, Bill Richardson, who has just
returned to Washington after a visit to major oil producers has
called the rising prices and dwindling supplies a threat to global
economic growth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   OPEC's production cuts are set to expire on March 31.
Historically, however, demand for oil falls in the second three
months of the year with the arrival of spring in the Northern
Hemisphere, and prices tend to weaken. That cyclical shift has
provided OPEC's hawks with the argument against increased
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept that oil prices are high at the moment, but they will
fall in the second quarter when we expect demand to drop by 2.8
million barrels per day,'' said Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, an
Iranian oil ministry official. ``If we increase output while demand
is falling it will be detrimental to prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran has previously called for the OPEC production cuts to be
maintained through September and the official's remarks seemed to
signal continued deep division within OPEC about raising production
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly no decision taken yet,'' said Frederic
Lassere, an analyst at Societe Generale in Paris, who argued that
of the three oil-producers meeting here, Mexico was probably under
greatest pressure from the United States to increase output.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is not a member of OPEC, which accounts for around one
third of worldwide oil production, but has agreed to cooperate with
the group's decision at its Vienna meeting later this month. ``An
increase in production is warranted'' because of a dramatic
increase in demand, the Mexican oil minister, Luis Tellez, said
Thursday. ``We believe there is a need for more oil in the
market,'' he said, but indicated that Mexico would prefer not to
break ranks while OPEC was seeking a broad agreement among its
members. ``We will wait to see this consensus before making our
independent decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The move to raise oil production won further cautious support
Thursday when Norway, another non-OPEC country that joined in last
year's production cuts, indicated that it backed a return to less
volatile prices. ``It is a goal that we should reach long-term
stability that is fair to both producing and consuming countries.
There is a danger when the price is very low and when it gets very
high,'' Marit Arnstad, the Norwegian oil minister, said in Paris
Thursday.

   The ways in which Madonna will stir us up to get our attention
never cease to amaze me _ especially this time, when her pose seems
to be one of relatively uncharacteristic nonoffensiveness. Who
could object, after all, to a calm, respectful cover of the classic
``American Pie''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, just about every child of the 1960s and '70s who reveres
Don McLean's folksy original, probably. Madonna sings it as a lush,
danceable ballad in a hushed, breathy tone without regard to
phrasing or intent. It becomes less a pop-cultural coming-of-age
parable and more just a pretty song. Objections? None here; I never
liked ``American Pie'' anyway, and I appreciate that she brought
out the music in it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she shows she can assemble a pretty good soundtrack
disc (she executive-produced). She includes another pretty new song
of hers, ``Time Stood Still.'' She includes good cuts from Moby and
Groove Armada, a nifty remake of 10cc by female-fronted electronica
band Olive and an amusing little Euroditty from Manu Chao.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dignified centerpiece is ``Stars All Seem to Weep''
by up-to-date folksinger Beth Orton. Her red-wine voice reminds the
listener that she's the only artist on a record full of popsters.
Madonna, knowing this, might be even braver and smarter than we
thought.

   TRIO 99 &QR; 00

</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   It is an unassuming disc, this latest from guitarist Pat
Metheny, on break from his group to lead a trio. The CD comes in a
simple gray package, with plain typography and no liner notes. Its
only concession to vanity is the rainbow burst of color on the disc
itself. But even after a single listen, it's clear that the music _
the simpatico burst of creativity _ does not need fancy packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably Metheny's most straight-ahead jazz album since 1990's
trio document ``Question and Answer,'' the new record spotlights
younger players Larry Grenadier (bass) and Bill Stewart (drums),
who bring a subtle edginess and a funkier take on their playing.
</P>
<P>
   Metheny charges out of the gate with a new original, ``Go Get
It,'' then steps back to offer a slower, more unusual take on John
Coltrane's ``Giant Steps,'' drawing out chords and expanding
spaces. Three more Metheny compositions follow before a clever
rendition of Wayne Shorter's ``Capricorn.'' Several songs later,
strong versions of two old Metheny-Lyle Mays compositions complete
``Trio 99 &QR; 00.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Grenadier provide a thoughtful counterpoint to
Metheny, who plays no-frills jazz guitar _ it's almost as if he's
standing back to let the music discover itself. The album winds its
way through several moods and styles, showing a panoramic view of
the trio's range.

   None of these songs, with the exception of the new Bob Dylan
tune, ``Things Have Changed,'' needs much of a review to speak for
it. They have withstood the test of time and have gotten their due.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishment here is the compilation. Together, the songs'
philosophical leanings intensify, creating a contemplative album
that looks at the challenges of love and life through a bittersweet
lens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things Have Changed'' sets the tone, as it picks up the
swampy, blues feel from Dylan's last studio album, ``Time Out of
Mind.'' The song reveals a Dylan who is as at home with a groove as
he is with poetics. The album continues down a path of
self-exploration and earnest yearning with three older Dylan tunes
_ ``Shooting Star,'' ``Not Dark Yet and'' ``Buckets of Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Other 1960s icons on the disc are John Lennon, represented by
``Watching the Wheels''; Buffalo Springfield (``A Child's Claim to
Fame''); Neil Young (``Old Man'') and Tim Hardin (``Reason to
Believe''). In his own way, each of these figures has struggled
with fame and redemption _ as the movie's central character must.
Van Morrison's ``Philosophers Stone,'' closing the album, is a
standout, as well.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, the selection of tunes suggests that the fight to
decipher the reasons behind the chaos of life may mean more than
the result.

   The compilation ``Grammy Rap Nominees'' is designed to cash in

you're supposed to buy again.
</P>
<P>
   Irony surrounds this disc. At the Grammy ceremonies Feb. 23, the
big winner in the rap categories was Eminem, who took home awards
for Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song. He didn't even attend the
event, although the disc includes two of his songs (``My Name Is''
and ``Guilty Conscience,'' with Dr. Dre). The awards are annually
maligned as much as the Oscars, so for the folks behind the Grammys
to release albums is wildly funny: ``I know, let's get all of the
lame songs that we nominated and put 'em on CD.'' Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a companion disc out called ``Grammy Pop Nominees
2000.'' It pushes acts such as Ricky Martin, TLC, Lou Bega and, of
course, Carlos Santana.
</P>
<P>
   The only good thing about the Grammys and rap this year is is
that Smith didn't collect any statuettes. ``Big Willie'' has a way
of winning these things nearly every time he is nominated. The
Roots did win, so maybe there is justice.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not: This disc hasn't disintegrated yet.

<P>
   With her big-label debut, ``Kansas,'' Jennifer Knapp deserved
the attention she received, including being named best new artist
by the Gospel Music Association. She provided a folk-rock passion
lacking from women in Christian music.
</P>
<P>
   Her second Gotee Records release, ``Lay It Down,'' whets the
appetite. The first radio single, ``A Little More,'' effectively
articulates _ without cliches _ the confusing truths of grace and
sin, and Knapp's vocal is appropriately thick with pain, longing
and hope. Still, though the arrangement starts sparsely with
acoustic guitar, strings swell into a distraction on the bridge.
Knapp doesn't need the musical emotional baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Her low-key backing vocals on the title track expose how easy
Knapp makes it seem. ``Usher Me Down'' is a great, completely
different worship song with a Chris Isaak musical feel. ``Into
You'' carves vivid imagery and contradictions in a straight-on
rocker.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of Shawn Colvin's ``Diamond in the Rough''
fittingly links Knapp with other rootsy women songwriters whose
vulnerability and strength coexist somewhat uneasily. For those
more attuned to Christian music, ``When Nothing Satisfies,'' penned
with Margaret Becker, makes a similar connection. Jennifer Knapp is
earning her place.

   It's easy for mainstream hip-hop fans to dismiss Detroit's Natas
for its heavy reliance on rock music. Acid rap, as made by Natas,
Kid Rock and Insane Clown Posse, deviates from the hip-hop norm,
which long has favored R&AMP;B. But Natas proves there is a place for
other genres in the dynamic world of hip-hop. Natas' 21-cut album
``WWW.Com'' (Overcore) must be treated like a buffet meal: Purists
may pass over many of the tracks, while some songs, including
``Oriental Spas,'' ``Levitation,'' ``Forever Fly'' and ``Funeral,''
merit a second helping. The best bits deserve to go beyond cult

tracks and standard production. She's even got that tired,
single-name thing going. Maybe on her next one, she will give us
her full name.

BRITAIN ALLOWS PINOCHET TO RETURN TO CHILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Seventeen months after he arrived for surgery in what
he thought was a friendly capital, former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet left London Thursday a free but broken man, ending an epic
diplomatic and legal tug of war.
</P>
<P>
   The episode divided Britain and put despots worldwide on notice
that they can be held accountable anywhere for human rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours of the announcement by Jack Straw, Britain's
home secretary, that the 84-year-old Pinochet was too physically
and mentally feeble to be extradited to Spain to face torture
charges, the former dictator was bundled into a minivan at the
mansion where he had been held under house arrest for more than a
year. Under a police escort, he was whisked to a Royal Air Force
base in Lincolnshire, where he boarded a Chilean government jet
that had been waiting for him since January.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's supporters said the jet would arrive in Santiago, the
Chilean capital, Friday, when Pinochet is expected to check into a
military hospital.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that Pinochet's condition meant he could not
receive a fair trial ``in any country,'' Straw said the former
dictator's arrest and the legal precedents that followed produced
``a landmark judgment in human rights law, whose impact has been
felt far beyond our shores.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The case,'' Straw told the House of Commons, ``has
established, beyond question, the principle that those who commit
human rights abuses in one country cannot assume that they are safe
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of the legal drama, Pinochet's hurried
departure from Britain was something of an anticlimax. While a
handful of anti-Pinochet protesters demonstrated near the mansion
in Surrey and outside the air base, even those who had fought
fiercely to bring him to trial had resigned themselves to the
reality that Pinochet would be released.
</P>
<P>
   Straw said in January that he was inclined to release Pinochet
after a team of four doctors concluded he was too incapacitated to
defend himself. Even Pinochet's most implacable foes acknowledged
that the last seven weeks of legal wrangling, in which Straw was
forced to give the medical reports to Spain and three other
European countries that sought Pinochet's extradition, had only
postponed the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to move on,'' said a crestfallen Luis
Macchiavello, a Chilean exile who was tortured during the Pinochet
regime and leads the Families of the Disappeared, which represents
relatives of some 3,000 people who died or vanished at the hands of
Pinochet's regime.
</P>
<P>
   Macchiavello said Pinochet's victims would now channel their
energy into getting him tried in Chile, where Pinochet faces 59
civil suits for murder and torture committed during and after the
1973 coup in which he seized power.
</P>
<P>
   They face an uphill struggle. Pinochet enjoys immunity from
prosecution in Chile because he was made senator-for-life under a
compromise that saw him step down as dictator in exchange for a
return to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely doubtful he will be tried in Chile,'' said Jose
Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division for
Human Rights Watch, one of the groups that mounted a tenacious
legal battle to extradite Pinochet to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights activists like Vivanco insisted that Pinochet's
release in no way diminishes the precedent established in the fight
to hold the former dictator accountable for human rights violations
committed by his regime.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium's foreign minister, Louis Michel, whose country also
sought Pinochet's extradition along with France and Switzerland,
said the international community had shown that heads of state may
be held accountable outside their own nations and can no longer
rely on the principle of sovereign immunity to escape
accountability for acts of repression against their citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have demonstrated that a dictator is not out of the reach
of justice,'' Michel said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ruling by England's highest court, the Law Lords, that
Pinochet did not enjoy immunity as a head of state that is seen as
the most significant and lasting legacy of this convoluted legal
and diplomatic saga.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a warrant issued by Baltasar Garzon, a crusading
Spanish judge, British police arrested Pinochet on Oct. 16, 1998,
as he recovered from back surgery in a London hospital. Just days
before his arrest, Pinochet had enjoyed cocktails at the home of
Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister who regarded
him as a friend and staunch ally of Britain during its 1982 war
with Argentina over the Falkland Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was held for 17 months _ a month for every year of his
military dictatorship _ in a case that divided Britain and strained
its relations with Chile, which argued that Britain had no right to
intervene in what Chile called a domestic matter. While
conservatives like Thatcher admire Pinochet as a steadfast ally who
wrested Chile from the control of a pro-communist regime, he is an
object of hate to many British liberals who supported Salvador
Allende, the elected socialist president who was overthrown and
killed in a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the strong emotions on both sides of the
ideological aisle, Straw was greeted with shouts of ``Shame'' in
the House of Commons as he explained his decision.
</P>
<P>
   As Britain's top law enforcement official, Straw, who as a
college student in the 1970s led protests against Pinochet, held
the power singlehandedly to send Pinochet to Spain or home to
Chile. He said he had received 70,000 letters and e-mails, nearly
all of which urged him to extradite Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am all too well aware that the practical consequence of
refusing to extradite Senator Pinochet to Spain is that he will
probably not be tried anywhere,'' Straw said. ``I am very conscious
of the sense of injury which will be felt by those who suffered''
under Pinochet. But, he concluded, the medical evidence forced him
to let Pinochet go.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader William Hague said the government's decision
to authorize Pinochet's arrest, then to dither before eventually
freeing him, was a ``shambolic'' scandal that had tarnished
Britain's reputation and cost taxpayers more than $6 million. Straw
said the only bill tallied so far was a legal one of $2.2 million,
but he said it was too early to estimate how much had been spent
providing round-the-clock police protection for Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government would review its extradition law to see
whether there was any way to make the process less prone to long
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's High Court initially ruled that Pinochet was immune
from prosecution because he was a head of state when the crimes
were committed. But in the final appeal, the Law Lords ruled that
so-called sovereign immunity did not apply to cases of murder and
torture. That precedent-setting ruling, however, was set aside
because the judge who cast the deciding vote of the five-judge
panel had failed to disclose his association with Amnesty
International, one of the parties to the case. A different panel of
Law Lords then issued a similar decision.
</P>
<P>
   Straw then began formal extradition proceedings last April, but
they bogged down in a series of appeals. In the meantime,
Pinochet's health began to fail and he had a series of minor
strokes, leading Straw to ask a panel of doctors to examine him.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Pinochet had been extradited, tried, and convicted, he
would not have gone to prison because Spain prohibits the
incarceration of anyone over 75. Still, those who demanded that
Pinochet stand trial believed the sight of him in the dock would
serve as a powerful deterrent to other despots bent on using murder
and torture to control their citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Alegria, a Chilean exile here who helped organize vigils
and protests against Pinochet, spoke for many of the regime's
victims when he said they felt cheated by his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is seeing the compassion he never showed to his victims,''
Alegria said.

&HT;     HOORAY FOR THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Declaration of Independence is the first rock
of our democracy, setting forth a revolutionary ideal condemning
lordly oppression of the masses and envisioning the freedom of all
citizens to improve their lot through ability and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Its premise was that ``all men are created equal,'' a vision of
fundamental human rights toward which we are morally and
historically committed to constantly strive _ even though we were
far from it in the 18th century and may never, ever fully achieve
it.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, we know all that. Our Founding Fathers were good
guys.
</P>
<P>
   So why the history lesson from a contemporary political column?
Because modern-day politics has gone out of whack where this great
document is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   African-American legislators in New Jersey are fighting a
legislative proposal to stimulate patriotism that would require
local schoolchildren to recite part of the Declaration: ``We hold
these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   These bold words were written by Thomas Jefferson and approved
by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, in the middle of a
revolution against British rule that was tough-going, its outcome
dicey. Lexington and Concord had fired up the colonial spirit, but
Yorktown was yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   That declaration more than 200 years later has taken on a
meaning to civil rights activists that ignores the forest for the
trees. Instead of seeing a brave struggle to free the colonies from
oppressive foreign rule and taxation without representation, they
see only that Jefferson and other southern plantation owners kept
slaves to work their fields.
</P>
<P>
   They have no sense of the nation's history, only that of their
own skin color. They do not see the Declaration of Independence as
a set of idealistic principles but as a racist document.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey state Sen. Wayne Bryan, who is black, protested,
``You have the nerve to ask my grandchildren to recite (the
Declaration.) How dare you? You are now on notice that this is
offensive to my community.''
</P>
<P>
   This is sad. I want to weep. The bill's proponents ``dare''
because it is important for children of all races to remember the
great humanitarian principles that our nation is based on.
</P>
<P>
   Perfection is the enemy of the good here. Rewriting history is a
mistake. We cannot put 21st century sensibilities into the heads of
18th century white men whose dreams and actions were limited by the
imperative of forming a united republic. They set a noble goal
although they could not meet it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery, of course, was evil. But it was entrenched in the
South. It took a civil war almost a century later to finally
achieve emancipation. The Founding Fathers were supposed to resolve
it and beat off the British at the same time?
</P>
<P>
   Slave-holders and abolitionists were forced to cooperate in the
greater goal of forming a self-governing union that could shake off
the British yoke. Jefferson actually included in his first draft a
clause condemning the practice of ``enslaving the inhabitants of
Africa,'' but it was struck by South Carolina and Georgia, which
intended to continue importing slaves.
</P>
<P>
   From the wisdom of old age in 1823, Jefferson wrote to a friend
that slavery ``is a hideous blot I believe that the necessity of
removing this evil gains ground with time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other colonists were also excluded during the 18th century from
the dream of equal opportunity by virtue of their gender or by
their failure to own property. Women were not officially slaves,
but their role was not much better. They were unable to vote or own
property, and husbands were legally permitted to abuse them. White
men and families too poor to own property were also denied a voice
in governing. Like slavery, these officially sanctioned inequities
have been eliminated with time.
</P>
<P>
   But before injustice can be rectified, there must be a public
national commitment to do so. That is what the Declaration of
Independence did for us from the very beginning of our nationhood.
It is offensive to find that offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights activists have campaigned to end reminders of
slavery in many ways in many places in recent years, from taking
down the Confederate flag that flies over the South Carolina
statehouse to removing the name of historic figures who were
slave-holders from school buildings. This is not going to change
residual racial discrimination one bit, but if it makes people feel
better, that's okay.
</P>
<P>
   And the extent to which state legislatures can require students
to repeat the Declaration of Independence may be limited. The
Supreme Court ruled in 1943 that West Virginia schools could not
compel students to salute and recite the pledge of allegiance to
the flag, because the refusal to do so was a form of speech
protected under the Bill of Rights. The New Jersey law, if
compulsory, could face the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is to encourage schoolchildren to express their
patriotism and love for their country by reciting the Declaration
of Independence, but not mandate it. This, by the way, would be a
more useful and fitting document to hang on the wall than the Ten
Commandments, which preach individual morality but not equality and
human rights. It still is, after all, our country, right or wrong.

   PINOCHET (London) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet was allowed to fly
home to Chile Thursday after Britain dropped extradition
proceedings against him and put an end to his 16 months of house
arrest in England. The decision to free the 84-year-old former
dictator was announced by Home Secretary Jack Straw, who told the
House of Commons that he was ending the complex legal and judicial
case because of the failing health of Pinochet. By Warren Hoge.

Pinochet's return, and a look at the legal situation for the former

<P>
   AUSTRIA-HAIDER (Bad Kleinkircheim, Austria) _ To his supporters,
Joerg Haider's message has less to do with Nazi revisionism or
anti-immigrant vitriol than with market reform. It is about less
state. Deregulation. Sweeping privatizations. Reduced bureaucracy.
An end to the division of the spoils in Austria among members of
the long-dominant Social Democratic and conservative People's
parties. This is a popular view in Austria. About one-third of the
support that took Haider's Freedom Party into national government
in February for the first time comes from entrepreneurs,
particularly in the small companies that dominate the Austrian
economy. By Roger Cohen. 1,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   HSIA-TRIAL (Washington) _ A federal jury on Thursday convicted
Maria Hsia, a longtime political fundraiser for Vice President Al
Gore, on all five felony counts she faced for her role in arranging
more than $100,000 in illegal donations to Democratic candidates in
1996. Of that amount, $55,000 came in illegal donations to the
Democratic National Committee in connection with the vice
president's much-criticized 1996 visit to a Buddhist temple in the
Los Angeles area. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIAN-RIGHT (Atlanta) _ It is hard to know how many Bob
Harrisons are out there. But each one is a nightmare for Sen. John
McCain. Harrison, a 60-year-old electrical engineer and a leader of
the choir at Atlanta's Mt. Paran Church of God, was once an
enthusiastic McCain supporter. He liked his heroic military
background. He liked his positions on education and health care.
And he liked his penchant for straight talk. ``I was really pulling
for him,'' Harrison said. ``He was the guy.'' That all changed this
week. Harrison, who considers himself a Christian conservative
voter, was deeply offended by McCain's attacks on Pat Robertson and
Jerry Falwell, whom the Arizona Republican described in a Monday
speech as ``agents of intolerance'' comparable to Louis Farrakhan
and Al Sharpton. ``I think he was out of line,'' Harrison said. Now
Harrison is leaning toward voting for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
in Tuesday's Republican primary in Georgia. By Kevin Sack. (1400

   CINDY-MCCAIN (Cincinnati) _ For months now, more than any other
presidential candidate's wife, Cindy McCain has been a regular on
the campaign trail. Through 14-hour work days, she is almost
constantly at her husband's elbow, smiling as she double-steps to
keep up with him in crowds, and nodding at just the right moments
during the speech she has heard hundreds of times. A profile by
Melinda Henneberger. (2000 words)

   NY-POLICE-SHOOTING (New York) _ An unarmed Bronx man who was
fatally shot by the police Wednesday night had a long criminal
history, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said, as he took pains to say the
shooting should not be likened to the killing of Amadou Diallo. The
latest shooting, which took place two blocks from where Diallo was
killed, ignited another round of protests as intense as those over
the Diallo shooting. In both shootings, the police were in
plainclothes and were approaching a building at night, and in both
instances the people they killed were unarmed. By Robert D.
McFadden.

   PALM-IPO (San Francisco) _ Shares of Palm Inc. surged in their
trading debut Thursday, rising as high as $165 from an offering
price of $38 before retreating. Shares in Palm's parent, 3Com
Corp., declined, although 3Com still holds 94 percent of Palm after
the offering. By Lawrence M. Fisher.

NEW ZEALAND'S PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For only the third time in its 150 years, the America's Cup has
gone to a non-American boat. For the first time, a foreign defender
_ New Zealand _ defended successfully. This year, also for the
first time, not even the losing boat was American.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's Black Magic won with grace and precision and
apparent ease, leaving Italy's Red Moon (Luna Rossa) and several
lessons in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian crew entered the finals in high hopes that may have
heeled over into overconfidence. They thought they had the faster
boat. And, after winning two tough series against 10 other
challengers, they felt a competitive edge. But their tactical
errors turned out to be the major difference.
</P>
<P>
   Moral: Hopes do not produce results unless matched by
performance.
</P>
<P>
   A larger lesson has to do with national pride. Sailing's
greatest prize is named for the boat that won the first race,
beating the English yacht Aurora and 14 other boats in a 60-mile
race around the Isle of Wight in 1851. The cup does not belong to
the United States, but the sense of mastery became so great as the
United States defeated 24 challengers that some began to feel it
did.
</P>
<P>
   When the first race was sailed, the British Empire was near its
peak, including major possessions on all six inhabited continents.
New Zealand had been added to the empire only 11 years earlier.
England was the world leader in large part because it had no
challenger as a maritime power.
</P>
<P>
   The United States at that time was gaining stature
internationally, but struggling for its soul domestically. The
Civil War was just a decade away.
</P>
<P>
   So, for more than a century after the American yacht prevailed
in England, national pride was palpable. One American writer in
1974 compared the cup to Mount Everest, Excalibur, and the Holy
Grail, calling it ``the most prized sporting honor in the world . .
. an object symbolizing power and invincibility.'' Today, America
is the world leader, but the America's Cup belongs in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Moral: In this era of globalization, America has much to teach
and much to learn. Today, yachting and humility may be counted
among the latter.

CAUTION ON BREAST IMPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through all the controversy about the safety of silicone-gel
breast implants, little attention was paid to the alternative,
saline implants. Lest anyone think this is because they have a
clean bill of health, the Food and Drug Administration is hearing
evidence this week of problems with these devices.
</P>
<P>
   The problems do not justify banning implants, but they do make a
strong argument for more research. Thursday's recommendation by an
FDA advisory panel that women be warned of the complications of
implants is supported by the data _ much of it compiled by the
manufacturers themselves. Surgeons must provide women with the
latest information about implants and then give them a waiting
period so they can consider the pros and cons at home and give
truly informed consent.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, this kind of FDA hearing would have taken place 30
years ago, before the implants came on the market. But the FDA did
not gain authority to approve medical devices like this until 1976.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the FDA ruled that silicone-gel implants should be
limited to women who have had mastectomies and not used for
cosmetic breast augmentations because of many problems, including
leaks and infections. However, the FDA did not find that the
implants were causing systemic disease. Last year, the Institute of
Medicine confirmed that silicone implants did not cause major
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   As for saline implants _ saltwater in a silicone shell _ they
often rupture, deflate, or infect the breast tissue, requiring
repeat surgeries. They also make tumor detection by mammograms more
difficult. According to a study by implant-maker Mentor Corp., 9.2
percent of implants given women after a mastectomy rupture and
deflate within three years, and 24 percent of recipients suffered
breast hardening from scar tissue. For women undergoing breast
augmentation, the rate of complications was lower.
</P>
<P>
   But the manufacturers also point to data showing women are
highly satisfied with their implants, in spite of the difficulties.
That speaks to a demand the implants can fill. What's crucial is
making sure that women have valid data, preferably from impartial
sources, before choosing implant surgery.

A TEACHABLE MOMENT ON GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's children are more vulnerable to death by firearm than
any other industrialized country in the world. In 1996, 19 children
were killed by guns in England, none in Japan, 153 in Canada, and
5,285 _ that is not a typo _ in the United States. Every child's
death is tragic, but the murder Tuesday of a 6-year-old Michigan
girl by her schoolmate is an incident to galvanize public attention
on the woeful state of the nation's gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason for the shocking toll guns take is their
ubiquity. So long as there is a gun for everyone in America _ 200
million in circulation _ this country will top the grim charts of
deadly violence. Some states, including Virginia, Maryland, and
California, have laws restricting gun purchases to one a month. Gun
buyback programs are also a small step toward reducing the
country's arsenal of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, action can be taken to keep the guns out of
the wrong hands. If Michigan had a child access protection (CAP)
law, as Massachusetts has, it would be easier to prosecute the
adults who neglected to keep the stolen .32 semiautomatic
inaccessible to the young boy. It may not have prevented this
particular tragedy, but a study by the Journal of the American
Medical Association found that CAP laws requiring loaded guns to be
stored in locked containers have reduced accidental gun deaths of
children by over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gun manufacturers must also bear some responsibility for the
Michigan crime. Instead of investing research dollars into new ways
to make their products more lethal or concealable, manufacturers
should work toward perfecting safety locks and identification
systems that can make sure the guns are fired only by their owners.
</P>
<P>
   Automobiles driven recklessly also kill plenty of children every
year. But every car in this country must be registered and every
driver licensed, and every gun and owner should be as well. Cars
are also covered by consumer safety laws, unlike guns. It strains
credulity that products designed to kill continue to be so poorly
regulated.

MCCAIN CAMPAIGN RIGHT IN STEP ON STATEN ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - If further proof were needed that Sen. John McCain is
running an uncommon campaign for the March 7 Republican primary
here, just look where he's put his New York State headquarters _ in
Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, candidates have their main offices amid the bustle of
Manhattan or in the state capital of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Staten Island _ the most remote, the smallest, the least urban,
the least New Yorkish of New York City's five boroughs, with only
380,000 people (5 percent of the city's total population) _ tends
not just to get passed over, but overlooked entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time a campaign headquarters has ever been
here,'' Guy Molinari, the borough president, said Thursday, a
little mist in his eye. ``Usually, candidates don't even come
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinari is also McCain's New York campaign manager, and he
finds an exquisite justice in the fact that the headquarters is
here. For, according to statewide polls, McCain is slightly ahead
of the establishment candidate, George W. Bush, and it feels like a
David-Goliath contest, racheted up to the third power.
</P>
<P>
   All three share an underdog's, even an outcast's, reputation:
</P>
<P>
   --McCain, the insurgent who threatens to blow up his party's
links with corporate soft money;
</P>
<P>
   --Molinari, the 71-year-old, eccentric pol who thumbs his nose
at the state GOP bosses, who stand otherwise united behind McCain's
rival, George W. Bush;
</P>
<P>
   --And Staten Island itself, which so loathes the city, of which
it is a part, that two-thirds of its residents voted a few years
ago to secede. (It was a non-binding referendum.)
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is fairly mutual. Those who live in the other four
boroughs rarely come to Staten Island, except to pass through on
the Interstate. Until 1964, when the Verrazano Bridge was built,
the only way to get to Staten Island was by ferry from Manhattan or
driving through New Jersey from Brooklyn or the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   To most New Yorkers, Staten Island is known for having the
world's largest garbage dump, one of the world's best guitar stores
(Mandolin Bros.), a once-notorious mental hospital (Willowbrook),
Frank Lloyd Wright's ugliest house, and little more.
</P>
<P>
   Its fortunes have been turning a bit lately. New York City's
Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, has treated the borough well.
Staten Island gave him his margin of victory in 1993, when he first
won the mayor's seat. In return, he promised to shut down the
garbage dump by 2002, and lately agreed to build an expensive
minor-league baseball stadium for the forthcoming Staten Island
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about this primary is unusual, beginning with the
fact that it's the first time in 20 years that the New York
Republican primary has been seriously contested at all.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear why Molinari, who once stood with Bush as solidly
as his brethren, split off last autumn to endorse McCain. Some
chalk it up to a bruised ego. A decade ago, Molinari was the state
campaign manager for Bush's father. He expected the same role in
George W.'s, so this theory goes, and stomped off when Gov. George
Pataki drew the honors.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari insists he simply grew ``disenchanted'' with Bush, and
thought McCain the better candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the real reason, McCain would be nowhere in this state
without him. It was Molinari who formally filed the lawsuit that
succeeded in putting McCain's name on every primary ballot after
the party bosses tried to disqualify him in nearly half the state's
election-districts.
</P>
<P>
   That was how the headquarters came to Staten Island. ``It was
not by design,'' Molinari explained.
</P>
<P>
   During the fight to get on the ballot _ first through
circulating petitions, then through filing the suit _ Molinari
could not legally make calls from Borough Hall. So the campaign,
which had almost no money, rented an office across the street.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain won New Hampshire and the campaign here took off,
it was easier to expand into adjoining suites than to rent space in
a more central location.
</P>
<P>
   As with most McCain operations _ which have had a hard time
keeping pace with its grassroots growth _ the headquarters in
Staten Island has a decidedly shabby look about it.
</P>
<P>
   Just over the past couple weeks, two offices expanded into a
suite of five, all of them sorely in need of renovation: plaster
peeling, tiles flaking, sockets exposed. Multiple computer lines
entered the picture last week. ``McCain 2000'' buttons were printed
up Thursday. New phone banks were installed the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's three steps up from a tin can and a string,'' said Gerry
O'Brien, the campaign coordinator, as he watched a volunteer
struggle with a defective switch.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, though, this campaign depends critically on high
technology. Lacking access to the state party's rosters and other
resources, McCain's team has built up strength almost entirely
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raise money, recruit delegates, and train volunteers over
the Internet,'' O'Brien said. ``A lot of our delegates, we've never
met. It would have been very difficult to find them without the
Internet. Four years ago, this campaign would have been impossible.
The technology didn't exist.''

HARVARD PILGRIM OFF LIFE SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, which seemed on the brink of
collapse two months ago, will soon be out of receivership if the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court accepts Thursday's
recommendation of Attorney General Thomas Reilly and Insurance
Commissioner Linda Ruthardt. The action is a tribute to the
recovery program being implemented by Harvard Pilgrim executives
and the confidence that receivership has given plan members in its
viability.
</P>
<P>
   While the short-term prognosis for the plan is improved, its
long-term prospects are far from clear, and the state will have to
examine whether health plans and the providers of care have
adequate resources to do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Reilly and Ruthardt's approach is that it does not
require Harvard Pilgrim to be sold to a for-profit company, a
transaction that would have undermined the strong nonprofit culture
of health care in Massachusetts. And it also does not require
anyone to invest in the plan, whether through surplus notes of
dubious value to hospitals or contributions from Harvard University
or Ross Perot, whose company is revamping the Harvard Pilgrim
information system.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of any of these investors means that the plan is
heavily reliant on premiums from customers. Its survival depends on
retaining most of its members as it raises rates to pay off its
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly and Ruthardt promise to continue their oversight of the
plan, which ought to insure there will be no surprises on the order
of the extra $34 million in losses uncovered in January. Neither
can do much to solve the basic problem of health care in
Massachusetts. Most providers think they are underpaid, even though
health care costs are extremely high. And hundreds of thousands of
people lack health insurance while the economy booms.
</P>
<P>
   The Cellucci administration was wise to establish four task
forces to explore a comprehensive approach. Their jobs are
formidable: to retain the nonprofit philanthropic orientation of
the system; develop policies that provide adequate compensation for
hospitals, physicians, and other providers; reduce the number of
uninsured; and make sure that the Harvard Pilgrim financial crisis
is never repeated. Formidable tasks, but essential.

BRADLEY APPEALS TO DEMOCRATS IN COSTLY TV `INFOMERCIAL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ Democratic presidential contender Bill
Bradley bought some precious national television exposure Thursday
to call the Democratic Party home to its roots.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Thursday in Connecticut, Bradley said he will
concentrate his weekend campaign on the northeast, where ``there
are states I can win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, even though he seemed to be cruising as polls show him
leading in every Super Tuesday state, joined Bradley in that
region, pushing his education ideas in New York and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   At an estimated cost of $1 million, Bradley used a five-minute,
``infomercial'' on CBS to take his appeal directly to voters across
the country. Several days ago, Bradley bemoaned the fact that he
has enjoyed little national television news coverage, following his
loss to Gore in the New Hampshire primary and the emergence of
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore have had two nationally televised debates in as
many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, Bradley pressed his case for why the nation needs a
more committed alternative to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the economy's good, but I don't think that's enough,'' he
said. ``It's no accident of history that we are discussing, in this
election today, the same issues that we talked about eight years
ago and four years ago _ and after each election, failed to use the
great opportunity given us by our economic prosperity; to teach the
young, care for the sick, clean the environment and heal the racial
divide.``
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won the presidential races four and eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said that if the Democratic Party is controlled by
special interests and strays from its mission to ``give voice to
the voiceless'' and represent all parts of society, ``then we have
forfeited the meaning, the reason, for the Democratic Party.``
</P>
<P>
   Gore read a storybook to P.S. 163's kindergarten class on
Manhattan's Upper West Side. Gore told a tiny, crammed room filled
with educators that he's determined to improve school facilities,
student-teacher ratios and teacher performance without burdening
local school districts with federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come here on the eve of the all-important New York
primary to reaffirm my top priority is education. If you entrust me
with the presidency, I will fight for you. I will fight for
revolutionary improvements in schools,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming his fire at a general-election opponent, ``The Republican
candidates have both supported draining money away from public
schools at a time when more is needed. They seem to think that just
because New York schools begin with 'PS' that education is an
after-thought. It's not,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who enjoys strong union backing, said teachers are
unfairly portrayed as opponents of accountability in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's a sensitive subject. Some in the public have the
misimpression that teachers and their organizations don't want to
see anybody ever get fired. But what they want is due process and
for protection against arbitrary or political personnel
decision-making,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley advertisement, which competed with the top-rated NBC
show ``ER'' for viewers, could reach about 7 million voters across
the nation in advance of Tuesday's primaries and elections in 16
states, Bradley aides said.
</P>
<P>
   With Connecticut on the list of states that vote next week,
Bradley conducted a rally in Bridgeport a few hours before the
commercial was broadcast. Reflecting the relatively conciliatory
approach he took against Gore in a Los Angeles debate Wednesday, he
refrained from making the kind of aggressive attacks against Gore
that were a staple of Bradley's speeches just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   And in interviews with local TV news crews here and in New York,
Bradley fended off suggestions that he will soon quit the race in
the face Gore's dominant lead in surveys of Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his message to voters in Connecticut, Bradley said,
``Don't listen to the pollsters or the pundits. Vote your heart,
vote your conscience, vote for a new politics.``
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he doesn't plan to quit the race and is fighting
mightily for votes, Bradley invoked his career as a professional
basketball player in New York and senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in these places before, when nobody thought you can
do it, and I did it. So it doesn't bother me,'' he said.

 &HT;    Law firm that battled Citadel discussing gift
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Two old foes, The Citadel and the New York law
firm that led Shannon Faulkner's courtroom assault against the
males-only corps of cadets, are negotiating a sizable contribution
to help female cadets.
</P>
<P>
   The Citadel said Shearman &AMP; Sterling suggested a donation of
$300,000, a figure that both sides hope to nail down in a meeting
in Charleston a week from today. The negotiations raise a
potentially ticklish question. In exchange for the gift, would
Shearman &AMP; Sterling _ or Faulkner _ deserve a public
acknowledgement, such as an honorary plaque on the campus once
hostile to the prospect of women in the ranks?
</P>
<P>
   Here in Columbia, six Citadel graduates serving in the state
Legislature said they'd welcome Shearman &AMP; Sterling's contribution,
though two said they'd prefer it not celebrate Faulkner's
trailblazing role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think Faulkner ever intended to go to The Citadel,''
said 1964 graduate James Battle, a Democratic representative from
Nichols. ``She went down there for the publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Citadel alumnus, state Rep. Greg Delleney (D-Chester),
made that point bluntly. ``I do not think Shannon Faulkner did
anything to improve The Citadel,'' the 1974 graduate said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Black, a Charleston lawyer who represented Faulkner, now
a high school teacher in Greenville, said she remains a target of
``persistent hostility'' because some alumni believe ``she
destroyed The Citadel.''
</P>
<P>
   After a bitter 2 1/2-year court fight, a federal judge ordered
The Citadel to admit her. In August 1995, she enrolled as the
school's first female ``knob,'' but faltered on the first day of
Hell Week and quit in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a short-lived victory for The Citadel. The next
summer, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Virginia Military
Institute's males-only policy was unconstitutional, The Citadel's
Board of Visitors reversed its ban on females.
</P>
<P>
   Black said Faulkner deserves recognition, or, he said, ``Women
who enroll will someday want to know what was wrong with Shannon
Faulkner.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three women are now enrolled, and they have made The
Citadel a better college, said President John Grinalds, who arrived
at the school after the court fight.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the college nor Shearman &AMP; Sterling would discuss
how the law firm's gift might be acknowledged. In fact, both said
they hadn't given it much thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to make (a donation) or not make it based on
what it is called,'' Shearman &AMP; Sterling partner Henry Weisburg
said. ``There has been no discussion yet about apportioning
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Citadel spokeswoman Patricia McArver said school administrators
are concerned that a public discussion might ignite old hostilities
and snarl negotiations over what the college and the law firm said
should be a symbolic reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators agreed it's time for a truce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly hope we could let the issue die and move
on,'' said state Rep. Gresham Barrett (R-Westminster).
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the school is trying to raise millions of dollars
for major renovations and expansions, Barrett, a 1983 graduate
said, ``A gift like that for The Citadel is welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure they can figure out how to accept that gift,'' said
state Rep. James Harrison, a Columbia Republican and a 1973 Citadel
graduate. ``I would hope they would readily accept a gift to the
college from any source.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know why there would be any resistance,'' said
Allison Dean Wright, one of two women appointed as nonvoting
Citadel board members in 1997. She is running for an at-large,
voting seat on the Board of Visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Shearman &AMP; Sterling initially suggested that its
gift, drawn from the legal fees it won in The Citadel case, go
toward women's scholarships, McArver said.
</P>
<P>
   But the college, figuring that $300,000 invested conservatively
would generate little money for scholarships, countered that the
gift might be used for women's locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously are not in a position to turn $300,000 away,''
McArver said.
</P>
<P>
   Shearman &AMP; Sterling routinely donates the legal fees it wins in
cases, such as the one against The Citadel, in which it volunteers
its legal services for what it considers the public good, Weisburg
said.

PANEL INVESTIGATING BONFIRE TRAGEDY AT TEXAS A&AMP;M SEEKS MORE FUNDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The special commission investigating the deadly collapse of the
Texas A&AMP;M University Bonfire now says it may need to spend $2
million to figure out the cause of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   That amount is more than eight times what university officials
originally believed they would need to learn why the stack
collapsed Nov. 18, killing 12 people and injuring 27 others.
</P>
<P>
   The money will come from the university's investment fund _
money that typically is used for everything from emergencies to
travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston, said spending that much money
``is excessive, beyond what probably is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if that amount is needed, Wilson said, a commission
appointed by the school should not head the investigation. Instead,
the work should be done by an independent law enforcement agency,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was Texas Southern University and the same event had
occurred on that campus, it would be crawling with federal and
state and local officials looking at it,'' Wilson said. ``But A&AMP;M
has some politics on its side.''
</P>
<P>
   TSU is a largely black state university in Houston with about
7,000 students. More than 43,000 students attend Texas A&AMP;M at
College Station.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, whose district includes the A&AMP;M
campus, said Wilson is ``just flat wrong.'' Ogden is vice chairman
of the Senate Education Subcommittee on Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to drag Texas Southern and the racial issue into this
is totally inappropriate,'' Ogden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, A&AMP;M has no choice,'' he said. ``If they appoint an
independent commission and do not give them the assets they need,
it compromises the public perception.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to Wilson's comments, Texas A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen
released a statement that read:
</P>
<P>
   ``We share Representative Wilson's concern about the cost. We,
too, wish it didn't cost so much. We obviously wish, of course, the
tragedy had never occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's comments came a day after special commission Chairman
Leo Linbeck Jr. informed school officials that another $1 million
might be needed to complete an investigation. He also said the
commission will miss the March 31 deadline set by Bowen. The new
goal is the first week of May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep it at a high level of confidence so people are
sure we didn't leave anything out,'' Linbeck said. ``The gravity of
the tragedy and the injuries that ensued make it important that we
pursue the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, university officials appointed Linbeck to head
the special panel to determine why the 59-foot tower collapsed
before completion. The accident was the most tragic in the 90-year
tradition of the bonfire, which is burned before the annual
football game with the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Documents released by the school indicated that on Dec. 5, A&AMP;M
officials expected to spend $225,000 on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In January, after talking with consultants, Linbeck estimated
the cost would be about $500,000 to hire four firms to determine
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, A&AMP;M regents said they would spend as much as $1
million for the investigation, but they wanted to sign off on any
expenditures above that amount.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Linbeck told university officials the budget is
$1.67 million. However, he wants as much as $2 million needed.
</P>
<P>
   The money for the investigation is coming from university
investments, rather than tax dollars from the state's general
revenue fund. The university invests income from student fees and
other non-tax generated monies, and that income may be used for any
lawful purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In the days just after the tragedy, the school spent $292,000,
including about $90,000 to send students and administrators to
funerals.
</P>
<P>
   University regents have indicated they will approve the budget
increase Linbeck wants. The Houston construction magnate, who is an
alumnus of the University of Notre Dame, said the extra money
largely is needed to complete interviews with more witnesses and
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the companies handling the investigation want
financial protection should they be dragged into any ensuing
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism from Wilson, other lawmakers who oversee the
state's second-largest university said they had no problem with the
$2 million figure or the fact that the school is investigating
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Senate Education Chairman Teel Bivins said A&AMP;M is taking
the same approach that Johnson &AMP; Johnson did when the company faced
a scare that its product, Tylenol, was laced with cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnson &AMP; Johnson spared no expense to investigate their
product and the company did everything in the open,'' Bivins said.
``It appears to me that Texas A&AMP;M is doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time Wilson has spoken up about the Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he said he would seek a bill in the 2001 Legislature
to allow victims and their families to sue the school for more than
the state-mandated cap.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, governmental entities cannot be forced to pay
more than $500,000 to all those who suffered from anyone incident
the government is responsible for.
</P>
<P>
   No lawsuits have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, some associated with the school said Wilson was
getting even for a 1992 incident during which the Houston
legislator launched a fight against campus racism since an A&AMP;M
fraternity held a ``jungle party.'' That year, a student newspaper
depicted him as a small, black, yapping dog.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has said there is no vendetta, though he can understand
why some might say that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe that an independent law enforcement agency
would provide more accountability,'' he said.

US PROPOSES FOREST ROAD MAINTENANCE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another sign of the greening of the US Forest Service,
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman Thursday proposed a plan to
repair and maintain heavily used roads and close lightly used ones.
The proposal affects 380,000 miles of roads in America's 155
national forests and 20 grasslands, including New England's prized
Green Mountain and White Mountain national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the lightly traveled roads are little more than rutted
dirt trails built a half-century ago to enable logging trucks to
penetrate the dense, remote forests.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the US Forest Service faces an $8.4 billion backlog
in roadwork, because it gets only 20 percent of the funding needed
to maintain roads.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has recently come under intense pressure from
environmentalists, who say that increasing numbers of roads pose a
threat to forests.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers, bikers, snowmobile riders, and other outdoor enthusiasts
are increasingly using the roads. The White Mountains alone have
about 500 miles of road and receive 7 million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of timber groups and the delight of
environmentalists, Glickman and Forest Service chief Mike Dombeck
said Thursday that it is time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have 380,000 miles of roads and an $8.4 billion
backlog, what do you do?'' Dombeck said. ``You put the shovel down,
stop digging deeper, and really focus on what the priorities and
needs of the people are.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirt roads can erode into rivers and streams, altering water
temperatures and flows, obstructing fish and wildlife, and causing
other ecological harm, say environmentalists. The roads also
potentially endanger growing numbers of drivers, because many roads
don't meet safety standards, environmentalists say.
</P>
<P>
   But a top timber industry group said the proposal would drive a
wedge between Americans and their forests by limiting access. It is
one of several proposals the agency has made recently that amount
to redefining its mission to preserve forests rather than enabling
the public to use them, the industry group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're managing the forests for wilderness protection, and
that's not their mission,'' said Derek Jumper, a spokesman for the
American Forest and Paper Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear there will always be a place for roads in the
national forests,'' said Jay Watson, a Wilderness Society
spokesman. ``But it's high time the Forest Service put the brakes
on what has been a runaway road program, one that, with 380,000
miles, is now eight times the interstate highway system.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal differs from President Clinton's proposal last
October to protect 40 million acres of forests from new roads.
Thursday's proposal only involves existing roads. Work on the
proposal began in February 1999, when Dombeck declared a moratorium
on road building and repair until a policy could be put in place.
It is expected to be finalized by Sept. 1, following a 60-day
public comment period that begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Forest Service wants roads it can be proud of,'' Dombeck
said. ``And right now, that's not the case.''

FOR MANY AUSTRIANS, HAIDER'S APPEAL IS BLEND OF FREE MARKETS AND
FAMILY AID 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAD KLEINKIRCHHEIM, Austria _ Here in the midst of
picture-postcard Austria _ pine-clad slopes, sun glistening on the
snow, rosy-cheeked families sipping mulled wine _ it is something
of a surprise to encounter Matthias Krenn and his modern political
theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political populism is just modern marketing,'' Krenn said
casually as he sat in the lobby of one of the hotels he owns. ``In
politics today, you have to sell your services like any other
product. So you listen carefully to what each person wants and
respond accordingly. That is why Joerg Haider is such a successful
political marketer.''
</P>
<P>
   Krenn, 40, is a hotelier from the southern province of
Carinthia, the heartland of Haiderism, and a representative figure
of the young entrepreneurs who have helped thrust Haider's
catch-all Freedom Party to power. While the world tends to see
Haider as a xenophobic rightist, based on statements he has made,
Krenn sees him as Austria's belated answer to Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   For him, Haider's message has less to do with Nazi revisionism
or anti-immigrant vitriol than with market reform. It is about less
state. Deregulation. Sweeping privatizations. Reduced bureaucracy.
An end to the division of the spoils in Austria among members of
the long-dominant Social Democratic and conservative People's
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Krenn's is a popular view in Austria. About one-third of the
support that took the Freedom Party into national government in
February for the first time comes from entrepreneurs, particularly
in the small companies like the Krenn hotel group that dominate the
Austrian economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To understand Haider, you must see that he's a late edition of
the neo-conservative wave that totally passed Austria by in the
1980s and 1990s,'' said Lothar Hoebelt, a historian sympathetic to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Austria's political system was long distinguished by
immobility. During three decades of Social-Democratic-led rule,
stability came before market reform, and state jobs were useful to
reward political loyalty. The state still owns the national
telephone company and main tobacco corporation; as such, it is now
a European anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   But a look at how Haider operates in Carinthia, where he won 42
percent of the vote in the regional election last year, suggests
that promoting the free market is merely one ingredient of his
heady brew.
</P>
<P>
   Haider quit Feb. 28 as leader of the Freedom Party but retained
his post as governor of Carinthia. The resignation was widely seen
as a maneuver to shield himself from any unpopularity the new
government may encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Take Thatcherism, add a dose of Robin Hood, some designer
labels, a touch of Austria-first bigotry, a dollop of straight talk
and fanatical physical fitness, and the seductive magician of
modern European politics emerges, a man who has taken his party
from 4 to 27 percent of the vote in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Klagenfurt, seat of Haider's regional government,
``Joergs Treff'' is a popular meeting place. In this Freedom Party
office, young people can surf the Internet or play video games on
computers provided by the governor. Posters plastered on the
windows show a baby brandishing a check for 5,700 Schillings, about
$407.
</P>
<P>
   A bubble from the baby's mouth reads: ``This check can be cashed
with Governor Haider.'' It is a reference to Haider's promise to
hand out monthly checks to mothers with small children in order to
strengthen the family and boost Austria's falling birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   So, the prophet of leaner government, more individual
responsibility and tighter state budgets is also the proponent of
an ambitious new program of state handouts? Well, yes, so it seems,
if that is what brings in the votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children's check cannot be financed,'' said Franz Pacher,
a businessman who is president of the Carinthian Chamber of
Commerce and who opposes Haider. ``It could cost as much as $175
million a year, or close to one tenth of the state budget. But of
course the promise has won him a lot of popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Haider said the program could be financed and
that the checks would be paid: ``You see, on the one hand I am a
kind of Margaret Thatcher pushing lean government and the end of
party influence. On the other, I am a new Social Democrat, pushing
family values and taking care of the smaller people against the
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled his gleaming smile and added: ``That is why I like to
say that I am not to the left or the right of my opponents. I am
simply ahead of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how long Haider can stay ahead of the game, and continue to
appeal both to rising entrepreneurs and to the less privileged, who
like the look of his largesse, is the question now posed by the
Freedom Party's entry into government.
</P>
<P>
   Karl-Heinz Grasser, the 31-year-old national finance minister
and a home-grown Carinthian protege of Haider, is attempting to do
on a national scale something of what the party leader has done
locally.
</P>
<P>
   He has vowed to eliminate about 9,000 state jobs, sell off state
industries, raise the retirement age and reduce pensions for early
retirees in order to bring the budget deficit down to 1.7 percent
of Austria's total output from well over 2 percent. All doctrinaire
market-oriented policy straight out the textbook.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Grasser wants to increase state support for
the family by extending fully paid maternity and paternity leaves
and by introducing other measures that Haider said would include
extending the promised ``child checks'' to a national level. That
would cost close to $3 billion _ about what the finance minister
has promised to cut this year in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do it the American way,'' said Thomas Prinzhorn, a
prominent Freedom Party member of Parliament who owns a large paper
company. ``We're Austria's only free-market party. At the same
time, Haider feels passionate about the family and social justice,
so we have to balance these things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Haiderian ``balance'' appears to involve other elements.
Michael Stattman, a Klagenfurt businessman, said that when Grasser
was in charge of economic policy in Carinthia, he tried to impose
an ``Austrians-first'' principle on hiring for building sites in
the province. This angered some entrepreneurs, who faced the loss
of cheaper foreign labor.
</P>
<P>
   Prinzhorn has also made some notable anti-foreigner statements,
including a remark during the national election campaign last year
that foreigners in Austria were getting free hormone treatment from
the country's health services ``in order to increase their
fertility.'' He has since apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Max Hofmann, a leader of a business group supporting Haider
called the Circle of Freedom Party Enterprises, said there was
nothing xenophobic about such remarks or the party's approach to
business. Both simply reflected the fact that, in a small country,
``We can only invite in foreign people when we have enough work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, the owner of a central-heating business, said the
Freedom Party is a post-ideological party that wants to scale back
the state but also to appeal to workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think in terms of appealing either to workers or to
entrepreneurs is the thinking of the past,'' he said. ``There is no
more class struggle. There is only the joint interest of workers
and management in making Austria a good place to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Haider has been highly successful in promoting this
message. His support among entrepreneurs has been matched by strong
support from blue-collar workers who fear the loss of jobs to
foreigners and seem to feel more identification with Haider's
slickly marketed nationalism than with the socialism of old.
</P>
<P>
   In Klagenfurt, one catch phrase promoted by the governor is
``the Silicon Alps'' _ the slogan of several new technology
companies that have set up shop here. At the same time, Haider
loves to promote local folklore against ``cultural globalization.''
The clear idea is a very broad laptops-to-loden-coats political
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For Pacher, the leader of the Klagenfurt Chamber of Commerce,
Haider is simply ``the master of disguises, the great European
illusionist.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Krenn, the hotelier, the Haider message is consistent:
``The old government was selling you tired wares badly. I'm selling
you new goods and I'm doing it well.''

BRADLEY HOPES NORTHEAST WILL BAIL OUT CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Bradley Thursday acknowledged the imperiled
state of his campaign as he turned toward the Northeast in the hope
of emerging from Tuesday's do-or-die primaries with a reason to
contiue his quest for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   All but writing off California, Ohio and several other large
states that hold primaries Tuesday, Bradley indicated he will focus
his last-ditch efforts on New York and New England as he struggles
to avoid elimination from the race for the Democratic nomination.
He began by campaigning at a popular hot dog stand in Greenwich
Village before stumping in Hartford and Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be less than truthful if I didn't tell you I wish I was 30
points up,'' Bradley said in an interview with a television station
in New York, where polls show him trailing Vice President Al Gore
by about 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, also campaigning in New York, hammered away at a favorite
theme, education, as he visited with elementary school children and
their teachers at an uptown school.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a soft swipe at the Republican presidential candidates,
who back vouchers for private school, Gore said, ``They seem to
think that because public schools begin with `P.S.,' that education
is an afterthought.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore declined to comment on the conviction Thursday of Maria
Hsia, saying the matter was still in the courts. Hsia was a key
figure in the 1996 Democratic fund-raising scandals, for which Gore
has been harshly criticized, particularly by Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury has rendered a verdict,'' Gore said. It's a hard day
for her. She's a friend and a political supporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has dramatically softened his attacks on Gore as he
strives to present himself with greater dignity in the final days
before Super Tuesday, would not directly address Hsia's conviction.
He said only that the case underscores the need to overhaul the
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, working on 90 minutes of sleep after an overnight
flight from Los Angeles, insisted again that he will not heed calls
to withdraw from the race at least until the 16 Democratic contests
are completed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to quit,'' he said. ``I'm strong. I'm
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the rationale he has shared with top supporters for
remaining in the race, Bradley said, ``I believe I owe it to people
to give them a chance to say I've offered myself as a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Notable among those people are thousands of donors who helped
Bradley raise more than $20 million for his renegade run for the
White House. Many contributors were inspired by Bradley's sports
career, in which he captained an Olympic gold medal team and won
two NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in those places before where nobody thought you can
do it and I did it, so it doesn't bother me,'' he said of the long
odds against him.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his comeback attempt, Bradley invested an estimated
$1 million Thursday night to air a 5-minute television ad on CBS
that reached about 7 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was largely a variation on Bradley's standard stump
speech, in which he calls for capitalizing on the country's
unprecedented prosperity to invest in ending child poverty,
guaranteeting access to comprehensive health coverage, improving
public schools and promoting racial unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do all those things, all of us will be stronger,'' he
concluded in the ad. ``That's why I entered the race against all
odds. That's why I will fight for every last vote to be your
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was scheduled to take his campaign Friday to Portland
High School in Maine and the Feinstein College of Continuing
Education in Providence, R.I. as he focuses his resources on New
England and New York. ``Those are states I can win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut Thursday night, Bradley conducted interviews with
Hartford television stations and addressed supporters at a Boys and
Girls Club in Bridgeport. At the Hartford-Springfield International
Airport in Windsor Locks, he issued a direct appeal to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't listen to the pollsters and the pundits,'' he said.
``Vote your heart. Vote your conscience. Vote for a new politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who also took a red-eye flight to New York after Wednesday
night's Democratic debate, reiterated his call for smaller class
sizes, money to build new schools, and the weeding out of bad
teachers ``who reflect poorly on the vast majority'' of educators.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president first read to a class of 5- and 6-year-olds,
who seemed unclear about what Gore did for a living. ``President?''
offered one student. ``Principal?'' ventured another. Some students
did recognize Gore as the vice president, though one thought Gore
was ``Clinton's principal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a packed travel schedule going up until March 7. He is
scheduled to arrive late Friday in Boston, after campaigning in
Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also made an impromptu statement condemning the South
Carolina legislature for voting Thursday against a state holiday
honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and for the continued use
of the confederate flag as the state symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet again South Carolina sticks a finger in the eye of all
those people in the country who want a country that recognizes that
diversity is a strength and not a weakness,'' Bradley said.

REPORT LINKS HEART ATTACKS TO MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what is believed to be the first documented link between
smoking marijuana and heart attacks, a study has found that a
middle-age person's risk of heart attack rises nearly five fold in
the first hour after smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The study was presented Thursday by Dr. Murray A. Middleman at
the annual meeting of the American Heart Association's annual
conference on cardiovascular disease in San Diego. Middleman, an
internist, heads a team of specialists that has been reporting on
risk factors in heart attacks for the past six years. Members of
the team are from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the
Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The marijuana report is one of a series of studies on marijuana
underway at medical schools and universities throughout the
country. One, at Columbia University, reported that a psychological
dependency on marijuana might develop among users. Another, at the
University of Washington, found that skillful child rearing
significantly increased the age at which young people began using
marijuana and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the heart study, Middleman said that smoking
marijuana increased the heart rate by about 40 beats per minute.
``It also causes blood pressure to increase when the person is
lying down,'' he said, ``and then abruptly fall when the person
stands up, often causing dizziness. These effects may pose
significant risk, especially in people with unrecognized coronary
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn A. Smaha, president of the American Heart Association,
said the study produced important information in the search for
factors that bring on attacks. Smaha and other specialists said
they knew of no previous study that pin-pointed marijuana as one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Middleman said that the study might be of concern to baby
boomers who continue to use marijuana as they age. ``Many of these
people were users of marijuana when they were in their teens and
`20s,'' he said, ``and a sizable portion of them may still use the
drug, either frequently or occasionally. They should at least be
aware that their risk of heart attack suddenly soars each time they
take the drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Middleman also said that in the debate over the medicinal use of
marijuana, it might be judged inadvisable for people with existing
coronary disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston group studied 3,882 patients who had survived heart
attacks and found that 124 reported using marijuana regularly. Of
those, 37 said they had used it within 24 hours of their heart
attacks and 9 within the hour of their attacks. The relative risk
of heart attack increased 4.8 times within the first hour but
dropped to 1.7 times higher in the second hour, suggesting a rapid
decline in the acute cardiac effects, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The group previously reported on other triggers of heart
attacks, including cocaine, exercise, sex and psychological
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The team's latest report said that smoking marijuana was ``about
twice as dangerous as exercise for a fit person, sex for a
sedentary person, a tantrum of anger or a bout of anxiety.'' But it
also said that it was less risky than a ``spurt of exercise for a
couch potato or a snort of cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Further studies will have to determine why marijuana, or the key
chemical in it, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), may bring on heart
attacks. But the researchers speculate that it is because of the
extra physical stress from the increased heart beat and blood
pressure and the breaks they may cause in the lining of the blood
vessels, especially among people with elevated cholesterol levels.
The breaks may set off the formation of blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   In the study at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons,
Dr. Mirian W. Fishman said surveys showed that the use of marijuana
among young people had risen sharply since 1990 but little had been
determined about whether people become dependent upon it. Dr.
Margaret Haney, the lead author of the report, and colleagues
conducted a study that Fishman said suggested that daily use of
marijuana might develop a psychological dependence. Marijuana is
not considered physically addictive.

 &HT;    Cinnabon creates new look; parent AFC makes more plans
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cinnabon International Inc. is rolling out its new
look nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based bakery chain, which was acquired by AFC
Enterprises in 1998, plans to remodel about 100 company-owned units
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started remodeling the units to make them more attractive
and to keep us competitive,'' said Gerald Wilkins, chief financial
officer for AFC. The previous owner ``really had not done much to
re-image the concept,'' Wilkins said. ``It had gotten old and dated
and tired.'' He said it will cost about $60,000 to redo each
bakery.
</P>
<P>
   The new look is more contemporary, with extensive use of wood
tones and stainless steel. The blue and white tile remains.
Cinnabon spokesman Mallard Holliday said consumers said they wanted
more of a ``neighborhood bakery feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Other changes are in store for Cinnabon. Over the next five
years, the chain plans to sell between 30 and 50 bakeries to new
and current franchisees in areas that it considers to be
``remote.'' ``These locations are very difficult to oversee, which
causes the overhead to be abnormally high,'' Wilkins said. He added
the ``lion's share'' of those units are profitable but are
difficult to manage effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The previous owners embraced a development strategy that
really caused them to be far too spread out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company will use the proceeds to reinvest in markets
where Cinnabon has a stronger presence.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnabon, which had systemwide sales of $150 million in 1999,
has 382 bakeries in 41 states and eight countries. The company
plans to open 104 units this year, the bulk of which will be
franchised locations.
</P>
<P>
   Currently Cinnabon represents about 12.5 percent of AFC's
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   This week AFC released its results for the 1999 fiscal year. The
company reported net income of $12.1 million, which included a $2.4
million charge related to the loss from Chesapeake Bagel Bakery's
discontinued operations and the sale of its franchise system.
</P>
<P>
   Total revenue in 1999 was $707.1 million, vs. $605.6 million for
fiscal year 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Systemwide sales at AFC's 3,374 company-owned and franchised
restaurants, bakeries, cafes and whole and manufacturing operations
were $2.1 billion, compared with $1.8 billion for the same period a
year earlier. This was the first time in the company's history that
systemwide sales exceeded $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cinnabon, AFC also owns Churchs Chicken, Popeyes
Chicken &AMP; Biscuits and Seattle's Best Coffee. Overall, the company
plans to open 450 new units this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins said the company is still evaluating a public offering.
``Right now we don't see a favorable market environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that once we see that, we will be in a position to
go.'' He said it could happen as early as the fall.

 &HT;    Former manager accuses Waffle House of racial bias
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A former manager of a Waffle House restaurant in
Beaufort, S.C., is suing the Norcross, Ga.-based restaurant chain,
alleging he was dismissed for refusing to fire black workers and
hire whites.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse E. Gantt Jr., who has homes in Georgia and South Carolina,
accused the company of racial discrimination and unlawful
employment practices. The lawsuit was filed last month in U.S.
District Court in Atlanta and seeks unspecified monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Gantt was employed by Waffle House in management positions
between 1991 and 1998 in Georgia and South Carolina. Most recently
he was senior operator/franchisee trainee for the Beaufort
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said that Gantt's production numbers were
consistently above-average to excellent and he was often praised by
his supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   However, on or about Dec. 20, 1997, the suit claims that a
Waffle House area vice president visited the store.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that vice president looked around the
restaurant and said, ``Jesse, I will not have a black restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Days later he asked Gantt for a racial breakdown of the staff
and insisted that it match the demographic mix of Beaufort County,
which was 70 percent white and 30 percent black, according to the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Gantt claims he was then ordered to change his employee base by
firing black workers and replacing them with whites until he
achieved a 70 percent to 30 percent, white-to-black mix.
</P>
<P>
   When Gantt resisted, he was told if ``you can't do this, I'll
get someone who can,'' the suit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said the instructions were spelled out in a memo
that was sent to several high-ranking Waffle House executives,
including its chief executive and executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure continued, and in the spring of 1998, Gantt was
fired for allegedly having an inappropriate relationship with an
employee he supervised.
</P>
<P>
   Gantt, who now owns and operates a restaurant in Beaufort,
denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Waffle House spokesman Chris Jacobsen declined to comment on the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jacobsen said the company has a policy of ``zero
tolerance for any form of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennan R.S. Nix, one of the attorneys who represents Gantt, said
he expected the company to fight the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the company engages in widespread
patterns and practices of discrimination against African-American
employees, managers and customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another discrimination case, a major Waffle House franchisee,
Northlake Foods, is being sued by five African-Americans customers
who claim a cook refused to serve them because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   Waffle House owns and operates 1,250 restaurants, mostly in the
Southeast.

SGI AGREES TO SELL ITS CRAY SUPERCOMPUTER BUSINESS TO TERA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Wash., Calif., Minn. , Wis.)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ SGI, formerly Silicon Graphics Inc., said
Thursday that it had agreed to sell its Cray supercomputer business
to Tera Computer Co. of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed, but analysts said there was little
doubt that Tera paid a fraction of the $740 million that SGI had
paid to acquire Cray Research Inc. in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   SGI shares closed at $9.875, down 25 cents apiece, on the New
York Stock Exchange. Tera shares fell $1.125, also to $9.875, on
the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Cray at such a discount reflects both technology
trends and a shifting dynamic in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Cray, once an icon of U.S. technological prowess and a national
asset for its deep involvement with the departments of Defense and
Energy, had already begun to slip from its perch before SGI
acquired it. Although Cray's huge supercomputers, which sell for as
much as $20 million, still excel at certain kinds of demanding
tasks, like simulating atomic explosions, they are increasingly
rivaled by machines based on microprocessors, like those used in
PCs, which cost much less.
</P>
<P>
   Cray's machines belong to a class of computers called vector
processors, so-called because they perform calculations on a long
series of numbers called vectors. Doing this at high speed requires
enormously powerful processors, which are built in small
quantities. In contrast, high-performance computing has
increasingly moved to parallel processing, in which lower-power,
lower-cost microprocessors are ganged to work on multiple
calculations at once. Cray also sells parallel systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we don't see the vector business as a growth
business or a profitable business given the price/performance of a
product like that,'' said Kenneth Coleman, SGI's senior vice
president for sales and marketing. ``It's declining rapidly. It's
an industry phenomenon, not unique to Cray.''
</P>
<P>
   Cray is still attractive to Tera, which has sold just one
supercomputer since its formation in 1987. ``Cray has been the
pre-eminent supercomputer manufacturer,'' said Jim Rottsolk, Tera's
president and chief executive. ``We're a small company, just
entering the business, and being able to acquire the Cray operation
with a talented work force and its customer relationships, was, for
us, a no-brainer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tera will change its name to Cray to capitalize on the brand
awareness and reflect the importance of the acquired products,
which will contribute about $200 million a year in revenue to the
company. ``We have a different perspective than SGI,'' Rottsolk
said. ``It's true the market has been in decline, but that's
because there hasn't been a product to satisfy customer needs. We
believe we can expand and grow the market.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Cray name, Tera is gaining about 775
employees in Egan, Minn., and Chippewa Falls, Wis., and the rights
to sell three lines of Cray supercomputers. Silicon Graphics is
retaining certain assets that will remain part of its
high-performance computer business. ``What we bought and what we
sold are not the same thing,'' Coleman said. ``We bought a company.
We're selling the vector business. Even in the Midwest, we will
have more people at SGI than Cray will have.''

 &HT;    Figure in stock fraud case still in jail, looking for new lawyer
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier and Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Lybrand, the alleged head of a $12 million
international stock fraud scheme based in a former dime store,
needs a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Lybrand, also known as Peter Tosto, were to have
told a federal judge in New York on Thursday why Lybrand should be
released on bail. Instead, a lawyer from the Manhattan firm Brafman
&AMP; Ross told a U.S. District judge that the firm will withdraw from
the case Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lybrand, 35, is being held in a New York area jail until the new
bail hearing March 24. Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanna Hendon is
expected to ask that he be held without bail until trial.
</P>
<P>
   The extra time before the new hearing is to give Lybrand time to
find another lawyer and to give the lawyer time to learn the case,
said U.S. District Judge Theodore H. Katz, a chief magistrate judge
for the Southern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lybrand is charged with manipulating stocks and defrauding
investors in three publicly traded companies, all while working and
living in Madison, Ga., an hour's drive east of downtown Atlanta.
He was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Lybrand faces three counts each of securities fraud and lying to
the U.S. attorney's office, and one count each of perjury and
obstructing justice. The criminal fraud charges each carry a
maximum sentence of 10 years and $1 million or twice the proceeds
from the fraud. The remaining counts each carry a maximum fine of
$250,000 or twice the proceeds, and five years in prison. The
charges carry no minimum penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges last
week as well.

RETAIL SALES RISE IN FEBRUARY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, oil
prices increased and the stock market grew more volatile, American
consumers continued a record spending spree in stores in February,
a report showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of unusually mild weather, shoppers rushed to the stores
to buy their jean jackets and tropical print spring fashions early
and gave merchants a stronger-than-expected month. Sales in stores
open more than a year, a key industry measurement, rose 5.1 percent
in February, according to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were enough factors that together they could have caused
the train to go off the track,'' said Jeff Feiner, a retail analyst
for Lehman Brothers, ``but consumer confidence has remained high,
and we are optimistic about the first quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   More good news came as the Commerce Department released its
first official estimate of electronic commerce retail sales, which
had previously been included with overall sales. The study found
that $5.3 billion worth of goods and services were sold online in
the fourth quarter of 1999. Although that number accounted for only
0.64 percent of the total retail economy of $821 billion for the
quarter, the data confirmed sharp growth in Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department based its numbers on a survey of 12,000
Internet merchants who sold products as diverse as cars, furniture
and groceries. But the survey did not include travel services,
financial brokers and dealers and ticket sales, numbers that
consulting firms have often included in online predictions.
</P>
<P>
   February is not a significant month on the retail calendar,
accounting for only about 6 percent of sales in a year. As a
result, most analyst were not adjusting profit predictions for the
companies despite the better-than-expected results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though most of my companies have outperformed, I am not
changing earnings estimates,'' said George Strachan, a retail
analyst with Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with long-term industry trends, the retailers that
performed strongest last month were at opposite ends of the price
spectrum. On the luxury side were Saks Inc., whose sales rose 8
percent, and Neiman Marcus, which posted a gain of 11.2 percent.
Among the discounters, Costco continued its red-hot streak, with an
increase of 13 percent. &QL;

LET'S PUT THE UNFORTUNATE ROCKER BEHIND US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ John Rocker walked into a gymnasium
adjacent to the baseball field. He sat in front of a microphone,
read a 372-word general apology, and then departed.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate media probing. (He would later submit to
questioning from the Atlanta press only.) It was, said John
Schuerholz, the Atlanta Braves' executive vice president and
general manager, Rocker's choice not to take questions from the
national press. ``We neither discouraged him nor encouraged him
from doing anything,'' Schuerholz explained.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it would have been nice had Rocker satisfied the media mob.
He could have said, ``I'll deal with it this one time, and this one
time only.'' He could have said, ``Twenty minutes, and not a second
more.'' He did not. He read and ran.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me for not feeling offended. Aren't we all just about
Rockered out, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   In his statement John Rocker apologized for the ``foul
language'' he used in the infamous Sports Illustrated article. ``I
was not raised that way,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   He next apologized to AIDS victims and the assorted minority
groups he denigrated while taking his hypothetical trip on the 7
train. Pointing out that he has had various minority players as
house guests for periods ranging from two weeks to six months, he
said, ``As you can see, my actions do not support this racist
label,'' adding that ``My thoughtless words, however, do show that
sometimes I lack the understanding to see the problems others
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he apologized to the Atlanta organization, his manager,
and his teammates for the ``stress and confusion'' I have brought
on the Braves organization.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, fine. He did his public duty, even if it had the suspicious
rhetorical ring of an agent's prose and even if he didn't satisfy
those who apparently would have preferred he had been brought into
the room locked inside one of those Viet Cong cages. It was enough.
I'm not sure it would have been totally necessary to have him
answer an hour's worth of warmed-over
``Have-you-stopped-beating-your-wife?'' queries from righteous
media attack dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Of far more import was a meeting he had with the players and
coaches earlier in the morning. This is where his teammates looked
into his eyes and weighed the timber of his voice and decided
whether or not they would believe what he had to say. Those men are
his only meaningful judge and jury.
</P>
<P>
   And?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was very sincere, and I think he's sorry about the
pain and attention he has brought to the organization and the
team,'' said Brian Jordan, an African-American outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good meeting,'' said Chipper Jones, a Caucasian third
baseman. ``Very positive. Guys got things off their chests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said what they had to say,'' explained Ozzie
Guillen, a Venezuelan shortstop. ``He said what he had to say. We
said what we had to say. Now we leave everything in the
clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a productive meeting because we have so many good
veterans,'' declared Reggie Sanders, an African-American
outfielder. ``We have a lot of guys with good hearts. We're trying
to turn this into a positive situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all forgive him,'' said Javy Lopez, a Puerto Rican catcher.
``We all gave him another chance. We are here to play baseball and
be a family.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is all a great collective acting bit, so be it. But
these are the only people whose opinions really count on this
matter, since they're the ones who have lived with him in the
clubhouse, busses, and planes the past three years. The fact is
they have a difficult time reconciling the John Rocker in the SI
article with the lovable goofball they know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I was concerned when I read the article,'' said
Lopez. ``Everybody knows I'm a Puerto Rican. Those comments
included me. When I first heard about it, I just thought he was
reacting to the things that went on in New York during the World
Series. Then when I read it, I couldn't believe it. I thought he
was set up. But he wasn't. So I was confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it obvious that Javy's first instinct was correct? John
Rocker was getting back at the New York fans _ or, at least, he
thought he was _ when he went off on his 7 train riff. He was
extraordinarily foolish not to foresee the potential consequences
of his discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the foolish rantings of a 25-year-old relief pitcher
should not materialize into a national issue. When are we going to
regain perspective? In a more reasoned world, people would have
looked at the Rocker quotes and said, ``I think I'll consider the
source.'' Why can't we learn to save our outrage for meaningful
occasions, like, when major presidential candidates refuse to
denounce a racist flag flying over a state capitol building?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we have John Rocker's overturned suspension as the lead
story in some American newspapers. Said a somewhat exasperated
Schuerholz, ``This is a front-page story in a major national
newspaper over a man murdering four people in Pennsylvania in what
apparently is a racially-oriented killing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not over, of course. People will have their fun with this
all season. ``It's a big step, but it will all take a while to calm
down,'' said Jordan. ``It won't happen today, or next week. In
every city there will be someone ready to light the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Please don't forget that one reason the Braves are so willing to
reembrace John Rocker is the simple fact that he is very good at
what he does. They want him happy and content and just plain John
Rockerish. ``I want to see his focus,'' said Jones. ``I want to see
him run out of the bullpen the way he used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, age 36, sounds as if he would have been willing to live
with Rocker even if he (itals)didn't(unitals) think his apology was
sincere. ``He doesn't have to say he's sorry to anybody,'' he
growled. ``Just save 50 games, get me a ring, and make me some
money.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is a guy Rocker ripped for not making a play in Game 4
of the National League Championship Series. If he can get over it,
everyone else should, too. Acknowledge that the kid needs to do
some growing up, and then let's hunt around for something in our
society that's worth our legitimate outrage.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be hard to do.

 &HT;    Northwest finds fault with Delta over exclusive Priceline fares
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A spat between Northwest and Delta airlines over the
availability of fares through Priceline.com has escalated into a
public feud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you heard what Delta is up to? Delta won't allow Atlanta
to receive competitive Priceline fares,'' Northwest complains in a
newspaper ad that appeared Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Northwest problem, not an Atlanta customer
problem,'' responded Delta spokesman John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Northwest has fumed over its inability to sell seats
on Atlanta flights through Priceline.com, the name-your-price
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Delta, the first major airline to participate in
Priceline.com, negotiated a clause that prevents other carriers
from offering seats to or from Atlanta at the site. The only
exceptions are nonstop routes between Atlanta and another carrier's
hub.
</P>
<P>
   The exclusivity clause was a savvy business deal, Kennedy said,
adding that Northwest is trying to manufacture a consumer issue.
</P>
<P>
   Delta sells ``thousands'' of tickets weekly through
Priceline.com, giving travelers good availability, Kennedy said. He
noted there are many other Internet sites where consumers can also
shop.
</P>
<P>
   But Northwest pricing executive Tom Bach said Delta's
Priceline.com sales on Atlanta routes are ``at generally higher
fares'' than users of the Web site get in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a level playing field'' for either airlines or
consumers, Bach said, adding that none of the other airlines that
participates in Priceline.com has such protection for its hub
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest is doing more than just complaining. Since November
it's run a fare sale on its own Web site, nwa.com, aimed
specifically at Atlanta fliers. Fares range from $98 to $218 round
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, in turn, has retaliated with special fares on its Web
site, delta-air.com, for travelers in Minneapolis, Detroit and
Memphis _ Northwest's hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com spokesman Brian Ek wouldn't comment on the terms
of Delta's contract, or on the dispute. ``We're not getting in the
middle of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's early participation in Priceline.com got it more than a
hometown advantage. Delta took warrants for 18.6 million shares of
Priceline stock, which later went public. Delta has since sold part
of its holdings, netting $711 million so far.

   DLAAT OUTPOST, Lebanon _ In the pitch black of another tense
night in southern Lebanon, a convoy of armored Israeli jeeps bumped
over the rutted roads that often hold bombs meant just for them.
Eerily, they moved without their lights on, the drivers fitted with
night-vision goggles under their combat helmets. The general and
his officers did not chat.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, they attended a memorial service for a brigadier
general whose jeep, also carrying an Israeli journalist, was blown
up on a convoy into southern Lebanon exactly a year ago. It was
impossible not to be escorted by that memory, especially during a
period of heightened guerrilla attacks on the Israelis and at the
end of a day of intensive fire.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, a debate has been raging about what many have termed
the senselessness of the chronic fighting in southern Lebanon.
Referring to ``the tragedy'' of Israel's 18-year-old involvement,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has set a deadline of July to withdraw
the troops in the context of a peace agreement with Syria. Many
Israelis are pushing him to pull out sooner, calling the young
soldiers sitting ducks in a guerrilla war that has already been
lost.
</P>
<P>
   But in the nine-mile-deep ``security zone'' that Israel occupies
here, the war is still on against the Hezbollah, or Party of God,
guerrillas who see themselves as trying to liberate a swath of
Lebanon from Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   And the political conversation has to be tuned out for
survival's sake.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, the Israeli officers were visiting an outpost
largely to make sure the troops knew that while the country may be
divided, the military establishment still stands behind them,
focused on ``the mission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had better stand behind us,'' said one of the soldiers,
Ori Rosenstein, 19, from Ramat Yishai near Haifa, ``because nobody
really wants to be here. It wears you down. After the initial rush
of being inside the conflict, you adjust to the reality. Suffice it
to say, we are a doing a job. People are proud of that. But the
sooner we leave, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a grim coincidence that an Israeli general, Moshe
Kaplinsky, escorted a reporter from Qiryat Shmona on the northern
Israeli border into the security zone on the one-year anniversary
of the deaths of a general and a journalist. Army officials granted
relatively free access to the post and to soldiers, allowing them
to speak without an army spokesman present. Their goal, the
officials said, was to demonstrate that even though morale is
tested by the eroding public support for the war, many soldiers
still see the fighting as purposeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a mission here until the political echelon tells
us otherwise,'' said Maj. Olivier Rafowicz, a spokesman for the
northern command. ``The soldiers think they are protecting the
northern border, and that is why they are putting their lives at
risk. They don't need the Israeli public to see them as a
19-year-old local hero, but at least as someone who is doing
something important.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers' views varied. No one went so far as to condemn
Israel's recent bombing of civilian targets in Lebanon. But some
did suggest that it was the army's occupation of the zone that was
keeping alive the violence, in which seven Israeli soldiers have
died so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still others spoke like gung-ho teen-age boys who are members of
an elite army unit bent on proving themselves, in traditional
Israeli fashion, but on the only front line that exists. And they
said they felt somewhat abandoned, not by the military, but by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nuts,'' said Baruch Brenner, 19, originally from Flatbush,
Brooklyn. ``I took a leave to go to the funeral of my friend who
was killed by a missile, and then I actually came back, two weeks
before I'm supposed to get married. You'd think I'd be saying,
`What's the point?'''
</P>
<P>
   Brenner said he was angered by politicians' comments at the
funeral. ``They said the war was criminal,'' he said. ``No one
dared tell the truth _that the only thing that stood between that
missile and Qiryat Shmona was my friend Tsahi.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to shmooze the troops, Kaplinsky, tall and gregarious,
peeled off his helmet and vest as he entered the peculiar reality
of nighttime inside the large, cold, concrete bunker. The Dlaat
outpost sits on the Ali Taher Ridge, at the northern edge of the
occupied zone, overlooking the city of Nabatiye to the west and
Merj 'Uyun to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers from an elite paratroopers unit milled around inside
the dank enclosure. Rosenstein called it ``our cage,'' since the
fighters rarely leave the confines of the outpost, now that
offensive strikes in this war are mostly conducted by F-16
warplanes and Apache helicopters. Soldiers are assigned to Lebanon
for four-month stints as part of their fighting units, to which
they volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   In a beat-up armchair, Rosenstein, a scarf coiled around his
neck, was reading a thick fantasy novel _ ``Appropriate, no?'' he
said. Others slept under glaring lights on three-level bunk beds _
with their boots on, so that they were combat-ready _ or munched on
apples or played the guitar and sang. In a small, private room,
effectively warmed by a portable heater, two Arab-speaking Bedouin
soldiers who live at the outpost lounged on their beds watching the
Hezbollah television station on cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we watch the pictures of their attacks on our
friends,'' Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bedouin soldiers are responsible for knowing every patch of
the topography and noticing slight shifts that could indicate
guerrilla activity. ``Before you came tonight, they went out and
made sure that nothing would go boom,'' Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   In the war room, where a map of the immediate region was
color-coded to pinpoint guerrilla activity, Kapinsky took his place
at the head of a table covered with plastic pitchers of steaming
coffee and trays of sandwich cookies. The brown beret of the elite
Golani brigade was tucked under his epaulete. In style, he was part
Socratic-method law professor, part football coach. A soldier
brought him a porcelain demitasse of espresso laced with cardamom,
and he nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, do we have gaps in our security?'' he began his meeting
with the officers. He peppered them with technical questions. ``Are
there blind spots that the guards cannot see? At what points
precisely do we have threat of anti-tank missiles? What is the
efficiency of our camouflage?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside, how does our position look?
</P>
<P>
   ``Does someone think there a need to change our approach because
of the change of the threat?'' he asked. He referred to an attack
on another outpost: ``What were the lessons of Beaufort?''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the door flew open and a soldier ran in breathlessly
to interrupt. ``There are mortar attacks on the Taybeh position!''
The meeting continued, because such attacks are facts of life.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the officers answered and the general scratched
notes. They also described drills performed in the last week _ the
silent mobilization of all the soldiers, the evacuation of wounded
from the field into the outpost. The general asked one
tired-looking sergeant how long it had been since he had taken a
home leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-one days,'' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' the general said. ``What are you trying to
prove?''
</P>
<P>
   When one officer gave a long-winded answer to what happened one
recent day after he spied a guerrilla, the general interrupted:
``If you identify a terrorist, you have to shoot and hit. Don't
give me philosophy and ideology. Don't get lost in your head. Stay
focused. Rely on your instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iran-backed Hezbollah guerrillas see themselves as freedom
fighters, a view that is shared by many in the Arab world. But the
Israeli army resolutely calls them terrorists even though it is
fighting them in a classic guerrilla war, the kind that armies
rarely win.
</P>
<P>
   The brigade commander, speaking with matter-of-fact scorn, said,
``Our morality and theirs are on different levels.'' Others might
not agree, especially after the recent Israeli bombardments of
civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
   But the commander described several times when he ordered his
men not to return fire because the guerrillas were in villages _
violating the rules of engagement established in 1996 _ and using
women with children and elderly men as shields. The firing from
villages has escalated in the last few weeks, he said, something
Israel used to justify its bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Lebanon provides a kind of laboratory for
high-tech counter-insurgency warfare. This is one of the few places
in the world, if not the only, where state-of-the-art war equipment
is in daily combat use.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way up darkened steps to an observation post, the
commander showed how the soldiers identify the source of fire,
using night-vision monitors at night. Bundled against the chill
wind, a 19-year-old sat by himself, in his fourth hour before the
hooded monitor, watching a line of Mercedes moving through the
fuzzy night on his screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have company up here,'' he said, ``but after the
fighting got worse earlier this month, they didn't want to risk
more than one of us at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Back downstairs, Rosenstein said his 10 hours a day at the
observation post had taken on the numbing aspect of a routine.
``Well, not people getting killed,'' he said. ``It happens a lot
here that we get bombed. But after 28 days here, it's boring,
grinding, suffocating. You can't walk outside without a bulletproof
vest. I feel that I am living inside a vest.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the army threw in jail a soldier who refused an
assignment in Lebanon. He was a tank technician, the army stressed,
and not a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fighters, what interests them is fighting, not
protesting,'' a senior officer said. Recently, another senior
officer got in trouble for mocking as wimps two soldiers who pulled
aside Israeli journalists in Lebanon and told them they were
scared.
</P>
<P>
   The wimp remark infuriated Rosenstein, who told a departing
journalist that the ride in and out of southern Lebanon, between
the border and the outpost, was the ``scariest'' part.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disheartening to hear all the talk in Israel, people
calling us whiners,'' he said. ``We're the ones in the field. If
things are tough, we should be able to speak our mind until they
pull us back to the international border.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's just little me's view.''

DOUBLECLICK, ASSAILED ON PRIVACY ISSUE, BACKS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stung by protests from Internet privacy advocates and a federal
investigation, Internet advertising firm DoubleClick Inc. has
halted its plan to use name and address data to track the online
activities of millions of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In a frank admission that his company had blundered, DoubleClick
chief executive Kevin O'Connor said Thursday his company would not
use such data until the Internet industry and the federal
government establish firm guidelines to protect the privacy of
Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake by planning to merge names with anonymous
user activity across Web sites in the absence of government and
industry privacy standards,'' O'Connor said. He added that New
York-based DoubleClick had not yet begun the controversial
practice, despite press reports to the contrary. ``We commit today
that until there is agreement between government and industry on
privacy standards, we will not link personally identifiable
information to anonymous user activity across Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, hailed the policy shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think DoubleClick finally got the message,'' he said. ``It's
a step in the right direction.'' But the only satisfactory
solution, he said, is a federal law setting strict standards for
the use of data collected on the Internet, an unpopular idea among
Internet marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, publisher of industry newsletter Release 1.0, also
helped establish the Internet privacy consortium TrustE. Dyson said
the DoubleClick announcement is intended to fend off the heavy hand
of government. ``The point they're trying to make is that
self-regulation in the market works, because, look, we stopped,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, O'Connor's words suggest to Dyson that
DoubleClick might accept some degree of government privacy
regulation. ``He's saying we need something. We need something
clear and explicit.''
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Ed Markey, who has long favored a federal
Internet privacy law, thinks major Internet companies may be coming
to the same conclusion. ``I think increasingly many in the industry
realize that it makes no sense for the best participants to
continue to protect the worst online companies,'' he said. The
large Internet companies already have good policies, he said, while
smaller firms are more likely to misuse personal data.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick's travails began last year, when the company spent
more than $1 billion to acquire Abacus Direct, a marketing database
firm with the names and addresses of millions of Americans on file.
DoubleClick announced a plan to combine this data with information
collected from users of various Internet sites. DoubleClick already
tracks the Internet surfing habits of millions of individuals, by
displaying advertisements on their Web browsers. These ads contain
identification tags called ``cookies'' that link to the user's
computer and enable DoubleClick to track their movements through
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But cookies have traditionally been anonymous _ DoubleClick and
other firms that use them don't know the identities of the people
being tracked. But with Abacus, DoubleClick planned to change that,
linking cookies with name and address information to build detailed
profiles of a user's tastes and interests.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to create a database that would be worth millions
of dollars to marketers on or off the Internet. But consumer groups
and privacy advocates were outraged by the idea. Last month a woman
in California sued the company; the attorney general of Michigan
and the Federal Trade Commission both launched investigations.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick's woes continue to escalate. On Wednesday, Internet
home delivery service Kozmo.com announced it would no longer carry
advertisements linked to the DoubleClick system. The same day, the
AltaVista Internet search service announced it would limit the
amount of user information made available to DoubleClick. AltaVista
is owned by Andover-based CMGI Inc., which also owns Engage
Technologies Inc., DoubleClick's biggest competitor. Engage,
however, does not collect names and addresses of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, the leading financial software maker Intuit Inc.
announced that DoubleClick ads on its Web site were inadvertently
sending personal information from users to DoubleClick. The problem
was caused by a bug in HTML, the coding method used to build Web
pages. There is no evidence that DoubleClick was collecting the
information being sent by Intuit. And the same information could
also be sent to other Internet advertising firms, not just
DoubleClick.
</P>
<P>
   But independent computer security specialist Richard Smith of
Brookline, Mass., who discovered the problem, said he began warning
DoubleClick in October that the privacy leak existed. Smith said
DoubleClick could have warned sites that displayed its ads so they
could fix the bug. But no action was taken. The story came out
because Smith discovered the bug on the Intuit site, and informed
that company of the problem. As for DoubleClick, ``They have got to
be more proactive than they have,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick may not be hurt financially by delaying its
data-collection plan. Anthia Christian, analyst with William Blair
&AMP; Co. in Chicago, says revenues from Abacus' other database
businesses still make it a profitable investment for DoubleClick.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick stock rose $2.875 to close at $83.4375 on the Nasdaq
stock exchange.

   CHRISTIAN-RIGHT (Atlanta) _ It is hard to know how many Bob
Harrisons are out there. But each one is a nightmare for Sen. John
McCain. Harrison, a 60-year-old electrical engineer and a leader of
the choir at Atlanta's Mt. Paran Church of God, was once an
enthusiastic McCain supporter. He liked his heroic military
background. He liked his positions on education and health care.
And he liked his penchant for straight talk. ``I was really pulling
for him,'' Harrison said. ``He was the guy.'' That all changed this
week. Harrison, who considers himself a Christian conservative
voter, was deeply offended by McCain's attacks on Pat Robertson and
Jerry Falwell, whom the Arizona Republican described in a Monday
speech as ``agents of intolerance'' comparable to Louis Farrakhan
and Al Sharpton. ``I think he was out of line,'' Harrison said. Now
Harrison is leaning toward voting for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas

 &HT;    Garcia makes late run to head of pack
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Donna Garcia never thought of herself as an Olympic
hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia had been a scholarship runner at the University of
Kentucky, but the bulk of her postcollegiate years have focused on
the 9-to-5 world. She traveled the back roads of Georgia and
Tennessee calling on grocers as account manager for Pepperidge
Farms. Her day job always came first.
</P>
<P>
   That's all changing.
</P>
<P>
   Almost out of nowhere, Garcia has developed into a major factor
in women's distance running. The 31-year-old Marietta, Ga.,
resident earned a spot recently on the U.S. team for next month's
World Cross Country Championships in Villamoura, Portugal. She is
one of only two women qualifying in both the 4K and 8K races.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia already had qualified for the Olympic trials in the 5,000
meters and, if plans go as scripted, she will do the same in the
10,000 meters. In April, she will take a break from her job to
pursue her Olympic dream in full.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a point where I need to give this running thing 100
percent of my time and see what I can do,'' Garcia said. She moved
near Atlanta three years ago and trains with Georgia State
Professor Dave Martin, a running guru.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say I'll be a long shot going into the Olympic trials,
but stranger things have happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step comes Saturday in the USA Indoor Track and Field
Championships, where Garcia is entered in a strong 3,000-meter
women's field. This year's meet is short on big-name athletes, but
the 3,000 figures to be one of the more competitive races, with
Garcia and Amy Rudolph, Marla Runyan, Kathy Fleming and Blake
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Her coach said he thinks her future will be in the longer 10,000
meters as she continues developing strength and endurance. Her
debut in that event is this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a real success story,'' Martin said. ``Like a lot of
postcollegiate runners, she got a job and started working her way
up the corporate ladder. But she continued to run and harbored an
interest in staying competitive. In every single race, over the
three years she has been running competitively, she has gotten
better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia began hitting her stride last year, running in her first
World Cross Country Championship and posting a 5,000-meter time of
15:57 to qualify for her first Olympic trials. Her goals got
grander. With a boost to her confidence, she started training
harder and thinking she could run with top Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things have changed for me,'' Garcia said. ``It seems,
every time I run, I'm running at a new level or new standard. I
look around and see the who's who of American distance running _
Regina Jacobs (36) and Libbie Hickman (35) _ and they're older than
me. It's inspiring.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Staples Inc., the office-supply retailer, announced Thursday
that its fourth-quarter profits rose 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? Its stock fell sharply on the disclosure that
its small Internet business will run up much bigger losses this
year than previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
   As a brick-and-mortar retailer, Staples continues to turn in
impressive performances. But investors were spooked by news
that &UR;  &LR; the Framingham, Mass. company expects losses this year for
Staples.com to double to $150 million on expected sales of $250
million.
</P>
<P>
   Staples.com sales in fiscal 1999 were $94.3 million, only a
sliver of the company's total sales of $8.84 billion. Still, shares
of Staples stock fell 4 11/16, closing on the Nasdaq at 21 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   The company had been projecting losses for this year of $75
million for Staples.com, said PaineWebber analyst Aram Rubinson.
Doubling that projection was not what Wall Street wanted to hear,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, Staples.com had a loss of
$9.8 million on sales of $43.1 million, compared with a loss of
$285,000 on sales of $7.8 million in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinson had nothing but good things to say about Staples'
traditional brick-and-mortar operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a terrific retailer, one of the best around,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But for the short term, Staples may find itself in a
click-and-mortar dilemma. The Net has spawned two types of
retailers. There are so-called pure-plays _ retailers that only
sell goods online. Then there are click-and-mortar businesses such
as Staples that sell goods online and in brick-and-mortar stores.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, big losses were almost a badge of honor for publicly
traded pure-play retailers. Though these upstarts produced oceans
of red ink, investors bid up their stock prices to lofty levels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when traditional retailers dabble in the new economy of
e-commerce, they're now sometimes judged by the hard-eyed
arithmetic of the old economy. That's one reason why Staples plans
to issue a separate stock that tracks the performance of
Staples.com.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNNfn, Staples chairman and chief executive
Thomas G. Stemberg expressed some frustration with how Wall Street
now seems to regard his company and the potential for Staples.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there are some analysts who don't fully appreciate
the long-term ramifications of significant moves on the Internet,''
said Stemberg.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said that the Staples.com work force should
grow from 140 to 300 employees this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, Staples said its net income was $129.2
million. Fourth-quarter sales rose 25 percent to $2.59 billion. At
stores open at least a year, sales rose 10 percent.

FIDELITY INVESTMENTS DOUBLES PROFIT IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fidelity Investments earned a record $1.01 billion last
year, more than doubling its 1998 profit, as surging online
investments helped push managed assets to nearly $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The results mark a huge comeback for the nation's biggest mutual
fund firm after a disappointing 1998, when earnings slumped 17
percent. Fidelity attributed the gains to a jump in Web activity,
higher fund sales through brokers, and success overseas,
particularly in Canada and Japan, according to its annual report,
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's revenues rose 31 percent, to $8.85 billion, twice the
growth rate in 1998. At the same time, Fidelity reaped cost savings
by driving more trading and customer service to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very cost effective,'' said James Lowell, editor of
Fidelity Investor, an independent newsletter in Needham, Mass. He
suggested Fidelity's internal motto last year was ``to get our
customers onto the Web. That's clearly the mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity introduced its Powerstreet online brokerage last year,
which lets customers trade, track their investments, and access
news and research online. The number of Internet accounts at the
firm soared 71 percent last year, to 3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Assets in online accounts doubled to $269.2 billion. That was
five times the 20 percent growth seen in Fidelity's traditional
mutual funds, which totaled $351.1 billion at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of phone calls handled in
Fidelity's service centers decreased to 659.3 million from 680.1
million in 1998. That meant 3.1 percent fewer calls per day.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to shareholders and employees in the annual
report, Fidelity chairman Edward C. Johnson 3d noted that fund
sales to individuals grew ``less vigorously'' than in the past. He
called the market for selling funds to individuals ``maturing and
highly competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   As the entire fund industry grapples with slower growth,
Fidelity is gunning to increase its share of online brokerage, to
compete with Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and newer entrants such as
E-Trade. The popularity of online trading took off last year, as
investors were dazzled by unusually quick returns on technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity customers did 78 percent of their trades on the Web in
1999, up from 64 percent in the prior year. And investors sent
55,417 trades per day to Fidelity, more than double the 21,561
trades executed per day in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A strong, if up-and-down, stock market buoyed Fidelity's growth
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the market going up gives them more earnings,'' observed
Michael Lipper, founder of Lipper Inc., the Summit, N.J.,
fund-ranking firm. Indeed, not only does Fidelity earn more fees
with every dollar that comes in the door, but several of its stock
funds regained the old star power that wowed investors in the late
1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four of Fidelity's stock funds beat the benchmark
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index. And there were many standouts. The
firm's Aggressive Growth soared 103 percent, while New Millennium
(closed to new investors) rose 109 percent. Growth Company jumped
79.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of several hot funds overshadowed the fact that
Fidelity's funds beat only 50 percent of their peers in 1999, down
from 70 percent in 1998. Active managers across the industry beat
the indexes and posted strong returns.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson described last year as ``an environment that was less
than calm because of market volatility and increasing
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Fidelity Capital group, where Fidelity starts and runs
new ventures, there were several big gains:
</P>
<P>
   --BostonCoach's revenues jumped 19 percent to $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Fidelity's Life Insurance Co. notched a record $2 billion in
sales for the year, for a total $16 billion under management.
</P>
<P>
   --Fidelity received a federal savings bank charter.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the success of COLT, the telecommmunications company
Fidelity Capital launched and took public, Johnson said the firm
had to be careful ``that we don't neglect our traditional
businesses even as new opportunities demand our energy.''

NFL PAYS CONNECTICUT $2.4M TO SETTLE PATRIOTS CLAIMS

<P>
   BOSTON _ The National Football League paid Connecticut $2.4
million Thursday to settle any legal claims the state might seek
over the New England Patriots' hustle out of Hartford last year.
</P>
<P>
   Governor John G. Rowland said the money will allow the state to
recoup the legal and planning costs incurred during negotiations
with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision that instead of making up some number and
applying something for punitive damages or emotional stress . . .
the best thing to do was to ask for just the reimbursement for the
costs we incurred,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   While every team in the league will pay a share of the
settlement, NFL officials said the agreement absolved both the
league and the Patriots of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, Connecticut also returned a $2 million
letter of credit to the Patriots, which the state had been holding
since last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Connecticut pursued its stadium proposal fairly
and we are pleased that all remaining issues have been resolved,''
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Boston Globe reported last week, the settlement comes
almost a year after Kraft announced he was pulling out of a deal to
move his team from Foxborough to a publicly financed stadium in
downtown Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft signed an agreement to relocate in late 1998, but within
months it was clear there were serious problems in cleaning up the
polluted stadium site. Using a clause in the contact giving him a
penalty-free exit prior to May 1, Kraft backed out of the deal
April 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Kraft walked away from Connecticut, Bay State
lawmakers passed a bill giving the team $70 million in
infrastructure aid for a new Foxboro Stadium. The bill had been
pushed by the NFL and Boston business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts lawmakers and the Patriots insist they respected
language forbidding the team from talking with anyone else while
the contract was in force. Patriots spokesman Stacey James said
Kraft would not comment on the settlement.

BUSH-MCCAIN ENMITY GAP NOW 2,000 MILES WIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What a difference a few primaries make.
</P>
<P>
   Back before the first votes were ever cast, George W. Bush and
John McCain had only the warmest of words for one another. At
debates, they referred to one another as friends, and when they saw
each other they hugged. Never was a critical word exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think I would make a better president,'' was the worst
that McCain could muster. Usually, he would say of his rival: ``I
think he's a very fine and decent person who's been a good
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush repeatedly praised McCain as a hero. ``John
is a good man. I do think his story is compelling,'' Bush has said.
``He's a straight talker.''
</P>
<P>
   No more. Since they left New Hampshire behind, enmity has
replaced cordiality. Each man has a long list of grievances against
the other. And Thursday night, there was no hugging before the
debate, with the pair separated by about 2,000 miles, a gap that
was as much a metaphor for the state of their relationship as it
was a matter of geography.
</P>
<P>
   When asked this week about the status of the friendship, Bush
was cool and clipped: ``That's something I'll have to reassess
after the primary is over.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Bush called McCain to congratulate him on his victory
in New Hampshire, he ignored political etiquette and did not
congratulate McCain for winning primaries in Michigan and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, called Bush after losing to the Texas governor
in South Carolina and after Bush won the Virginia primary. But
McCain said their most recent conversation was terse on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   McCain congratulated Bush, and Bush said ``thanks.'' End of
phone call. McCain shrugged his shoulders after recounting the
frosty reception.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the relationship broke down as soon as the pair
arrived in South Carolina. A veteran, by the name of J. Thomas
Burch, Jr. stood by Bush's side and accused McCain -- a prisoner of
war in North Vietnam for five and a half years -- of abandoning
veterans and their concerns about Agent Orange and the Gulf War
Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came home and he forgot us,'' said Burch, chairman of the
National Vietnam and Gulf War Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   It was an affront that angered McCain, who believed that Bush
should have repudiated Burch on the spot. ``I gave him a pass on
the National Guard and now he comes after me on this,'' McCain said
at the time, referring to Bush's stateside service during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, reacted with outrage when McCain
launched a television commercial comparing him to President Clinton
and accusing him of breaking a handshake agreement not to run
negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we really want another politician in the White House we
can't trust,'' asks the announcer.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bush: ``That's about as low a blow as you can get in the
Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
   On a daily basis since, the back-and-forth continues to take on
an increasingly emotional tenor as every charge ratchets up the
palpable dislike between the two as they argue over phone banks,
push-polling, fliers and political ads.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the primary contest, there is little hope
of a let up. The Bush campaign began running a radio ad in New York
accusing McCain of opposing federal funds for breast cancer
research, which caused McCain, once again, to react with dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this really the way to run a presidential campaign?''
McCain said when he first found out. ``You would think this was for
county sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he was even sharper, for fear voters would believe he
is uncaring about cancer: ``Governor Bush, get out of the gutter.''

 &HT;    A start, but closure's not close
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ As John Rocker slipped onto Disney property
Thursday morning, he, like everyone else, was greeted at the gate
by the likenesses of the Magic Kingdom's cartoon elite.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger than life, there they are, a mouse of color and a duck
with a speech impediment. Even here, a lesson in diversity. There
is nowhere to escape from life's delicious differences, a truth
being jackhammered home to the Braves' raked-over reliever.
</P>
<P>
   We interrupt the odes to spring to bring you the latest in the
saga of a baseball player turned pariah. About 150 media types and
half as many Braves invitees were here to witness Rocker's return.
It was no great honor to be part of the former group, as we staked
out the parking lot by the light of dawn in hopes of glimpsing his
first steps toward redemption. As if his every movement was of
presidential importance. On top of that, we missed him, Rocker
already showing a gift for finding the side entrance that will
serve him well this season.
</P>
<P>
   This day would have been so much better spent celebrating the
start of spring games, the Georgia Bulldogs in to get some
snapshots and take their annual beating. A fine and beautiful day
in which the Braves' phenom in training, Rafael Furcal, went deep
his first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rocker came down out of that deer stand where Sports
Illustrated left him, exchanged the camouflage for his Braves
blues, and commenced trying to get right with his team. No longer a
symbol, now a flesh and blood presence.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wonderful to report that Thursday was the merciful
end of the Rocker ordeal. It also would be wrong. Call this, at
best, the beginning of the end. Or, at least, the end of the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   First came the meeting with his teammates, and by most reports,
it went swimmingly. They seem to be putting more effort into the
reconciliation than Rocker himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it was much better than I thought it would be,''
Rocker said about the reception.
</P>
<P>
   The making over of Rocker has gone so far that Brian Jordon, one
of his sternest critics after the offensive SI story, was moved to
say, ``The guy's gone through a lot. I feel sorry for him.'' It's
but a short leap from there to martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the closer did find some closure.
</P>
<P>
   His initial meeting with the gathered media was less successful.
The last event staged in the Disney field house was a
cheer-and-dance competition. Then came Rocker, for something
completely different. He didn't even try to tap dance. He simply
read another statement, with all the feeling of a man ordering off
a cafeteria menu.
</P>
<P>
   We still await the first signs of unscripted contrition. On the
other hand, keeping his mouth shut is not such a terrible idea.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the shortened suspension. Rocker's punishment began this
day. As he left the news conference, he was shadowed by mini-cams.
As he retreated to the bullpen, cameramen scrambled to the high
ground of the right field seats to shoot down on his sanctuary. A
beefy Disney security man tried to keep microphones away while
Rocker signed autographs. Peace will come grudgingly.
</P>
<P>
   The voice of the people seemed with him. He was cheered as he
made his first appearance, warming up with friend Rudy Seanez in
the outfield. Making his way back to the clubhouse after the
morning labors, he could hear, ``Way to go, Rocker!'' and ``First
Amendment!'' and ``We love you, John!''
</P>
<P>
   Only one dissenter, his Big Apple roots obvious in his accent,
said, ``You'll like the reception in New York.'' Hardly the worst
Rocker will hear this season.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday only started a long process. There's an evolution going
on. ``It's John's turn to be humble,'' Chipper Jones said. ``We'll
see how humble he is.''
</P>
<P>
   And what better time and place for him to get the message that
it's a small world after all.

 &HT;    MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, MITSUBISHI SCRAP PLANS FOR SALT MINE

<P>
   SAN DIEGO, Calif. _ After a five-year battle, the Mexican
government and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. pulled the plug Thursday on
an industrial project critics said would have harmed one of the
last pristine gray whale breeding grounds in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The project would have created one of the world's largest salt
mining industries inside Mexico's Viscaino Biosphere Reserve, on
the Pacific Coast of Baja California Sur.

   An existing salt factory _ Exportadora del Sal (ESSA) _ is 51
percent-owned by the Mexican government and 49 percent-owned by
Mitsubishi. Since 1994, a plan to build the second plant on the
nearby Laguna San Ignacio has drawn international criticism from
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic,'' said Jared Blumenfeld, habitat director of
the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). `` We're proud to
have protected one of the world's true natural treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Mitsubishi and Mexico government believed that
scientific evidence supported their claim that the factory would
not harm the whales' breeding ground, on Thursday they acknowledged
mounting public pressure against the project and agreed that it
would have an adverse impact on the landscape near the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became more and more aware of the need to preserve the
environmental integrity of the area,'' said Mitsubishi
International executive vice president James Brumm, speaking at a
news conference in Mexico City. ``There was a lot of public
pressure, and we certainly felt the brunt of all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists gathering in San Diego Thursday night for a
trip to Baja California Sur to see the whales said that their
journey will now be a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Some whale experts argue that the existing salt factory on the
edge of another breeding area had not reduced the number of gray
whales that migrate there. Others argue that the salt factory has
contributed to degradation of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists opposed to the proposed salt works called
their five-year campaign one of the most important battles to
preserve the environment and bio-diversity. They argued that the
project would not only threaten the gray whales, but other
endangered species including black sea turtles and prong-horned
antelopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally, there should never have been the possibility that
this would pass muster,'' said Mark Spalding, an international
environmental policy expert at the University of California at San
Diego and consultant to environmental groups. ``This is the largest
biosphere in all of Latin America. It is in the country that came
up with the concept of biospheres. And the precedent set would have
reverberated worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenfeld said a massive grassroots campaign that targeted
Mitsubishi and its automobile dealerships with boycotts forced the
Japanese multinational to listen. Critics sent more than one
million letters to Mitsubishi urging them to stop the second plant.
Forty-three cities in California passed resolutions against the
project, and similar campaigns were underway in Europe, Mexico and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   IFAW persuaded asset managers of 15 ``environmentally
sensitive'' mutual funds, representing some $14 billion in assets,
to not do business with Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenfeld also said Mitsubishi dealerships and Union Bank of
California, in which Mitsubishi owns a majority stake, had come
under pressure from customers. The companies told environmentalists
they too wanted the project ``to go away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists' showed ``it's not enough to say this is a
beautiful place that deserves to be protected, you've got to hurt a
company's bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks Thursday, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo said the
``national and world importance and the uniqueness of the Viscaino
Biosphere Reserve'' was an overriding concern persuading the
government to scrap the proposed 116-square-mile project that ESSA
said would have created 200 much-needed jobs to the isolated
region.

CLINTON OFFERS FIRMS $1B CREDIT IN SEARCH FOR CHEAP AIDS VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to spur a race for the discovery of vaccines
for the world's deadliest diseases, President Clinton Thursday
brought into the White House the heads of the four largest
pharmaceutical companies with an offer to create a guaranteed
market for new drugs in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced legislation to create a $1 billion tax credit
over 10 years for pharmaceuticals that would cover the cost of an
economical vaccine for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis or malaria in
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, remniscent of the gathering organized by White
House in 1996 when Clinton cajoled apparel and footwear companies
to end exploitation in sweatshops, was prompted by the unfolding
health pandemic in Africa, where 13 million children have lost one
or both parents to the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said nothing at the beginning of the meeting in his
Cabinet Room, but listened for an hour to participants from
pharmaceutical and biotech companies, from public health advocates,
from philanthropic institutions and from those in his
administration. He spoke at the end, telling the group that dealing
the disease of those in poverty was a moral obligation, ``one very
much in our self interest as well,'' according to the notes of one
participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us, `It was the right thing to do,' '' said Carol
Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   The big question remains whether the pharmaceutical companies _
known as Big Pharma _ will calculate that the administration's
incentives, coupled with other publicly financed sweeteners, would
create a profitable market.
</P>
<P>
   There was some doubt Thursday. ``I think it's great the
president called this meeting, but what we've heard from the
industry in the past is that $1 billion is not nearly enough pull
to get Big Pharma interested in working on these vaccines,'' said
Jim Yong Kim, co-director of Harvard's Program in Infectious
Disease and Social Change.
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Kremer, a Harvard economist whose research influenced
the president's proposal, said in an interview Thursday the plan
was ``a major step in the right direction, but I think more is
going to be needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kremer, who estimated a need for $2.5 billion over 10 years in
incentives per vaccine to spark interest from the pharmaceuticals,
said he expected funds from the World Bank and European countries
to help bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
   The administration plan, which in some respect parallels
legislation sponsored by Democratic Senator John Kerry of
Massachusetts and Republican Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, also
calls for $50 million toward a vaccine purchase fund established by
the Global Alliance for Vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Thursday almost fell through, according to Senate
and White House officials. In exchange for a presidential audience
and the ensuing free publicity, White House officials requested the
pharmaceutical companies donate large amounts of existing vaccines
and push ahead with clinical trials of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   At first, officials resisted, but later relented. Among the
announcements Thursday outside the Cabinet Room: Merck &AMP; Co.
donated 5 million doses of Recombivaz HB, a vaccine to prevent
hepititus B, a $100 million value; SmithKline Beecham agreed to
continue a second stage of clinical trial for a malaria vaccine;
American Home Products Corp. donated 10 million doses of
Haemophilus influenza type-B vaccine, helping protect 3 million
children; and Aventis Pharm gave 50 million doses of polio vaccine
to five war-ravaged African nations.
</P>
<P>
   The company heads said they were already committed to doing
research on vaccines. ``The key is once these drugs are discovered,
is to get access to them worldwide, particularly the developing
world,'' said Raymond V. Gilmartin, chairman, president and CEO of
Merck.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmartin described the White House initiative as a means of
`providing funding to the developing world to be able to develop
the infrastructure, the health-care delivery systems, as well as to
be able to finance health programs within each of these
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Said William Gates Sr., co-president of the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation: ``There's a real prospect that we will change the
world in a very significant way in a matter of a very few years.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Nils Daulaire, president and CEO of Global
Health Council, a White River Junction, Vt.-based coalition of
international providers, said he was surprised at the support
expressed by the industry presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see the opening being provided by the president's
policy,'' said Daulaire, a former administration health policy
adviser. ``One of the Big Pharma heads said vaccines account for
less than 2 percent of their overall budget. They could double
their investment and still not make a huge dent on their bottom
line.''

 &HT;    Lewis investigator faces probe over remark
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta policeman who arrested Baltimore Ravens
star Ray Lewis on murder charges is under investigation within his
own department for allegedly asking questions of a racial nature
that angered two potential witnesses in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Police Department's Office of Professional Standards
and Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson have confirmed that an inquiry has
begun to determine whether Lt. Mike Smith made a remark that
offended two men who are acquainted with Lewis. The men are
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Williams, one of the potential witnesses, had been with
Lewis on Jan. 29, while Lewis was signing autographs at the Sports
Authority in Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   But before police could learn what Williams knew about the three
knives purchased at the store that day, the interview turned sour.
</P>
<P>
   According to Williams, Smith immediately asked who, other than
Lewis, was at the Sports Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he told Smith he knew of only one other man, and
knew him only by nickname. Smith then asked Williams what his own
nickname was. Williams says that when he told Smith he didn't have
one, the officer responded: ``C'mon, you know all you
African-Americans have a nickname for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he and the other witness left the room and refused
to continue the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I went up there to talk to them as a citizen
and I was treated like that,'' Williams said this week. ``When he
said that I told him, `I don't appreciate that kind of comment,'
and I walked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigator Ken Allen, the lead detective on the killings, ran
after Williams and apologized for Smith's remark, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a 26-year veteran of the force who was named commander of
the homicide unit in September, said the men misinterpreted his
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said something that may have been taken the wrong way, but I
would never say anything of a racial nature,'' Smith said. ``I was
on Maynard Jackson's executive protection team. How could I be a
racist?''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Norman, an associate city attorney, confirmed the Smith
investigation. The Office of Professional Standards investigates
every complaint lodged against a police officer. An investigation
could last several months

 &HT;    Lawyer seeks tests on stabbing victims
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The attorney for one of the defendants in the
post-Super Bowl stabbing deaths in Atlanta asked the court Thursday
for the drug test results performed on the two men killed.
</P>
<P>
   The move is another indication that at least one of the three
defendants in the case will claim the killings were self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Sadow, attorney for murder suspect Joseph Sweeting, is
seeking tests performed on the bodies of Richard Lollar and Jacinth
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   He claims the tests ``will tend to show that one or both of the
decedents were aggressors.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sadow filed a motion asking for the tests performed
on the gun he contends Lollar might have carried the night of the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if police even have the gun that was fired at
the scene. Friends of Lollar say he did not own a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting is a co-defendant with All Pro linebacker Ray Lewis and
Reginald Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   The three were rushed into a limousine when a fight broke out
near the Cobalt lounge in Buckhead, Atlanta's entertainment
district. The two men died of stab wounds to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   In other motions filed Thursday, Ray Lewis' attorneys asked to
opt in to the discovery process, meaning that the state must,
before trial, turn over evidence it uncovers in the case. By doing
so, the Lewis team must turn over their evidence to the state.

 &HT;    Redgrave a standout in HBO's special
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the love that dare not speak its name to the love that gets
its own prime-time show, a new HBO special, ``If These Walls Could
Talk 2,'' traces the recent history of lesbianism.
</P>
<P>
   It does so with splashy stars (Sharon Stone, Vanessa Redgrave,
Ellen DeGeneres, Chloe Sevigny, Michelle Williams), flashes of
greatness, some nudity and sheet rumpling to lure the folks who
will tune in just for that, and several buckets of
diversity-seminar jawing about tolerance and acceptance. This is
not a debate, but a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``If These Walls Could Talk,'' in 1996, was about
abortion, and remains HBO's highest-ever rated ``movie.'' Both
``Walls'' are not really movies, though, but trilogies of stories,
each about a half-hour long. Both were produced, written and
directed entirely by women, and gay and straight women collaborated
on Sunday's offering. (``The Sopranos,'' incidentally, moves back
to 8 p.m. just for Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessor, ``Walls'' links its stories closely, with
a single house in which the three stories take place. First it's
1961, with an elderly lesbian couple; then 1972, with a group of
college feminists; then 2000, with a thoroughly modern couple of
gals trying to have a baby.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, as Doris Day's ``Que Sera, Sera'' plays in the
background, Redgrave stars as elderly Edith, whose lifetime
companion Abby is dying. Edith is denied visiting privileges at the
hospital because she isn't ``family'' and then must deal with
Abby's condescending relatives, who think they were just two old
spinsters sharing a house.
</P>
<P>
   There are scenes of unbearable sadness here, such as Redgrave
taking old framed photos off the walls that leave a brighter
wallpaper behind them. And Redgrave is beyond awesome in bringing
Edith to life. The story itself is really just a pro-tolerance
public service announcement, but Redgrave is so perfect she not
only transcends it, she makes the segment transcend its own
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to 1972 (``Share the Land'' by the Guess Who is playing),
and Williams (``Dawson's Creek'') is Linda, living with a group of
radical lesbian college students. One night they go to a ``dyke
bar'' (their words), and Linda is picked up by Amy (Sevigny, a best
supporting actress Oscar nominee for ``Boys Don't Cry''). Problem:
Amy is ultra-butch (short hair, necktie, motorcycle) and the other
lesbians are threatened by her persona, for reasons that are never
clear.
</P>
<P>
   But the chemistry between Williams and Sevigny is as potent as
can be (their long, wordless lovemaking scene will be what everyone
will be talking about Monday morning), and Sevigny's Amy is a
swaggering presence with a sweet core; along with Redgrave's Edith,
she's the only character who lingers after ``Walls'' is over.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, DeGeneres and Stone star in the contemporary episode as
a couple trying to get Stone pregnant through artificial
insemination. Unlike the first two, the tone here is goofy and
farcical (``Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves'' in the background
couldn't be more tongue in cheek), with an undercurrent of
wistfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Stone is as loose as can be, but DeGeneres is mainly playing a
version of herself, and the fact that her companion, Anne Heche,
wrote and directed the segment, and the couple has talked publicly
about possibly having a child, make ``2000'' squirmy rather than
uplifting. And while the 1972 segment's love scene is the pivotal
plot point, the Stone-DeGeneres coupling is gratuitous even by HBO
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walls'' ends up being too diffuse to sum up easily. There's
sex, sermonizing, a tone of political correctness that weighs
heavily, and Stone dancing giddily with a turkey baster. To crib
from the Indigo Girls, it's close, but could be even closer to
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If These Walls Could Talk 2''
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. Sunday on HBO .
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A mixed bag of strange bedfellows (and that's meant
figuratively, not literally).
</P>

 &HT;    Ratings, talent roster among WCW's woes
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pro wrestling continues to ride a wave of popular interest on
TV, in toy stores, on T-shirts and in ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   But in this time of plenty, the Atlanta-based WCW franchise has
run into its share of troubles, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the WCW has become a popular target for lawsuits: Three
of its wrestlers are suing over alleged racial discrimination (see
article above), and last month Shane ``the Franchise'' Douglas sued
the WCW for firing him after he suffered a wrestling-related
injury. Last year, the legendary Ric ``Nature Boy'' Flair sued the
WCW over a contract dispute, then settled.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important to the WCW's bottom line is faltering TV
ratings. Although WCW shows such as ``Monday Nitro'' and
``Thunder'' consistently show up among the nation's top cable
programs, they have fallen to a distant second behind edgier fare
offered by the rival World Wrestling Federation. The ratings and a
roster of aging wrestlers earning six- and seven-figure salaries
probably led to the corporate decision to remove WCW President Eric
Bischoff last year.
</P>
<P>
   The WCW seemed to improve its fortunes recently by hiring Vince
Russo, a popular wrestling scriptwriter lured from the WWF. But the
coup was short-lived. Russo has been feuding lately with WCW
executives over creative differences, and four popular WCW
wrestlers have since defected to the WWF.
</P>
<P>
   With the talent exodus and the sense among fans that the WCW is
saddled with Golden Age stars like Flair and Hollywood Hogan, the
league is showing no signs of overtaking the WWF.
</P>
<P>
   Both leagues telecast their two-hour, marquee cable events on
Mondays: WCW's ``Nitro'' on TNT and WWF's ``Raw'' on USA. A year
ago the shows were a virtual dead heat. ``Raw'' now more than
doubles ``Nitro's'' ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nitro'' had a chance to rebound Feb. 14 when ``Raw'' was
pre-empted to make room for USA's presentation of the Westminster
Kennel Club Dog Show. But the pooches narrowly beat the WCW
performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now WCW is the underdog. We're David fighting Goliath,''
admits WCW spokesman Alan Sharp. But he says the troubles haven't
put the WCW on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``WCW is focused on strengthening entertainment appeal of our
shows with compelling programs, larger-than-life personalities and
strong production. We will win the fan support one week at a
time.''

 &HT;    Under Galliano, the D in Dior stands for daring
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ What a gal wants, and what a gal needs, aren't always
mutually inclusive of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the best fall/winter collections presented this week
came from designers skilled enough to tread that fine line between
wardrobing necessities and desires while keeping firm toeholds on
their individual styles.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Dior
</P>
<P>
   Dior's iconoclastic new design chief, John Galliano, had the
gall to exorcise some demons publicly, instead of privately. He
showed clothes too racy not to make the label's old guard clients'
heads spin. But the devilishly clever collection also should fuel
new interest in the brand among younger women. His theme song _
whose refrain was ``I hate you so much right now!'' _ spoke
volumes. For his critics in the press, he produced coats, boots,
ultrasheer dresses and panties in a mocked-up ``Christian Dior
Daily'' newspaper print, with his own black-hatted photo placed
prominently amid tabloid headlines. For his employers pressuring
him to increase brand recognition, he augmented coats and pants
with belts that had clunky gold ``C'' and ``D'' buckles, and
splashed jeans and other separates with sequined Dior logos. To
show animal rights activists that they could not deter him, he
offered floor-length shearling coats in turquoise and purple. The
models' sassy strutting indicated how much they enjoyed wearing the
tie-dyed snakeskins, animal-print skirts with ragged and slinky
gowns that looked like they were made from strips of tissue.
Galliano emerged from backstage afterward wearing a tank top and
gold lame stretch jeans; confident that he'd flexed his creative
muscle to its fullest.
</P>
<P>
   Celine
</P>
<P>
   With the fanfare of the '80s nighttime soap ``Dynasty'' blaring
as his theme song, Celine design chief Michael Kors showed clothes
that juxtaposed the overindulged boarding schooler's style against
that of her manor-born mother. The looks were elitist, yet
electric: the suits _ in tweed or brown, blue and burgundy cashmere
and camel hair _ had a snug, sexy fit to them; skirts stopped at
the knee, but had a sultry swing to them; blazers were monogrammed
regally with Celine's logo; and jeans were trimmed extravagantly
with fur. As testament to Kors' mastery of textiles, even the
corduroy and paisley-print silk pieces seduced the eyes.
Eveningwear looks varied between crystal-encrusted, ruffle-skirted
gowns and ensembles composed of brilliant black-and-white pants
with shimmering blouses.

   Anyone who thinks a collection laden with pinstriped suits can't
be captivating hasn't seen the fall looks from Ungaro yet. The use
of color in this collection ranks among the season's most creative,
if only because Ungaro made divergent shades of blue, pink, green
and purple flow together flawlessly. He also offered innovative
twists on treadworn military styling: His broad-shouldered coats
and jackets had not only epaulets, but gold chains dangling
evocatively from them as well. His camouflage print separates came
in emboldened shades of turquoise, fuchsia, copper and cream.
Ungaro found endless ways to embellish garments with beads,
feathers, floral-appliques and sequins and tie-dying, and
patchworking gave his jeans and leathers added playfulness. His
vibrant chenille sweaters had a carefree quality. His coats swept
the floor. And his eveningwear consisted mainly of sassily short
dresses with asymmetrical hemlines and ruffles that danced in the
breeze.

 &HT;    Don't be cross, Paula, but an award does not a career make

   The Grammys as arbiters of musical greatness are rather suspect.
Remember Milli Vanilli? Even artists whose contribution to their
own recordings is not in doubt aren't immune to a precipitous
decline in fortunes following a Grammy win.
</P>
<P>
   One artist who didn't receive quite the glowing response for the
follow-up to her heavily nominated album is in Atlanta this
weekend. (9 p.m. Saturday. $19 at Ticketmaster. The Roxy, 3110
Roswell Road N.E. 404-249-6400 or 404-233-7699). Like Christopher
Cross in 1980, Paula Cole's 1997 Grammy win didn't guarantee that
anyone would stick around for the sequel. Of course, everyone loves
a comeback (just ask Carlos Santana), so you can't count Cole out
yet.

COST FACTOR CITED IN PROPOSAL TO GIVE STUDENTS COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Mayor Boston Thomas M. Menino had the cash, he wouldn't
hesitate to supply every student with city-subsidized computers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry would also do
as much as possible to bridge the so-called digital divide, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   And a spokesman for Governor Paul Cellucci called furnishing
students across Massachusetts with their own computers ``a very
interesting idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine Governor Angus King's proposal Thursday to provide all
seventh-graders in his state with government-issued laptops has
captured the attention of politicians and educators across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   King proposed spending $50 million from a state surplus to buy
the first installment of 17,000 for every student entering the 7th
grade in 2002, and establish a $75 million income-producing private
endowment to buy computers for successive classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're heading into an age when computer literacy is essential.
It's going to be as important as knowing how to read or write,''
King told a small audience of students and teachers at press
conference in Gardiner, Maine, Thursday. ``This isn't a frill. This
is essential ... this is where the country's going.''
</P>
<P>
   But the utopian idea scrapes against the reality of legislators
with competing views of how a state's money should be spent _ even
in an era flush with mounting surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had the resources, I would love to give all the kids free
computers,'' Menino said from in a phone interview from San Jose,
Calif., where where he was attending a conference on how to help
lower-income families access the Internet and use computers.
President Bill Clinton is scheduled to address the conference
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor King's goal of providing laptop computers for all
Seventh graders demonstrates both long-term thinking and an
understanding of the paramount importance of equipping all our
students with the knowledge and skills to succeed in an information
economy,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is encouraging that the digital divide is becoming such an
important policy issue at both the state and federal level,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Cellucci spokesman Jason Kauppi said the governor
supports using technology to improve education, he bridled at the
hundreds of millions of dollars it would surely cost to supply
students computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that would have to be looked at for
feasibility,'' Kauppi said. ``It's interesting; but the hurdle is
the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a similar reaction to King's proposal among many Maine
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   While many state lawmakers initially expressed interest in the
proposal, they quickly raised the issue of whether the state could
afford such a program before paying for needy school repairs and
other pressing obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough sell,'' said Dennis Bailey, King's
press secretary. ``We have a lot of work to do. There are always a
1,000 ways to spend money.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators, however, have lauded King's proposal as a bold and
novel approach to reducing the digital divide, the growing gap in
access to computers and the Internet along racial and economic
lines. According to a US Commerce Department study in July,
households with incomes greater than $75,000 are 20 times as likely
to have computers as those with lower incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very exciting idea, and it makes sense in today's
technological world,'' said Linda Roberts, director of the US
Department of Education's Office of Educational Technology. ``But
this is a major investment. The goals have to be tied to the way
students use the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In similar experiments around the country, where students have
been provided with free computers, researchers found the gifts also
must accompany close supervision and training, Roberts said.
``Where there has been no clear focus, and lack of teacher
training, the kids are just playing games,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if teachers and students are trained to use the computers,
some educators argue it's better for students to focus on the
basics of such elemental skills as reading and writing before
spending too much time on things such as surfing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University Chancellor John Silber said school districts
across Massachusetts have already wasted lots of money on ensuring
kindergarteners and first graders had access to computers. ``There
hands weren't even large enough to fit the keyboard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silber argued against further state investments in computers,
saying many students already have their own computers and the prime
beneficiaries would be the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great school system in Massachusetts before computers
were invented,'' he said. ``Three to four years of high school is
plenty of time to become expert on computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet those school districts that have actually issued students
computers say the positives far outweigh the negatives. At
Milwaukee Public School District, about 250 summer school students
have been given their own computers. And according to
administrators, attendance and class participation dramatically
increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really weren't any negatives,'' said Robert Shleck,
assistant director of technology for Milwaukee Public School,
adding only one computer had been lost and one damaged. ``And in
the end, the kids didn't want to return the computers.''

CLINTON OFFERS FIRMS $1B CREDIT IN SEARCH FOR CHEAP AIDS VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to spur a race for the discovery of vaccines
for the world's deadliest diseases, President Clinton Thursday
brought into the White House the heads of the four largest
pharmaceutical companies with an offer to create a guaranteed
market for new drugs in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced legislation to create a $1 billion tax credit
over 10 years for pharmaceuticals that would cover the cost of an
economical vaccine for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis or malaria in
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, remniscent of the gathering organized by White
House in 1996 when Clinton cajoled apparel and footwear companies
to end exploitation in sweatshops, was prompted by the unfolding
health pandemic in Africa, where 13 million children have lost one
or both parents to the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said nothing at the beginning of the meeting in his
Cabinet Room, but listened for an hour to participants from
pharmaceutical and biotech companies, from public health advocates,
from philanthropic institutions and from those in his
administration. He spoke at the end, telling the group that dealing
the disease of those in poverty was a moral obligation, ``one very
much in our self interest as well,'' according to the notes of one
participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us, `It was the right thing to do,' '' said Carol
Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   The big question remains whether the pharmaceutical companies _
known as Big Pharma _ will calculate that the administration's
incentives, coupled with other publicly financed sweeteners, would
create a profitable market.
</P>
<P>
   There was some doubt Thursday. ``I think it's great the
president called this meeting, but what we've heard from the
industry in the past is that $1 billion is not nearly enough pull
to get Big Pharma interested in working on these vaccines,'' said
Jim Yong Kim, co-director of Harvard's Program in Infectious
Disease and Social Change.
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Kremer, a Harvard economist whose research influenced
the president's proposal, said in an interview Thursday the plan
was ``a major step in the right direction, but I think more is
going to be needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kremer, who estimated a need for $2.5 billion over 10 years in
incentives per vaccine to spark interest from the pharmaceuticals,
said he expected funds from the World Bank and European countries
to help bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
   The administration plan, which in some respect parallels
legislation sponsored by Democratic Senator John Kerry of
Massachusetts and Republican Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, also
calls for $50 million toward a vaccine purchase fund established by
the Global Alliance for Vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Thursday almost fell through, according to Senate
and White House officials. In exchange for a presidential audience
and the ensuing free publicity, White House officials requested the
pharmaceutical companies donate large amounts of existing vaccines
and push ahead with clinical trials of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   At first, officials resisted, but later relented. Among the
announcements Thursday outside the Cabinet Room: Merck &AMP; Co.
donated 5 million doses of Recombivaz HB, a vaccine to prevent
hepititus B, a $100 million value; SmithKline Beecham agreed to
continue a second stage of clinical trial for a malaria vaccine;
American Home Products Corp. donated 10 million doses of
Haemophilus influenza type-B vaccine, helping protect 3 million
children; and Aventis Pharm gave 50 million doses of polio vaccine
to five war-ravaged African nations.
</P>
<P>
   The company heads said they were already committed to doing
research on vaccines. ``The key is once these drugs are discovered,
is to get access to them worldwide, particularly the developing
world,'' said Raymond V. Gilmartin, chairman, president and CEO of
Merck.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmartin described the White House initiative as a means of
``providing funding to the developing world to be able to develop
the infrastructure, the health-care delivery systems, as well as to
be able to finance health programs within each of these
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Said William Gates Sr., co-president of the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation: ``There's a real prospect that we will change the
world in a very significant way in a matter of a very few years.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Nils Daulaire, president and CEO of Global
Health Council, a White River Junction, Vt.-based coalition of
international providers, said he was surprised at the support
expressed by the industry presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see the opening being provided by the president's
policy,'' said Daulaire, a former administration health policy
adviser. ``One of the Big Pharma heads said vaccines account for
less than 2 percent of their overall budget. They could double
their investment and still not make a huge dent on their bottom
line.''

 &HT;    Appeals keep Atlanta reverend out of jail
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Fayette County Sheriff's Department has stopped
looking for the Rev. Creflo Dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar's attorney has filed new appeals with the Georgia Supreme
Court. That means the leader of World Changers Ministries won't be
arrested for contempt of court until the appeals are heard, said
his attorney, Lecora Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   Fayette County Judge Ben Miller found the leader of the
20,000-member church in contempt last December because Dollar
refuses to give a deposition in boxer Evander Holyfield's divorce
case.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar appealed the contempt citation, but the Georgia Supreme
Court dismissed it Feb. 25, saying the proper appeals procedures
were not followed.
</P>
<P>
   In domestic cases, lawyers seek permission to file an appeal
before the actual appeal is filed, according to the Georgia
attorney general's office. Bowen had appealed directly to the high
court.
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court dismissal, Fayette deputies went to the
World Changers church in College Park looking for Dollar, but did
not take him into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen then filed a motion asking the Supreme Court to reconsider
his appeal. Bowen argues the contempt citation was not a domestic
issue.

Harrison, who considers himself a Christian conservative voter, was

<HEADLINE>
SPORTS COLUMN: BASEBALL DRUG POLICY NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before Darryl Strawberry checked into a rehabilitation
clinic in Florida to ``take control of my drug addiction once and
for all,'' he provoked two reactions. Sympathy for the slugger,
scorn for the system.
</P>
<P>
   If Major League Baseball's drug policy were as stern and as
specific as that of the National Basketball Association, the
National Football League and the National Hockey League, the nearly
38-year-old Strawberry would probably not have lingered as a repeat
offender whose presence in a Yankee uniform annoyed at least as
many people as it touched.
</P>
<P>
   In reacting to the reduction of John Rocker's suspension and
fine, Commissioner Bud Selig criticized the arbitrator's disregard
for the ``player's position as a role model to children.'' But with
its soft as Straw drug policy, MLB is disregarding the player's
position as a role model.
</P>
<P>
   The drug policies of the other three sports list specific
punishments for repeat offenders. But the MLB policy, as defined in
a six-page memo in 1997 from Selig, then the chairman of the
executive council as the interim commissioner, warns vaguely that a
``second and any subsequent violation will result in immediate
discipline.'' Immediate perhaps, but too variable, often too
lenient. In the other three sports, it's one-two-three strikes and
you're out. In baseball, ironically, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   When Lawrence Taylor knew his next positive test would result in
an automatic one-year suspension by the NFL, the Giants linebacker
told Coach Bill Parcells not to worry, that he wanted to play too
much to risk another positive test. Strawberry never had that
guillotine hanging above his career until now when it's probably
too late.
</P>
<P>
   If Strawberry had been subject to the current NBA, NFL or NHL
policies with his five documented substance-abuse episodes, he
would have been disciplined more firmly, more quickly and perhaps
more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   When Strawberry voluntarily entered the Smithers Center in New
York for alcohol-abuse rehabilitation in 1990 while with the Mets,
he would automatically have entered the first stage of the
substance-abuse policy in the other three sports with their variety
of mandatory testing procedures as well as their variety of
penalties for ensuing violations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NBA policy, when Strawberry, then with the Dodgers,
voluntarily went to Betty Ford Center in 1994 with a cocaine
problem, he would have been suspended for a minimum of six months
without pay; under the current NFL policy, he would have been fined
the equivalent of four games' pay; under the N.H.L. policy, he
would have been suspended without pay during his treatment there
before being eligible for reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   But as a baseball player, Strawberry was put on the disabled
list with pay, not fined or suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NBA policy, when Strawberry tested positive for
cocaine again in 1995, he would have been suspended with the right
to reapply for reinstatement after two years, as Micheal Ray
Richardson, Roy Tarpley and Stanley Roberts have been. Richardson
went to Italy and, despite being cleared to play in the NBA, is
still playing there. Under the NFL policy, Strawberry's positive
test in 1995 would have resulted in his being suspended with the
right to reapply for reinstatement after one year.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen NFL players, notably Dexter Manley and Leon Lett,
have incurred such a suspension. Manley, a feared pass rusher with
the Redskins, never reapplied for reinstatement. Lett, the Cowboys'
defensive tackle, was reinstated during last season after a year's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NHL policy, Strawberry's positive test in 1995 would
have resulted in his suspension without pay for at least six months
before being eligible for reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   As a baseball player, Strawberry was suspended for only 60 days
for that 1995 positive test; that June he joined the Yankees. Under
NHL policy, after Strawberry's no-contest plea to cocaine
possession last April, he would have been suspended without pay for
at least six months before being eligible for reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   As a baseball player, he was suspended for 120 days last year;
his ban was later reduced by a week and he rejoined the Yankees on
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Under NHL policy, with his recent positive test for cocaine,
Strawberry would have been suspended without pay for at least one
year without any assurance of reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   But as a baseball player, Darryl Strawberry has finally been
suspended for one year, but several years too late.

 LEG INJURIES SLOW WETTELAND, GREER (For
use by NYTimes News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rangers pitcher John Wetteland and
outfielder Rusty Greer spent part of last night undergoing
magnetic-resonance-imaging exams on their lower right legs.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland has a slight strain of his calf muscle, and Greer has
inflammation in his ankle. The results are expected today, but
neither injury is expected to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told not to be too concerned,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``Until I'm told differently ... march on.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland said he experienced a ``twinge'' in the calf area in
the first inning of yesterday's scrimmage and decided it was too
early in spring training to push it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can deal with not throwing for a few days,'' Wetteland said.
``Not being able to work out like I'm used to is disappointing. I
don't want to spend all my time in the training room.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer did not play in yesterday's scrimmage and has been
scratched from today's exhibition opener against the Minnesota
Twins. But the Rangers expect him back early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we skip John two days, it's no big deal,'' Oates said. ``If
Rusty misses three or four days, he won't miss a beat.''
\Nsubheds:Mateo's outlook Ruben Mateo's teammates suggest he is
cocky, but the Rangers' rookie center fielder insisted yesterday
he's a little uncomfortable with the high expectations being placed
on him.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates, after meeting with Mateo on
Wednesday, said it's up to Mateo whether he wants to be an average
$3 million player or a $10 million star putting up big numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But Mateo said yesterday: ``I don't like hearing about those
things. My goal is to play 162 games. After that, I want to help my
team make the playoffs and the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said Mateo needs to be pushed a little more this year. But
Mateo said he understands the manager's point about staying
focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel different than last year,'' Mateo said. ``Last year,
somebody else was playing center field. This year I'm the center
fielder. It's a good feeling. But the one thing I need to do is
play hard every day.'' \Nsubheds:Thompson throws Pitcher Justin
Thompson took another step toward coming back from last year's
surgery on his left shoulder by throwing 25 pitches off the mound
at a distance of 50 feet yesterday. Thompson said he experienced no
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do this a couple, three times more, raising the effort
and frequency slowly,'' pitching coach Dick Bosman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bosman was impressed that Thompson has corrected some of the
mechanical problems that caused the torn labrum in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mechanics look good,'' Bosman said. ``There is nothing
wrong with his mechanics.'' \Nsubheds:No Griffey, Sanders The
Cincinnati Reds won't be bringing their two most-glamorous players
to Port Charlotte tomorrow for their exhibition game against the
Rangers. The Reds informed the Rangers yesterday that Ken Griffey
Jr. and Deion Sanders won't be making the 45-minute trip from
Sarasota.

 MIHM NEEDS ANOTHER SEASON AT TEXAS (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) By MIKE JONES c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Will they or won't they?
</P>
<P>
   The subplot to March madness may continue on into April and May
for hoops fans at Texas and Iowa State as they anxiously await the
decisions of Chris Mihm and Marcus Fizer regarding their respective
future mailing addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Will they return for a senior season? If the answer is yes, both
teams will catapult into serious consideration for 2000-2001
preseason Top 10 lists and the Big 12 will receive an attendant
boost in national prestige. If both opt for the riches of the NBA,
then the league will take a hit when their defections are coupled
with the loss of seniors Desmond Mason of Oklahoma State and
Eduardo Najera of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   My semi-educated guess? Fizer is more likely to go, Mihm more
likely to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Both say they've yet to make a decision and how they say it
rings true. I hope both stay for the simple reason that a
conference that boasts national player-of-the-year candidates is a
more attractive beat. On an even more personal note, I like Mihm
and don't believe that he is ready for the rigors of the NBA,
either physically or mentally. Though he hedges on the question, I
sense Longhorns coach Rick Barnes feels the same way.
</P>
<P>
   As much progress as Mihm has made in the past calendar year, his
game is not at the level I suspect he would like it to be for entry
into the play-for-pay arena. I just can't imagine him going
one-on-one with Shaquille O'Neal and surviving without injury to
his psyche. And Mihm doesn't want to be a journeyman player. He
wants to be one of the best and I think that factor will weigh
heavily when he determines his immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' Mihm said in a recent conversation. ``Even my
friends are asking me about it. And it's only a month away until
the Big Dance is over with. I have so many things to look at and
it's going to take time. Right now, I have so many things on my
plate that I don't have time to think about it. When the time
comes, I'll sit down with my family and loved ones and coach Barnes
and discuss it. But ultimately, I'll make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mihm makes the decision based strictly on what he feels in
his gut, I believe we'll see him in a Texas uniform next season _
no matter what happens on the court during March.
</P>
<P>
   Chris has told me time and time again over the last year that he
really enjoys going to college, and why shouldn't he? I just can't
imagine that he would give that up for the bottom-line life in the
NBA. That's one good reason why he should stay. Another reason has
been sitting on Texas' bench this season _ transfer Maurice Evans,
a 6-foot-5 forward who ranked ninth nationally last year with a
22-point scoring average at Wichita State. Despite the loss of
seniors Gabe Muoneke, Ivan Wagner and Will Clay, Evans could be the
missing link in Barnes' stated goal of making a run at the national
championship. Evans alone could dampen other teams' desires to
double- and triple-team the Longhorns' 7-foot center.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Mihm suffering a career-ending injury next
season? Possible, but unlikely. His family doesn't need the money.
Both Texas and the Big 12 need him. But he needs to do what he
thinks is best for him and him alone. Ultimately, I think he'll
decide what is best is another year in Austin. Could that be so
bad?
Spotlight on ...
Player that few wanted proves a steal for Tech Rayford Young will
finish his career as one of only three players in Texas Tech
history to score more than 1,000 points (currently 1,470) and pass
out more than 400 assists (404). With 36 points and seven assists,
he almost single-handedly led the Red Raiders to the brink of an
upset against Iowa State in the final home game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a kid that few wanted, even though he led Pampa to a
state championship his senior year in high school. He wanted to go
to Texas. Former coach Tom Penders took Anthony Goode instead. But
a lot of other coaches passed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate
playing for coach \RJames\S Dickey,'' Young said. ``He was one of
the few coaches who was willing to give me a chance even though I
was on a team that went 33-3 and won state.''
</P>
<P>
   A class act on and off the court, Young will be remembered as
one of Tech's best ever, though he played during one of the most
difficult times in Raiders history. Recall that at the end of
Young's freshman season, academic certification problems surfaced
that led to NCAA penalties. Tech (19-8) pulled itself from NCAA
Tournament consideration and shortly thereafter, center Tony Battie
opted for the NBA rather than come back for a senior season when
Tech would have been one of the Big 12's top teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about that all the time,'' Young said. ``All that
changed the whole profile of the program. It's still hard to
swallow. I thought a lot about transferring, but I think I still
made the right decision to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-footl-11 (on tiptoes) point guard still dreams of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to have to prove I can play with the big guys
in one of the \RNBA\S camps,'' Young said. ``But that's nothing
new. Everything in my life has come hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lane \Nsubhed:We remember From the October memory bank.
Nebraska coach Paul Sanderford questioning the Big 12 women's
coaches' poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't bet,'' Sanderford qualified. ``But Texas Tech fifth?
Just remember what I said at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, he told us so. And so the No. 7 Lady Raiders (24-3, 13-3)
stand once again in the nation's Top 10, sharing a third
consecutive conference championship after starting league play 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it always feels better the third time around,'' Tech
senior forward Keitha Dickerson said. ``This is special. No one
expected us to win and we did. It's the greatest feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Marsha Sharp admitted, ``After we started 0-2, we thought
we were dead in the water, that we just had to go play hard and
hope to get one of the top four \RBig 12\S seeds and get a decent
seed in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that was good, because it took some pressure off. The
last couple of years there has been a bull's-eye on our backs and
we operated under a lot of self-imposed pressure to live up to
expectations. So \R(winning this share\S has been fun. And the
thing that has made this so rewarding is that this is the best
conference race we've ever been involved in.'' \NSubhed:You foul,
you run It's no accident that Iowa State has made more free throws
(502 of 724) than its opponents have shot (258 of 354). Not
coincidentally, 1999 regular-season champion Texas did the same
thing in conference games (287 made to 286 for opponents' shots),
but nowhere near what the Cyclones have accomplished this season.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation? Fear and loathing of the dreaded wind-sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a lot of time in practice paying penalties for
fouling in practice,'' coach Larry Eustachy said. ``We sometimes
play a two-basket game and if a coach thinks a player has fouled an
opponent, it's an automatic basket and the losers run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play five-on-five, if we see a foul we call it. Then,
we stop and run as a group, the whole team. We put a lot of time
and emphasis into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones, who have clinched the No. 1 seed, attempt to win
it all tomorrow at Baylor. ISU fans have chartered a plane for the
game.
\Nsubhed:Nobody told me Missouri rookie coach Quin Snyder admits he
has been through the wringer this season and is looking forward to
a long nap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical toll of the season is something I had not
anticipated,'' he said. ``The psychological and emotional grind of
the season is very different from being an assistant. As an
assistant, there are times and places you can slide away for a
respite every now and then. But every minute of every day is on the
line as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I was aware of, but until you feel the weight
of the responsibility you're not aware how fatiguing that can be.
You need to be so regimented in your daily routine. I forget to
eat. I don't sleep. The result is that if you're not careful, it
can make you less effective in the short run. It's something I
clearly need to modify.''
Free Throws
</P>
<P>
   If winning a share of the women's championship isn't evidence
enough, Oklahoma coach Sherri Coale clearly demonstrated she has
learned a thing or two after Wednesday's clinching 77-68 victory
over Oklahoma State when asked if she had a retort for fellow
coaches who picked the Sooners sixth in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have words for \Rthe title tie\S even though I planned
for it,'' she said. ``I didn't know at the time we would tie for
first, but I thought we could be in the top three. But no, I don't
have any bulletin-board material for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas women's coach Jody Conradt paid senior Edwina Brown the
ultimate compliment this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I can say about her is she would be on our
all-Texas team, which puts her in some pretty elite company. I
don't think our fans will see a more versatile player in a Texas
uniform for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's Basketball News'' named Edwina Brown and OU's
Phyleshia Whaley to their 10-player All-America team, Iowa State's
Stacy Frese and Kansas' Lynn Pride to the second group. ESPN.com
picks Sherri Coale as national coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Quin Snyder's Tigers (17-10, 10-5) may need another `W' next
week in Kansas City to cement an NCAA invitation, but he appears to
feel good about Missouri's chances after a must-win over Nebraska
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team has made a pretty strong statement this year
about being in the Tournament,'' he said. ``And that's the first
time I've said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Put Columbia, Mo., on the top of my list for favorite old Big
Eight towns, Booche's pool hall hamburgers (order two) as a
favorite local delicacy and the Katy Trail as the best place to
walk 'em off.

 MIHM NEEDS ANOTHER SEASON AT TEXAS (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) By MIKE JONES c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Will they or won't they?
</P>
<P>
   The subplot to March madness may continue on into April and May
for hoops fans at Texas and Iowa State as they anxiously await the
decisions of Chris Mihm and Marcus Fizer regarding their respective
future mailing addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Will they return for a senior season? If the answer is yes, both
teams will catapult into serious consideration for 2000-2001
preseason Top 10 lists and the Big 12 will receive an attendant
boost in national prestige. If both opt for the riches of the NBA,
then the league will take a hit when their defections are coupled
with the loss of seniors Desmond Mason of Oklahoma State and
Eduardo Najera of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   My semi-educated guess? Fizer is more likely to go, Mihm more
likely to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Both say they've yet to make a decision and how they say it
rings true. I hope both stay for the simple reason that a
conference that boasts national player-of-the-year candidates is a
more attractive beat. On an even more personal note, I like Mihm
and don't believe that he is ready for the rigors of the NBA,
either physically or mentally. Though he hedges on the question, I
sense Longhorns coach Rick Barnes feels the same way.
</P>
<P>
   As much progress as Mihm has made in the past calendar year, his
game is not at the level I suspect he would like it to be for entry
into the play-for-pay arena. I just can't imagine him going
one-on-one with Shaquille O'Neal and surviving without injury to
his psyche. And Mihm doesn't want to be a journeyman player. He
wants to be one of the best and I think that factor will weigh
heavily when he determines his immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' Mihm said in a recent conversation. ``Even my
friends are asking me about it. And it's only a month away until
the Big Dance is over with. I have so many things to look at and
it's going to take time. Right now, I have so many things on my
plate that I don't have time to think about it. When the time
comes, I'll sit down with my family and loved ones and coach Barnes
and discuss it. But ultimately, I'll make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mihm makes the decision based strictly on what he feels in
his gut, I believe we'll see him in a Texas uniform next season _
no matter what happens on the court during March.
</P>
<P>
   Chris has told me time and time again over the last year that he
really enjoys going to college, and why shouldn't he? I just can't
imagine that he would give that up for the bottom-line life in the
NBA. That's one good reason why he should stay. Another reason has
been sitting on Texas' bench this season _ transfer Maurice Evans,
a 6-foot-5 forward who ranked ninth nationally last year with a
22-point scoring average at Wichita State. Despite the loss of
seniors Gabe Muoneke, Ivan Wagner and Will Clay, Evans could be the
missing link in Barnes' stated goal of making a run at the national
championship. Evans alone could dampen other teams' desires to
double- and triple-team the Longhorns' 7-foot center.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Mihm suffering a career-ending injury next
season? Possible, but unlikely. His family doesn't need the money.
Both Texas and the Big 12 need him. But he needs to do what he
thinks is best for him and him alone. Ultimately, I think he'll
decide what is best is another year in Austin. Could that be so
bad?

 REMARKS UNITE CHRISTIAN RIGHT AGAINST McCAIN 
 (rk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is hard to know how many Bob Harrisons are out
there. But each one is a nightmare for Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, a 60-year-old electrical engineer and a leader of the
choir at Atlanta's Mount Paran Church of God, was once an
enthusiastic McCain supporter. He liked the Arizona senator's
heroic military background. He liked his positions on education and
health care. And he liked his penchant for straight talk. ``I was
really pulling for him,'' Harrison said. ``He was the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That all changed this week. Harrison, who considers himself a
Christian conservative voter, was deeply offended by McCain's
attacks on Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, whom he described in a
speech on Monday as ``agents of intolerance'' comparable to Louis
Farrakhan and Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was out of line,'' Harrison said, pausing on
Wednesday night between dinner in the church fellowship hall and
choir practice. ``It's almost like a John Rocker episode. I don't
agree with everything Robertson and Falwell say, but McCain was
attacking the faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Harrison is leaning toward voting for Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas in Tuesday's Republican primary in Georgia. And if McCain
happens to win the party's nomination, Harrison may stay home in
November rather than casting his traditional Republican vote. ``I
just haven't gotten over this,'' he said, ``and I probably won't.''
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of interviews this week, both the leaders and the rank
and file of the religious conservative movement said that McCain
may succeed in accomplishing what Robertson and Falwell could not.
By unleashing an offensive against the movement's two most visible
spokesmen, in a strategic appeal to moderate Republicans and
independents, McCain seems to have energized Christian conservative
support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the Virginia primary on Tuesday, held the day after McCain
made his widely publicized remarks, Bush won the votes of nearly 80
percent of those who considered themselves part of the religious
right, a significantly higher percentage than in previous
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Not only may McCain have miscalculated by alienating voters like
Harrison and by rousing those who leaned ambivalently toward Bush,
he also may have created for himself a formidable repair job should
he win his party's nomination. Seventeen percent of voters in the
presidential elections of 1992 and 1996 were white Christians who
identified with the religious right, and nearly two-thirds of them
voted for the Republican nominee, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McCain's remarks are irresponsible,'' said Dr. Paige
Patterson, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the
country's largest Protestant denomination, with 14 million members.
``And I would say if he wins the primary, they are the remarks of a
man who apparently doesn't want to be president of the United
States, because it's difficult for me to believe that a Republican
can win the election while deliberately abusing a considerable
segment of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Can McCain win back Christian conservative voters? ``I'd say
it'd be pretty difficult,'' said Patterson, a North Carolinian who
supports Bush. ``I hope evangelical Christians are always willing
to forgive. But I've certainly not seen any disposition on the part
of Mr. McCain to do anything other than critique people of
evangelical faith.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain only deepened his problems with evangelicals by telling
reporters on Tuesday that Robertson and Falwell exerted an ``evil
influence'' on the Republican Party. Those comments followed nearly
two weeks of heavy criticism by McCain of Bush's decision to speak
at Bob Jones University on Feb. 2 without renouncing the
fundamentalist school's ban on interracial dating and the
anti-Catholic views of its leaders. While many Christian
conservatives, including many of the movement's leaders, also
object to the university's practices, they were made uncomfortable
by McCain's intense focus on a Christian college.
</P>
<P>
   McCain apologized on Wednesday, but only for the ``evil
influence'' comment, which he characterized as a ``flip remark.''
Gary Bauer, a Christian conservative leader who endorsed McCain
after withdrawing from the Republican race, issued a statement on
Wednesday repudiating McCain's ``unwarranted, ill-advised and
divisive attacks on certain religious leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Until McCain's speech, the Christian conservative movement had
been riven this year by a debate over its place in American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious conservatives, disillusioned by President
Clinton's political survival and the failure of the
Republican-controlled Congress to change national policy on
abortion, school prayer and gay rights, have advocated a retreat
into the life of the church and the family. That, they say, is the
most effective way to bolster the country's moral standing. Others
insist that Christians must continue to fight for political
influence, while developing the sophistication to understand that
politics is a game of compromise and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who encourage continued political activism, Bush has
been a clear preference over McCain. But the level of fervor for
Bush, a United Methodist, has not approached that enjoyed by Ronald
Reagan or Robertson in their presidential campaigns, according to
movement leaders and academic authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's occasional references to his own conversion
experience and to his admiration for Jesus Christ, some religious
leaders question his level of commitment to their causes. For
instance, Bush favors a constitutional amendment to ban abortion
but supports exceptions in the case of rape, incest and danger to
the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's comments, which were incited by Robertson's
campaigning against him in South Carolina and Michigan, may at
least temporarily unify the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the short run it could be counterproductive and
mobilize the faithful to rally against McCain as much as rally for
Bush,'' said Charles Reagan Wilson, the director of the Center for
the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi and
the author of a book on religion in the South.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Green, a professor at the University of Akron who
studies religion and politics, speculated that McCain's attacks
might even prolong the life of Robertson's Christian Coalition.
``They really thrive on adversity,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Monday, delivered in Robertson's home town of
Virginia Beach, Va., McCain strove to draw distinctions between
Robertson and Falwell on one hand and other evangelical leaders who
he said were ``changing America for the better.'' By contrast, he
said that Robertson and Falwell ``have turned good causes into
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   But that nuance seems to have been lost on many Christian
conservatives. While many do not agree with either the political
views or tactics embraced by Robertson and Falwell, they often
admire their record in winning converts to Christ. And already
sensitive to what they see as a media caricature of them as
zealots, they clearly view McCain's attack on Robertson and Falwell
as a broad assault on all evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rather liked McCain for a while,'' said Marion J. Fisher, a
70-year-old retired secretary who was interviewed during the
Wednesday night fellowship at Southside Baptist Church in Lakeland,
Fla. ``But lately, talk about hate-mongering. I mean, the religious
right, quote unquote, gets a lot of flak about promoting hate. To
me, that's what he's doing now, throwing mud and bad-mouthing
people who have faith and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most grating to many Christian conservatives is their
feeling that McCain pandered to their detractors by playing on the
stereotype that they are a homogeneous collection of intolerant
extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff plays well with people whose conception of a
fundamentalist Christian is that they're not smart enough to be
enlightened,'' said Ron L. Plemmons, the 37-year-old pastor at
Southside Baptist Church in Lakeland. ``What bothers me about it is
that you paint with such a broad stroke of the brush. And what's
amazing to me is that Ronald Reagan was elected to two terms by
embracing the pro-life, pro-conservative religious movement. And
here's someone, John McCain, who claims to be a Reagan Republican
yet tries to run against the very same people.''

SAUL STEINBERG: A MODEL FOR TODAY'S INTERNET BARONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hot stocks traded for hundreds of times their earnings, if they
had any. Companies with concepts that caught the eye of eager
investors could acquire companies many times their size. Public
enthusiasm for stocks was higher than at any time since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   The late 1960s, memorably termed the Go-Go Years by the great
financial writer John Brooks, are largely forgotten now. They
shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   No man better exemplified that era than Saul P. Steinberg. He
was the survivor, a man wise enough in his youth to come up with a
concept that would captivate investors and then to realize that the
riches bestowed upon him would be ephemeral if he did not use his
ridiculously overvalued stock to buy something that had real value.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, now just 60 years old, announced this week that he
was stepping down as chief executive of Reliance Group Holdings,
the insurance company that he took over in 1968, although he is
staying on as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   His departure is not exactly being mourned, for Reliance is in
dreadful shape, with its stock trading as if its remaining
insurance operations were worth less than nothing. He did far
better for himself, taking generous salaries and bonuses, than he
did for Reliance's public shareholders. He was much better at
identifying values than he was at running companies.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not for what he did lately that Steinberg will be best
remembered. It was in 1961, at the tender age of 22, that he
pioneered the computer leasing business. IBM, which made the
computers, was not interested in offering long-term leases, and
Steinberg saw a niche. Whether or not that business would be
profitable in the long run depended on how well old computers would
hold their value, but with the right accounting assumptions his
company, named Leasco, could and did show instant profits. It went
public in 1965 and the stock zoomed. Three years later, that hot
stock enabled Leasco to take over Reliance, a dull but prosperous
insurance company that was nearly 10 times its size.
</P>
<P>
   Leasco, it turned out, was not worth anything close to what Wall
Street thought it was. But Reliance was a real asset, and Steinberg
had an operation that would keep him in business even when that era
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end of the Go-Go Years may, in fact, be
dated to Steinberg's disastrous 1969 attempt to have Leasco take
over Chemical Bank of New York, then the sixth-largest bank in the
United States. Suddenly Leasco's inflated stock came under attack,
and Steinberg had to withdraw his offer as Leasco's share price
withered. ``I always knew there was an Establishment,'' he said
later. ``I just used to think I was part of it.'' Within a few
years the country was in recession, the stock market had collapsed,
and the public had lost interest in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Steinberg tried more raids, but the really big
targets, like Disney before Michael Eisner turned it around, eluded
him. He took his empire private in 1982, when stock prices were
very low, and then sold stock in Reliance to the public in 1986,
when the bull was roaring.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy for a company with a sizzling stock to go against
the Wall Street grain and use those shares to buy an unloved
company. Some America Online owners are outraged that its Internet
operations will be diluted by boring assets, and AOL is down 24
percent since it agreed to buy Time Warner. But the people running
many a hot Internet company now would do well to ponder Saul
Steinberg's staying power, and to follow his example.

EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK POSTPONES INTEREST RATE RISE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Despite worries about inflation and the
euro's slump to a record low this week, the European Central Bank
decided Thursday not to raise interest rates, while warning that it
would probably do so soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks are increasing,'' said Wim Duisenberg, the president
of the central bank, after a meeting here of the board of
governors. ``There can be no doubt in anybody's mind about the
direction of monetary policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg acknowledged that he was concerned about the euro,
the single currency adopted a year ago by 11 European countries.
Though conceived in part as a rival to the U.S. dollar, the value
of the euro has tumbled from $1.18 at its debut to 96.63 cents
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the euro dropped to nearly 94 cents before recovering
a bit amid speculation _ apparently wrong _ that the central bank
had intervened on its behalf.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders insist that they have no intention of propping
up the euro through direct intervention, and Duisenberg explicitly
denied that the central bank had moved into currency markets on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the persistent decline of the new currency has been
disheartening, and Duisenberg said he was troubled by it on two
counts.
</P>
<P>
   The first concern, he said, is that the currency weakness will
generate inflationary pressures by increasing the prices of
imported goods. A second concern, he continued, is about ``possible
psychological effects'' on the credibility of the currency itself.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the decline against the dollar, most
economists agree, is that the U.S. economy is growing so much
faster than that of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised U.S.
interest rates more rapidly in recent months than the European
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg is now caught at one of the trickiest junctures he
has faced since the introduction of the euro on Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The anemic growth in Europe's biggest economies has finally
improved, and conditions are among the best they have been in
years. At the same time, however, inflationary pressures are
clearly building. Across the 11 euro nations, consumer prices
climbed at an annual rate of 2 percent in January. That is right at
the limit of what the European Central Bank considers acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are climbing considerably faster than that in Europe's
smaller but faster growing countries. Inflation is running at 4.4
percent a year in Ireland, while in Spain the rate is 2.9 percent.
Italy, one of Europe's biggest yet weakest economies, has a rate of
about 2.2 percent. Much of that reflects the surge in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank has come under increasing criticism
for sending mixed signals about its priorities. Until recently,
many economists were convinced that it would raise interest rates
Thursday in another pre-emptive strike against rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that expectation came from hawkish statements in the
most recent monthly bulletin of the central bank. In a newspaper
interview published Monday, the bank's vice president, Christian
Noyer, cautioned that people were reading too much into its
bulletin and hinted that the bank was not yet ready to become more
tightfisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they are aiming at a broad consensus of all the
members of the governing board,'' said Elga Bartsch, an economist
with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14 months since it assumed control of monetary policy for
the euro countries, the European Central Bank has struggled to
maintain its credibility in global markets even as it has watched
the euro decline steadily the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   Initially determined to run a hard-nosed policy aimed at
preventing inflation above all else, it was forced to open its
spigots last year, when European growth stalled as a result of
financial crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Last November it swung back to a hard-line stance, raising
interest rates by half a percentage point, to 3 percent. In
January, it followed up with a second increase, to 3.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That still leaves baseline interest rates in Europe well below
those in the United States, though its inflation rate is slightly
lower as well.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, all signs point to a strong rebound in European
growth. Germany, Europe's biggest economy but also its most
sluggish, is growing at an annual rate of more than 2.5 percent _ a
big improvement from 1999, when it grew a total of 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the euro zone as a whole, economists predict that growth
will average about 3 percent in 2000, and perhaps slightly more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic conditions and perspectives in the euro area appear
to be better at present than at any time in the past decade,''
Duisenberg said Thursday, a signal that he is not worried that a
tougher monetary policy will put Europe back into a tailspin.

<P>
   Rex Golding, a partner at Softbank Technology Ventures, has made
a lot more money than he had ever expected. But even among the
circle he associates with, things are getting a little out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 6-year-old is starting to say things like, `Their house is
bigger,''' Golding said, recalling a recent drive through his
neighborhood in Menlo Park, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley.
``She knows the different cars. It is troubling to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kiernan, a senior executive at Goldman Sachs Group,
attended an Ivy League party last fall where one recent graduate
boasted he would own a fleet of personal airplanes by age 30. ```I
don't just want wealth,''' Kiernan said the young man told him.
```I want plane wealth.'''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping up with the Joneses used to mean buying a vacation home,
a BMW perhaps, first-class airplane tickets. But your own fleet of
planes? These days, though, even the superrich are finding that the
rules of the game are being rewritten with each stock market move.
In a world of instant windfalls where companies go public without
ever earning a profit, a 10-figure fortune buys more freedom than
nine, an eight-figure sum buys more than seven. So much so that at
least two distinct classes among the rich have emerged _ the haves
and the have s'mores.
</P>
<P>
   Even the newest of nouveau riche _ those who made their millions
a decade ago in the Wall Street gold rush _ feel out of sorts with
the fresh-faced generation filling its coffers today. That angst
pervades almost every conversation about their generally younger,
often richer peers from the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Nelson Peltz who, in his heyday, was a confidant of
Michael R. Milken, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond
maven. Peltz made much of his wealth investing in troubled
companies in the 1980s. No pauper, he caused a stir when he bought
the singer Mariah Carey's $20 million estate in Westchester County,
N.Y., and he has appeared on the Forbes list of richest executives
for almost a decade, with a net worth estimated at $890 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like old money these days,'' Peltz complained one
afternoon at his office on Park Avenue in Manhattan. ``You see
these young guys worth $3 billion to $4 billion, and you think to
yourself, `What have I done wrong?' I feel like the guy who has to
say to his kids, `Go back to work because we can't make ends meet
anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   He is joking _ at least a little. But an even bigger contrast
between then and now is that people like Peltz were vilified a
decade ago for flaunting their wealth in what was often called the
Greed Decade. Not so today. The rich now, an overwhelming number of
whom have profited from the technology boom, seem to be lauded as
new-economy celebrities and have yet to experience the backlash of
a disapproving public. While some fear that is bound to happen, for
now at least the benefits to the economy from new technology is
helping to insulate the dot-com wunderkinds from attack.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even this era's more restrained haves, it seems, have lost
perspective in this time of fast, abundant riches. Consider Dave
Welsh. As senior director for corporate development at Portal
Software in Cupertino, Calif., he said, he has a stock option
package worth tens of millions of dollars. But that is small change
compared with the options given to John Little, Portal's chief
executive and founder, who is now worth more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have John's money,'' Welsh said, almost apologizing.
``I'm normal.''
</P>
<P>
   True, being worth millions does not count for as much these
days. Even the billionaires' club is getting a little crowded.
Forbes magazine, in its annual effort to name the richest 400
Americans, counted 267 last year with a net worth of more than $1
billion, compared with just 13 in 1982. But it is not just the
growing number that is causing the stir, but more importantly the
very visible way in which those riches, mainly derived from stock
ownership in newly public companies, can be monitored almost hourly
by market watchers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has created this mania to be rich,'' said Edward Wolff, a
professor of economics at New York University. ``The focus on other
people's money has created a materialistic and self-serving
milieu.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone would know, Wolff would. For several years, he has
been studying wealth and its impact on American society. The number
of households with a net worth of more than $10 million, according
to his research, has grown fourfold the last decade from about
67,700, to almost 350,000. Corporate executives are pocketing a lot
of that money. In 1988, for instance, the average chief executive's
salary was 40 times that of the average employee. A decade later,
Wolff said, a chief executive made 400 times what the average
employee did.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy are hitting the jackpot at younger ages, too. Today,
five of every 100 people in the top 1 percent of the wealthiest
Americans are 35 years or younger, compared with a fraction of a
percent just 17 years ago. ``Wealth today is more of a result of
entrepreneurial activity than inheritance,'' he said. ``It's not
just the coupon clippers anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If any executive has fast become the model of the new monied
class it is Meg Whitman, chief executive of eBay, the online
auction site. Two years ago, Whitman was a little-known marketer
selling Teletubbies at the toymaker Hasbro. But today she is seen
almost as frequently as that other most-talked-about female
billionaire, Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Whitman has been on the cover of five
magazines (she was anointed one of the most powerful women
executives by Fortune); appeared almost 20 times on CNN and CNBC;
sat through 15 photo shoots, including sessions for Vanity Fair and
Glamour; and been mentioned hundreds of times in major newspapers
and magazines. Her net worth (she had stock options worth close to
$1 billion, according to recent government filings) is fodder for
online chatter.
</P>
<P>
   But that intrusion into her personal life is wearing a little
thin. One evening, Whitman and her family were trapped at an ice
cream shop in Palo Alto, Calif., delayed after several strangers
grabbed her to chat. At restaurants, diners whisper and point when
she walks in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how you watch movies and you follow a star's
career?'' she recently mused. ``You feel like you know them. But
when you meet them, you have to hold yourself back. I think that is
a little bit of what is going on now.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the focus of where wealth is generated most quickly has
shifted from Wall Street and Hollywood to Silicon Valley, the scale
has escalated as well. Remember when Milken was chided for making
$550 million in salary and bonuses in 1987? Pierre Omidyar, who
founded eBay so that his wife would have a place to trade Pez
dispensers and is now worth billions, owned stock options worth
$661 million the day eBay went public in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At Harry Winston, the high-end jewelers at Fifth Avenue and 56th
Street in Manhattan, a growing army of Internet millionaires barely
out of college are splurging on diamond engagement rings at
$125,000 to $1 million each.
</P>
<P>
   One young entrepreneur who could not be with his friends on New
Year's Eve had his own event last fall _ a black-tie dinner at
Windows on the World at the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan,
where 200 people danced until a wall-size clock brought in for the
evening struck midnight. The cost? About $120,000, or $30,000 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many on Wall Street have been the beneficiaries of
selling shares in Internet companies like eBay to an eager public.
But some cannot help missing the spotlight they once enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these cyberbillionaires, in a perverse way, have put Wall
Street in its place,'' said Michael Biondi, chief executive of
Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co., the investment advisory boutique that
helped mastermind many of the corporate takeovers of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Dinesh D'Souza, a research scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute and author of a forthcoming book, ``The Moral Conundrum
of Success,'' said that among the monied class, wealth is less
about a dollar figure than how secure a person feels about it. Much
of the wealth created these days is tied up in stock option
packages that are subject to the vagaries of a volatile stock
market. So while a billionaire is assured the same grand life even
if his stock price drops in half, someone who is worth, say, $50
million, may not feel so comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   George Bell, chief executive of the Internet portal
Excite(at)Home, acknowledges that he used to track his stock
options several times a day after each market tick. But that
exhilaration wore off as soon as his wealth became the talk of the
party circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things people ask is: `How much are you
worth?''' he said. ``You kind of laugh at first. But now it has
gone out of my psyche. You've got to get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not so easy to do. Unlike earlier generations, many of
the new rich were raised in middle-class homes and seem awestruck
by their good fortune. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, for
instance, likens his success to winning the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a practical side to such humility, too. ``The new
money doesn't want to separate itself from the population at
large,'' D'Souza said. ``They are not sure they can defend their
extravagances.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Souza said the most affluent Americans have an income of at
least $10 million a year and assets of $100 million or more. The
merely rich earn $1 million to $10 million a year, with assets of
$10 million to $100 million. The difference between the two is
scale. The rich own two homes, he said, while the superrich own
homes around the world. Besides, the superrich get something the
merely rich do not. ``Great wealth, even if it is paper wealth,''
he said, ``propels people into celebrity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On a Sunday afternoon last December, a crush of cars filled the
parking lot in front of Buck's restaurant in Woodside, Silicon
Valley's equivalent of Morton's in West Hollywood. For years,
entrepreneurs and wealthy venture capitalists gathered weekdays to
discuss ideas over coffee and toast. But Saturdays and Sundays have
lately been given over to camera-carrying tourists and television
news crews eager to catch a glimpse of a Silicon Valley
billionaire, who is now more likely to be holed up in his home
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Such notoriety is producing some fear among many in the
entrepreneurial class who are beginning to sense a rising tide of
resentment toward those who became too rich, too fast. Most hope
they will not be remembered as many of their predecessors of the
1980s were.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 20 years if all these people go out and make a difference,
there will be no backlash,'' Little, the chief executive of Portal
Software, said. ``But if all they end up with is 14 cars, 3 houses,
and the jet _ the symbols of wretched excess _ there will be.''

BRADLEY SUPPORTERS SEEM RESIGNED TO POSSIBLE END OF CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patricia Simpson was waiting for Bill Bradley inside
the Gray's Papaya hot dog joint in Greenwich Village on Thursday
afternoon, hoping for a word with the candidate and a chance to
show off her ``Bill Bradley for President'' sticker. But she would
also have been content, frankly, if the sticker had read ``Bill
Bradley for Vice President'' or ``Bill Bradley for U.N.
Ambassador.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, she said that while she liked Bradley's liberal
positions, particularly on abortion, she also said that she had
nothing against Vice President Al Gore. In fact, she said she would
probably vote for Gore in Tuesday's crucial Democratic primary in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Bradley, and I think he's a very fine man,'' said
Simpson, 66, a retired speech pathologist. ``I just feel badly for
him because the spotlight has been on McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   With five days to go before the do-or-die Super Tuesday
primaries, Bradley's campaign has, for some supporters, taken on
the aura of a noble but silver-medal effort, as his poll numbers
have collapsed and his campaign continues to be overshadowed by the
more dramatic Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley remained upbeat on Thursday, from the event at Gray's
Papaya to later events in Connecticut, but many supporters seemed
almost philosophical and wistful about what they said was a race
that appeared to be over, barring a miracle. So they populated
their thoughts with sentiments ranging from encouragement to
gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I really don't see him winning, I want to thank
him because, if anything, he's pushed Al Gore to address issues he
wouldn't have addressed,'' said Jason Greenfield, 20, a student at
New York University majoring in political science. ``I think he
would be a great V.P.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, though, continued to talk the good fight. Looking
somewhat fatigued after his debate in Los Angeles on Wednesday
night with Gore, Bradley donned the strawberry-colored uniform of
Gray's Papaya, wolfed down part of a hot dog _ with sauerkraut _
and worked the modest crowd with smiles and handshakes. It all took
15 minutes, tops.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp is eager to appear sensitive to Bradley's
situation and wants to avoid alienating him and his supporters at
this delicate stage, Gore aides said. So when Gore visited P.S. 163
on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on Thursday, he seemed content
to read ``A Friend for Little Bear'' to children. Later, he read
``Green Eggs and Ham'' to children at the Francis Scott Key school
in District Heights, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Connecticut, Bradley reacted strongly to a decision by
the South Carolina Legislature on Thursday to reject recognition of
Martin Luther King's Birthday and to keep the Confederate battle
flag flying over the state Capitol. ``Yet again, South Carolina
sticks the finger in the eye of a country that recognizes that
diversity is a strength, not a weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   And he tried to sound positive in a five-minute television
advertisement that was broadcast nationally on Thursday night,
offering not an attack on Gore _ as he has done in previous weeks _
but a variation of his stump speech. But he did acknowledge that
his task was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I got into this race that it wouldn't be easy,''
he said. ``Anything worth fighting for in life rarely is. But my
convictions of where we are as a country and where we can go are so
deep that I made the decision to take on the establishment and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in Connecticut late on Thursday, he offered an underdog
pitch that he is expected to repeat throughout the Northeast the
next few days. In an interview with an NBC affiliate in Hartford,
he said: ``Don't listen to the pollsters and the pundits. Vote your
heart. Vote your conscience. Vote for a new politics.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, though, whether Bradley has enough time
to climb back into the race. On Thursday, in Greenwich Village,
even his most ardent supporters admitted that the odds did not look
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for him because I don't think he'll get elected,''
said Matt Rosenberg, a retired teacher. ``He's a real decent human
being.''

 &HT;    Bobby Labonte finds success, teamwork
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte learned the benefits of a two-car team last
season. He also learned some of the risks, such as protecting the
ego and sharing the spotlight in the same garage.
</P>
<P>
   Now Labonte is taking lessons learned in the 1999 season and is
using them to his advantage in 2000. The driver of the No. 18
Pontiac is off to a good start, winning Sunday's Dura Lube/Kmart
400 at North Carolina Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Labonte moved to second in the points
standings, which is where he finished last season.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between Labonte and the Winston Cup championship last
year was 201 points. In an otherwise splendid year _ five
victories, five poles _ Labonte looks back and sees opportunities
missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that comes to my mind is Sears Point, trying to
go for fourth place. Maybe I should have stuck with fifth instead
of wrecking,'' Labonte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a major screwup. I lost a lot of momentum that
day, points-wise, because we were ahead of Dale Jarrett and never
could gain it back. You wish you could have five mistakes
throughout the year and survive. That was one mistake I really
couldn't overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte had to deal with a number of freaky things last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can start off at Daytona,'' Labonte recalls. ``We had a
piece that fell out of the manifold. Freak deal. We've got to
address that problem. At Bristol, when you're running third or
fourth and somebody spins out in front of you, sometimes you can't
avoid that. When a piece of metal comes off the race track and
knocks the rear-end belt off and catches on fire, there's not a
whole lot I could've done about that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrecking at Sears Point and Watkins Glen, yeah, I could have
done something big about that. In a nutshell, we've got to fix
those little things, and I've got to make sure I don't do the wrong
thing. Just try to be better everywhere. We ran good when we didn't
have a problem _ we were up front. But Dale Jarrett just had less
problems than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief Jimmy Makar said he thinks this is the year Labonte
can make the move to the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did we finish second instead of first? Basically, it
boiled down to 10 races that we had problems in,'' Makar said.
``Twice we had debris knock belts off the car. We had a few motor
problems. Bobby had some mistakes on the race track and we were in
the wrong place at the wrong time on the race track. Those are the
areas that we have to try to work on to make the jump from second
to first.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte emerged as a championship contender last year at the
same time that teammate Tony Stewart rewrote the standards for a
Winston Cup rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Tony,'' Labonte said, ``the hardest thing probably was
knowing where the race tracks were, not what to do inside the
tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   But at times, Labonte had to wonder whose side Stewart was on.
In the next-to-last race of the season, the teammates were in a
side-by-side battle for the lead at Homestead, Fla., with laps
running out.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart tapped his No. 20 Pontiac into the side of Labonte's No.
18 Pontiac, took the lead away and went on to win his third race of
the season. Labonte fought to keep from sliding into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Stewart apologized to his boss and his teammate. He
said his car got loose on the apron where Labonte had pushed it
going into turn 3. ``I would never take Bobby Labonte out,''
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   The two seem to define the meaning of two teammates pushing each
other. Labonte believes it can only help the Joe Gibbs entries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one's off one day, we try to help out,'' Labonte said.
``We're two different drivers with two different styles. We've got
to make sure we don't try to talk one of us into something that
really isn't good for him. We've got to drive our own race, but yet
we can still communicate about what the track's doing, what the
tire's doing, what the car is doing, about other people or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's easy disposition is also helping make the Gibbs team
the most potent in Winston Cup racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony's an excellent driver,'' Labonte said. ``He came on board
and helped the program. We helped his program. The team that Jimmy
Makar has put together for the 18 car, and the 20 car, Greg
Zipadelli and all those guys, the communication's there. We're just
making a lot better decisions.''

 &HT;    NASCAR NOTES
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Power Index
</P>
<P>
   A look at some of the hottest NASCAR teams
</P>
<P>
   1.Robert Yates Racing: What is the highest honor for a driver
after the season's first two races? To have his 2000 Taurus
confiscated by NASCAR. That's what has happened with the
highest-finishing cars of each manufacturer after races at Daytona
and Rockingham. The cars were taken for a wind-tunnel examination
at Lockheed in Atlanta. Dale Jarrett has had the No. 88 Ford
confiscated two weeks in a row.
</P>
<P>
   2.Joe Gibbs Racing: This team might overtake the No. 1 ranking
from Yates after the next two events. Bobby Labonte miraculously
finished sixth at Daytona, despite a 15-second penalty in the pits.
He was the dominant driver at Rockingham. Teammate Tony Stewart,
who had a miserable experience at Daytona, returned to his rookie
form with a fourth-place finish Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   3. Richard Childress Racing: With 10 or 15 extra laps, Sunday's
Dura-Lube/Kmart 400 might have had a different winner.
</P>
<P>
   Many people thought that Dale Earnhardt, who finished second,
had the best car at the end of the race. Earnhardt has looked
superb in both races of the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   4.Penske Racing: Very quietly, the team of Rusty Wallace and
Jeremy Mayfield is starting to cause concerns in the garage area.
Wallace won the pole at Rockingham and was a force during the early
part of the race. Mayfield, after a disappointing sophomore season,
has shown signs of life. Mayfield, who finished seventh at
Rockingham, might soon reclaim his reputation as one of the
circuit's up-and-comers.
</P>
<P>
   5.Bill Davis Racing: After the first two races, Ward Burton has
surpassed the team's expectations and claimed the third spot in the
Winston Cup point standings behind Dale Jarrett and Bobby Labonte.
Only Labonte was stronger at Rockingham; Burton led four times for
100 laps. The only disappointment for the multi-car team was the
failure of Dave Blaney to qualify for the event. Blaney is a
Winston Cup rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   Some strong performances by drivers who appear to be on the fast
track from the back of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dale Jarrett, No. 88 Ford: Mr. Consistency is up to his old
tricks again this year. He placed first at Daytona and fifth at
Rockingham. It's the same formula that the team used last year to
capture the Winston Cup title. Jarrett has been atop the Winston
Cup standings for 26 races in a row.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Johnny Benson, No. 10 Pontiac: Benson has been on the rampage
ever since he bought out his contract with Roush Racing for a
six-figure amount last year. Benson nearly came away with a miracle
victory in the Daytona 500 before being ganged up on by the Ford
fleet. He turned in a top-15 performance at Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-FALLIN'
</P>
<P>
   Some weak performances from drivers who appear to be on the fast
track to the back of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Darrell Waltrip, No. 66 Ford: Waltrip had the racing community
excited after posting the 10th-fastest qualifying time at
Rockingham. He then reverted to form and dropped to last place nine
laps into the race. Can Waltrip win in his final year, the
``Victory Tour 2000''?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Rookies: The heralded eight-man rookie class won rave
reviews at Daytona but earned a thumbs down at Rockingham. Three
rookies, including Scott Pruett, failed to qualify. Dale Earnhardt
Jr. and Matt Kenseth started in the top 10 but were nowhere in
sight at the end.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   MAKING HEADLINES
</P>
<P>
   Our take on the sport's top stories.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING BACK
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pit-crew members in danger zone: The track seems like a
children's playground compared with pit row. Several pit-crew
members from different teams have been seriously injured since the
season began. Mark Martin accidentally struck one of his crew
members in the Bud Shootout and quit the race immediately. Tony
Stewart accidentally hit a No. 20 crew member after he was trying
to grab a stray tire from another team. A member of Wally
Dallenback's crew suffered burns on his face at North Carolina
Speedway. NASCAR should take steps to improve safety in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rockingham sees rocky future with spring race: At least 10,000
people were no-shows for Sunday's race at ``The Rock,'' which does
not bode well for the track's chances of maintaining two races per
season in future years. The weather forecast was sketchy, but a
better turnout was expected with big names such as Dale Earnhardt,
Bill Elliott and Darrell Waltrip starting in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  NASCAR hopes for more exciting racing: When will the boredom
end? Fans loudly complained about the boredom at the Daytona 500,
which is supposed to be the biggest race of the season. Rockingham
was much more exciting until the yawns began appearing with 40 laps
remaining. Can Las Vegas bring back the excitement? NASCAR needs
more thrilling finishes such as last year's Goody's 500 at Bristol,
Tenn., in which Dale Earnhardt bumped Terry Labonte to win the
race.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Eyes on the skies: After a week of sunny skies and
temperatures in the lower 70s, Atlanta Motor Speedway officials are
holding their breath that good weather can last for another week.
The spring race at Atlanta has a history of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   BROTHERLY LOVE?
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Las Vegas 400, Jeff Burton, driving No. 99 Exide
Batteries Ford, outraced brother Ward to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first 1-2 finish by brothers since Terry Labonte beat
Bobby in 1997 in Talladega, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Q&AMP;A
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Matt Kenseth, driver of the No. 17 Ford, has a top 10 in
a race and a top 10 in qualifying after two events. Here he talks
with Cox News Service reporter Rick Minter about his first few
weeks in Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you define a successful rookie season?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's hard to say what I'll feel good about after the season
ends. We want to improve from race to race _ make better pit stops,
qualify better and run better. Obviously, I'd like to win rookie of
the year. Winning a race, I don't really think about that. It's
pretty far-fetched at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much help have you gotten from your teammates at Roush
Racing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mark Martin and Jeff Burton have been especially helpful to
me, giving me hints here and there. Their crew chiefs are giving us
a baseline chassis set-up so we'll have something to work with each
week. It's an advantage to be with guys with that much experience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you taking a conservative approach with your set-up and
with your driving until you learn the cars and the tracks?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I'm running as hard as I can run. That's my style. I've
never been smart enough to figure out how to lay back and still be
up front at the end of the race. If the opportunity is there to win
a race, we'll run as hard as we can. But it would be boastful to
say we can win a race. You can't go from running in the top-10 a
couple of times to all of the sudden winning a race.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What differences have you found between running the Winston
Cup and Grand National divisions?
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't seem that much different. The cars drive a little
different, and it's different getting in and out of the pits, but
on the track, passing cars and getting passed is about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is your relationship with Dale Earnhardt Jr., whom you
battled for the Grand National championship for the past two
seasons?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right now we are getting along better than ever. We spent a
lot of time together at Daytona hanging out, talking about
different things and watching TV in the motorhome at night. We talk
about other things besides racing more than ever now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the demands on your time from sponsors, fans and the
media becoming a burden?
</P>
<P>
   A: It gets a little busier as we go along, but I'm young,
enthusiastic and fired up about doing this, so whatever else I have
to do, I don't complain about it. That's part of the job, and I
want to meet as many fans as I can and try to build a fan base.

PHILIP MORRIS OFFICIAL SAYS IT COULD ACCEPT SOME TOBACCO
REGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a striking admission, a top executive of Philip Morris Cos.,
the nation's largest cigarette maker, referred to nicotine as a
``drug'' on Thursday and said the company could accept some
regulation of tobacco by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   That executive, Steven Parrish, a senior vice president of
Philip Morris, also said the company was prepared to see cigarette
sales drop and invest assets now spent on tobacco n other
businesses. Additionally, he left the door open to discussing with
lawmakers whether the legal age for buying cigarettes should be
raised to 21 from 18.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish's comments are the latest he has made during a watershed
week for the giant cigarette maker. On Monday, he said that the
company was no longer opposed to some regulation by the federal
government. As expected, he expanded on those comments on Thursday
at a meeting of smoking and health experts held at the Ronald
Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether nicotine should be classified as a drug is
at the center of federal efforts to exert some regulatory control
over tobacco companies. If nicotine is officially considered a
drug, the sale of tobacco products which contain it might be
regulated by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's meeting, Parrish reiterated that Philip Morris
opposed having the FDA regulate nicotine as a drug or a cigarette
as a drug-delivery device. He said that nicotine was an addictive
drug but added that Philip Morris believed it did not fall under
the definition of that term by the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it is a drug as that is defined by the act
but I do think that nicotine is a drug,'' said Parrish, according
to a transcript of his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from that, he said that Philip Morris could accept broad
regulation by the FDA in a number of areas. He said the company
wanted to develop a ``sensible, comprehensive regulatory approach
for this product that will keep it out of the hands of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the company wanted the industry and government to
work together to reduce the ``demand'' for cigarettes and to help
develop potentially less hazardous products.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said Philip Morris, whose other divisions include Miller
Brewing and Kraft Foods, knew that efforts to deter youth smoking,
if successful, would lead to an erosion of cigarette sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``If no adults smoke as a result of cracking down on youth
smoking, we are prepared to invest our assets elsewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, Parrish said that the company believed
there would always be adults who choose to smoke. He also said that
raising the legal age for cigarette sales in the immediate future
would prove difficult because significant numbers of people between
18 to 21 were already smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Kessler, the former head of the FDA, appeared Thursday
on the same panel as Parrish and said that he applauded his
commitment to change.
</P>
<P>
   The new stance by Philip Morris come as a number of currents
swirl around the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami jury is about to render a verdict in a case that could
financially devastate some cigarette producers. The Supreme Court
is set to decide this spring whether the FDA has regulatory
authority over tobacco. And a scientific panel is reviewing whether
it is possible to produce a less hazardous cigarette, a decision
critical to the industry's future marketing plans.

 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service is on a collision course with an
Indianapolis church, one of a small but growing number of New
Testament churches that say they are not subject to federal tax
laws requiring employers to withhold income, Social Security and
Medicare taxes from workers.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation comes at a time when the IRS has been so
reluctant to seize property to collect back taxes that some
accountants and lawyers have complained about the agency's failure
to act against their clients. The church, however, is eager to
establish what it believes are its rights by forcing the IRS to
act.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the IRS must foreclose on the Indianapolis Baptist
Temple or find a way to avoid enforcing a federal judge's ruling
last July that the church owes $5.9 million in taxes, penalties and
interest for 1988 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the church plans a demonstration in downtown
Indianapolis to protest the ruling, and says it expects as many as
2,000 members and supporters to march between two federal
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Gregory J. Dixon said the 1,000 members would be
peaceful, and Sgt. Paul Ciesielski, spokesman for the police, said
he does not expect any difficulty with church members.
</P>
<P>
   But the case has caught the attention of conservative radio talk
shows and of right wing paramilitary organizations, including the
Michigan Militia, whose commander, Norman E. Olson, has pledged to
help the church resist foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, 67, said the people who work at the church are not
employees and called the money they receive ``love gifts'' on which
the church cannot withhold taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the workers, about 60 people, or their spouses had their
tax returns audited, Dixon said, and none had a significant
adjustment made to their tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   He said they had paid the taxes on their own, but the IRS
refunded the half of their Social Security and Medicare taxes
normally paid by an employer, telling them that it should have been
paid by the church. Dixon accused the IRS of fabricating an issue
by returning the payroll taxes and then taking the church to court
to collect them and said the agency was interfering with the
church's First Amendment Rights.
</P>
<P>
   But in her ruling last July, U.S. District Judge Sarah Evans
Barker said requiring a church to withhold taxes on money paid to
its pastor, teachers, secretaries, janitors and others does not
interfere with the right to free exercise of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the church, Barker wrote, ``the Supreme Court
does not share its creative interpretations of the First Amendment,
making resolution of this issue straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, in its newsletter The Trumpet, said Barker ``has
literally declared war on Christ and His church.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS would not comment beyond stating that federal law
requires all employers to withhold taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Barker had stayed foreclosure on the church's chapel, school and
parsonage, which are appraised at $8 million, so the church could
take its case to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, at the request of the Justice Department, she
modified her order, requiring the church to withhold taxes and turn
them over to the court, to be held in escrow, if it wanted to stay
foreclosure while it appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not comply,'' Dixon said in an interview. ``We cannot
because we are subject only to the authority of our Lord Jesus
Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Refusal to put the money in escrow is likely to speed the
foreclosure process, which otherwise could drag on for months or
years in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon described churches that issue receipts for gifts and
withhold taxes from workers as ``state-licensed churches'' and said
that ``the IRS has declared that the only legal religion in America
is IRS-approved religion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that requiring the collection of taxes ``violates our
religious liberty and what this means is the end of religious
freedom in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's lawyer, Albert R. Cunningham, who is also a pastor
in Redding, Calif., said he represents about 200 New Testament
congregations, which believe the separation of church and state is
absolute. They do not register as non-profits and discourage
members from claiming a charitable deduction on their tax returns
for contributions to the church. None of the churches withhold
taxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis Baptist Temple is the only church facing
foreclosure for its actions.
</P>
<P>
   It complied with federal tax laws from its founding in 1950
until 1983, said Dixon. But then he became convinced that the
church had sinned. The church corporation name was changed to ``Not
A Church, Inc.,'' and then dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership of church real estate was transferred to Dixon as a
trustee. Dixon said the property belongs to God.
</P>
<P>
   Barker took note of these and other arguments, writing that the
church ``apparently believes it can evade federal tax law by
metamorphosing into various different forms of entity. On this, it
is sadly mistaken. Although defendant's tactics may have resulted
in enough confusion to cause the IRS to use an incorrect employee
identification number in assessing its tax liabilities, such
tactics do not save defendant from the harsh ramifications it now
faces as a result of years of tax evasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, who at one time was national secretary of the Moral
Majority but said he has since parted from the organization's
founder, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, said that he has not filed a
personal tax return since 1983 because he believes he is not
required to do so.

BOUT PUTS UNDEFEATED RECORDS ON THE LINE

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ One thing is sure about Friday night's World Boxing
Association junior middleweight title fight between Felix Trinidad
and David Reid. Somebody's 0 has got to go.
</P>
<P>
   Reid is the undefeated former Olympic gold medalist who won the
WBA title in only his 12th professional fight and has since
defended it twice. Seldom does a fighter become a world champion
after 12 fights, and even less often does he put it all on the line
in his 15th one, against a longtime champion in his prime like the
undefeated Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   At 36-0, Trinidad is the only man to defeat Oscar De La Hoya,
and he holds both the International Boxing Federation and World
Boxing Council welterweight titles. Friday night he is putting
neither at risk, but if he wins he must decide what titles he wants
to hold. If he does not conquer the calmly confident Reid, it is a
moot point, and he returns to a world of 147-pounders in which
pursuit of De La Hoya will again become his goal.
</P>
<P>
   In Reid's opinion, Trinidad will have only that option by late
Friday night. Supremely confident without being cocky, the kid from
the streets of Philadelphia who stunned the world when he won a
gold medal with a last-second knockout of a heavily favored Cuban
(Alfredo Duvergel) in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta believes this is
his moment, not Trinidad's, just as that moment in 1996 was his and
not the Cuban's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest fight of my career,'' said Reid (14-0, 7
KOs). ``All the marbles are in the basket. It's a winnable fight.
It's a fight I have to win to go on to bigger and better things.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning I have to make him respect my power. I have
to make him back up. That's the question. We both come forward.
Who's going to back up first?''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad has confidently predicted a knockout and his father and
trainer, Felix Sr., has gone so far as to call the fourth round as
their moment. Reid didn't disagree with that timing, just who was
going down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it to end in four, too,'' Reid said. ``Who is going to
get hit on the chin first? I know it's not going to be me. I'm
going to start off fast. Trinidad is going to have to catch up to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Trinidad's father concedes Reid is the faster fighter, both
in terms of foot speed and hand speed. He concedes, too, that while
Reid has only 15 fights, he is an Olympic gold medalist, the third
straight his son is facing. To the Trinidads, an Olympic gold medal
counts for much more than a lengthy string of professional
victories over nonentities, and so they view young Reid with
perhaps more respect than the bookmakers, who have made him an 8-5
underdog.
</P>
<P>
   They do not argue Reid's advantages, they concede them. Then
they simply contend that, in the end, none of them will matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he is faster than my son,'' Felix Sr. said. ``But what
does it matter? When he gets hit, he will slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that is what the Tinidads are counting on. David Reid
is counting on what he has in his heart and in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Trinidad is going to have trouble with my speed and my
movement,'' he said. ``I do not stay in one spot . . . and he's
going to have trouble with my punching power.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, somebody seems certain to find trouble before this
night is over. When he does his O will go. And, for 10 seconds or
so, he's likely to go out with it.

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ At every campaign stop, Sen. John McCain introduces
his wife, Cindy McCain, as ``the one who everyone says, `Why isn't
she the candidate?''' But until a few months ago, no one, including
either of the McCains, saw her as someone who could take on so much
as a supporting role in a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even some friends considered her not only disinterested, but
simply too fragile _ and in the rough calculus of political life,
probably a liability. Her life in Arizona, where her husband has
joined her on weekends and holidays throughout his Senate career,
had always revolved around their children and her parents, who live
across the street. Politics was a subject the McCains rarely
discussed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And if the public had heard of her at all, it was probably as a
result of the 1994 headlines about a federal investigation into her
theft of painkillers from a medical charity she ran. Or because of
the Keating Five savings and loan scandal a few years earlier,
which she was drawn into as well. Today, drug-free since 1993, she
looks back on that time in their lives as a moment that ``nearly
destroyed both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in contrast, news reports about Mrs. McCain have been
uniformly positive. Crowds like her, the camera loves her, and, not
insignificantly, her husband seems to have noticed, too: ``She's
really blossomed,'' he said. Those who know the couple say it is a
profound relief for Mrs. McCain to find that she is widely
perceived as a political asset to him.
</P>
<P>
   And in this new role, at age 45, she seems to be seeing not Sen.
McCain but herself in another light: ``It's overwhelming,'' she
said, ``how much interest there is in the partner.''
</P>
<P>
   For months now, more than any other presidential candidate's
wife, she has been a regular on the campaign trail. Through 14-hour
work days, she is almost constantly at her husband's elbow, smiling
as she double-steps to keep up with him in crowds, and nodding at
just the right moments during the speech she has heard hundreds of
times.
</P>
<P>
   Getting on the Straight Talk Express again one morning last
week, she said she had expected to hate campaigning, and planned to
avoid it as much as possible. And no one was more surprised than
she was, she says, that she has instead really taken to life on the
road: ``For most of the 20 years we've been married, he's been in
Washington all week while I'm in Arizona with the kids,'' she
explained. ``I've never spent this much time with my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign trail, of course, does not offer much quality time
for the candidate and his wife, either. But she says she is mostly
here to help, and she certainly does: She smoothes her husband's
hair and helps him with his jacket _ the injuries he suffered as a
prisoner of war prevent him from raising his arms over his head _
and watches his diet, too, though often in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Intensely protective, she also gives a pretty good stiff arm to
photographers who try to get too close _ not to her, but to her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   And she tries to see that he sleeps. During the flap about his
Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, carrying his own feather
pillow on the road, someone asked Sen. McCain whether, he, too, had
brought a pillow from home. Yeah, he said, and gestured towards his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   She is a quiet presence on the bus, and by far its best turned
out passenger, in her St. John knit suits and patent leather pumps,
with a soft-spoken femininity that does recall her role model,
Jackie Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hip haircut that an aide insists is sweeping
Washington, she carries herself in a way that is distinctly
unmodern: Years of dance training have endowed her with perfect
posture, and she usually stands with one foot forward, in the
fourth position.
</P>
<P>
   Often, she sits up front reading magazines and fielding calls
from her kids while her husband holds forth with reporters in back.
But when he does bring her into the conversation by teasing her, as
he did one day in New Hampshire _ when he referred to ``a certain
dyed blond'' and she pretended to throw something at him _ she
beams, and basks in the attention.
</P>
<P>
   She seems always to have revered her war hero husband, 18 years
her senior, whom she met when she was only 25: ``I see the crowds
and their faces and they're looking at him with hope and it's nice
people agree with me. He's a real inspiration.'' Then she stopped
and added, ``I guess anyone would say that about their husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, seeing that her husband needed a day off, she pinch
hit for him while he took a break in Arizona. ``She did a very
stoic thing, while we all went to the cabin and grilled chicken and
drank beer and slept for 12 hours,'' said his longtime aide Mark
Salter.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Mrs. McCain doesn't speak much to voters, but does make
a striking appearance, and her husband's admirers frequently tell
him they are wowed by her looks: ``I like your taste in women,''
one woman told him last weekend as Mrs. McCain sat at his side. A
supporter in San Diego last week waved a sign that said, ``Cindy is
a Babe.''
</P>
<P>
   Her assistant says that the number one question she gets is how
she manages to look at all moments as though she just returned from
a week at a spa. When asked that question yet again, she blushed
and said, ``I don't do anything special. I just love being with my
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Far less flattering questions get a similarly positive response.
When asked whether she ever worried about how her addiction to
painkillers had affected her children, the oldest of whom was 7 at
the time she was dependent on Percocet and Vicodin, she said, ``No.
It was more for me that I missed a
</P>
<P>
   great deal. I missed a lot of what went on. But I'm a better
person and a better parent for having gone through that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And she went through quite a bit. In 1991, her husband was
rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee for exercising poor judgment
in meeting with federal regulators who were investigating Charles
Keating Jr., the owner of a failing savings and loan who was also a
friend and donor. Mrs. McCain was involved in the matter as well
because she had helped keep her husband's books and could not find
receipts showing that they had reimbursed Keating for flying on his
corporate jet to his vacation home in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   It was under pressure of that scandal, and after back surgery,
that she became addicted to painkillers. And though her drug
problem went on for a couple of years, her husband never noticed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was not McCain but his wife's parents who became
worried by her erratic behavior and confronted her. More than a
year later, when federal authorities began investigating reports
that she had stolen drugs from the charity, the senator finally
learned of his wife's addiction _ just before her troubles, too,
hit the front page.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, news of Mrs. McCain tends to focus on her constant
cell phone conversations with her children. And one of her closest
friends, Sharon Harper, said that she is enjoying every minute of
her moment: ``She does really well so there's a lot of
reinforcement, a lot of validation and reassurance along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCain herself suggests that as a stay-at-home mom, the
little gold stars were harder to come by: ``There have been times,
particularly in Washington, when they shake your hand and look over
your head _ ``Where's John?'' _ but I don't really care what they
think.''
</P>
<P>
   The only child of a wealthy Phoenix beer distributor, Jim
Hensley, she was a little lonely growing up, she said, and always
knew she wanted children.
</P>
<P>
   After college and graduate school at the University of Southern
California _- an institution her husband refers to as the
University of Spoiled Children _ she shunned a major role in the
family business and taught for a few months as a special education
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   When she met McCain, and they ``fell in love at first sight,''
as she said, he was still married and living with his first wife.
But she was so shy, so obviously not the initiator, his first
wife's friends have said, that even then, no one blamed her.
</P>
<P>
   After years as ``a background spouse,'' as Salter referred to
her, McCain only got her to go along with his presidential plans by
promising that she would never have to set foot in Iowa or New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But then, over the course of the campaign, she began to feel
needed.
</P>
<P>
   At a town hall meeting in Peterborough, New Hampshire, last
October, someone in the audience asked about Mrs. McCain's agenda.
``Her special project? It would be keeping me under control,'' her
husband said, winking at the audience before handing the microphone
over to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right,'' she began, ``my first concern is to keep him
under control, but I'm a stay-at-home mother. If our family is
running well and our home is running well that enables my husband
to do his job better. I don't like labels, but if there's a label
for me, it would be traditional, and I'm very proud to be
traditional,'' she said, to huge applause.
</P>
<P>
   Her issues as first lady, she says, would be adoption and foster
care.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her years in Narcotics Anonymous, Mrs. McCain doesn't
mention drug treatment as a principle focus, and in fact advocates
a return to Nancy Reagan's `Just Say No' anti-drug philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even as her husband's most loyal supporter, how does
she appear ever rapt during the stump speech _ and filled with
delight at every retelling of his jokes? She laughed. ``Let's just
say it's very exciting when there's a new joke.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of times, she has cried in full view of reporters, most
recently on the day of the South Carolina primary. ``Losing is not
what bothered me,'' she explained. ``It was how we lost. When they
criticized me for having an adopted child of color, that capped it.
That was despicable.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to reports, disputed by the Bush camp, that
there were campaign leaflets characterizing Mrs. McCain as a drug
addict who had adopted a black baby; her 8-year-old daughter
Bridget was born in Bangladesh, and Mrs. McCain brought her here
for medical care. She decided to adopt her on the flight back,
before talking to her husband, and at the airport, told him, ``Meet
your daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on his campaign plane, McCain referred to that
display of emotion as ``the only time I saw her slip during this
whole thing'' and called her ``very emotional'' and ``not a
political sophisticate.''
</P>
<P>
   And when, at the end of yet another long day during which Mrs.
McCain spent virtually every moment supporting him, the senator was
asked to describe his marriage to her, he rubbed his hands over his
face before answering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most marriages,'' he said, sitting next to her on the
plane, ``it has a lot of revolving around our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   If these are not exactly the words every wife is longing to
hear, however, Mrs. McCain did not protest, or register any
reaction at all.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would describe his wife to a friend who did not
know her, the senator said, ``as a very kind person, committed to
her children, and never before this campaign politically involved.
She's really blossomed.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, she pulled a blanket over him and watched
as he drifted off to sleep.

ZIMBABWE WILL REPORTEDLY CONTINUE EFFORT TO SEIZE WHITE-OWNED
LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The Zimbabwean government Thursday
sent the clearest signal yet that it plans to press ahead with its
effort to change the constitution to allow the state to seize
white-owned land without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page article, the state-controlled Herald newspaper
reported that the government plans to put forward a constitutional
amendment that would grant the government the power to take land
from white farmers, resettle landless blacks and pay nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a similarly worded proposal was defeated in a
referendum on a new constitution. But a constitutional amendment
could be adopted with the support of two-thirds of the 150-member
Parliament, which is dominated by President Robert Mugabe's
governing party, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Approval could come as early as April, before the country's
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The voters' rejection of the constitutional referendum 16 days
ago delivered a stunning rebuke to Mugabe, who has led Zimbabwe
since its independence from Britain in 1980. But the rejection had
more to do with the country's crumbling economy than with the
constitution itself or with any widespread concern for the fate of
white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, two decades after the black majority wrested control
from whites, land reform and redistribution remains a volatile
political issue, particularly among people in the countryside.
Whites, who number about 70,000 in this nation of 12.5 million
people, are estimated to control more than half of the country's
most fertile land, while most blacks are crowded onto land with
little or no agricultural value.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of just how inflammatory an issue land remains,
thousands of veterans of the guerrilla war against white rule
stormed farms around the country this week in what they said was
retribution for the vote against the constitutional revision.
</P>
<P>
   The mobs intimidated and threatened land owners, and in at least
a couple of cases, forced them off their land, said Jerry Grant,
deputy director of the Commercial Farmers' Union, which represents
about 4,000 large-scale farmers, most of them white.
</P>
<P>
   Police did little to halt the raids at first, and the national
police commissioner told the state newspaper that the actions
against the farmers were a ``political issue'' and that his
officers could do nothing to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa said Thursday that the
raiders could not be denied their ``democratic right to
demonstrate'' but added that if they did not withdraw by Saturday,
the police would intervene.
</P>
<P>
   With parliamentary elections set for April, the amendment
appears to be a play for the support of rural voters, whose
homesteads were in many cases stolen decades ago by white settlers
during Britain's colonial rule in the former Rhodesia and who
remain frustrated by the slow pace of redistribution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mugabe and his party were apparently counting on that anger to
propel the proposed new constitution in February, but they
underestimated the depth of discontent in the country over
inflation, unemployment and government corruption and
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the new constitution would only have strengthened
the president and was more about grabbing power than grabbing land,
opponents of the referendum were able to defeat Mugabe, the
liberation leader who has been all but invincible during his two
decades in power.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by his surprising loss at the polls, Mugabe, 76, was
uncharacteristically diplomatic in his speech after the vote. But
since then, his government has been giving every indication that
the land question is far from settled.
</P>
<P>
   Only a couple of years ago, Zimbabwe appeared ready to make land
reform a reality. An agreement with several donor countries,
including Britain, called for Zimbabwe to cover the costs of
acquiring the land, while the donor nations would pay the
considerably higher costs of redeveloping and resettling the land.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan, hampered in part by the government's desperate
shortage of money, has yet to move off the drawing board. With
little to show for all the chatter about land reform, Mugabe has
frequently resorted to talk of simply taking the land and leaving
Britain with the responsibility for paying out any compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, like the failed draft constitution, the new draft
amendment would codify Britain's responsibility for compensation.
Such a threat, empty as it is, has only served to harden attitudes
on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Such standoffs, along with the government's willingness to stand
by and watch the farm raids happen, suggest that the divide between
the government and its critics _ at home and abroad _ is only
deepening, said Sam Moyo, a land reform expert and the director of
the Southern Africa Institute for Policy Research in Harare,
Zimbabwe's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have dug in their heels,'' Moyo said in a telephone
interview. ``What we're seeing is a reflection of the polarization
that has developed on both sides.''

`THE JAUNDICED EYE': TWO LIVES TORN BY A CHILD ABUSE CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(jt) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen Matthews grew up in a small town in Michigan, working in
his father's live bait store and dreaming of being the first member
of his family to go to college. When he was still a teen-ager, he
got his girlfriend, Danette, pregnant, and they had a son. These
perfectly ordinary circumstances, which could come out of a Raymond
Carver story or a Bruce Springsteen ballad, lie in the background
of ``The Jaundiced Eye,'' Nonny de la Pena's wrenching new
documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews soon discovered that he was gay, divorced Danette, and
moved to California to escape the drab provinciality of his
hometown. The mother of his child found a new boyfriend, but
Matthews' parents continued to enjoy a close relationship with
their grandson, who frequently spent weekends at their house.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is horrifying, but far from extraordinary.
The 1980s saw a wave of shocking allegations that young children
were being sexually abused in bizarre and hideous ways. The
testimony of children _ often coached by well-meaning but badly
trained therapists and pushed by zealous prosecutors _ sent a
number of innocent people to jail, among them Stephen Matthews and
his father, Melvin, convicted in 1989 of molesting Stephen's
5-year-old son. After four years in jail, they were freed on appeal
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Their case is not as spectacular, or as well known, as the
McMartin or Little Rascals day care cases, but it followed a
similar pattern. Stephen's ex-girlfriend was troubled by some
aspects of her son's behavior, and soon a therapist was extracting
wild stories from him. He reported that he was forced to watch his
father and grandfather having sex, that he had been tied to a tree
and sodomized, and that his father had penetrated him with the
blade of a machete. No corroborating physical evidence was ever
produced, but the boy's testimony was sufficient to convict both
men.
</P>
<P>
   De la Pena takes us through the legal maze that led, a decade
after the charges were first leveled, to the granting of a new
trial. The trial never took place because the district attorney's
office declined to prosecute, citing insufficient evidence. Some of
what the film documents is almost comical: the Matthewses' first
lawyer attributes his clients' conviction to their refusal to hire
a handwriting analyst to screen potential jurors, even though he
himself seems to have mishandled crucial medical evidence. de la
Pena also records the selfless decency of Walter Carlson, a local
detective who made it his life's mission to exonerate the
Matthewses, and whose wife carried on his crusade after he died.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, this film catalogs a dozen varieties of cruelty and
heartbreak. Stephen Matthews retains a remarkable affability in the
face of an ordeal that has included a rape in prison and the loss
of all contact with his son. His father found religion in prison.
But beneath the still waters of their friendly Midwestern reserve
you can intuit deep reservoirs of rage and resentment, not least
toward each other. And though the criminal justice system can
provide a measure of vindication, it can't guarantee a happy
ending. In the film's devastating last scene, Stephen listens to
the voice of his now teenage son, whose name is never heard on the
soundtrack, and what he hears is, in its way, more shocking than
any of the boy's lurid courtroom testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, every story has two sides, and de la Pena is
honorably fair-minded. She brings in experts from both sides of the
debate about how to handle allegations of sexual abuse and allows
the boy's mother and his stepfather, Doug Wilson, to defend their
continued belief in the Matthewses' guilt. Fairness, of course, is
not the same as neutrality, but the Wilsons, whose faces are never
shown, don't seem to require much prodding to create the impression
that they may have been motivated by jealousy and intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   De la Pena has continued the valuable work, begun by writers
like the journalist Debbie Nathan and the literary critic Frederick
Crews, of bringing the nation back to its senses after an episode
of mass hysteria. ``The Jaundiced Eye'' is a passionate, angry
piece of advocacy, but it is equally, and in consequence, a brave
and necessary act of truth-telling.

   FILM-MAP (Undated) _ Alice (Sigourney Weaver), the
heroine-narrator of the film version of Jane Hamilton's 1994 novel,
``A Map of the World,'' tells us in its opening moments that we are
about to witness a woman's descent into a living hell. The boast
turns out to be no exaggeration.

   FILM-THING (Undated) _ At some point, Madonna is going to have
to face the hard fact that her particular stardom just doesn't
translate well to feature-length, narrative-based motion pictures.
When she tries to play a normal, everyday human being _ as she does
in her latest splashy star vehicle, ``The Next Best Thing'' _ she's
fairly hopeless.

   FILM-SKIP (Undated) _ ``My Dog Skip'' has its lapses, but it
kept a preview audience in tears. As a family film about a boy and
his dog, it brings back memories of ``Old Yeller,'' ``Big Red'' and
``The Incredible Journey,'' which also taught kids about life, its
hardships and joys, and how important that first beloved pet can
be. And it works because it never tries to be more than the very
personal memory piece it is.

STRAW POLL FAILS TO DESIGNATE NEW IMF CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Directors of the International Monetary Fund failed
Thursday to rally around any of the people who want to lead the
world financial institution, and expectations rose that Europe
would search for a new candidate to keep its half-century lock on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   The European, American and Japanese contenders for the fund's
top post all fell short of a majority of the votes in a straw poll.
No further poll was scheduled, and people involved in the selection
process said it could now take weeks to choose a replacement for
Michel Camdessus, the Frenchman who recently retired as managing
director.
</P>
<P>
   The vote result, which was not a surprise, confirmed that
Germany had misjudged its chances of rallying support for Caio
Koch-Weser, a deputy finance minister whom German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder aggressively pushed for the job during a
four-month campaign. Germany backed Koch-Weser despite public
opposition from the United States and a lukewarm endorsement by
European allies.
</P>
<P>
   Koch-Weser garnered 43 percent of the votes in the straw poll,
people involved in the process said. That was a modest margin over
the nearly 37 percent of the votes that the European Union
controls. Stanley Fischer, the American candidate nominated by a
coalition of African and Arab countries, placed a distant second
with 12 percent. The Japanese favorite, Eisuke Sakakibara, a former
Finance Ministry official, got 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The United States abstained, as did many other countries, and 36
percent of the votes were not cast for any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   European Union officials expressed hopes that Germany would
admit defeat and allow the 15-nation European Union, which had
formally endorsed Koch-Weser earlier this week, to search for a new
candidate. Romano Prodi, the European Commission president, told
European reporters Thursday that Koch-Weser's candidacy was
effectively dead and that Europe should find someone the United
States could support.
</P>
<P>
   German officials sent no clear signals about their next move.
European and American participants in the process speculated that
Germany, which has surprised people with the tenacity of its
campaign so far, could try to force a second vote.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, these people said, Germany could seek to extract
diplomatic concessions from European partners before agreeing to
clear the way for a new IMF candidate. The fear was that such
maneuvering could take weeks, leaving the IMF leadership in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, attention quickly turned to other possible European
candidates. Clinton administration officials have said that they
intend to back a European for the job, a tradition that dates to
the founding of the monetary fund just after World War II.
Americans have historically run the IMF's sister institution, the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking before the vote, reiterated that
line Thursday. ``I am completely committed to having a European
head of the IMF,'' he said. In an apparent attempt to soothe
wounded German pride after the United States rejected Koch-Weser,
Clinton also said he would like see other German candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see Germany play a bigger role in all these
international institutions,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no other publicly declared candidates in Europe,
speculation has focused mainly on five people. Gordon Brown,
Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, is considered a possibility
if he is willing to put aside ambitions to succeed Tony Blair as
prime minister. Andrew Crockett, a Briton who currently heads the
Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, has a solid
reputation in international financial circles. There is some
question whether Germany could accept him, however, because he is
not viewed as having substantially greater political stature than
Koch-Weser.
</P>
<P>
   The French have a potential heavyweight candidate in Jean-Claude
Trichet, the head of the Bank of France. But Trichet would have to
sacrifice his ambitions of heading the European Central Bank to
take the IMF post. Two Italians, Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato
and Mario Draghi, a senior Italian Treasury official, are both seen
as experienced in finance and likely to be interested in the IMF
job.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Germany, the big losers in the process were the 20
African and Arab countries that on their own decided to nominate
Fischer, the popular deputy director of the fund, risking Germany's
contempt for failing to support its choice. Delegates of those
countries had clearly hoped that their bid would sooner or later
attract the support of the United States. Fischer, a former
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is highly
regarded by the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton appeared to rule Fischer out on Thursday. He
said that while he admires Fischer, he will not turn away from
Europe. ``I will not support an American candidate even though I
have enormous respect for Mr. Fischer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some people involved said there was a set of
circumstances in which Fischer could get the job. In this case,
Europe would decide that it needed more time to settle on a
qualified candidate and would agree to throw its weight behind
Fischer, perhaps for an interim term of two years.

<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ After John Rocker was sneaked into the Atlanta
Braves spring training complex around 8 a.m. Thursday, he walked
through the doors of an anxious and awaiting clubhouse. Rocker wore
a smile, perhaps a nervous one, as he returned to the place where
some teammates once said he would never be wanted again.
</P>
<P>
   But Rocker was back because his suspension from baseball had
been reduced by an arbitrator on Wednesday. After shaking hands
with some teammates and introducing himself to new members of the
Braves, Rocker sat beside his locker on the left side of the room
and pulled on his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   There was a clock on the wall, but Rocker already knew what time
it would soon be.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, perhaps an hour after Rocker arrived, manager Bobby Cox
spoke to the Braves about Rocker's return and told them that the
reliever wanted to address the club. That is when Rocker, with
teammates and coaches sitting in a circle around him, began
apologizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, guys, let me play,'' teammates said Rocker told them
at one point. ``I want to play for the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves cautiously welcomed Rocker, with his teammates saying
they would give him a chance to prove he is different from the
person who made critical comments about foreigners, gays and New
Yorkers to Sports Illustrated in December.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Rocker was adamant about not answering
questions from reporters. However, after he did one television
interview, he grudgingly agreed to speak with representatives of
the Atlanta news media and a pool reporter representing the
national news media.
</P>
<P>
   In Rocker's first interview with a group of journalists since
the article appeared, the Braves' closer talked about an encounter
with African-American construction workers in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``A black guy who is the foreman at a construction site right
next to my apartment complex stopped me two days ago when I was
pulling out and wanted me to come and talk to all his construction
workers,'' Rocker said. ``I stopped for 15 minutes and signed all
their hard hats, for about 30 guys. Probably 12 or 13 of them were
black guys and they shook my hand and were like, `Man, we hope you
stay with Atlanta.' It's been like that for the last two months.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rocker wanted the anecdote to validate that he is not a
racist, it sounded awkward and mistimed. He had earlier read a
statement in which he said that minor league teammates from
different ethnic groups had stayed at his family's house in Macon,
Ga., and said that his best friend is of Lebanese heritage, a
person whose grandfather came to Ellis Island about 60 years ago.
Once again, Rocker's stories seemed clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see, my actions do not support this racist label,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rocker probably cared less about his public statements than
what he told the Braves in the clubhouse meeting earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to his teammates for 10 minutes, telling them he was
sorry and claiming he did not intend to be malicious. When Rocker
was finished, six players and one coach spoke after Cox to counsel
the pitcher, ask him questions or lecture him. Players said the
meeting fluctuated between being serious and tense, and that Rocker
got teary-eyed at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Mulholland advised him to show the organization respect.
John Smoltz and Tom Glavine talked to him about the critical
comments he made about Cox and reminded teammates that they have
probably been forgiven for something in the past. Brian Jordan and
Reggie Sanders told Rocker it was important for him to admit his
mistakes and move on.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Simon, the unidentified player Rocker had called a ``fat
monkey'' in the article, asked the left-handed closer how he felt
about Latin Americans, and Rocker told Simon that he lived with
Latinos in the minors and had nothing against any groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that he didn't mean what he said and he apologized
for it if he hurt me,'' said Simon, who is from Curacao. ``I felt
really good about what he said. I think I deserved that.''
</P>
<P>
   Players described Ned Yost, the third-base coach, as the most
passionate during his discussion with Rocker. Yost has been with
the Braves for 10 years and he scolded Rocker for being
disrespectful to so many people and causing such distress to an
organization that tries to be classy. Both Jordan and Eddie Perez
said that Rocker almost wept as he tried to apologize to Yost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told John flat out that some of the things that he said
embarrassed me terribly and embarrassed my ideals about the
Braves,'' Yost said. ``He knew that and he was sorry about that and
he apologized to everyone for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Relieved that the meeting was finally over, Rocker later said,
``It was actually much better than I thought it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, all the players said they would forgive Rocker.
Chipper Jones said Rocker has to use his second chance wisely.
Ozzie Guillen, whose fielding was criticized in the article, said
that he does not need an apology from Rocker, and that Rocker just
needs to win games.
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Schuerholz will monitor trade possibilities
and how Rocker's return influences the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In here, it's not going to go away today,'' Glavine said.
``Our clubhouse is no different than society. There are cross
sections he offended in here a lot more than other cross sections.
The important thing was for him to do what he did. Now it's
important for him to figure out what guys he offended more than
others and maybe go around and have conversations there. It's going
to take a while to be totally normal here.''
</P>
<P>
   After Rocker's session with his teammates, he walked through the
spring training facility to get to a field house that was crowded
with 100 reporters. As Rocker strode along purposefully, camera
operators trailing him, he looked alone. It took him 102 seconds to
read a two-page statement that was similar to a statement that
appeared Thursday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He
apologized to AIDS patients, members of minority groups, Cox and
the Braves. He also apologized for not being a role model.
</P>
<P>
   When Rocker sauntered onto the field for the first time this
morning, a fan yelled, ``We still love you, John,'' while another
shouted, ``First Amendment.'' The 25-year-old reliever tossed a
ball along the right-field line with Rudy Seanez, his best friend
on the team, and watched as the Braves defeated the University of
Georgia. It was Rocker's first day back, a day when he admitted he
has been immature and when the Braves admitted that this saga is
hardly over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just turned 25 a couple of months ago and I think people are
expecting me to be mature way beyond my years because of the
position that I'm in,'' Rocker said. ``Got just a little bit of
growing up left.'' &QL;

ADVERTISING: DOUBLECLICK PUTS OFF PLAN FOR WIDER USE OF CONSUMER
INFORMATION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yielding to pressure from privacy advocates and Wall Street,
DoubleClick Inc., the nation's largest online advertising company,
said Thursday that it would put a hold on its plan to link personal
information to anonymous data it collects about consumers on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a big mistake,'' said Kevin O'Connor, DoubleClick's
chief executive. ``It was wrong to try to match that information in
the absence of government or industry standards, so until there's
agreement on it, we will not.''
</P>
<P>
   The move was applauded by privacy groups, which began
criticizing DoubleClick late last year, after it completed its $1.7
billion purchase of the Abacus Direct Corp., which compiles
off-line information on the buying habits of millions of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's share price had fallen in recent weeks as protests
grew over DoubleClick's use of detailed personal data from multiple
sources to select consumers for advertisements that fit their
lifestyle and buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick had announced plans to take the Abacus information
and combine it with data it already gathers about consumers as they
travel within the company's network of 1,500 sites. These include
Web giants like Alta Vista and Autobytel.com. When users visit
those sites and view DoubleClick ads, DoubleClick places a tiny
file called a ``cookie'' on their hard drives. The cookie contains
an identifying number that enables DoubleClick to track consumers
and their behavior as they make their way around the Web.
</P>
<P>
   While some privacy advocates have criticized even the cookie
data, it is somewhat anonymous in that it is associated with the
user's computer, not with an actual name or address. But by
combining that data with the Abacus information, the company could
provide advertisers with consumers' identities and detailed
personal information that would tie an individual to his or her
Internet use and buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick also places traceable ads on more than 11,000 other
sites, including The New York Times on the Web, which are not part
of the DoubleClick network but use the company to serve some of the
banner ads on their Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick's Abacus policy also drew anxious inquiries from
legislators and state attorneys general. As privacy groups like the
Center for Democracy and Technology and the Electronic Privacy
Information Center increased the intensity of their attacks against
the company last month, the Federal Trade Commission opened an
investigation into the company's tracking practices.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also fled. DoubleClick's stock dropped more than $30
in the last two weeks in February, settling into the low $80 range.
They gained $2.875 on Thursday's announcement, closing at $83.4375.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became very clear that the overwhelming point of contention
was under what circumstances could a name be associated with
anonymous Web activity,'' O'Connor said. ``Now we're just happy to
get this behind us and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel MacKeigan, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, an
investment firm, said after the announcement: ``What DoubleClick is
trying to do is take the bull's-eye off their chest. The first side
of the hurricane hit them, and while it may have quieted down a
little, the back side of the storm was coming. It's a smart move.''
</P>
<P>
   Tara Long, an analyst with CE Unterberg Towbin, an investment
firm, said DoubleClick's new strategy was sound. ``It shows the
flexibility in their business model,'' she said. ``They recognized
they made a mistake, they maybe moved too early, and that they need
to have the consumers' buy in to make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the Abacus acquisition as valuable now? Probably not, but
it's not a total waste,'' Long said. ``They didn't spend $1 billion
on nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, DoubleClick could still use the Abacus
data to aim ads at people based on their offline buying habits if
they wanted: ``For example, they could still target soccer moms _
women of a certain age, who might not have a job and might drive a
minivan.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the company was simply agreeing not to combine that
data with information about Internet sites this woman had visited.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates expressed relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased, and in fairness to DoubleClick, the fact that
they reversed themselves was the right thing to do,'' said Marc
Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center. Nevertheless, he added: ``That said, I don't think the
issue of online profiling goes away now. They just have to do it in
a way that maintains the user's privacy going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But Evan Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, a Washington
newsletter, said he feared that DoubleClick's move could actually
stall the effort to establish privacy standards. ``It's like `Darn,
we won!''' he said. ``By backing down now and doing the right
thing, they take a little air out of the balloon, and unfortunately
that could slow things down.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that until February, the industry's
self-regulation effort was moving just slowly enough to maintain
the status quo, but quickly enough to satisfy Congress and the FTC,
each of which had threatened to propose privacy laws specific to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   However, since DoubleClick became the focal point of the online
privacy debate, the industry groups have accelerated their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really had a galvanizing effect,'' said Rich LeFurgy,
chairman of the Internet Advertising Bureau, one of several
industry trade groups developing privacy standards. ``We know the
FTC is looking closer and closer at it and potential legislation is
being reviewed, so we know we're reaching a critical point. I doubt
this will slow things down one iota.''

 &HT;    BellSouth could be part of global deals
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Deutsche Telekom is apparently in talks to buy Qwest
Communications, just as the Denver-based company is poised to merge
with US West.
</P>
<P>
   Such a purchase by the German phone company, the largest
telecommunications concern in Europe, would continue the wave of
consolidation that has roiled the industry during the past four
years. The acquisition would be the first by an overseas player to
purchase a U.S. company _ and probably not the last.
</P>
<P>
   For months, speculation has floated through the industry that
Deutsche Telekom is considering a bid for Atlanta-based BellSouth.
Word that Deutsche Telekom is now focused on Denver-based Qwest
drops an intriguing set of options at BellSouth's door _ assuming
BellSouth isn't already involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has mostly sat out the flurry of mergers and
acquisitions. Yet last year, BellSouth bought 10 percent of Qwest,
with the notion that the investment could lead to an acquisition _
especially once BellSouth is permitted into the long-distance
market in its nine-state region.
</P>
<P>
   And while BellSouth has been conservative _ zealously guarding
earnings from dilution by large investments _ the company has
proven that it can gamble big. With MCI WorldCom about to forge a
deal to buy Sprint last fall, BellSouth rushed in with a stunning,
eleventh-hour bid. MCI WorldCom quickly topped that $100 billion
package, but BellSouth had shown that it could move _ and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the possibility of an SBC-BellSouth alliance emerged
with news that the companies have been talking about joining to
form a nearly national wireless network. That kind of asset is one
that any major player is expected to build _ or buy.
</P>
<P>
   ALLIANCE MAY HELP BELLSOUTH
</P>
<P>
   Like MCI WorldCom, Deutsche Telekom has the firepower to win a
bidding war. But _ perhaps even without bidding _ BellSouth could
come away with an alliance that would help both companies.
</P>
<P>
   And the two might be natural allies, if only because BellSouth
recently earned the enmity of Deutsche Telekom's main rival, France
Telecom. Late last year, BellSouth headed off France Telecom's
purchase of a German wireless company. Perhaps by forging a deal
with Deutsche Telekom now, BellSouth might become more competitive
_ and maintain its independence, too.
</P>
<P>
   Other European telecom companies _ especially British Telecom
and France Telecom _ are also interested in establishing a U.S.
beachhead. And Deutsche Telekom is negotiating toward a purchase of
Global Crossing, the Bermuda-based provider of high-speed services,
according to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any of them did some kind of investment, it wouldn't
surprise me,'' said Elliott Hamilton, vice president with the
Strategis Group. ``If anything, it's surprising that they have
waited so long.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies involved would comment Thursday. And
Deutsche Telekom's French rival airily dismissed the whole notion
as a bad bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see nothing in the valuation of Qwest that would justify
France Telecom being interested in it,'' said Michel Bon, chief
executive of France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the logic of a deal makes sense, even if there
is some quibbling about the price. Qwest could give Deutsche
Telekom a 16,000 mile network of high-speed fiber lines in the
United States, as well as a sizeable long-distance company.
Deutsche Telekom is reportedly willing to pay at least $70 a share
for Qwest, setting the purchase price north of $52.4 billion.
Complicating any negotiations would be Qwest's $35 billion purchase
of US West, a compact embraced by shareholders and awaiting only
regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   US West, although the smallest of the regional Bells, is still a
large, stable, profitable company with dominance in local phone
service throughout its 14-state region. US West, while often
criticized for poor customer service, does seem to have a lead on
other phone companies in delivering high-speed services for video
and Internet. But it would be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   If Deutsche Telekom only wants Qwest, it would have to break up
the merger. In addition to facing a multi-billion dollar breakup
fee, that move would likely provoke a fight from US West, whose
shareholders expected to be paid a healthy premium as part of the
merger. Even an attempt to pay less than Qwest had agreed to pay
might spark resistance.
</P>
<P>
   With stock worth about $290 billion at the close of trading
Thursday, Deutsche Telekom certainly should be able to afford
either or both companies. But even two huge acquisitions would
hardly be the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
   SHIFT TOWARD GLOBAL
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the industry is in the midst of an inexorable
shift toward a global marketplace in which ``mega-carriers'' will
offer all manner of telecom services from local phones to Internet
access. No company known has that reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it ultimately be Deutsche Telekom, Qwest, US West and
BellSouth together? Sure. Why not?,'' said analyst Marc Bacurin at
JC Bradford. ``We are moving to a world where there will be only
five or six global carriers. For BellSouth, it will mean becoming
part of some larger company, whether as an acquirer or being
acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   If BellSouth has not already maneuvered itself into the thinking
of Deutsche Telekom, it probably should, he said. ``BellSouth has
probably been making calls to make sure they are not left at the
altar.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, BellSouth's stake in Qwest has risen along with
the speculation about Deutsche Telekom. BellSouth's 10 percent now
represents $4.4 billion, up more than 100 percent this year.
BellSouth's stock too has bounced _ jumping about 25 percent in the
past week to close Thursday at $44.875 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation talk has spurred a number of stocks in the
long-lagging sector. For example, AT&AMP;T added $6.31 1/4 a share to
close at $54.12 1/2, after some upbeat comments from Goldman Sachs.
SBC Communications gained $2.50 to $44.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom is Europe's largest telecommunications company,
but its presence in the United States has thus far been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The company has seven offices in North America, with a U.S.
headquarters in New York that is mostly concerned with serving the
needs of German companies doing business here. Acting chief
executive of the unit is Don Hassenbein, a veteran of 23 years in
the U.S. Air Force and a decade with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southeast, Deutsche Telekom has a site only in Atlanta.
Those offices are just across the street from BellSouth's corporate
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (report) highlights the fact that Deutsche Telekom has a
gaping hole in its strategy,'' said London-based Bob House, vice
president of the consulting company Renaissance Worldwide. ``What
they need to do is make a play for someone who has built or is
building a high-speed network. There are not many of those around,
and Qwest is one.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have staked a claim at mega-carrier status are
AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Bell Atlantic, all of which have substantial
international interests. But Deutsche Telekom cannot vault to that
status without a large U.S. presence. Deutsche Telekom hadn't
entered the U.S. market at least partly because until recently it
was part of a three-way European venture with France Telecom and
Sprint. That arrangement, never entirely harmonious, fell apart and
France Telecom bought the others out.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the instigator
behind the deal is Phlip Anschutz, chairman of Qwest who owns 39
percent of the company. Anschutz reportedly met with Deutsche
Telekom Chairman Ron Sommer on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest Chief Executive Joseph Nacchio, a hard-charging veteran of
AT&AMP;T, has clearly been angling to make a major player out of Qwest,
whose sales last year were still shy of $4 billion. His ambitious
and independent nature has been widely viewed as a potential
obstacle to a deal with some larger company. And earlier this week,
US West's chief executive, Solomon Trujillo, announced his
resignation, citing a failure to reach accord on management in the
merged company.
</P>
<P>
   To buy US West, Nacchio and Qwest had to out-battle Global
Crossing, led by another aggressive ex-AT&AMP;T executive who had to
settle for purchase of Frontier Communications. If all the current
speculation is true, they could all be owned by Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   And there are yet other entanglements. For instance, BellSouth's
main partner in Europe _ Dutch-based KPN Telecom _ has a joint
venture with Qwest that gives KPN the right to become sole owner if
Qwest is sold. BellSouth and KPN are seen as possible merger
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the talk of logic and lucrative global markets, the deal
may prove tough to consummate.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant Bob House of said that Qwest's top brass ought to be
enticed somehow into staying, perhaps through something less than
an acquisition, perhaps through granting them more independence.
``This is really not consistent with the way that Deutsche Telekom
thinks,'' House said. ``But unless they show some flexibility, they
stand the chance of losing management that makes Qwest a success.''

 A.W. STILES, A VERITABLE SANTA, DIES AT 89  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archibald W. Stiles, the little boy who had no toys but grew up
to become Santa Claus _ and run an eccentric antiques business that
let growing children exchange their old ice skates for somebody
else's bigger ones _ died Tuesday at a New Jersey convalescent
home. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles, who had a long, flowing beard and white hair, lived what
was, by all accounts, a magical life. Neighbors came to treasure
the sight of him and his wife, Emma, taking their weekly two-hour
rides in an old-fashioned horse-drawn carriage from their home and
shop in Meyersville, a hamlet on the outskirts of Chatham Township
in southern Morris County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   At Christmas time, they would put on cherry-red costumes to be
Mr. and Mrs. Claus. Holly the horse would draw their sleigh to
visit schools and hospitals, and their herd of pet deer (alas,
Virginia, white-tailed, not reindeer), sometimes as many as a
dozen, frisked merrily behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, he just grew to look more and more like
Santa,'' Stiles said.
</P>
<P>
   Their store, Archie's Resale Shop, resembles an elves'
warehouse. Enclosed within six sheds, pretty much collapsing on one
another, it telegraphs the possibility of serendipitous treasure,
the lure that draws millions of Americans to flea markets. In
recent years, foreigners eager to buy a piece of Americana have
been turning up at the shop with astonishing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? A Bing Crosby 45-rpm record for 50 cents here; a
stained-glass window for $200 there; a one-of-a-kind horseshoe
chair, handmade by a blacksmith using 90 horseshoes, a steal at
$1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the thousands of hub caps and license plates, there are
even things on display that are solemnly declared not for sale _
except perhaps for the right price. These include collections of
1940s dolls, rocking horses and 20 horse-drawn sleighs, not to
mention the immense grouping of stuffed rabbits, each wearing a
swimsuit and sunglasses and holding an umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   And, boy, could Stiles sell his odd wares. A 1992 article in The
New York Times pictures him pointing and saying, ``Look at that
elephant over there _ came from a circus that couldn't afford a
real one, only one of them in the world, made in the 1930s _ watch
her eyes blink and her stomach move.''
</P>
<P>
   He put it this way: ``It's all here to give people's eyeballs an
education. I tell people to take three steps forward and then back
up two to see what they missed.''
</P>
<P>
   But everyone would notice the pet farm. Over the years,
residents have included peacocks, ferrets, ducks, wild turkeys,
rabbits, geese, turkeys, cats and a raccoon named Rebel. Charlie,
the crow, could bark like a dog. Well, almost: he could not
pronounce the letter B, so it came out ``wow, wow.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the deer, Stiles had wanted since childhood to have at
least one. In the mid-1950s, he paid a $150 fee to the state to
take whatever the wildlife authorities would give him. He got a
buck and a doe, and since then, had something like three dozen in
all.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles was born in Westfield, N.J., and never had toys as a
child. He once speculated that that was the reason he was driven to
acquire 60 life-size dolls and 160 teddy bears as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   He ran away from home at 13, his son, George, said. He worked as
a carpenter and in a metals factory, where melting magnesium left
holes in his skin that remained for the rest of his life. By the
early 1950s, he owned a luncheonette in Berkeley Heights, N.J., the
town where he died in the convalescent home.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, he met and married Emma Newman, who ran a
family-owned boarding house in Meyersville. They immediately began
to collect junk, setting the used bathroom fixtures, wagon wheels
and the rest of it in the muddy front yard of the boarding house.
In 1956, the boarding house became Archie's Resale Shop, looking
exactly like what it was, a glorified junk shop.
</P>
<P>
   One winter in the late 1950s, when one manufacturer of ice
skates had suffered a fire and another a strike, skates were hard
to find. The Stileses, both of whom loved to skate, bought as many
used skates as they could find. They invited others to trade in
skates that no longer fit, charging $1 per trade, a figure that has
now risen to $5.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles donated time and merchandise to local charities,
particularly the Meyersville Grange, Chapter 188. His antique
clothing collection was displayed annually in the town's Mayfair
Parade; Stiles took part dressed as an organ grinder with his pet
monkey.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and his son, who lives in Long Valley,
N.J., Stiles is survived by a brother, Donald, of Westfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The shop will survive him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Osgood, the CBS radio raconteur, once said the tale of
Archie Stiles was his favorite of all the stories he had reported.
He came to Meyersville to report on the skate trade-ins, then
discovered a fantastical world of striped barber poles, deer and a
ruddy-faced fellow with a white beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the speculation had the operation headquartered
farther north,'' he told the nation. ``Much farther north.''

CLINTON URGES CONGRESS TO BREAK LOGJAM ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Adds Feinstein quote in 8th graf, Schumer comment and quotes in
12th and 13th grafs, deletes NRA spokesman's quote and adds
background on gun legislation offered last term in Congress in last
2 grafs of story) 
(jt) 
 By MARC LACEY and ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to two high-profile incidents of gun
violence this week, President Clinton said Thursday that he would
invite legislative leaders to the White House next week to try to
``break the logjam'' on gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of Congress' approving a far-reaching gun
control bill remains bleak. Frustrated Senate Democrats vowed
Thursday to break off pieces of the legislation that has been tied
up since last summer and add them as amendments to other bills. In
the House, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., called Democratic
leaders the obstructionist ones and suggested alternatives of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate approved different gun control bills after
contentious debates last year. But lawmakers in the two chambers
are deeply divided on the restrictions and have yet to reconcile
them in conference.
</P>
<P>
   In convening a session at the White House on Tuesday, Clinton
sought Thursday to bring the issue of gun control to the forefront
following heightened public concern after the shooting death of a
six-year-old girl in Michigan by a classmate, as well as a
Pennsylvania man's rampage that left two men dead and three others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two incidents were very troubling, and they have
individual causes and explanations, and doubtless will require
individual responses,'' Clinton said. ``But they do remind us that
there is still too much danger in this country and that for more
than eight months now, Congress has been sitting on the
common-sense gun safety legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The impasse over the legislation is becoming a powerful issue in
this election year and each sides blames the other for the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have explained lawmakers' inaction on gun control as
the result of a Congress held captive by the National Rifle
Association, especially the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten so mired in politics that members are afraid of
their own shadows when it comes to these gun groups,'' said Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who supports tougher
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accuse Democrats of refusing to compromise to have a
campaign issue to run on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the House Democratic leadership drops its
obstructionist tactics and agrees to work with us to pass
common-sense gun legislation,'' said Hastert, who suggested
legislation dealing with the prosecution of gun felonies, cracking
down on illegal drugs and addressing ``cultural problems which
encourage some of our youth to do evil things.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that if a trigger lock had been installed on the
gun used by the Michigan boy, as the legislation in both chambers
calls for, the incident might not have happened. Child-safety
trigger locks are one part of the legislation with broad bipartisan
support. Other measures with wide backing include a ban on
large-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   But with legislation unlikely to move, Sen. Charles E. Schumer,
D-N.Y., said gun control supporters would seek to add gun
restrictions to unrelated bills in the next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect Republicans to be on board,'' Schumer said,
``but we'll take whatever steps we can.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, many Republicans rejected the Democrats' piecemeal
approach, and pressed House and Senate negotiators to break up the
impasse. ``I want a juvenile justice bill to be completed, and
that's the way we should do it,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, the assistant majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreements are not strictly partisan; a main opponent of
tighter gun restrictions is a Democrat, Rep. John D. Dingell of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise is not likely anytime soon, lawmakers in both
parties said. The popular gun control measures, as well as scores
of other measures intended to reduce youth crime, are imperiled
because of an impasse between House and Senate negotiators over
regulating gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   A provision that was endorsed by most Democrats and that was
approved by the Senate last May required all vendors at gun shows
to conduct mandatory background checks on customers and gave
vendors up to three days to perform those checks. Currently, only
licensed dealers must conduct background checks, while hobbyists
and collectors are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill technically has no gun show provisions, although
a majority of the House last year approved a measure that gave
dealers only 24 hours to conduct the checks. Since most gun shows
are held on weekends, critics said many checks would not be
completed in time.

 BUSH SHOWS GROWING STRENGTH AS CAMPAIGNER IN BATTLE WITH McCAIN  
(sw) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, Gov. George W. Bush shows roughly the same affection
for Sen. John McCain as he might for a particularly large and
repulsive cockroach. But if Bush becomes president in January, he
might want to use his White House stationery to send a thank you
note to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   For all the divisiveness that the Arizona senator has injected
into the Republican presidential primaries, and despite some harm
that he may have done to Bush's prospects in November, McCain has
helped Bush in one critical respect: he has made him a far better
campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being frightened stiff by the McCain challenge, Bush
has been frightened loose. These days, as the Texas governor
barnstorms through Georgia, Ohio and other states that vote in the
March 7 Super Tuesday primaries, he comes across as a more relaxed,
more energetic and less scripted campaigner than he was just a
month ago, and his audiences are responding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely mesmerized,'' said Gay Hartman, a mortgage
banker in Seattle who had just heard Bush speak in a crowded high
school gymnasium. Halfway across the country, in Cincinnati, after
a thunderous Bush rally that virtually had the ambience of a rock
concert, a nurse, Rose Anne Bertram, still had confetti in her hair
as she raved about Bush's speech, exclaiming, ``He seemed so down
to earth _ not at all like an Ivy Leaguer!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as a presidential candidate Bush still seems a bit quirky,
a work in progress, far more adept at dealing with voters than with
policies. He appears congenial, witty and charming, tremendously
capable of energizing audiences and glad-handing voters, yet weak
on policy details and foreign affairs and often wary of taking
strong stands.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, he also appears squeamish about political
rough-housing. Unlike either McCain or Vice President Al Gore, who
seem to relish a brawl, Bush comes across as thin-skinned and
uncomfortable with the politics of insult _ and not very good at
it.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain used the slur ``gooks'' to refer to his North
Vietnamese guards when he was a prisoner of war (McCain later
apologized), Bush had a perfect opportunity to criticize his
opponent. But when the issue arose at Bush's daily press
conference, this was the exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``Is that appropriate language for someone running for
president?''
</P>
<P>
   A. ``That is going to have to be up to the people. You know,
it's amazing. I haven't seen that in the press yet. I appreciate
you bringing that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. (inaudible)
</P>
<P>
   A. ``I better not say anything about it, lest I be accused of
negative campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``Do you have an obligation as a leader to take a stand on
that kind of language?''
</P>
<P>
   A. ``He has an obligation as a potential leader to explain what
he meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Searching for news, the press corps daily lobs gentle pitches to
Bush in search of some condemnation that sounds like news. Bush
gamely swings at each lob, but he often takes a few tries before he
manages a hit worthy of the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a television reporter asked Bush if he thought
McCain should apologize for a phone campaign that Bush says
portrays him as ``an anti-Catholic bigot.'' Bush answered awkwardly
without using the word ``apology,'' so the reporter tried again.
And again. The third time, Bush finally said, yes, McCain should
apologize. And MSNBC reported this with an on-screen headline,
``Bush demands apology.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has tacked right and left in his campaign to
outmaneuver his rivals, it is striking how little he panders to
audiences. Speaking to workers who worry about imports, he warmly
recounts the benefits of free trade. Addressing wealthy Republicans
decked out in pearls, he speaks sympathetically about Mexican
immigrants and asserts that a single mother has ``the hardest job
in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Before lily-white audiences that might favor English as the
nation's official language, Bush occasionally drops a phrase in
Spanish. The audiences stare back in puzzled silence.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Bush comes across as the opposite of his father,
President George Bush, a cerebral, worldly man of great experience
who knew everything except how to be folksy. The younger Bush once
confessed that his greatest weakness is his lack of interest in
long books, especially those about policy, and that the only
statistics he seems to know involve baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is education policy, on which the governor speaks
with passion and confidence. In other areas he is being
home-schooled by experts, engaging in at least one conference call
a week with his foreign policy advisers and plowing through
briefing papers on major issues in states he will be visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also regularly reads The New York Times and two Texas
newspapers, plus clippings that his staff assemble from other
newspapers. But the contrast with Gore, who can recite statistics
about programs that Bush has probably barely heard of, is huge.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bush is a natural politician _ far more so
than the vice president _ with a down-home, one-of-the-guys charm
that puts people at ease. He loves the crowds, relishes the
limelight and invariably comes across to audiences as likable,
funny, sincere and decent.
</P>
<P>
   ``On TV, he used to come across as kind of stern,'' said Ken
DeWeber, a retired insurance agent who attended a Bush rally in
Pasco, Wash. ``But here he came across as the kind of guy you'd sit
on the river bank fishing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his loss to McCain in the New Hampshire primary, Bush
sometimes came across as cocky, lightweight and over-rehearsed.
Presidential campaigns are all a kind of theater, carefully
produced and directed in a frantic effort to seem as if they are
not, but Bush's appearances were particularly stage-managed, and
voters chafed at that.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, McCain's success has led Bush to redefine his
campaign themes _ sometimes appropriating McCain's, so that the
blue banner Bush now speaks in front of repeats the word
``reformer'' 43 times.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington state, who is co-chairwoman of
Bush's campaign in that state, said the primary battle was
ultimately helping Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''All this has a good bottom line,'' Dunn said. ``He's much
crisper and much better schooled on all the issues he's asked
about. This primary scuffle is good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush speaks without notes and often without much of a point,
telling audiences a bit about himself and his family in a folksy
way and raising a few issues like education, taxes and national
security. More than Gore, he knows how to be brief.
</P>
<P>
   After a rally in Ohio, a salesman named Bill Bertram said he
liked Bush's speech very much. Why? ``It was pretty short,''
Bertram replied enthusiastically. ``He just gave us the
highlights.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's early appearances were complicated by what his friends
described as a smile but what others saw as a smirk. Since then,
the smirk seems to have been surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   These days he frowns, smiles, laughs and even scowls, but he
does not normally smirk _ although occasionally he forgets himself
when he is in a good mood and it creeps back, only to be replaced
by a frown as soon as he notices it.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by journalists' praise for McCain as an accessible
candidate and envious of McCain's good relations with the news
media, Bush has begun his own charm offensive. Although he
sometimes gives the impression that he would prefer to pitch the
national press out of his campaign plane at 30,000 feet, he now
regularly puts on a smile _ not a smirk _ and comes to the back of
the plane to chat with journalists in an effort to win their hearts
and minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is fair to say that thanks to a contested
nomination,'' said Ari Fleischer, an aide to Bush, ``the governor
is going to be much stronger running against Al Gore in November.''

<P>
   Many years ago, I was asked whether I planned someday to write a
novel about Pinochet. No, I said, because as a character he was
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   I need to retract that statement: One can say anything about him
except that he is insignificant. Pinochet held Chile in his grip
for 25 years. A decade after he stepped down from the presidency,
the old dictator still held the democratic government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   But by now, even if Pinochet never faces a tribunal, justice has
been done. By pursuing the general, assembling a strong legal case
and issuing the request for his extradition to Spain, the Spanish
magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, achieved the salutary result of
Pinochet's moral ruin. A man who had the gall to pose as his
nation's savior will now take his place alongside Caligula and Idi
Amin.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1973, no one could have imagined a dictatorship in Chile,
a nation so proud of its democratic institutions that we Chileans
called ourselves ``the English'' of our continent. How, then, did
this soldier, never characterized by intelligence, culture or
courage, come to hold absolute power?
</P>
<P>
   Just as at a critical moment Adolf Hitler embodied the
frustrations and aspirations of millions of Germans, Pinochet led
Chile along a path that many wanted. Neither Hitler nor Pinochet
could have existed without the tacit or explicit consent of
millions of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has long stood as a symbol of brutality for the simple
reason that he was and always will be linked to Salvador Allende,
an icon of social justice in the early 1970s. Allende was the first
Marxist politician in the world to win the presidency of a country
in a free election.
</P>
<P>
   Allende was my father's cousin; in a Latin family, that made him
my uncle. I knew him well and loved him with a mixture of
admiration and anxiety. Although he was a kind man with a good
sense of humor, I always felt it was impossible to live up to his
standards and expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a physician, he was well acquainted with the needs of
the poor. He was a founder of the Socialist Party, and was
appointed secretary of health at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, after three failed attempts, Allende finally won the
presidency of Chile in a sharply divided election. He was a
minority president, having received only 36 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't his biggest problem. Immediately after the
election results were in, the CIA and the Chilean right began a
campaign of terror to prevent him from assuming his post as
president.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 11, the military coup took place that would leave a
profound mark on Chile's soul.
</P>
<P>
   That morning I had left my home early. The streets were
practically empty, but I saw military vehicles, tanks and groups of
heavily armed soldiers. I didn't have a radio and went to the house
of a friend nearby to listen to the news.
</P>
<P>
   She was very distressed. Her husband, a teacher, had gone to the
school where he taught and she had not heard from him. By then all
the radio stations, except one, had been silenced by the military.
</P>
<P>
   On the way downtown to pick up her husband, I witnessed the
bombing of La Moneda palace. I heard Allende's last words on my
friend's portable radio. She and I held hands crying as my uncle
calmly addressed the country with a historic speech that later
would be broadcast and published all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Having declared that he would never resign his office, he
refused to flee the country in a plane offered by the generals. It
was the right choice _ and not only because his heroic death
confirmed his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Had he accepted their offer to go into exile, we now know,
Pinochet would have murdered him during the flight. Instead,
Allende took his own life in the burning presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   Until just before the coup, Pinochet was an obscure Chilean army
general. He had been elevated to the rank of commander in chief of
the armed forces by Allende himself only three weeks before.
Pinochet had been recommended to Allende as a loyal soldier who
could be trusted to uphold the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The military junta Pinochet would soon command abolished the
Chilean Congress, muzzled the press, suspended constitutional
guarantees and began the systematic elimination of the left. The
right toasted with Champagne while leftists ran for their lives and
the rest of the population was dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet persecuted labor and student leaders, politicians,
intellectuals, artists and journalists, as well as all those who
were a part of the Allende government. The worst repression was
carried out against the lower classes, long viewed by the military
as a prime breeding ground for Marxism.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Chileans were arrested. Others found asylum in
embassies or escaped across the border, while many simply
disappeared. Torture centers and concentration camps were set up
throughout the country. Hundreds of prisoners were thrown from
planes into the sea _ after their bellies were slit open to make
sure that they would sink _ or blown to bits or plowed under by
bulldozers. Fear became a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Voices of protest were raised in most of the world, because the
socialist experiment of Allende had aroused great sympathy, but
Washington supported the dictatorship of Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   The general changed Chile's Constitution to designate himself
president. In early photographs he is wearing dark glasses, his
arms folded across his chest and his jaw thrust forward in a
caricature of the Latin American dictator. Later he modified his
image, wearing impeccable suits and shedding the sinister dark
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a Pinochet Foundation, dedicated to assuring his
place in history as the Chilean Napoleon who ``saved the country
from communism,'' a task that some ``pinochetistas'' claim was
assigned to him directly by God.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet is characterized by his cunning. (When a mass grave was
discovered with two bodies in each coffin, he said it was a good
way of saving nails.) He surrounded himself with the most
intelligent ideologues of the right. He transformed the economy of
Chile, moving from social democracy to the capitalism of Milton
Friedman, but with little of the freedom promised by the Chicago
School.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Pinochet, entrepreneurs and investors were in
paradise. They enjoyed the benefits of the free market but did not
have to deal with unions; workers were plentiful, cheap and
submissive. The state still intervened in the economy, but always
in favor of the capitalists. Greed became the new religion. Almost
everything was privatized, even hospitals and public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, this created an economic boom and the basis for
sustained progress, which is the main argument of those who defend
Pinochet. But they can't disregard the social costs.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's savage capitalist revolution came out of the hides of
the poor, who were supposed to be satisfied with the crumbs
trickling down from the wealthy. For the poorest of the poor, the
trickle-down never did occur. A third of Chile's 15 million
inhabitants still live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's supporters explain the torture, assassinations and
disappearances during his regime as a necessary evil in preventing
a civil war in 1973. That is preposterous. He remained as commander
in chief of the armed forces until 1998, when he had himself
declared senator for life. A law of amnesty granted him impunity
for all crimes committed during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   I feel no hatred for Pinochet. Hatred is a very heavy burden,
one I shook off many years ago, when I started writing. Writing has
allowed me to exorcise most of my demons and transform my pain into
strength. I would like to see Pinochet face a trial, so that the
truth about his crimes is fully exposed.
</P>
<P>
   But I wouldn't want the general to rot in prison, as so many of
his victims did. He has already suffered an undeniable defeat that
nothing can turn into victory. Even without a trial, in the eyes of
the world he is an alleged criminal, and moral censure can be worse
than prison.
</P>
<P>
   I merely wish that in the winter of his life the general would
ask forgiveness of all those whose lives he destroyed, the families
of the dead and disappeared, the exiled and tortured; that he would
reveal where the bodies of his victims can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Only then, with the recognition of past errors, will a true
reconciliation among Chileans begin.

   WASHINGTON _ The United States began sending search-and-rescue
teams and additional emergency supplies to Mozambique Thursday to
help deal with ravages caused by weeks of severe flooding in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid is expected to include about 500 people, five MH-53
cargo helicopters and five C-130 transport planes, according to
Capt. Bob Pritchard, a spokesman for the U.S. European Command in
Stuttgart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Ten military specialists from Europe are en route to Mozambique
to join a dozen others already there to determine the requirements
of the mission and the best way to carry it out, Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in a statement, ``All Americans have been
deeply moved by the tragic events in southern Africa,'' and he
applauded the governments in the region for working together to
address the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had already pledged $12.8 million for the
flood relief effort, including money for a special 14-member team
from the Miami-Dade Fire and Rescue Department to travel to
Mozambique. The team will be taking three inflatable rescue boats
and three small trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary mission will be rescuing people from the high
areas and taking them to the shelters,'' said Lt. Louie Fernandez,
a rescue team spokesman in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The MH-53 helicopters, which can carry about 38 people and have
infrared systems for operating at night, are suited for search and
rescue, said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The C-130 aircraft will be responsible for the in-flight
refueling of the helicopters, enabling them to travel much greater
distances, Bacon said. Most of the flood zone can be reached only
by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,400 blankets, 6,000 water cans and 160 rolls of plastic
sheeting to build emergency shelters have already been flown into
Mozambique by a U.S. C-17 aircraft. Those supplies, provided by the
U.S. Agency for International Development agency, were to be
distributed by the United Nations, the government of Mozambique and
the South African military.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid package also consists of $7 million in food, as
well as sandbags, shovels and wheelbarrows.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis is the result of several weeks of torrential rains
and floods that have killed more than 150 people in Mozambique,
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Botswana. Relief agencies
estimate that more than 1 million people have lost their homes or
livelihoods.

N.H. YOUTH ARRESTED IN ALLEGED WEB HACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Authorities raided the home of a Wolfeboro, N.H., youth who they
said admitted to intrusions on several Web sites in recent months
including one operated by RSA Security of Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was disclosed Thursday by the Los Angeles Police
Department, which said officers entered the home several weeks ago
as part of an investigation following attacks on a Web site
operated by the anti-drug organization DARE America in Inglewood,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles police spokesman said officers had arrested a
17-year-old male during the raid and that he had admitted to
defacing sites operated by DARE and a military organization, and to
interrupting service to a site operated by RSA.
</P>
<P>
   But federal law enforcement officials later said there had been
no arrests in connection with the incident, and the Los Angeles
police said they planned to issue a revised statement this morning.
They declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities also indicated that the youth, who used the
online screen name of ``coolio,'' was not considered a prime
suspect in an ongoing investigation of attacks on major
electronic-commerce companies last month.
</P>
<P>
   In those attacks, major sites _ including those operated by
Yahoo Inc., ETrade Inc. and Amazon.com _ were knocked off-line for
hours after receiving a string of messages simultaneously from
thousands of other computers via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are looking into the incidents but have made
no arrests so far. Los Angeles police said the FBI's field office
there assisted in its investigation of coolio, but FBI spokeswoman
Laura Bosley also said the New Hampshire youth didn't appear
connected to the broader attacks on e-commerce companies. ``We do
not anticipate filing any federal charges against this
individual,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and other officials, who declined to name the youth, would
not say if he would face any other charges.
</P>
<P>
   He was sought after DARE filed a complaint in November after its
antidrug Web site was twice defaced with pornographic images and
text supporting the legalization of certain drugs. In Bedford,
Mass., RSA also complained that traffic to its own Web site was
being diverted for a period last month to a ``spoof'' site that
parodied the company's statements.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfeboro police referred questions to the FBI and to Paul
Gagnon, US attorney in New Hampshire, whose office didn't return
calls seeking comment.

   WASHINGTON _ Negotiators from the House and the Senate, meeting
for the first time, said Thursday that they were optimistic about
their chances of cutting a deal on legislation that would establish
a wide range of new rights for patients and new duties for health
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton urged members of the conference committee to
reach a bipartisan agreement. Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
assistant Republican leader, said he hoped to do just that by the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to define patients' rights is already a hot political
issue, and will become hotter as this fall's elections approach. In
their meeting Thursday, Republicans and Democrats alike stressed
the areas of potential agreement, as if to defy skeptics who have
for months been predicting a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after being elected chairman of the conference
committee, Nickles said, ``My objective is to complete this
conference this month and have a bill passed by both houses of
Congress by Easter. We have a much better chance of passing good
legislation that's not so partisan, not so political, if we work
sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pep rally Thursday at the White House, with a handful of
Republican members of Congress, Clinton said opinion polls showed
that ``well over 70 percent of all Americans, without regard to
their political party, support a strong, enforceable patient's bill
of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the House bill, drafted by Reps. Charlie
Norwood, a Georgia Republican, and John D. Dingell, a Michigan
Democrat, was his benchmark for acceptable legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the Norwood-Dingell bill by a vote of 275 to
151 on Oct. 7, as 68 Republicans defied their party leaders and
supported it. The Senate passed its version, which provides
protection to fewer people, on July 15 by a vote of 53-47. All 45
Democratic senators voted against that version of the legislation,
saying it was largely a sham because many of its protections would
apply to fewer than one-third of the 161 million people covered by
the House bill.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood, a dentist, is not a member of the conference committee.
He stood in a corner, watching the committee as it met. He said he
believed a ``reasonable compromise'' could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they felt they were in a strong negotiating
position, because the House bill, unlike the Senate bill, had
bipartisan support. Moreover, Democratic conferees said they were
pleased that Republicans were now talking to them about the
substance of the legislation. In the last five years, many
important bills have been written behind closed doors by
Republicans, with a minimal role for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's session, an aide to a Democratic member of
Congress said, ``This has the feel of a real conference, such as we
haven't had around here in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The conferees appear to have devised an ingenious way of
proceeding. First, they will seek agreement on the substance of
proposed new rights for patients. Then they will discuss the more
difficult questions of who should have those rights _ the ``scope''
of the bill _ and how the rights should be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles said the conferees were ``very close to agreement'' on
guaranteeing coverage for emergency medical care and allowing
patients to visit pediatricians, obstetricians and gynecologists
without getting a referral from another doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles said the House and Senate bills were also similar in
that they would guarantee timely access to certain specialists;
allow doctors to discuss all treatment options with patients; allow
patients to continue receiving care from a doctor dropped from
their health plan; and give cancer patients greater access to
clinical trials of promising new treatments.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the protections
provided by the Senate bill were, in nearly all cases, weaker than
the comparable provisions of the House bill, which he strongly
prefers. ``The Senate bill excludes more than two-thirds of
privately insured Americans from most of its protections, and it
leaves out almost every citizen who belongs to a health maintenance
organization,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, unlike the Senate bill, would expand the right
of patients to sue HMOs and other health plans for injuries caused
by the delay or denial of care. Democrats see such a provision as
essential, and in recent weeks, Republican leaders of the House and
the Senate have expressed a new willingness to consider the idea,
as a way to make health insurers more accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who was at the White House on
Thursday, said the question of liability was ``the key point'' that
must be resolved. ``It's very unpopular to advocate letting people
go to court, but you have to do that,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate bills would both require HMOs to establish
appeal procedures, so patients could appeal the denial of benefits
to an independent panel of medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans said they had limited the scope of their bill
because they did not want to usurp the states' authority to
regulate health insurance. In general, they said, states have done
a good job of regulating.

RIVAL BIDS FOR AETNA UNLIKELY, ANALYSTS SAY

<P>
   Investors bought up shares of Aetna Inc. again Thursday, but the
buying spree slowed as it became apparent that rival bidders were
unlikely to emerge to a $9.9 billion purchase offer Aetna announced
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said it had received the purchase offer from ING America
Insurance Holdings, a financial services company, and WellPoint
Health Networks, a California-based national managed care company.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said the bid of about $44 a share in cash
and $26 a share in WellPoint stock was not supposed to leak to the
public and posed considerable risk for Aetna shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there are other bidders, Aetna will have to choose
between negotiations with WellPoint and ING, a unit of ING Group,
and trying to solve its formidable problems internally.
</P>
<P>
   ``All WellPoint wants is an opportunity to look,'' said Todd
Richter, an analyst at Banc of America Securities. ``If Aetna's
business looks worse than they expected, and they decide to back
off from the price, it could be devastating for Aetna
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint has grown through careful acquisitions of businesses
like the health care units of Massachusetts Mutual and John Hancock
life insurance companies. Usually WellPoint negotiates prices that
analysts say are on the low side.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Aetna rose $2.8125, or 5.3 percent, to $55.8125
Thursday. Earlier, the stock peaked at $61.875 _ briefly a 50
percent gain in two days. WellPoint, which dropped $5.625 on
Tuesday, fell Thursday by $1.125, to $60.75.
</P>
<P>
   William McKeever, an analyst at PaineWebber Securities, said
there was only a remote chance that another bidder would emerge.
The other big, financially solid health insurance companies, United
Healthcare and Cigna, do not seem interested.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna has shown little interest in big acquisitions, and a
merger with Aetna would immediately raise antitrust issues, Richter
added. And United has been investing in lines of business that do
not entail taking the risk for delivering care at an agreed price
as health maintenance organizations do.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the 21 million people covered by Aetna are
in HMOs. Most of the rest have access to physician and hospital
discount networks that are paid on a fee-for-service basis, or else
they have traditional insurance with few restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint, a medium-size insurer with 7.3 million subscribers,
has also emphasized these less risky networks. WellPoint's strategy
is ``giving consumers what they want: choice in the selection of
their health plans,'' Leonard Schaeffer, chief executive of
WellPoint, said last month.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer, who made his reputation by turning around Blue Cross
of California when it had heavy losses, ``really understands how
the business operates,'' said Helen Darling, a managed care expert
at the Watson Wyatt consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   More than three years after its purchase of U.S. Healthcare,
Aetna still has not fully integrated that unit with its other
health-care lines, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ING, a worldwide financial services and insurance company based
in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, has said it was ready to spend
heavily to increase its presence in the United States. As outlined
in the offer, it would take Aetna's profitable pension and group
life insurance units, and WellPoint would get the health care
units.

HMO'S WOES EASING, REGULATORS TAKE HANDS-OFF APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK AND RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rejecting all proposals from outside investors because
they came with too many strings attatched, state regulators said
they will rely on clever accounting and faith to keep Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care an independent nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months after forcing the state's largest HMO into state
receivership and touching off a regional healthcare crisis,
Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly said Thursday that the Harvard
Pilgrim's financial condition had improved dramatically in January
and February, infusing the HMO with $200 million in available cash.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected turnaround, coupled with the fact that potential
investors and buyers were demanding unappetizing conditions,
convinced regulators that Harvard Pilgrim is a ``going concern''
that can continue to operate without new cash, a taxpayer bailout,
or court oversight, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly and Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt next week will
ask the Supreme Judicial Court to take the HMO out of receivership
and approve a long-term rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
   A key component of the rehabilitation plan are a pair of
accounting maneuvers that, if approved after a public hearing, will
allow receivers to instantly increase Harvard Pilgrim's net worth
from a negative $88 million to $178 million in the black.
</P>
<P>
   They will do this by bringing up to market value the plan's 14
health centers, much the way homeowners reassess their property,
and by subordinating the HMO's bond debt _ in other words taking it
off the books as a liability. A new law passed by the legislature
in November gives HMO receivers the power to restructure debt in
this way.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said they are working out other details of the plan, but
that he and Ruthardt would continue to monitor Harvard Pilgrim's
operations under a more lenient term than receivership called ``
``administrative order.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden confidence on Harvard Pilgrim's future prompted some
to ask whether receivership was every necessary or was brought on
by panic. Reilly said without the receivership, Harvard Pilgrim
would not have been able to ward off creditors, stop hospitals and
doctors from breaking contracts and regulators could not have
subordinated the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly announced the unexpected plan, which he said
``crystallized'' for him over the weekend, in a private meeting
with hospital executives, patient representatives and officials
from the managed care industry; he then released details in a press
conference called by Governor Paul Cellucci, who has faced
criticism for not taking a public role in guiding the state through
the Harvard Pilgrim crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnaround plan is working; Harvard Pilgrim's financial
situation is turning around,'' said Cellucci, who partly credited
loyal subscribers. ``I can't emphasize enough how important it was
that people did not panic. This will take Harvard Pilgrim off the
critical list.``
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement, it was difficult to find even one critic
of Reilly's new plan, which at least for now will save Harvard
Pilgrim and its 1.1 million members from the disruption caused by
liquidation or purchase by a large out-of-state insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   But the crucial test will come in April, when the next wave of
Massachusetts employers will decide whether to stick by Harvard
Pilgrim or switch their employees to other health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether employers will remain faithful to the state's
largest HMO, Rick Lord of the Associated Industries of
Massachusetts, said ``I think so, yeah, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt comfortable with the explanation I heard,'' said Lord,
who represents a trade group of manufacturers. ``In January and
February HP was actually making money. That's a very positive
signal that this is a viable entity going forward. There's a sense
of relief out there among the employers I talked to.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said that the other options were just too worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals had considered lending Harvard Pilgrim money through a
mechanism called ``surplus notes'' but regulators feared that
option would unduly burden hospitals, many of which are already
losing money. Hospitals also demanded that the state guarantee the
loans in case Harvard Pilgrim ultimately failed, a precedent that
Reilly called bad public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University also insisted that the state guarantee its
investment in the HMO and rejected a request by regulators to
itself guarantee investments made by other parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard was adamant, they were not going to participate
without state guarantees,'' he said. ``Well, that's a deal-breaker,
we weren't going to give it to them...End of story.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly complimented Ross Perot, owner of Perot Systems, the
company that is rebuilding Harvard Pilgrim's computer system, who
agreed to lend Harvard $75 million without a state guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said that several for-profit companies showed
considerable interest, but that he feared those companies would
hurt small hospitals and doctors' groups by slashing rates and that
they would not honor debt owed by Harvard to bond holders.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also had a legal requirement to tell the court that
there was no viable nonprofit option before selling Harvard Pilgrim
to a stock-based company.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiations with the hospitals, Harvard University and
Perot were going on, ``we got better information on (Harvard
Pilgrim's) performance and more lengthy information on the cash
status and we realized, `Wait a minute, we don't have to cave in
and we don't have to give away the store. We have another option
presenting itself.'
</P>
<P>
   He said that the team of regulators and advisors had been
thinking about giving Harvard Pilgrim more time to recover, when
two professors from Harvard School of Public Health and Boston
University School of Public Health suggested that approach at an
advisory committee meeting last Friday. Reilly said ``we needed
hard data and analysis and we got that (Thursday).''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis revealed that Harvard Pilgrim is paying bills to
hospitals and doctors, that it has set aside $200 million in cash
since Jan. 1 because it raised premiums and closed down
money-losing operations in Rhode Island, and that it has paid $200
million in pre-receivership debt to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts Harvard Pilgrim will be profitable next year.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said he does not know when regulators will lift the
administrative order. ``It certainly would not be lifted until HPHC
is fully restored to financial health,'' he said. ``That would
include profitability and financial reserves.''

COMMENTARY: SAGA OF AN ONLINE PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago I wrote a column about Lyle Bowlin, a professor of
small business in Cedar Falls, Iowa, who had started his own online
bookstore out of his living room. I used his story to illustrate
the low barriers to entry for those wanting to compete on the
Internet, even against Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   After the column ran, Bowlin's book site _ Positively-You.com _
was inundated with business and e-mail from moms and pops
interested in starting e-businesses _ so much traffic it blew out
his computer server. Thus inspired, Bowlin took a leave from
teaching, raised $90,000, rented office space, hired employees, and
decided to  &UR; really &LR;  try to compete with Amazon. Positively-you's
cachet was that it donated 10 percent of the profit of every book
you bought to the charity of your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this fair-e-tale, which I helped midwife, came to an end a
few weeks ago when Bowlin went out of business. His experience
taught him (and me) several lessons about e-commerce:
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 1: Trying to be a mid-size pure-Internet company is
really, really hard. Small is OK. Big is OK. Medium is tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gotten a big burst of free advertising from all the
stories about us, and that drove a lot of our early business,''
explained Bowlin. ``We could not afford to advertise ourselves. Our
plan was to approach large nonprofit foundations and encourage them
to buy books from us and get the donations. But they took too long
to throw business our way. In the meantime, our free advertising
from news stories dried up. Then, when our business grew from $500
a month to $48,500 a month, the bank we were using to manage our
credit card sales held back payments to us for 60 days. We had
gotten so big so fast they were worried that we wouldn't be able to
deliver the books, and they would get stuck with a lot of angry
card holders. So our costs went up, while the cash flow and free
advertising slowed down, and it was hard to raise more venture
capital to buy advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   People will throw money at Amazon _ on the bet that it will one
day dominate the whole world _ but they won't throw it at a
medium-size company on the bet that it will be 10th in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 2: Bowlin's experience perfectly illustrates the ``Vardi
paradox.'' Yossi Vardi is the granddaddy of Israel's Internet
industry. He achieved fame and fortune by backing his son and three
friends in founding Mirabilis _ better known as ICQ, better known
as instant messaging on the Internet. ICQ became a hugely valuable
company, because its popular service spread entirely by word of
mouth, without ICQ ever spending a dime on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Vardi paradox states: ``The value of any Web site is in
inverse relation to what it costs to attract new users.'' The
biggest cost for most e-commerce sites is ads, so the more people
come for free the more valuable your site.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 3: The barriers to entry into any Internet business
really are low _ ``as long as you want to remain a small niche
player, or as long as you can get free advertising,'' says Bowlin.
But, as his own case teaches, while it's easy to &UR; compete &LR;  with
Amazon.com if you remain small, it's not so easy to &UR; be &LR;  Amazon.com.
if you want to get big. That takes big dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 4: The only way to learn the e-business is to be an
e-business. Said Lori McConville, the advertising exec who was
Bowlin's main partner: ``We learned by doing. The textbooks can't
teach e-commerce fast enough. I got an education money couldn't buy
_ well, actually, I did pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 5: Don't sell Main Street short. The success ratio of the
real store that adds the Internet to its real business may be much
higher in the long run than those who try a pure Internet store.
The reason, says Bowlin, ``is that the established store has loyal
customers, and all you are doing with the Web is making it easier
for them to spend, even if they move away. But when you are a pure
Internet store, you're always buying customers, rather than having
a customer who has already bought into you'' _ and there is always
someone who will buy your customers for more, just one click away.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 6: Owning an e-commerce site doesn't mean you've married
a millionaire. ``Everyone assumed that I got rich, and in hindsight
my net worth is down from a year ago,'' said Bowlin. ``I wouldn't
trade the experience for the world. But I'm going back to teaching
now _ with a lot more knowledge of e-commerce to share with my
students.''

COMMENTARY: A NEW YORK MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What with all the primaries next Tuesday, I've been a little
worried that New York would be robbed of its traditional role in
the presidential selection process. Which is, of course, to torture
and humiliate the candidates until they beg for mercy or rethink
their career goals.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, South Carolina is the first place that Republicans go to
behave badly. But when it comes to having things done  &UR; to &LR;  you, the
Big Apple is still top of the heap. You can wake up in the city
that never sleeps and find yourself on the front page of every
tabloid in town, with your comb-over blowing in the breeze or your
mouth gaping like the village idiot. Total strangers will suddenly
take it into their heads to follow you around, hollering insults.
You may blurt out the most outlandish things, and if you don't,
your local supporters will say them for you.
</P>
<P>
   Like California and all the other March 7 states, New York is
pretty much resigned to the idea that this year's Democratic
primary is not going to be any fun. When Al Gore turned to Bill
Bradley early in this week's debate and said, ``I think that's a
very fine statement,'' you knew Bradley was flirting with the
single digits.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans are working themselves into a real New
York-quality snit. George W. Bush's team has been running ads
suggesting that John McCain doesn't support breast cancer research
because he objected when our legislators siphoned off money for
projects at two local hospitals. The senator says he is, in
principle, against politicians doing an end run around the
appropriations process to get special stuff for their districts.
New Yorkers obviously agree, except that in this instance the end
run wound up working to our advantage and therefore constitutes a
special case.
</P>
<P>
   McCain demanded that Bush ``get out of the gutter,'' and sniped
at the Texas governor's environmental record _ I believe the
adjective in question was ``awful.''
</P>
<P>
   This campaign must be driving the Republicans crazy. If Bush is
the nominee, Democrats will have tapes of McCain saying he's a big
spender who consorts with bigots and screws up the environment. All
the Republicans will have is endless footage of Bradley muttering,
``Al Gore is really more conservative than you might think.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the candidates are not spending much time on the East
Coast, we were particularly excited when Bush agreed to appear on
the David Letterman show Wednesday night and be humiliated via
satellite. Thanks to the virtues of modern technology, candidates
don't have to be in Gotham to experience a New York crash-and-burn.
They can beam it in.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find the right words to describe Bush's appearance
except to say that you generally find this level of performance on
a talk show only when the guest is a troubled actress facing a
midlife crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``A uniter, not a divider _ what exactly does that mean?'' asked
the host.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the time comes to sew up your chest cavity, we use
stitches as opposed to opening it up. That's what that means,''
replied the guest, exhibiting the complete repertoire of his least
attractive expressions _ the smirk, the nervously darting eyes,
that trapped look that always makes Bush resemble a small mammal in
distress.
</P>
<P>
   A skill at guesting on late-night television has become a
critical requirement for the presidential candidate of the 21st
century, right up there with pretending to like surfing the
Internet. These programs have become such a critical part of our
political culture that the Center for Media and Public Affairs has
an ongoing project counting the jokes told about the candidates.
Bush was the presidential candidate most frequently made fun of
over the last year, the object of 293 late-night sallies, followed
by 275 for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about foibles and foul-ups and physiques,'' said Bob
Lichter, the center's president. ``But there aren't many fat jokes
since Clinton lost weight and Gingrich left the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you understand now, people, why Al Gore is in his cabin doing
stomach crunches while he flies around campaigning? A health plan
is all well and good, but nobody is going to listen to policy from
a guy with flabby abs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by the way, is going to visit Jay Leno on the eve of next
week's primary. It's bound to go well. The interview is live, and
it's not in New York.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Rejecting all proposals from outside investors because
they came with too many strings attatched, state regulators said
they will rely on clever accounting and faith to keep Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care an independent nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months after forcing the state's largest HMO into state
receivership and touching off a regional healthcare crisis,
Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly said Thursday that the Harvard
Pilgrim's financial condition had improved dramatically in January
and February, infusing the HMO with $200 million in available cash.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected turnaround, coupled with the fact that potential
investors and buyers were demanding unappetizing conditions,
convinced regulators that Harvard Pilgrim is a ``going concern''
that can continue to operate without new cash, a taxpayer bailout,
or court oversight, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly and Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt next week will
ask the Supreme Judicial Court to take the HMO out of receivership
and approve a long-term rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
   A key component of the rehabilitation plan are a pair of
accounting maneuvers that, if approved after a public hearing, will
allow receivers to instantly increase Harvard Pilgrim's net worth
from a negative $88 million to $178 million in the black.
</P>
<P>
   They will do this by bringing up to market value the plan's 14
health centers, much the way homeowners reassess their property,
and by subordinating the HMO's bond debt _ in other words taking it
off the books as a liability. A new law passed by the legislature
in November gives HMO receivers the power to restructure debt in
this way.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said they are working out other details of the plan, but
that he and Ruthardt would continue to monitor Harvard Pilgrim's
operations under a more lenient term than receivership called ``
``administrative order.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden confidence on Harvard Pilgrim's future prompted some
to ask whether receivership was every necessary or was brought on
by panic. Reilly said without the receivership, Harvard Pilgrim
would not have been able to ward off creditors, stop hospitals and
doctors from breaking contracts and regulators could not have
subordinated the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly announced the unexpected plan, which he said
``crystallized'' for him over the weekend, in a private meeting
with hospital executives, patient representatives and officials
from the managed care industry; he then released details in a press
conference called by Governor Paul Cellucci, who has faced
criticism for not taking a public role in guiding the state through
the Harvard Pilgrim crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnaround plan is working; Harvard Pilgrim's financial
situation is turning around,'' said Cellucci, who partly credited
loyal subscribers. ``I can't emphasize enough how important it was
that people did not panic. This will take Harvard Pilgrim off the
critical list.``
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement, it was difficult to find even one critic
of Reilly's new plan, which at least for now will save Harvard
Pilgrim and its 1.1 million members from the disruption caused by
liquidation or purchase by a large out-of-state insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   But the crucial test will come in April, when the next wave of
Massachusetts employers will decide whether to stick by Harvard
Pilgrim or switch their employees to other health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether employers will remain faithful to the state's
largest HMO, Rick Lord of the Associated Industries of
Massachusetts, said ``I think so, yeah, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt comfortable with the explanation I heard,'' said Lord,
who represents a trade group of manufacturers. ``In January and
February HP was actually making money. That's a very positive
signal that this is a viable entity going forward. There's a sense
of relief out there among the employers I talked to.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said that the other options were just too worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals had considered lending Harvard Pilgrim money through a
mechanism called ``surplus notes'' but regulators feared that
option would unduly burden hospitals, many of which are already
losing money. Hospitals also demanded that the state guarantee the
loans in case Harvard Pilgrim ultimately failed, a precedent that
Reilly called bad public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University also insisted that the state guarantee its
investment in the HMO and rejected a request by regulators to
itself guarantee investments made by other parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard was adamant, they were not going to participate
without state guarantees,'' he said. ``Well, that's a deal-breaker,
we weren't going to give it to them...End of story.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly complimented Ross Perot, owner of Perot Systems, the
company that is rebuilding Harvard Pilgrim's computer system, who
agreed to lend Harvard $75 million without a state guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said that several for-profit companies showed
considerable interest, but that he feared those companies would
hurt small hospitals and doctors' groups by slashing rates and that
they would not honor debt owed by Harvard to bond holders.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also had a legal requirement to tell the court that
there was no viable nonprofit option before selling Harvard Pilgrim
to a stock-based company.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiations with the hospitals, Harvard University and
Perot were going on, ``we got better information on (Harvard
Pilgrim's) performance and more lengthy information on the cash
status and we realized, `Wait a minute, we don't have to cave in
and we don't have to give away the store. We have another option
presenting itself.'
</P>
<P>
   He said that the team of regulators and advisors had been
thinking about giving Harvard Pilgrim more time to recover, when
two professors from Harvard School of Public Health and Boston
University School of Public Health suggested that approach at an
advisory committee meeting last Friday. Reilly said ``we needed
hard data and analysis and we got that (Thursday).''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis revealed that Harvard Pilgrim is paying bills to
hospitals and doctors, that it has set aside $200 million in cash
since Jan. 1 because it raised premiums and closed down
money-losing operations in Rhode Island, and that it has paid $200
million in pre-receivership debt to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts Harvard Pilgrim will be profitable next year.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said he does not know when regulators will lift the
administrative order. ``It certainly would not be lifted until HPHC
is fully restored to financial health,'' he said. ``That would
include profitability and financial reserves.''

BALLOONIST NEARLY HALFWAY THROUGH A SOLO TRIP AROUND THE WORLD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Ariz., India, China, Switzerland, England, Egypt)   By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Arizona man trying to become the first solo balloonist to
complete a nonstop trip around the world was speeding over India
Thursday, hoping to steer clear of the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Kevin Uliassi, was nearly halfway through his
journey, which began in Rockford, Ill., on Feb. 22. After some slow
going in the early days of the flight, Uliassi's balloon, the J.
Renee, found better winds and at midweek was traveling at about 100
miles an hour, said Scott Lorenz, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to fly south of the Himalayas,'' Lorenz said from
the mission's headquarters in Homewood, Ill., near Chicago. ``Right
now it looks like he'll be able to do that.'' Uliassi was flying at
31,000 feet, not much higher than Mt. Everest, and was anticipating
thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi has permission to fly over China, which he is expected
to do in the next several days before heading out over the Pacific.
He packed enough fuel for about 20 days, Lorenz said, and thinks he
has enough to complete his trip.
</P>
<P>
   Should Uliassi do so, landing east of Rockford, he would be the
third balloonist to circumnavigate the world nonstop. The first
two, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of Britain,
completed a 20-day trip together last March, ending in the Egyptian
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Like those two, Uliassi is flying a hybrid balloon called a
Rozier type, which uses two huge sealed nylon bags, one containing
helium and the other air. The air, heated by propane burners, keeps
the helium from contracting at night, helping the balloon to
maintain altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Piccard and Jones, though, Uliassi is flying in an
unpressurized crew compartment. He has spent most of the trip with
an oxygen mask strapped on his face, and wears a sensor on a finger
that will sound an alarm if the level of oxygen in his blood gets
too low.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi is well rested, Lorenz said, and in good spirits despite
the cramped conditions and thunderstorms over Egypt that bounced
the craft up and down. He communicates with his volunteer support
team by e-mail and satellite phone.
</P>
<P>
   This is Uliassi's second attempt to fly around the world. The
first, in 1997, ended several hours after liftoff when his balloon
burst.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi, a mechanical engineer, designed the 140-foot balloon
with some assistance from his wife, after whom it is named. In
particular, she helped him with the crew compartment, marking the
dimensions around him as he lay on the floor of their Scottsdale
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had it to do all over again,'' Lorenz said, ``he'd build
it one foot bigger all the way around.''

   The arrest and detention of Augusto Pinochet served a purpose,
far beyond warming the hearts of the thousands of friends,
relatives and colleagues of his victims _ men and women who had
waited nearly a quarter of a century for justice and solace.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its ethical and legal implications, the dictator's
detention revealed many of the contradictions and deeper truths
about how societies move from authoritarian to democratic rule, and
how they settle scores with a past that never should have existed.
</P>
<P>
   Both in general and in specific reference to Chile, Pinochet's
predicament raised far more questions than answers _ questions that
years ago should have been asked in Chile and Latin America, and in
countries as dissimilar as Mexico and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called transitions to democracy in Latin America during
the 1980s, in eastern Europe in the late '80s and early '90s, as
well as in Asia and Africa, all rested on a few basic premises that
at the time seemed self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   Dictatorships do not just fade away; military rulers do not
simply walk into the sun when they get bored or tired. Achieving
their departure and the overall dismantling of their regimes, as of
one-party systems, implied providing them with a way out: a safe
departure, to a safe haven, for a safe future.
</P>
<P>
   On some occasions, the political golden handshake of amnesty or
tacitly letting bygones be bygones was accompanied by a desire to
know, if not to punish. Truth Commissions, Never Again Commissions,
White Books and the like were created and supported.
</P>
<P>
   But the understanding always was that the personal safety and
financial integrity of the dictators remain protected and that
details of their policies _ economic in some cases, geopolitical in
others _ be preserved by their democratic successors.
</P>
<P>
   This was the deal in Chile, in Argentina, in Uruguay, in a
certain sense initially in Nicaragua, in South Korea, South Africa
and even in some places in eastern Europe. It was formal and
institutionalized in some cases, de facto in others, but it made
democracy possible. It seemed a small price to pay, a pill not too
bitter to swallow, a necessary and sufficient condition for moving
on.
</P>
<P>
   But too many questions simply went unanswered. Who made the
deals? With whom did the political leaders consult? How freely did
the leaders and the led consent to the agreements and how well
informed were the countries' citizens?
</P>
<P>
   Would the arrangements withstand international and historical
scrutiny, particularly of a passionate and critical nature? Would
the amnesties resist the test of time, further investigations and
new revelations?
</P>
<P>
   In Chile and elsewhere, many had believed, sincerely, that the
best solution was to bury the past, to leave the dead where they
were and the fat bank accounts unexposed _ and move forward. Others
felt that some degree of accountability and punishment was
indispensable to ensure that impunity cease being a leitmotif of
routine political life.
</P>
<P>
   But who really knows the cost of either option: whether
forgiving and forgetting is possible, or if burrowing into the past
is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, the conventional wisdom about Chile was simple. At
last, moderation and sensibility had prevailed, national
reconciliation had been achieved, successful economic policies had
been pursued. The past decades of revolutionary turmoil and bloody
repression had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Today we know that while Chile is a more prosperous nation than
before, it is as unequal in wealth and income distribution as ever,
and the polarization of its society is as acute as 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the country's left, and center, and sympathizers and allies,
as well as for much of international public opinion, Pinochet is
the personification of evil: The man with the dark glasses is as
bad as they come. Yet for a large minority of the population, he
remains the saviour of a nation threatened by heathen communism and
inflationary socialism.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably preferable for Chileans to have uncovered this
split of opinion, and for the rest of the world to grasp that
dealing with the past is a very complicated matter, and that easy
solutions, as brisk and painless as they may seem, generally do not
work.
</P>
<P>
   We can thank the dictator for this, but for nothing else.

 &HT;    A day of healing for Rocker
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ John Rocker's locker was back where it's been
the past two years in the Braves clubhouse at Disney, beside that
of fellow reliever Rudy Seanez. Rocker played a little long toss in
the outfield, threw a side session in the bullpen, then worked out
in the weight room afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But his day was anything but usual.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' 25-year-old closer, who alienated himself from
several segments of society _ and his own clubhouse _ with hateful
comments in a Sports Illustrated story, faced his teammates as a
group for the first time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was given permission a day earlier by baseball arbitrator
Shyam Das to rejoin the team. Das reduced his suspension to 12
games and slashed his fine to $500. By Thursday, Rocker was trying
to mend his relationships with teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really good,'' Rocker said about a 30-minute,
closed-door team meeting. ``It was actually much better than I
thought it would be. This is my third year ... and I've always had
good relationships with 95 percent of the guys. Those guys treated
me just like they always have, and it went really well. My buddies
like Rudy (Seanez) and Mike Remlinger, Javy (Lopez) and Eddie
(Perez) _ it was the same greeting I got when I walked in the
clubhouse, say, last August.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker apologized to Randall Simon, whom he referred to as a
``fat monkey'' in the article; Ozzie Guillen, whom he criticized
for not making a play behind him in the National League
Championship Series; and Brian Jordan, who after the story came out
initially called for Rocker to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker asked Simon to go to lunch after the game Thursday, which
Simon said he planned to do, with his wife, Jadira.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at him in the face, and he showed me that he really
meant that he regretted what he said,'' Simon said. ``I saw right
in his eyes (that) it was sad to be standing in front of him
because of what he said about me. ... I really accepted his
apology. I forgive him for what he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen said he interrupted Rocker's apology. ``He thought he
hurt my feelings,'' Guillen said. ``I said, `I've heard worse
before.' I told him to be the same guy he's always been. He's my
teammate, and I support him 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting, Rocker took the floor first. He was followed by
Bobby Cox, Tom Glavine, Jordan, Simon, newcomer Reggie Sanders and
third base coach Ned Yost.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're giving John Rocker the greatest opportunity in the
world to turn this around,'' Cox said. ``They were terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most poignant questions was posed by Yost, who asked
Rocker, ``Are you going to change or are you just going to stay the
same?''
</P>
<P>
   Players said privately they were upset that Rocker had decided
not to answer questions in his morning news conference. He chose
instead to read his statement, which had been published in The
Atlanta Constitution on Thursday. By the afternoon, Rocker had
agreed to meet a smaller number of reporters, who conducted a
five-minute interview in the clubhouse after he kept them waiting
for 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who met with Rocker privately and said he plans to
again, said he encouraged Rocker to face the situation head on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed some remorse,'' Jordan said. ``It was almost like he
might tear up a little bit. He's trying to be strong about it. ...
I feel sorry for him. I know he was really sincere as far as
feeling sorry about the pain and attention he's brought to the
team. It's a lesson he has to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones said: ``All you guys want to see him break down
and cry and show all this emotion. That's not John. For those of us
who know John the way we do, we know he was a little more humble
when he walked in the clubhouse today. ... I think we all came away
satisfied for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan went so far as to say that it ``would be cowardly act''
for the Braves to trade Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and his teammates do expect some changes in Rocker,
something Rocker said he accepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will have to grow up a little bit and find different ways to
deal with frustration from not being perfect all the time,'' Rocker
said. ``I just turned 25 a couple months ago. I think people are
expecting me to be more mature way beyond my years just because of
the position I'm in. I've just got a little bit of growing up to
do. I don't think it'll be a problem.''

<P>
   Continuing a wave of enthusiasm for companies involved in the
Internet and wireless communications, investors snapped up shares
Thursday of Palm Inc., the maker of the popular Palm Pilot handheld
devices.
</P>
<P>
   The shares traded as high as $165, more than four times the
offering price of $38, before retreating to slightly more than $95.
</P>
<P>
   At that price, the market is valuing Palm at $53.3. billion, far
more than the value of its parent, the 3Com Corp., which still owns
most of the company. Palm's market value is higher than that of
many far larger companies, including Ford Motor, General Motors,
Chevron and McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring price for Palm partly reflected the fact that less
than 5 percent of the outstanding shares in Palm were available for
trading, far from enough to satisfy investor demand. Nonetheless,
the resulting trading produced prices that appeared ridiculous,
leaving 3Com valued at $28 billion, a figure that is $23 billion
less than the value of its holdings in Palm.
</P>
<P>
   ``3Com owns 94 percent of Palm, and the non-Palm part of 3Com is
worth something,'' Eric A. Benhamou, chairman and chief executive
of 3Com, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that will get corrected,'' he said of the
market value. ``We think the result is that 3Com has a very bright
future, with a complete focus on the networking business and much
more financial resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks ago, before expectations for the Palm offering
started to grow, 3Com shares were trading at about $50. Thursday,
they opened at $117, nearly $13 higher than the closing price the
day before. But they soon began to fall, ending the day down
$22.3125, at $81.8125.
</P>
<P>
   At Palm, the wild success of the offering, which was originally
filed to be offered at $14 to $16 a share and was then raised to
$38 amid heavy demand, brought joy. ``We're just exhilarated at the
confidence it gives us about our direction,'' said Carl J.
Yankowski, the company's chief executive. ``It's an ecstatic
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are based in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 12 months, Palm accounted for just 13 percent of
3Com's revenue and a slightly larger proportion of the company's
profits. But Palm's revenue and profits have been growing rapidly,
while revenue has declined recently at 3Com's other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The valuation disparity was particularly acute because 3Com has
said that it intends to distribute its remaining shares in Palm to
its own shareholders, assuming it gets a favorable tax ruling. An
owner of 3Com shares is expected to get more than one share of Palm
for each share of 3Com held, yet Palm's per-share price is higher
than that of 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   Palm's being valued at nearly twice as much as its parent
company is not likely to endure long. Many investors have made a
habit of piling into hot new issues, regardless of valuation
concerns. Over time, the shares of Palm could fall or 3Com could
rise, or both.
</P>
<P>
   The situation would seem to invite arbitragers, who make money
on price differences between securities or currencies, to buy
shares of 3Com and sell shares of Palm short. In short-selling,
investors borrow shares and then bet that the price will fall,
enabling them to return the shares at a lower price and pocket the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   With a new stock like Palm, however, it can be difficult to find
shares to borrow, limiting the ability to sell them short.
</P>
<P>
   The first minute of Nasdaq trading in initial public offerings
is often chaotic, but Palm's debut was unusually so as different
market makers charged wildly different prices to their customers.
Within the first 60 seconds of trading, shares were traded at
prices ranging from $135 to $165. As the day wore on, however, the
price fell. Nearly all those who bought in the open market _ as
opposed to those who got in on the offering before trading began _
paid more than Thursday's closing price of $95.0625.
</P>
<P>
   For now at least, Palm is the undisputed gorilla of handheld
computing devices, also known as personal digital assistants, or
PDAs. Palm has a 68 percent market share, despite the best efforts
of the Microsoft Corp. and its hardware partners using the Windows
CE operating system. 3Com, in comparison, is a distant second place
in the networking market to Cisco Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Palm also benefited from the current obsession with the Internet
and wireless connectivity, even though only one of its current
products, the Palm VII, offers such features and only in a limited
fashion. The paradox is that even though 3Com is the No. 2 player
in networking equipment, it is a bigger participant in the buildup
of the World Wide Web. Most people connected to the Web are using a
3Com modem or network interface card.

</P>
<P>
   But Thursday clearly belonged to Palm. Analysts said Palm had
all the sizzle of an Internet start-up plus a real business with
revenue, earnings and a popular product. With more than 5.5 million
Palm organizers sold, there is a good chance investors own one or
know several people who own them. Palm has a gilt-edged list of
partners in Nokia, Motorola, Sony and America Online, and a new
star chief executive in Yankowski, the former head of Sony
Electronics Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an Internet hysteria attached to this, and there are
those who feel Palm will be the dominant force in the wireless PDA
market for some time to come,'' said David Menlow, president of
IPOfinancial.com, a Web-based research firm that tracks initial
public offerings. ``What worries me is that they are at the top of
the hill now, but I don't believe their technology in its current
form will be the enduring standard. There are better operating
systems around.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm's business model is changing as the company shifts from
selling hardware to licensing partners like Sony and Nokia to use
the Palm operating system software. So far, however, the only
licensee actually selling a product is Handspring Inc., which was
formed by Palm's original founders, Jeff Hawkins and Donna
Dubinsky, who left 3Com 18 months ago when the company was
unwilling to do a spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   As the market for handheld devices expands, competition will be
intense on both the hardware and software fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past they had little or no competition'' because
Windows CE was viewed as big and clumsy, said Jack Gold, an analyst
with the Meta Group. ``There is going to be much more competition
out there, from people like Intel'' for hardware, he said. On the
software side, ``why go to Palm when you can use Linux and not have
to pay anybody anything,'' he added. ``The market is going to grow
but it is also going to fragment, and people won't only be buying
things that are Palm-like.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Palm's filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission point out, some of its partners may also be competitors.
Nokia, for one, will not only sell Palm-enabled devices, but is a
founding partner in Symbian, a consortium creating a new operating
system for wireless Internet devices. Other founders of Symbian
include Ericsson, Psion and Matsushita.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is, can it crossover to the wireless
world,'' said Geoffrey Moore, president of the Chasm Group, a
Silicon Valley consulting firm. ``I think Palm has a tough time
winning, because it will be a mobile phone category, not a PDA
category, at the end of the day.''

</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich. _ Two days after a 6-year-old boy
brought a gun to first grade and killed a classmate, school
officials in this working-class district just north of Flint on
Thursday tried to reassure parents that it was safe to send their
children to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view the events that took place as an aberration, something
that was highly, highly, highly unusual,'' Ira Rutherford, the
superintendent of Beecher public schools, said at a news conference
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford said he ``was proud'' of the way the staff handled
the shooting of 6-year-old Kayla Renee Rolland at the Theo J. Buell
Elementary School on Tuesday. But he would say little about how the
school had handled a boy it recognized as troubled.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who had been singled out as needing help by a school
program that identifies children with problems, had been assigned
to a social worker and had undergone counseling, Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a number of support mechanisms in place to assist
youngsters that would be defined as high risk or have problems,
especially for an elementary school,'' Rutherford said. But he
would not give any details about the boy or how he was being
treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say we were aware that there were some problems
with him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, whose father is in jail and whose mother sent him and a
brother to live with an uncle in what the authorities say was a
drug-ridden crack house after she was evicted, will not be charged,
the authorities said. He told detectives he only meant to scare
Kayla with the gun.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, a 19-year-old man who lived in the house and who
police say left the stolen, .32-caliber semiautomatic gun that was
used in the shooting under blankets in a bedroom there, was charged
with involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not looking for scapegoats in this case; we're looking
for justice for Kayla,'' the Genesee County prosecutor, Arthur
Busch, said of the charge against the man, Jamelle Andre James.
</P>
<P>
   ``This definitely was grossly negligent in allowing the boy to
get a loaded pistol,'' Busch said.
</P>
<P>
   The school remained closed Thursday for classes, but was open
for counseling services. The district has sent teachers and
counselors to the homes of the 20 other first-grade classmates,
including five children who witnessed the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, more than 100 angry parents showed up at a
board of education meeting here, demanding action. They petitioned
the school system to install metal detectors and security cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford said the district was considering more security
measures. There are no guards currently assigned to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to put security guards _ not even security guards,
cops,'' June Hensley, whose five grandchildren attend Buell, said
in an interview Thursday. One of her grandsons witnessed the
shooting, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised here; I went to those schools and it's nothing
like when I went,'' Hensley added. ``You see people in the streets
trying to sell crack all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No charges have yet been filed in Kayla's death against the
boy's uncle, Sir Marcus Winfrey, who was taken into custody
Wednesday on unrelated charges, or the boy's mother, Tamarla Owens.
Owens and her 5-year-old daughter had been living with another
relative.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Michigan moved to gain custody of the boy and his
two siblings Wednesday, saying Owens and the boy's father, Dedric
Owens, 28, were unfit parents.
</P>
<P>
   The state said that Owens had physically abused her 8-year-old
son in the past year and that she had exposed the children to
drunkenness, criminality and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dedric Owens has apologized for the shooting. He told the
authorities he did not know where his children were living, but
knew that the boys' uncle lived in a crack house. The authorities
say they found a gram and a half of crack cocaine, a stolen shotgun
and ammunition in the house.
</P>
<P>
   A probate judge has placed the children with a maternal aunt,
pending a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Theodoroff, the children's court-appointed lawyer, said
he had visited with them Wednesday and that they seemed unaware of
the impact of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three of them were acting pretty age-appropriate,''
Theodoroff said. ``The little girl was spinning in her chair and
the kids were just kind of slapping at each other. I don't think
the 6-year-old has any concept of what's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   At Buell, people continued to mourn for Kayla, who loved Barbie
dolls and often prayed before lunch. A large makeshift memorial is
mushrooming hourly as a steady stream of visitors place candles,
cards, teddy bears and candy in the school's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   A candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday night, and a memorial
service is scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Geoffrey Fieger, a former candidate for governor of
Michigan and lawyer for Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who assisted in more
than 130 suicides, said he was retained by Ricky Rolland, Kayla's
father. Fieger also said he was investigating reports that Buell
elementary had acted improperly in guarding the children's safety
from a community awash in guns and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can pay lip service all they want,'' he said. ``You go
out to the school and you'll see the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Hensley, whose grandson Christopher witnessed the shooting, says
her family is trying to decide whether the children should return
to Buell. Christopher is distraught, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll talk about it and then say he doesn't want to talk about
it anymore,'' she said. ``My daughter's taking him to counseling.
He doesn't want to go back to school. He's afraid that next time it
could be him.''

REPORT LINKS HEART ATTACKS TO MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>

and 7th grafs)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In what is believed to be the first documented link between
smoking marijuana and heart attacks, a study has found that a
middle-age person's risk of heart attack rises nearly five fold in
the first hour after smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The study was presented Thursday by Dr. Murray A. Mittleman at
the annual meeting of the American Heart Association's annual
conference on cardiovascular disease in San Diego. Mittleman, an
internist, heads a team of specialists that has been reporting on
risk factors in heart attacks for the past six years. Members of
the team are from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the
Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The marijuana report is one of a series of studies on marijuana
underway at medical schools and universities throughout the
country. One, at Columbia University, reported that a psychological
dependency on marijuana might develop among users. Another, at the
University of Washington, found that skillful child rearing
significantly increased the age at which young people began using
marijuana and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the heart study, Mittleman said that smoking
marijuana increased the heart rate by about 40 beats per minute.
``It also causes blood pressure to increase when the person is
lying down,'' he said, ``and then abruptly fall when the person
stands up, often causing dizziness. These effects may pose
significant risk, especially in people with unrecognized coronary
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn A. Smaha, president of the American Heart Association,
said the study produced important information in the search for
factors that bring on attacks. Smaha and other specialists said
they knew of no previous study that pin-pointed marijuana as one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Mittleman said that the study might be of concern to baby
boomers who continue to use marijuana as they age. ``Many of these
people were users of marijuana when they were in their teens and
`20s,'' he said, ``and a sizable portion of them may still use the
drug, either frequently or occasionally. They should at least be
aware that their risk of heart attack suddenly soars each time they
take the drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Mittleman also said that in the debate over the medicinal use of
marijuana, it might be judged inadvisable for people with existing
coronary disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston group studied 3,882 patients who had survived heart
attacks and found that 124 reported using marijuana regularly. Of
those, 37 said they had used it within 24 hours of their heart
attacks and 9 within the hour of their attacks. The relative risk
of heart attack increased 4.8 times within the first hour but
dropped to 1.7 times higher in the second hour, suggesting a rapid
decline in the acute cardiac effects, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The group previously reported on other triggers of heart
attacks, including cocaine, exercise, sex and psychological
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The team's latest report said that smoking marijuana was ``about
twice as dangerous as exercise for a fit person, sex for a
sedentary person, a tantrum of anger or a bout of anxiety.'' But it
also said that it was less risky than a ``spurt of exercise for a
couch potato or a snort of cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Further studies will have to determine why marijuana, or the key
chemical in it, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), may bring on heart
attacks. But the researchers speculate that it is because of the
extra physical stress from the increased heart beat and blood
pressure and the breaks they may cause in the lining of the blood
vessels, especially among people with elevated cholesterol levels.
The breaks may set off the formation of blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   In the study at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons,
Dr. Mirian W. Fishman said surveys showed that the use of marijuana
among young people had risen sharply since 1990 but little had been
determined about whether people become dependent upon it. Dr.
Margaret Haney, the lead author of the report, and colleagues
conducted a study that Fishman said suggested that daily use of
marijuana might develop a psychological dependence. Marijuana is
not considered physically addictive.

 &HT;    McCain, Christian right spat, but agree on essentials
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lost for the moment in John McCain's public fight
with Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell is one salient fact _
he agrees with them more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   On a range of social issues that include abortion rights, school
vouchers and gay rights, McCain holds views that come close to, and
sometimes match, the bench marks established by social
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   He opposes abortion rights in all but limited circumstances,
even favoring a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain supports voluntary school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   He would use public money for private schooling, although he
would begin with a test program of school vouchers in the nation's
poorest school districts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain opposes legal recognition of marriages between gays or
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   He opposes allowing gays and lesbians to adopt children.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has at several points expressed astonishment at the
vehemence with which he has been attacked from his right.
</P>
<P>
   This reinforces his view that abortion and other issues have
little to do with it. McCain attributes the opposition to his
support for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's attack Monday on Falwell and Robertson, in their home
state of Virginia, was a moment of high drama, and it raised
another question.
</P>
<P>
   Why did McCain go public with such severe criticism of two men
who have significant influence among social conservatives?
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that McCain was simply angry at attacks on
him and Warren Rudman, his campaign chairman, who has famously
feuded with Robertson's Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the former presidential candidate who has endorsed
McCain, said a nasty personal dispute with Robertson motivated
McCain's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that the attack was a calculated effort
to draw moderate Republicans to McCain's side. In this view, McCain
had little to risk since he already has lost the bulk of social
conservative support in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What he needed is a dramatic way to distinguish himself from
George W. Bush, portraying Bush as a captive of the religious
conservatives and McCain as a uniter, not a divider, to borrow a
phrase from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain paints the issue simpy as a matter of conscience for
himself and his party. ``This is a defining moment,'' he said again
Thursday, as he continued to mention Robertson and Falwell at his
rallies and in sessions with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and Falwell have pulled the party too far to the right
in national elections, forcing moderate voters into the Democratic
camp, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even before McCain's attacks on Robertson and Falwell, Bush
had the overwhelming backing of social conservatives, despite the
fact that McCain's positions on many social issues are
indistinguishable from Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives suspect that McCain somehow harbors beliefs
more moderate than his voting record and platform would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Paul, former chairman of the Georgia Republican Party,
said McCain damaged himself in the eyes of social conservatives in
January by suggesting he would consider allowing his daughter to
have an abortion if she became pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that he intended to send that signal, but it was
received,'' said Paul, who worked for Steve Forbes's presidential
campaign. ``He would apply one standard for women in America and
another for his daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that McCain cloaks his positions in the rhetoric of
inclusion. This has never been more true than this week, when he
proclaimed that Falwell and Robertson ``practice the politics of
division.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he, on the other hand, favors ``the politics of
addition.''
</P>
<P>
   He urges people who disagree with him on a specific issue not to
let it determine their vote. On abortion, for instance, McCain says
he wants people on both sides of the issue to work together to make
adoption easier.
</P>
<P>
   That view misses the point, say abortion rights supporters. ``He
wants to take away a woman's reproductive freedom. That's the
bottom line,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, which has
endorsed Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the adoption issue also exposes a harder line in McCain's
views.
</P>
<P>
   As he traveled between campaign stops in California this week,
McCain was describing how he and his wife, Cindy, came to adopt
Bridget, their 8-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   He told how his wife brought Bridget and another baby home from
Mother Teresa's orphanage in Bangladesh. Both babies had health
problems and, in McCain's view, probably would have died had they
remained at the orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just couldn't resist,'' he said warmly, recalling how his
wife surprised him by showing up at the airport in Phoenix with
their new daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But then he was asked why he would deny other babies similar
loving environments if the prospective parents are gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it's appropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it's appropriate,'' he repeated.
</P>
<P>
   He was pressed again and gave the same answer. The normally
voluble candidate refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate the issue even more, McCain believes that ``what
people do with their private lives is their business.''
</P>
<P>
   But he would not give legal blessing to a union of gay men or
women.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain has attracted some support from gay Republicans.
Mike Flickinger is a gay Republican in Cleveland, where he is a
local GOP chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy met with the Log Cabin Republicans,'' a group of gay
Republicans, Flickinger said. ``Bush wouldn't do that. Bush went to
Bob Jones University. Which one of those guys would you choose?''

 ROCKER NEEDS BRAVERY TO LIVE IN A NEW
WORLD (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By JIM REEVES
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Climb into John Rocker's head for a
moment _ there's plenty of room _ and take a look at the world
today through his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   A little frightening, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   This is the universe you've made for yourself, J.R.
</P>
<P>
   It is full of strangers, many of them of different colors and
nationalities, of different cultures and languages and persuasions.
It is full of No. 7 trains, doomed, like some haunted subway car
from the ``Twilight Zone,'' to make the same dismal run, day after
miserable day, night after lonely night.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome aboard, John Rocker. Hope you enjoy the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you've just successfully manipulated the system to
effectively emasculate your baseball-inflicted punishment and bring
it down to a much more manageable two weeks and 500 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and that sensitivity training you're required to complete?
You'll blow through that with your eyes closed. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   But what you are just beginning to understand is that no
arbitrator's decision can get you off the hook for the incredibly
inane and devastatingly insensitive remarks you so blithely made in
that ``Sports Illustrated'' article a couple of months ago.
</P>
<P>
   While you were so profusely and sincerely apologizing to your
teammates and reading your brief ``mea culpa'' statement to the
media at the Braves' spring headquarters in Orlando yesterday,
Rangers' first baseman Rafael Palmeiro was succinctly laying out
the harsh realities of your future existence at Texas' camp in Port
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to perdition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he's going to pay for this is how he gets treated when
he goes out on the road,'' Palmeiro pointed out. ``People know who
he is now, and it's not just going to be waiting for him at the
ballpark. It's going to follow him everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he goes out to a restaurant or anywhere in public, people
are going to recognize him, and there'll always be some guy with a
smart mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Some guy, in other words, who's not willing to let you off as
easy as arbitrator Shyam (rhymes with shame) Das did when he
ignored commissioner Bud Selig's attempts to finally get a player
suspension right.
</P>
<P>
   And you, better than anyone, know that anger control isn't
exactly your strong suit.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a minute that Palmeiro is blowing things out of
proportion, either. He was there to see the hell that Roberto
Alomar went through in Baltimore after the spitting incident with
umpire John Hirschbeck a few years back. And that's not even close
to what you're about to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He \RAlomar\S went from being a guy everybody cheered and
loved to a guy everybody booed and hated,'' Palmeiro remembered.
``It just about killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Alomar, however, nobody particularly liked you much in
the first place, which is why few players around baseball,
including your own teammates, have risen to your defense (an
impossible task anyway).
</P>
<P>
   ``The union had to go through with this appeal process, but what
I'd have liked to have seen him do is stand up and take the union
out of it by saying he accepted the suspension as punishment for
saying stupid \Rstuff\S,'' Rangers' reliever Tim Crabtree said.
``It wouldn't have hurt me to see him serve the entire
suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   You might have skipped out on that, John, but that doesn't mean
you won't pay. The bill is just beginning to come due.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to answer to the media, to the fans and to other
players,'' Palmeiro said. ``His teammates may get past it, but
everybody won't be so forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me? I'd rather have had the year's suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   The real shame of it is that while you personally are a walking
cesspool of racism and intolerance and prejudice, you've managed to
paint all of baseball with the same brush. That is extremely unfair
because this is a sport where finally, every player really is
created equal as far as skin color and ethnic background.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can throw 95 miles per hour, but if you can, or if
you're left-handed, it wouldn't matter if you were purple and spoke
Martian, some team will happily sign you up and throw millions of
dollars at your webbed feet.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is exploring the world in its search for talent, from
Caribbean hot spots such as the Dominican Republic and Venezuela,
to Far East locales such as Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking back, I can't remember the last time there was some
sort of racial incident in baseball,'' Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin said. ``As a player, it's just not an issue. When I was in
the minors in New Haven, Conn., I shared a house with five
Dominican pitchers. It just wasn't a big deal for any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, we won't kid ourselves that you're the only one of your
kind out there. You're not the first close-minded bigot in
baseball, and you almost certainly won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Most are smart enough to hide it, though, which might make them
even more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   We know who are you now, John. We know where you work and where
we can find you.
</P>
<P>
   You've earned yourself a lifetime pass on the No. 7 train, and
it's jam-packed with all your new ``friends.'' Enjoy the ride.

 A.W. STILES, A VERITABLE SANTA, DIES AT 89 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs to attribute quote in 4th graf to Mrs. Stiles.) 
(DW) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archibald W. Stiles, the little boy who had no toys but grew up
to become Santa Claus _ and run an eccentric antiques business that
let growing children exchange their old ice skates for somebody
else's bigger ones _ died Tuesday at a New Jersey convalescent
home. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles, who had a long, flowing beard and white hair, lived what
was, by all accounts, a magical life. Neighbors came to treasure
the sight of him and his wife, Emma, taking their weekly two-hour
rides in an old-fashioned horse-drawn carriage from their home and
shop in Meyersville, a hamlet on the outskirts of Chatham Township
in southern Morris County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   At Christmas time, they would put on cherry-red costumes to be
Mr. and Mrs. Claus. Holly the horse would draw their sleigh to
visit schools and hospitals, and their herd of pet deer (alas,
Virginia, white-tailed, not reindeer), sometimes as many as a
dozen, frisked merrily behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, he just grew to look more and more like
Santa,'' Mrs. Stiles said.
</P>
<P>
   Their store, Archie's Resale Shop, resembles an elves'
warehouse. Enclosed within six sheds, pretty much collapsing on one
another, it telegraphs the possibility of serendipitous treasure,
the lure that draws millions of Americans to flea markets. In
recent years, foreigners eager to buy a piece of Americana have
been turning up at the shop with astonishing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? A Bing Crosby 45-rpm record for 50 cents here; a
stained-glass window for $200 there; a one-of-a-kind horseshoe
chair, handmade by a blacksmith using 90 horseshoes, a steal at
$1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the thousands of hub caps and license plates, there are
even things on display that are solemnly declared not for sale _
except perhaps for the right price. These include collections of
1940s dolls, rocking horses and 20 horse-drawn sleighs, not to
mention the immense grouping of stuffed rabbits, each wearing a
swimsuit and sunglasses and holding an umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   And, boy, could Stiles sell his odd wares. A 1992 article in The
New York Times pictures him pointing and saying, ``Look at that
elephant over there _ came from a circus that couldn't afford a
real one, only one of them in the world, made in the 1930s _ watch
her eyes blink and her stomach move.''
</P>
<P>
   He put it this way: ``It's all here to give people's eyeballs an
education. I tell people to take three steps forward and then back
up two to see what they missed.''
</P>
<P>
   But everyone would notice the pet farm. Over the years,
residents have included peacocks, ferrets, ducks, wild turkeys,
rabbits, geese, turkeys, cats and a raccoon named Rebel. Charlie,
the crow, could bark like a dog. Well, almost: he could not
pronounce the letter B, so it came out ``wow, wow.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the deer, Stiles had wanted since childhood to have at
least one. In the mid-1950s, he paid a $150 fee to the state to
take whatever the wildlife authorities would give him. He got a
buck and a doe, and since then, had something like three dozen in
all.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles was born in Westfield, N.J., and never had toys as a
child. He once speculated that that was the reason he was driven to
acquire 60 life-size dolls and 160 teddy bears as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   He ran away from home at 13, his son, George, said. He worked as
a carpenter and in a metals factory, where melting magnesium left
holes in his skin that remained for the rest of his life. By the
early 1950s, he owned a luncheonette in Berkeley Heights, N.J., the
town where he died in the convalescent home.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, he met and married Emma Newman, who ran a
family-owned boarding house in Meyersville. They immediately began
to collect junk, setting the used bathroom fixtures, wagon wheels
and the rest of it in the muddy front yard of the boarding house.
In 1956, the boarding house became Archie's Resale Shop, looking
exactly like what it was, a glorified junk shop.
</P>
<P>
   One winter in the late 1950s, when one manufacturer of ice
skates had suffered a fire and another a strike, skates were hard
to find. The Stileses, both of whom loved to skate, bought as many
used skates as they could find. They invited others to trade in
skates that no longer fit, charging $1 per trade, a figure that has
now risen to $5.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles donated time and merchandise to local charities,
particularly the Meyersville Grange, Chapter 188. His antique
clothing collection was displayed annually in the town's Mayfair
Parade; Stiles took part dressed as an organ grinder with his pet
monkey.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and his son, who lives in Long Valley,
N.J., Stiles is survived by a brother, Donald, of Westfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The shop will survive him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Osgood, the CBS radio raconteur, once said the tale of
Archie Stiles was his favorite of all the stories he had reported.
He came to Meyersville to report on the skate trade-ins, then
discovered a fantastical world of striped barber poles, deer and a
ruddy-faced fellow with a white beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the speculation had the operation headquartered
farther north,'' he told the nation. ``Much farther north.''

HICKS CAN BALANCE BOOKS BY WINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If you've been keeping up with the business
page this week, companies owned by Tom Hicks have been involved in
one transaction for $2-plus billion and another for $3-plus
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And don't forget our deal for Hong Kong Telecom,'' said Hicks,
almost meekly. ``I think that one gives us control of the Asian
market.''
</P>
<P>
   I forgot to ask how many more billions were involved in putting
this hammerlock on Asia, but for Hicks this kind of stuff is just
another day at the office. Frankly, he'd rather talk sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that many people read the business page,'' Hicks added.
(Note to ``Star-Telegram'' Business Section employees _ he said
that, I didn't.) ``I told Mark Cuban early on that no matter how
great a company he had built, no one knew who he was. It was the
same with me. Buy a professional sports team, however, and all that
changes instantly, as Mark has found out.''
</P>
<P>
   Buy two, as Hicks did with the Rangers and Stars, and you become
the local sports mogul. Except the combined price of his baseball
and hockey clubs was around $325 million. On the business page,
that's considered tip money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that in sports, I'm dealing mainly with my
personal capital,'' Hicks said.''In business, it involves my
company, my company's investors, plus third-party investors. But
what makes it all work is I have to have a great team in position
from the top down. In sports, that's your president and your
general manager. It doesn't happen in either place without the team
effort. Fortunately, we have that in both areas.''
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, there's always a fork in the road, a roadway
that is littered with brilliant businessmen who buy a sports team,
become intoxicated with the instant notoriety, and drive right off
into the deep end of the ditch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports is so different,'' agreed Hicks, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   But after four years of Stars ownership and two years with the
Rangers, Hicks has been successful in trying to maintain the proper
balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mark \RCuban\S bought the Mavericks, the media asked him
the same thing they asked me,'' Hicks said. ``Would he be like
Jerry Jones? My answer was I'd be like Tom Hicks. I'd say the
answer on Mark is he'll be like Mark Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, that means either unpredictable or loose cannon.
But Cuban is still learning, now that he's ventured outside his
dot-com-geek environment.
</P>
<P>
   Does the sports world operate like the business world? ``No,''
said Hicks, firmly. ``It should, but it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that mainly because of ego? ``Yes,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   The almost automatic local answer is that Cuban should pattern
his ownership regime with the Mavericks after the Hicks model, as
opposed to the Jones version at Valley Ranch. Yet ...
</P>
<P>
   Who says Bob Gainey or Ken Hitchcock wanted Brett Hull two years
ago? Wasn't it Hicks who won out in pushing the Stars to sign Hull
as a free agent? And that was Hicks, right, who orchestrated the
trade attempt for pitcher Roger Clemens a year ago? The same Hicks,
by the way, who decided the Rangers were short a pitcher this
winter, so why not sign Darren Oliver?
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who label Jones a meddling owner, Hicks is not
even close to Jerry's hands-on grip of the Cowboys. But he can have
strong opinions and push for those. When Hicks pushes hard enough,
he obviously won't meet much resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very strong desire to win, to be successful,'' Hicks
said. ``At the same time, I never lose sight of the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, I know I didn't make myself clear enough after
the \RRangers'\S season was over last October. I said we were going
to cut payroll. But the Yankees had just swept us in the playoffs.
We didn't win with a high-dollar payroll. I wanted to cut that, but
only in terms of creating the financial flexibility to re-do the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks was in Port Charlotte last week, and will return to spring
training this weekend. ``What I love is the different mix of
players for this season,'' he said. ``The team attitude is the best
I've seen. Doug \RMelvin, the general manager\S has a payroll of
about $65 million, some $10 million less than last season. But that
gives us all this flexibility to add what we have to add. And we
will, if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Stars approach the NHL playoffs for another Stanley Cup
run, the Rangers approach the start of the American League season.
``I'm very pleased with how both teams are positioned,'' said
Hicks. ``I know there are those who don't agree with me on the
Rangers, but that's why we play the season.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's also why Hicks goes out and buys half of Hong Kong.
If you win, you're right. If you're right, you cash.

 ZIMMERMAN UNHAPPY WITH CONTRACT (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Sticking to their strict pay structure
for younger players, the Rangers automatically renewed reliever
Jeff Zimmerman's contract for a salary of $250,000 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star reliever was not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit frustrating,'' Zimmerman said. ``I can see
from a business side their thought process; I just don't agree with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said the Rangers have a
strict salary scale for players with less than three years'
experience. Players with zero to one year of experience get paid
from $200,000 to $250,000 based on service time and playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman got the maximum amount for a one-year player under the
Rangers' system, and the team added a $10,000 bonus because he made
the All-Star team last year. Braves reliever Kerry Ligtenberg
signed for $255,000 last year after recording 38 saves as a rookie
the year before.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmerman's contract is less than half of the $600,000 Kerry
Wood received last year after his terrific rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell the players, for the first two years and 100 days \Rof
service time\S we have control,'' Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin said. ``The rest of the player's career comes arbitration
and free agency. Those years are affected by what other clubs pay
their players. We're not trying to be hard-line. It's a matter of
keeping salaries under control while we have the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to the system. If they have a problem with the
system, they should talk to the union. I have a problem with
arbitration.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's contract is in line with most other top rookies.
Reds reliever Scott Williamson, the National League Rookie of the
Year last year, had his contract recently renewed at $300,000.
Oakland's Ben Grieve got a $300,000 contract a year ago after being
American League Rookie of the Year. Oakland recently renewed Tim
Hudson for $250,000 after Hudson went 11-2 with a 3.23 earned-run
average as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman and Mike Venafro, who was automatically renewed
yesterday at $245,000, don't like the fact the system is based on
how much they played and not how well they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for something based more on performance
criteria and theirs is on service time,'' Venafro said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman was 9-3 with a 2.36 ERA in 65 appearances and 872/3
innings last year. Venafro was 3-2 with a 3.29 ERA in 65 games and
681/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have pitched the same number of innings, gone 0-20
with a 12 ERA and gotten the same amount of money,'' Zimmerman
said. ``Which is very frustrating. But I'm just glad to get it
behind me. It's all about pitching for a team with a chance to win
the World Series; it's not about money.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said if the salary structure was based on performance,
``then it's all arbitrary, who performed well and who didn't
perform well. Somebody has to make the decision. I told him, your
goal is to get to arbitration and free agency. But for two years
and 100 days, we're going to be tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Danny Kolb was renewed at $200,000, and Matt Perisho
agreed to a one-year deal worth $230,000.

</P>
<P>
   Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he has been collecting cash
among business friends to help his conservative Christian
Democratic Union pay fines imposed for its illegal campaign
financing during his years in power. News media reports said he had
raised $3 million, enough to cover the financial damage resulting
from his admission that he accepted $1 million in undeclared

Kohl's activity ``incredibly embarrassing.''

   After a 50-year political battle, Parliament passed a law
granting private schools the same status as public schools, and

   The Affluence of Youth, Thanks to Mom and Dad &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder that teenagers are such targets for marketers:
they have a lot of money under their control. A study estimates
that 9.8 million American teenagers receive cash from their
parents, to the tune of $1.05 billion a week.
</P>
<P>
   During 1997 and 1998, researchers from Ohio State University
randomly selected 8,984 youths, ages 12 to 17, and asked, among
other questions, how much money they received from their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the count were regular weekly allowances for chores,
lunches or transportation, along with other discretionary cash
doled out during the week for things like movies or clothing
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the teenagers said they received a regular sum from
their parents; the median was $50 a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised at the amount,'' said Dr. Jay Zagorsky, a
research scientist at the university's Center for Human Resource
Research. ``My two sons aren't quite teens yet, but they don't get
anywhere near that much.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics come from the latest National Longitudinal Survey
of Youth, conducted by Ohio State for the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. This was the first time the survey asked about money.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, teenagers from wealthier families received
the highest dollar amounts. For children from families with an
annual household income of at least $100,000, the median was $175 a
week. That compares with $12 to $14 a week for teenagers in
households with annual income of less than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Parents were more generous if they had fewer children, the
researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   Zagorsky noted that half the teenagers interviewed didn't
receive any cash. But, he said, the study suggests that ``there is
still a significant number of teens who aregetting a fair amount
of money'' over the course of a week.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting finding _ and one that oddly echoes the
adult working world: boys in the study received more money than
girls did. ``I have no idea why,'' Zagorsky said. &QL;

 Palm Stock Hits IPO Heights  &HT;     By Verne Kopytoff 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
In one of the hottest initial public offerings of the year, shares
of Palm, the handheld organizer manufacturer, soared nearly 150
percent yesterday in their first day of trading.
<P>
   After being priced at $38 per share late Wednesday, the shares
opened at a staggering $145, soared as high as $165, but then
dropped back to close at $95.06.
</P>
<P>
   The increase gave Palm a market value of $53 billion _ almost
twice that of its parent, 3Com Corp., the giant Santa Clara
computer networking company. Although 3Com still owns almost 95
percent of Palm's shares, worth $50 billion, and is a far bigger
company, 3Com's market value yesterday was only $28 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors are betting that even though 3Com is bigger, Palm
will grow much faster. And unlike most recent high-tech IPOs, Palm
is actually making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest in Palm is tremendous,'' said Peter Lieu, an
independent analyst in Boston. ``It has all the parameters of a
great growth stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm's $53 billion market value exceeded that of Ford Motors,
General Motors, Philip Morris and Chevron, each of which are worth
about $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Palm's stock price soared is that very few shares
were sold in the IPO. 3Com offered only 23 million Palm shares _
less than 5 percent of Palm's 561 million outstanding shares. It
plans to distribute the remaining Palm shares to 3Com shareholders
in about six months.
</P>
<P>
   With more Palm shares on the market, the price could suffer,
which also could explain the wide disparity between Palm's and
3Com's market values.
</P>
<P>
   Palm is the world's largest producer of handheld computer
organizers, increasingly powerful devices that allow users to store
years' worth of appointments and thousands of telephone numbers.
These organizers feature liquid crystal screens, snap-in
accessories like digital cameras, and, in the case of the Palm VII,
a wireless Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   According to International Data Corp., Palm controlled 68.4
percent of the handheld computer organizer market in the United
States during the first half of 1999. Most analysts believe that
the company is poised to dominate in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Palm also makes a relatively small amount of money by licensing
its organizer software to other organizer manufacturers. But some
analysts think that this market could grow tremendously if
organizers are integrated with cellular telephones, as many
companies are trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   Palm faces stiff competition, however, from companies including
Casio, Handspring and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   3Com decided to make Palm independent so it could concentrate on
its network business, which has been suffering lately.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 3Com's sales in the quarter ended Nov. 26, 1999,
declined 4.3 percent to $1.47 billion from the same period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Palm's sales increased 76 percent to $259 million during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting day for Palm,'' Alan Kessler, Palm's chief
operating officer, said in an interview. ``It's going to allow us
to move to the next level and invest in some young companies that
are in the Palm economy,'' he said, referring to firms that make
add-on products for the Palm.
</P>
<P>
   While Palm's stock took off yesterday, 3Com's declined
dramatically. Though 3Com's shares had quadrupled in value since it
announced the Palm spin-off in September, its price yesterday
declined $22.31, to $81.81.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were divided on which company _ 3Com or Palm _ is the
better investment at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Purdy, president of Mobile Insights, a market research
company, preferred Palm. He said it will likely continue to grow
for years to come by adding sophisticated new features to its
organizers, essentially transforming them into portable personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palm represents a computer company of the 21st century,''
Purdy said. ``It's going to be about personalized information _
where you need it and when you need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy was less enthusiastic about 3Com, which he said must
reorganize and refocus on its computer networking business. Only
then, he said, will 3Com, the nation's second-largest maker of
networking equipment, be able to even consider overtaking No.1
Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Houghton, an analyst with Sutro Group, the investment
firm, thinks 3Com's stock is a steal considering that its market
value is half of Palm's, while it still owns about 95 percent of
Palm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the market is efficient, those two prices are going to
converge over the next six months,'' Houghton said.

   Amid all the fighting over Confederate flags and Christianity,
none of the presidential candidates have tried very hard to connect
with an important constituency: older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the contenders have ignored issues that
affect seniors, like Social Security and Medicare. And Vice
President Al Gore's recent trips to Florida have hardly been to
visit college students.
</P>
<P>
   But no candidate has tried to go beyond a handful of hot-trigger
issues and to forge an empathetic bond with older people, to become
(italics)their(end italics) champion, as President Clinton has with
blacks over the last seven years, as Sen. John McCain has with
fellow veterans or as Gore has with organized labor.
</P>

   Older Americans, of course, are a very diverse lot, making them
more difficult to appeal to than, say, an ethnic minority group
with a shared history.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Zinke, a consultant for corporations on hiring and
retaining older workers, thinks the time is ripe for a leader to
tap into this important voter pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``A candidate who can show that he really understands the needs
of older Americans could certainly swing important votes in his
direction,'' Zinke said. ``And I don't mean just in terms of
entitlement programs or more laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he is not asking candidates to pander to
seniors' pocketbooks. Rather, he wants to hear them talking about
what older Americans have to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   The comments from House members in the wake of last week's
unanimous vote to lift earnings restrictions on Social Security
beneficiaries aged 65 to 69 indicate that, at least on the
congressional level, some politicians are catching on.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zinke has no formal expertise in politics, he argues
from the numbers. Some 58 million Americans are 55 or older, a
figure that will bulge as the baby boomers enter retirement. And
older people go to the polls. In the 1996 presidential election, 77
percent of Americans over 65 voted, compared with just 49 percent
of the overall voting-age population.
</P>
<P>
   Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution in
Washington and an expert on aging and demographics, argues that
older people are too diverse to be captured as a core constituency.
He agrees, however, that their growing numbers and high voting rate
_ combined with ``ennui among younger voters'' _ could make them
fertile ground for a candidate able to forge an ``emotional
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinke wants to see political leadership that will change what he
calls the ``national mind-set'' about older Americans. ``Jawboning
is as good a term as any to describe what I think is needed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general attitude is that when you reach a certain age,
you're over the hill. You should go somewhere and enjoy the `golden
years.'''
</P>
<P>
   He cited a 1999 Harris Poll showing that there were 3.7 million
people over 55 who were out of the work force but who would like to
keep working. ``Because of ageism and the national mind-set about
older people, they think there are no jobs for them or they are not
wanted,'' he said. ``In a tight job market, this is a valuable
resource pool.''
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't one of the candidates start beating this drum?
``I think they and their advisers are just plain missing the
boat,'' Zinke said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Murphy, a democratic political consultant in Washington,
thinks there may well be an opening for a candidate with such a
message. But he said national office seekers had to be careful of
too many segmented appeals. ``You need an overarching appeal to
build a majority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an approach, he added, could have traction as a subtext of
a campaign, because values are important in this year's elections.
``Equal opportunity and respect for elders are important values,''
he said. ``Also, building credibility with older voters is
important, because traditional means of reaching them are becoming
less effective. They don't respond well to pandering.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinke, a former corporate and criminal lawyer in New York, runs
his own consulting company, Human Resource Services in Boulder,
Colo. He is organizing a conference in Washington in June on the
importance of older workers in meeting employment needs. Sponsors
include AARP, Chase Manhattan, GTE, Nortel Networks, Pitney-Bowes,
Young &AMP; Rubicam and AXA Equitable.
</P>
<P>
   Zinke is an example of what he preaches. He will be 73 this
month, and he has no plans to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not see aging and our increased longevity in a
negative light,'' he said. ``Instead of worrying about the graying
of America, we should be looking forward to the benefits and
opportunities of this demographic change.'' After all, he said,
``an older population is also a wiser and more skilled
population.''

 New PUC Rules Try to Cut Off Phone Cramming  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; After nearly three years of discussions, state regulators
yesterday enacted rules to help consumers fight fraudulent charges
on their telephone bills.
<P>
   The California Public Utilities Commission unanimously barred
local phone companies from cutting off customers' local service
when they refuse to pay their long-distance bills.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners said many customers mistakenly thought they
had to pay phony long-distance charges to prevent their phones from
being disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission did the right thing,'' said Paul Stein, an
attorney for The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer
group that lobbied for the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pay your local phone bill, you should get to keep your
local phone service.''
</P>
<P>
   Although complaints about overcharging have been falling,
regulators say it is still a sore spot for consumers. Pacific Bell
said it received as many as 1,200 complaints a month during a peak
in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do more,'' Commissioner Josiah Neeper said in
introducing the rules. Neeper said he recalled that one consumer
called his office in a panic after receiving a bill with nearly
$800 in phony charges.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, long-distance long distance  &LR; companies must
identify themselves on bills by their legal name or the name
registered with regulators to make it easier to resolve complaints
and crack down on companies ``cramming'' unauthorized charges on
customers' bills.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also issued new voluntarily guidelines outlining how
local phone companies can better track complaints against billing
companies, so they can sever ties with firms that pass along phony
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners quickly approved the new measures with little
debate. Commissioner Carl Wood, who recently proposed creating a
bill of rights for telephone customers, said the new measures
provide a good basis for a broad set of rules to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took nearly three years for the PUC to approve the
rules, in part because of strong opposition from telephone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokesman James Peterson said many companies have been
concerned about the rules because they could encourage some
freeloaders to refuse to pay legitimate charges, forcing phone
companies to raise their rates.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell, which fought some of the measures when they were
being hammered out, hailed the vote yesterday. ``This will give us
some more enforcement tools'' to fight cramming, said spokesman
John Britton. He said the phone company has also refused to do
business with roughly 70 firms suspected of passing along
fraudulent charges.
</P>
<P>
   Fassil Fenikile, an aide to Neeper, said the rules took time to
work out because they involved several revisions. He also said the
commission had to wait for related action in the state Legislature
and Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC ordered Pacific Bell and other local phone companies to
notify consumers about the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the PUC approved the merger of Bell Atlantic and
GTE. However, the commissioners rejected a proposal to divert $64
million of merger-related savings to help provide
telecommunications infrastructure to poor communities. Two
commissioners said more hearings are needed to decide how to spend
that money.

SPORTS COLUMN: ROCKER FACES TOUGHEST CRITICS IN BRAVES TEAMMATES
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBN-BRAVES-ROCKER) 
(rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ John Rocker's de facto judgment began Thursday
morning when he took what must have seemed like a very long walk
from his dressing stall over to Randall Simon's a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   With a room full of stone-faced Atlanta Braves watching for a
first act of contrition, Rocker tapped Simon on the shoulder, and
then waited out the most agonizing heartbeats of his 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to apologize to you,'' Rocker said, when Simon turned
to face him.
</P>
<P>
   More reflexively than deliberately, Simon's hand reached out to
meet the pitcher who had disparaged so many in the process of
disgracing himself. And at this very moment, Randall Simon applied
the lessons of a loving disciplinarian, a mother who had a way of
immediately recognizing deception disguised as truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the way my mother was, I've always been able to
look somebody in the eye and know if he means what he says,'' Simon
said.
</P>
<P>
   He studied the gaze of the man who had publicly labeled him ``a
fat monkey,'' and said he saw remorse. He said he saw pain.
</P>
<P>
   If Rocker's apology was just a song worthy of a Grammy, Simon
said he and his wife, Gidara, would surely catch on by the time the
three of them finished dinner Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   So forget the arbitrary suspension and the arbitrator's decision
to reduce it. Forget the protesters and the shrill cries for
baseball to ban Rocker or for the Braves to cast him off to a
less-righteous bullpen. Forget those sound bites from the No. 7
train. The opinions that matter most, or at all, are going to be
those in the clubhouse, the jury of John Rocker's peers.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Braves can make the definitive call on whether Rocker
is, in his heart and mind, what he sounded like in the pages of
Sports Illustrated, or if he is just another wayward product of our
shock culture, a Frankenstein news media creation, Goofy gone
Daffy.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat of a coincidence that the Braves train on the
expansive Disney campus, in a complex called the Wide World of
Sports, as Rocker's xenophobic commentary staggered fundamental
logic, given the certainty he would be confronting one of those
``foreigners'' every time he looked in for the sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about it, I thought it was no big deal,
just more of what he was saying at the World Series,'' said one of
the catchers, Javy Lopez, out of Ponce, P.R. ``Then I read the
article and I thought it was a setup. I just couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, in Atlanta at the time, said his phone began ringing,
calls from relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hated him right away, absolutely hated him,'' Lopez said.
``But I kept saying, `I've known Rocker for three years and he's
never, ever acted racist around me, or anyone I know.'''
</P>
<P>
   The other catcher, Eddie Perez of Cuidad Ojeda, Venezuela,
echoed those thoughts, following the team meeting during which
Rocker was said to have come close to tears and begged his
teammates, ``Please, let me play.'' Perez said Simon, one of
several Braves to stand up and speak, demanded that Rocker come
clean with the Hispanic players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he had been in the minor leagues with Latin guys,
had lived with them, never had any problems and you can ask them,''
Perez said. ``That, I agree with him. Me and him have been good
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig didn't have to make diversity training
part of Rocker's so-called punishment; he just had to return him to
the Braves, to the clubhouse, where Rocker can't hide anymore, if,
in fact, he was hiding there before.
</P>
<P>
   Fans may boo him, but Rocker has been booed before, even if it
was just for being the provocateur. The news media may hiss and
holler every time he uses awkward phrasing _ as he did Thursday in
relating a recent engagement with a bunch of African-American
construction workers _ but Tom Glavine was right when he said that
Rocker's real trial didn't begin until he walked through the
clubhouse door.
</P>
<P>
   The players will decide where they go from here. By late
morning, after manager Bobby Cox concluded the group therapy
session with a more sporting refrain _ ``Let's play some ball'' _
Rocker and Lopez could be seen on the warning track in right field,
chatting amicably.
</P>
<P>
   After the way the Braves' organization had shamefully tried to
close the clubhouse, it was if Rocker's teammates were saying, ``Oh
no, this is going to be out in the open where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was encouraging to hear them speak so candidly, straight from
the heart. If there is hatred in Rocker's, the Braves are the ones
to find out.

 Lawyers Paid Well to Stay  &HT;     By Verne Kopytoff 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Heather M. Shane was resigned to renting an apartment in San
Francisco because her $95,000 salary and $5,000 bonus weren't  &LR; 
 &LR; enough to buy one of the homes for sale that she visits for fun.
Now, the lawyer is thinking that buying a flat is within reach.
<P>
   In December, Shane's Menlo Park law firm, Gunderson Dettmer,
announced dramatic raises for its associates. Though Shane, who
graduated from law school 10 months ago, did not ask for more
money, her pay was increased to $125,000, with up to $25,000 more
in bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it just seemed astounding to me that I was making so
much money even before the raises,'' Shane said. ``Instead of
looking for a cheaper apartment, I'm looking for something that
possibly is in my range.''
</P>
<P>
   She's house-hunting in a market where the median price of a
condo was $435,000 in January, according to Acxiom Dataquick, a
real estate information firm in San Diego. Shane is the beneficiary
of a big increase in lawyer salaries in the Bay Area during the
past few months. In an effort to compete for attorneys with the
growing Internet and technology industries, many law firms now
offer salaries so generous that some normally stoic lawyers yell
and applaud when their raises are announced.
</P>
<P>
   The salary increases for Bay Area lawyers are being imitated at
corporate law offices across the country, noted Paula Patton,
executive director of the National Association for Law Placement,
which tracks hiring in the legal profession. That's unusual, she
said, because law firms in New York and Chicago dictate national
salary levels, not San Francisco and Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to say whether these increases are keeping lawyers
from leaving. Law firms say they expect to know in six months to a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys specializing in corporate law and intellectual
property are the primary beneficiaries of the salary increases.
Though costly, law firms say the raises are necessary to keep
attorneys from quitting to join Silicon Valley startups, many of
which offer shorter working days and stock options that are
potentially worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson Dettmer was the first law firm in the Bay Area to
announce a salary windfall. Within a month, most of the other large
corporate law firms in the area instituted similar raises for
associates that are usually between 25 and 50 percent higher than
what they were paid before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing a number of our most talented lawyers to our
clients,'' said Tower C. Snow Jr., chairman of Brobeck, Phleger &AMP;
Harrison, a law firm in San Francisco that works with companies
like Cisco and E-Trade. ``We wanted to make it as painful as
possible to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Snow's firm increased first-year lawyer salaries to
$125,000 from a base of $100,000. It is too soon, he said, to know
whether the raises will keep employees from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Attrition at the firm had been increasing prior to the raise.
Nearly 22 percent of the firm's associates left in 1999, compared
with 12 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of lawyer turnover can be high. Snow said that each
departing lawyer can mean a reduction in client billing time and a
loss of $200,000 in recruiting and training costs for the firm to
hire a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers who left Snow's firm last year is Kirsten
Mellor. She now works as a director of legal affairs for
Egreetings.com, the digital greeting card and gift Web site in San
Francisco. Mellor said she left the law firm for several reasons,
including the opportunity to get away from the constant pressure of
law-firm deadlines and the inconvenience of frequently working on
weekends and past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes as a lawyer at a firm, your work can be dry with so
many documents,'' Mellor said. ``Working at a company like
Egreetings is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Mellor, money was not an issue in the move. The
salaries were comparable, she said, though the stock options tipped
the balance in Egreetings' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney salaries in the Bay Area are among the highest in the
country, according to a survey taken in February by
Emplawyernet.com, a Los Angeles legal job listing Web site. based &LR; 
in Los Angeles.  &LR; The median salary for all lawyers in the Bay Area
is $85,000, compared with to  &LR; $72,000 nationally, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries are even higher for lawyers who specialize in
intellectual property, an area of expertise that is particularly
sought after in Silicon Valley. Those specialists earn a median
salary of $105,000 in the Bay Area, compared with $90,000
nationally, the Emplawyernet survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Jacoby, a corporate lawyer at Cooley Godward, a Palo Alto
law firm that raised first-year salaries to $125,000 from $95,000,
plus bonuses, has so far resisted the lure of working at a startup.
However, he gets several calls a week from recruiters who try to
break down his defenses with promises of a ``great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty happy with my job,'' Jacoby said, conceding that
the extra pay is nonetheless appreciated. ``My wife works at a
dot-com, so that coal is already in the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby, who plans to save most of the raise to help buy a house
and perhaps go to restaurants a little more often, added that
joining a startup &LR;   &LR; can be risky. Some companies prosper, while
others do not do well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all the companies turned into gold at the outset, leaving
was easier,'' Jacoby said. ``There are now a lot more
counterexamples to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to promoting an air of giddiness in law firms, the
salary increases have generated a lot of job applications. Since
the raises were announced, several Bay Area firms have received far
more resumes in the mail than usual.
</P>
<P>
   However, the premium pay attorneys are getting these days does
not necessarily extend to the entire legal profession. Criminal
defense attorneys, for example, have been mostly left out of the
raises so far, law firms say.
</P>
<P>
   There's some question whether the salary raises can be
sustained. Maurice Salter, chief executive officer for
Emplawyernet.com, said attorneys who earn high salaries may be
fired when times are not so prosperous, just as they were in the
1980s during an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are getting to the point where lawyers are not worth what
they are paid, when you compare it to the amount of money they're
bringing in to a firm through their clients,'' Salter said. ``When
the economy contracts, they may have to release these people who
they paid so much for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Schultz, a law student at the University of California at
Berkeley who will earn $125,000 a year plus bonuses when he starts
work in a year at Fish &AMP; Richardson, a law firm in Menlo Park, had
other reservations.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered whether firms would offset the big salaries by
charging clients more or pressuring lawyers to work longer hours, a
practice that Fish &AMP; Richardson told him would not be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned that, obviously, if the firms are are paying
more, they have to find the money somewhere,'' Schultz said.

SEC REACHES SETTLEMENT IN WEB-BASED `PUMP-AND-DUMP' CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Calif.)  (jt) 
 By ALEX BERENSON   
c .2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Douglas Colt was a second-year law student at
Georgetown University with a head for computers and a passion for
Republican politics when he hit upon a foolproof way to make money
from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He set up a free Web site promising investors hot tips on penny
stocks. But, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Colt bought the stocks in advance of his tips and sold them at a
profit as soon as his followers bid up the prices. The stocks then
plunged back to earth, causing losses for unwary investors in what
the SEC called an updated version of the classic market
manipulation known as a pump and dump.
</P>
<P>
   The system netted Colt, his mother and three other Georgetown
law students nearly $350,000 in only a couple of months last year.
Nearly all the money went to Colt and his mother, Joanne Colt, a
councilwoman in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Under an SEC settlement announced Thursday, none of the five
participants have to pay a fine. Nor do they have to pay back their
profits. While not admitting or denying wrongdoing, they merely
agreed not to violate securities laws in the future, a sanction
that some experts characterized as a slap on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Colts, the settlement covers Kenneth Terrell,
23; Jason Wycoff, 23; and Adam Altman, 25. Terrell and Wycoff are
third-year law students at Georgetown. Altman graduated from
Georgetown last year. A Georgetown law student who knows Colt said
he is spending this year at Pepperdine University's law school but
is expected to graduate with a Georgetown degree. Neither
Georgetown nor Pepperdine would comment.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown said it had no plans to discipline the students. In a
three-paragraph statement, the university said that it ``expects
students to conduct themselves with the highest degree of honesty,
integrity and trustworthiness.'' The students already face ``public
humiliation and future scrutiny by bar admissions committees,'' the
school said.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC depends on the deterrent effect of high-profile cases to
keep potential lawbreakers in line, and the agreement surprised
some legal experts. ``I'm really puzzled,'' said James Cox, a law
professor at Duke University. ``If you don't make people give up
their ill-gotten gains, it seems to me an invitation for people to
step forward and see if they can pull a fraud off and not get
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   SEC officials said the Georgetown settlement was fair. ``I don't
think anyone is walking away from anything here,'' said Paul
Berger, an assistant director of enforcement for the commission.
``I think the consequences are potentially severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the commission had decided not to ask for a monetary
penalty after reviewing the individuals' finances and determining
that they could not afford to pay a penalty. ``We're not a
collection agency,'' he said. ``You can get a judgment for 20
years, but I don't think that's what we're here to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Colt, who the SEC said earned more than $100,000 in a matter of
hours trading two stocks, said she was ``near bankruptcy'' from the
cost of defending herself and her son. ``I view this as an enormous
emotional and financial drain, an enormous embarrassment as a human
being,'' she said. ``At this point in my life, I'm hoping I can
pick up the pieces and salvage my more senior years.''
</P>
<P>
   Colt said she did not plan to step down as councilwoman. ``I
think I have served my community with great conscientious effort,''
she said. ``I hope the community will allow me to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Williams, El Paso County Republican chairman, said the
Colts are ``people that I view as very honest.'' Colt worked as a
volunteer for the El Paso Republicans in the summer of 1998. ``He
did a lot of database work, was very thorough,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other participants in the scheme could be reached
for comment. Jeffrey Robertson, a lawyer for Wyckoff, said his
client ``was a relatively minor focus of this investigation. He
cooperated fully with that investigation, and he is eager to put
this matter behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, Colt masterminded the plan by setting up a
now-defunct Web site called fast-trades.com that was directed at
day traders. Colt bought substantial positions in thinly traded
micro-cap stocks, then promoted them as selections on the site. As
the stocks rallied, he sold his shares for several times what he
had paid.
</P>
<P>
   The site disclosed that its operators might buy or sell stocks
at any time. But the disclaimer was ``materially misleading as to
the real trading intent of the participants,'' the SEC said. ``If
fast-trades had accurately disclosed their trading intentions,
subscribers would have been able to deduce that the only reason
Colt offered his `free' service was so he could further influence
the market price movement initiated by his purchase of the
recommended stock just before the announcement.''

FORMER GORE FUND-RAISER CONVICTED ON 5 COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Maria Hsia, a longtime political fund-raiser for
Vice President Al Gore, was convicted Thursday of all five felony
counts against her for her role in arranging more than $100,000 in
illegal donations to the Democratic Party and its candidates in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Of that amount, $55,000 was contributed to the Democratic
National Committee in connection with the vice president's
much-criticized visit to a Buddhist temple in the Los Angeles area.
The event, at the Hsi Lai Temple in the community of Hacienda
Heights, has shadowed Gore throughout the current political season,
with a variety of his opponents referring to it in efforts to
remind the public of the Clinton-Gore organization's fund-raising
embarrassments.
</P>
<P>
   As her federal jurors filed in Thursday, Hsia (pronounced shaw),
a 48-year-old Taiwan-born American citizen who works as an
immigration consultant in Los Angeles, consulted a Chinese
fortune-telling book to try to divine her fate. She then sat
impassively as the jury delivered its verdicts for what the
government had described as her masterminding an evasion of
election laws by disguising the true source of campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   All five counts against Hsia, who did not testify at her
three-week-long trial, charged her with causing finance officials
of the Democratic National Committee and Democratic campaigns to
file false contribution statements with the Federal Election
Commission. Although conviction on these counts can mean a
years-long prison sentence, federal sentencing guidelines make it
more likely that she will serve only a brief term, if any.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Buddhist temple, Justice Department
prosecutors charged that Hsia had arranged for nuns and monks there
to write checks to make it appear that they were the donors to the
Democratic National Committee. In reality, they were only ``straw
donors,'' reimbursed by the temple itself, which, as a religious,
tax-exempt institution, is prohibited from making political
donations.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the $1,000 limit on contributions to
presidential campaigns was evaded by wealthy Chinese-Americans who
testified at the trial that Hsia had helped them find straw donors
for their contributions to the Clinton-Gore re-election committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's opponents have noted that his 1996 fund-raising efforts
also included 56 telephone calls he made from the White House to
solicit donations for the party, in apparent violation of federal
law and longtime practice. When those calls became public
knowledge, he insisted that ``no controlling legal authority'' had
barred them. He has also been faulted for holding 23 ``coffees''
for wealthy donors at the White House in addition to co-hosting
eight others with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey who is
challenging Gore for the Democratic nomination, has repeatedly said
that Gore will be especially vulnerable in the general election
because of his record on fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, prosecutors portrayed the Democratic National
Committee, the Clinton-Gore committee and Rep. Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., who also received donations through Hsia, as unaware of her
actions and thus unwitting beneficiaries. Gore did not appear in
court but his name was mentioned throughout the trial and jurors
were shown a videotape of his April 29, 1996, visit to the Buddhist
temple.
</P>
<P>
   That tape could be troublesome for Gore during his presidential
campaign. Now that the trial is over, the tape is supposed to be
released publicly and Republican political operatives have already
asked for a copy, presumably to use in political advertisements to
embarrass Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had initially described his visit to the temple as
``community outreach,'' part of the Democrats' effort to build
closer ties to the Asian-American community. He later acknowledged
that he knew the visit was ``finance-related.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York Thursday, where he was campaigning in advance of
Tuesday's set of important primaries, Gore told reporters: ``The
jury has rendered its verdict. It's a hard day for her. She has
been a friend and a political supporter but since this matter is
still in the courts I am not going to comment on it further.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, which came after nearly 10 hours of deliberations
over three days, was a much-desired victory for the Justice
Department's special task force investigating campaign finance
abuses that occurred in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia has been only the second figure embroiled in the Democratic
fund-raising scandal to face a full trial so far.
</P>
<P>
   Other party fund-raisers, including John Huang and Yah Lin Trie,
have pleaded guilty to charges growing out of the scandal, and
Pauline Kanchanalak, another fairly obscure figure, is awaiting
trial. But no senior Democratic National Committee officials have
ever been charged.
</P>
<P>
   The only other figure to be brought to trial by the Justice
Department task force was Franklin L. Haney, a Tennessee
businessman, who was acquitted last July on 42 counts of disguising
his own contributions by using straw donors to Gore's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But Haney's case was unrelated to the heart of the larger
scandal about the Democratic Party's efforts to mine the
Asian-American community for contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Paul Friedman has yet to rule on motions brought by
lawyers for Hsia (pronounced ``shaw'') to dismiss the five counts.
Because of that, he did not immediately set a date for sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Luque, Hsia's lawyer, noting that it was extraordinary for
a federal judge to defer a ruling on dismissal motions until after
a verdict, said, ``It's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Luque had argued that the reports filed with the Federal
Election Commission _ false reports, according to prosecutors _
were filed by the campaign treasurers for the DNC, the Clinton-Gore
committee and Kennedy's re-election committee, none of whom Hsia
had ever met.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the five counts carries a five-year jail term and
$250,000 fine under the law. But if Hsia's conviction is upheld,
her sentence would be governed by complex federal sentencing
guidelines that weigh factors such as prior convictions, of which
Hsia has none. She would also benefit under the guidelines because
there is no allegation that any money was stolen. As a result she
could receive a relatively light jail sentence or perhaps even
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party Chairman Jim Nicholson said of the verdict,
``My faith in the jury system is once again restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson ridiculed the Justice Department's theory that the
vice president and the Democratic Party were unwitting victims of
Hsia's scheme. ``It's time to get beyond the small-fry and take on
the major players like Al Gore,'' he said in a statement.

THE KIWIS LET LOOSE AFTER PRADA IS SUBDUED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ On Thursday afternoon, the America's Cup
went for a spin.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 70,000 people descended on the Cup Village at the
Viaduct Basin to bask in the national glow in the moments after
Team New Zealand's mighty black sloop had put the finishing touches
on a 5-0 pasting of Italy's Prada Challenge. The Kiwis' victory was
the first successful defense of the cup outside American shores.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was absolute mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   A sea of humanity craned outward from every available space on
the waterfront, and thousands of revelers manned perches atop
apartment buildings and from balconies. Hundreds more took up
station on the bows and fly bridges of the dozens of superyachts
ringing the harbor. Percussive Champagne corks popped in the
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a theme color to the proceedings, it was the one
worn by all of New Zealand's national teams: basic black. A large
homemade sign was scrawled with the message, ``Black Is
Beautiful.'' A gigantic black flag emblazoned with a silver fern, a
Kiwi symbol for unity, streamed off a passing helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers pounded out that old Rolling Stones classic: ``Paint It
Black.'' Prada's Luna Rossa was the first boat to be towed into the
maritime maw, sporting a huge banner from its masthead which read,
``Arrividerci New Zealand.'' But the Italians will not be gone for
long, for immediately following their defeat they issued a
challenge to the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron for the next cup
match, to be sailed in the summer of 2002-3.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Italy's Yacht Club Punta Ala became the challenger
of record for the 31st competition for the cup. The most
significant apparent change in the regatta will be a modified
format for the challenger's selection tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Following two initial round-robins, two-thirds of the
challengers, with a maximum number of 10, will advance to a seeded
semifinal round. The final details of the series have yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   But that is in the future. Thursday, the Italians arrived to
wild cheers at the temporary barges docked in the center of the
viaduct, to which the cup had been transported from its regular
quarters at the yacht squadron. But it was nothing compared with
the arrival of the Kiwi boat, lined from stem to stern with the
several dozen members of the sailing and shore team that comprise
Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   A cacophony of unleashed air horns, blaring rock music, singing,
applause and cheers filled the early evening air. The unflappable
Kiwi tactician, Brad Butterworth, blinking Champagne spray from his
eyes and bellowing commands into a handheld radio against the din,
had the unenviable job of steering NZL 60 alongside.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, the New Zealanders took turns passing the cup around
and pressing it overhead, like Wimbledon champions. On the bow of
the winning yacht, the Kiwi supermodel Rachel Hunter, the pop
singer Rod Stewart's former wife, kicked up her heels in a victory
dance.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the boat, there was a more touching
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Clambering with difficulty from an inflatable dinghy to the
transom of NZL 60, the Kiwi skipper Russell Coutts' elderly father,
Allan, scrambled aboard and embraced his son. Coutts is known and
sometimes criticized for his restrained persona, but now his
unguarded sudden emotion was heart-wrenching.
</P>
<P>
   Although Coutts had elected not to sail the deciding race _ he
instead handed the wheel to the 26-year-old backup helmsman, Dean
Barker _ it was still very much his day. For in the grand gesture
of turning over command to his understudy, Coutts had underscored
his mantra that Team New Zealand was a well-rounded team. More
importantly, perhaps, he cemented his role as the squad's
undisputed, unselfish leader.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Coutts said: ``We want to hold this cup for a long time.
How long? Well, last night someone said 25 years, and that's not a
bad target.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Kiwis are to hold the cup for an extended spell, they
will need to cultivate young talent, which is why Barker was thrust
into the limelight for the final contest. And Barker was also at
the center of one of Thursday's signature moments, when he
liberated the cup for a long boat ride around the perimeter of the
basin, exhibiting the trophy to the gathered masses beyond the
viewpoint of the central barge.
</P>
<P>
   Barker could barely contain his pure, unabashed joy. Nor, in
return, could his countrymen. All wearing smiles, they were secure
in their knowledge that, for the foreseeable future, their
cup-holding nation remains the center of the yacht-racing world.
The cup was then escorted home, but the party raged into the night.

THEORY ON HAIDER'S APPEAL: NO IDEOLOGY, MORE MARKETING
</HEADLINE>
  (subs 3rd graf to note that Haider has apologized for praising
Hitler)  
(bl) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAD KLEINKIRCHHEIM, Austria _ Here in the midst of
picture-postcard Austria _ pine-clad slopes, sun glistening on the
snow, rosy-cheeked families sipping mulled wine _ it is something
of a surprise to encounter Matthias Krenn and his modern political
theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political populism is just modern marketing,'' Krenn said
casually as he sat in the lobby of one of the hotels he owns. ``In
politics today, you have to sell your services like any other
product. So you listen carefully to what each person wants and
respond accordingly. That is why Joerg Haider is such a successful
political marketer.''
</P>
<P>
   Krenn, 40, is a hotelier from the southern province of
Carinthia, the heartland of Haiderism, and a representative figure
of the young entrepreneurs who have helped thrust Haider's
catch-all Freedom Party to power. While the world tends to see
Haider, who has made _ and later apologized for _ statements
praising aspects of Hitler's rule, as a xenophobic rightist, Krenn
sees him as Austria's answer to Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   For him, Haider's message has less to do with Nazi revisionism
or anti-immigrant vitriol than with market reform. It is about less
state. Deregulation. Sweeping privatizations. Reduced bureaucracy.
An end to the division of the spoils in Austria among members of
the long-dominant Social Democratic and conservative People's
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Krenn's is a popular view in Austria. About one-third of the
support that took the Freedom Party into national government in
February for the first time comes from entrepreneurs, particularly
in the small companies like the Krenn hotel group that dominate the
Austrian economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To understand Haider, you must see that he's a late edition of
the neo-conservative wave that totally passed Austria by in the
1980s and 1990s,'' said Lothar Hoebelt, a historian sympathetic to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Austria's political system was long distinguished by
immobility. During three decades of Social-Democratic-led rule,
stability came before market reform, and state jobs were useful to
reward political loyalty. The state still owns the national
telephone company and main tobacco corporation; as such, it is now
a European anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   But a look at how Haider operates in Carinthia, where he won 42
percent of the vote in the regional election last year, suggests
that promoting the free market is merely one ingredient of his
heady brew.
</P>
<P>
   Haider quit Feb. 28 as leader of the Freedom Party but retained
his post as governor of Carinthia. The resignation was widely seen
as a maneuver to shield himself from any unpopularity the new
government may encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Take Thatcherism, add a dose of Robin Hood, some designer
labels, a touch of Austria-first bigotry, a dollop of straight talk
and fanatical physical fitness, and the seductive magician of
modern European politics emerges, a man who has taken his party
from 4 to 27 percent of the vote in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Klagenfurt, seat of Haider's regional government,
``Joergs Treff'' is a popular meeting place. In this Freedom Party
office, young people can surf the Internet or play video games on
computers provided by the governor. Posters plastered on the
windows show a baby brandishing a check for 5,700 Schillings, about
$407.
</P>
<P>
   A bubble from the baby's mouth reads: ``This check can be cashed
with Governor Haider.'' It is a reference to Haider's promise to
hand out monthly checks to mothers with small children in order to
strengthen the family and boost Austria's falling birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   So, the prophet of leaner government, more individual
responsibility and tighter state budgets is also the proponent of
an ambitious new program of state handouts? Well, yes, so it seems,
if that is what brings in the votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children's check cannot be financed,'' said Franz Pacher,
a businessman who is president of the Carinthian Chamber of
Commerce and who opposes Haider. ``It could cost as much as $175
million a year, or close to one tenth of the state budget. But of
course the promise has won him a lot of popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Haider said the program could be financed and
that the checks would be paid: ``You see, on the one hand I am a
kind of Margaret Thatcher pushing lean government and the end of
party influence. On the other, I am a new Social Democrat, pushing
family values and taking care of the smaller people against the
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled his gleaming smile and added: ``That is why I like to
say that I am not to the left or the right of my opponents. I am
simply ahead of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how long Haider can stay ahead of the game, and continue to
appeal both to rising entrepreneurs and to the less privileged, who
like the look of his largesse, is the question now posed by the
Freedom Party's entry into government.
</P>
<P>
   Karl-Heinz Grasser, the 31-year-old national finance minister
and a home-grown Carinthian protege of Haider, is attempting to do
on a national scale something of what the party leader has done
locally.
</P>
<P>
   He has vowed to eliminate about 9,000 state jobs, sell off state
industries, raise the retirement age and reduce pensions for early
retirees in order to bring the budget deficit down to 1.7 percent
of Austria's total output from well over 2 percent. All doctrinaire
market-oriented policy straight out the textbook.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Grasser wants to increase state support for
the family by extending fully paid maternity and paternity leaves
and by introducing other measures that Haider said would include
extending the promised ``child checks'' to a national level. That
would cost close to $3 billion _ about what the finance minister
has promised to cut this year in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do it the American way,'' said Thomas Prinzhorn, a
prominent Freedom Party member of Parliament who owns a large paper
company. ``We're Austria's only free-market party. At the same
time, Haider feels passionate about the family and social justice,
so we have to balance these things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Haiderian ``balance'' appears to involve other elements.
Michael Stattman, a Klagenfurt businessman, said that when Grasser
was in charge of economic policy in Carinthia, he tried to impose
an ``Austrians-first'' principle on hiring for building sites in
the province. This angered some entrepreneurs, who faced the loss
of cheaper foreign labor.
</P>
<P>
   Prinzhorn has also made some notable anti-foreigner statements,
including a remark during the national election campaign last year
that foreigners in Austria were getting free hormone treatment from
the country's health services ``in order to increase their
fertility.'' He has since apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Max Hofmann, a leader of a business group supporting Haider
called the Circle of Freedom Party Enterprises, said there was
nothing xenophobic about such remarks or the party's approach to
business. Both simply reflected the fact that, in a small country,
``We can only invite in foreign people when we have enough work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, the owner of a central-heating business, said the
Freedom Party is a post-ideological party that wants to scale back
the state but also to appeal to workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think in terms of appealing either to workers or to
entrepreneurs is the thinking of the past,'' he said. ``There is no
more class struggle. There is only the joint interest of workers
and management in making Austria a good place to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Haider has been highly successful in promoting this
message. His support among entrepreneurs has been matched by strong
support from blue-collar workers who fear the loss of jobs to
foreigners and seem to feel more identification with Haider's
slickly marketed nationalism than with the socialism of old.
</P>
<P>
   In Klagenfurt, one catch phrase promoted by the governor is
``the Silicon Alps'' _ the slogan of several new technology
companies that have set up shop here. At the same time, Haider
loves to promote local folklore against ``cultural globalization.''
The clear idea is a very broad laptops-to-loden-coats political
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For Pacher, the leader of the Klagenfurt Chamber of Commerce,
Haider is simply ``the master of disguises, the great European
illusionist.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Krenn, the hotelier, the Haider message is consistent:
``The old government was selling you tired wares badly. I'm selling
you new goods and I'm doing it well.''

MODESTLY, INDIA GOES FOR A PUBLIC SWIM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ With its acres of artificial rivers and cement
oceans painted swimming-pool blue, Water Kingdom could almost pass
for a theme park in Florida, if it weren't for the men in turbans
who are bobbing in the wave pools and the women sailing down the
water slide in pants and long-sleeved shirts.
</P>
<P>
   But Bombay is a long way from Orlando. The water park here was
built for people who don't know how to swim; it rents swimsuits to
women who have never worn one before. Sarabjit Kaur, dressed in a
bathing costume of long black stretch pants and a loose T-shirt,
shuddered at the thought of a one-piece, never mind a bikini.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our culture doesn't allow us,'' she said shyly. Her husband,
Tanjendar Singh Sodhi, a well-traveled banker, explained: ``Things
are changing. She wouldn't have even worn this five years back. Now
she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Water amusement parks are springing up all over India, in New
Delhi and Bombay, in Madras and Hyderabad, in Ahmedabad and Indore
_ signs of change in a country where tens of millions of people
have benefited from an increasingly open, market-driven economy
over the past decade. They have money to spend on luxuries that
their parents could never have afforded, or even imagined.
</P>
<P>
   India may still conjure up exotic images of snake charmers,
leprous beggars and bejeweled maharajas, but there is a new middle
class rising here, and its members are busily doing the consumerist
things that the middle classes do everywhere: shopping for
refrigerators, chatting on the phone, watching cable television _
and looking for fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leisure is on the boom here,'' said Rajen Shah, general
secretary of the Indian Association of Amusement Parks and
Industries. ``One Sunday, people will go to a bowling alley or a
pool parlor. The next Sunday, they'll go to a water park.''
</P>
<P>
   Gautam and Madhauri Varik are just such a couple. He owns a
small workshop that assembles electronic gadgets using circuits
from Singapore. She sells chemicals to biotechnology laboratories.
Each has a master's degree, and together they earn roughly $4,000 a
year, about five times the national average, putting them in the
upper middle class.
</P>
<P>
   They have a far higher standard of living than their parents
did. Varik grew up in a one-room house with three other family
members. He and his wife, who have no children, live in a two-room
apartment with a kitchen and a host of appliances, including a
refrigerator, washing machine, television, VCR, CD player and
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   They enjoy their prosperity, but their lives are more hectic
than those of their parents. Neither of their mothers had jobs, but
Varik works and travels almost as intensively as her husband.
``They had more free time than us,'' she said, a bit wistfully, of
her parents' generation. ``We are working too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Variks look for convenient places to relax. They enjoy
going out to play billiards, and on a recent Sunday they tried
Water Kingdom for the first time. ``One of my friends took his wife
here,'' Varik said, as he sat next to a wading pool. ``He insisted
this was the best place to spend a weekend. And it is fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists caution that being in the middle of the Indian income
range doesn't yield anything like the buying power of a
middle-class income in western Europe or North America. Iswar
Natarajan, chief economist at the National Council of Applied
Economic Research in New Delhi, thinks a better term for this group
might be the consuming class.
</P>
<P>
   Using survey data, he estimates that the number of households in
this class, with incomes of $1,200 to $6,000 a year, has almost
doubled in the past decade, to about 39 million. That translates to
220 million of India's one billion people. Most still cannot afford
a big-ticket item like a car, but they still find themselves with
growing amounts of disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Goel's family owns the 22-acre Water Kingdom park, which
had more than half a million customers last year. Goel said a
typical visitor to the park spent about $5 over all, including
admission, suit and locker rentals and snacks; at a water park in
the United States, $5 might not even cover parking. Prices are kept
affordable at Indian parks by low labor costs and the fact that
there is no off season _ the weather is warm all year round in most
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Parks like Water Kingdom adapt to the needs of local customers
in ways besides price. Almost all the pools are shallow, because
few Indians can swim, Goel said. Women, most of whom rent their
bathing gear, can choose among styles that reveal as much or as
little skin as they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swimming gear has been tailor-made for the Indian
psyche,'' Goel said. ``You can cover from wrist to ankle. We have
all the kinds. But the two-piece does not exist.''

   There are now about 80 water parks, large and small, in India,
most of them opened in the last few years, said Shah, who besides
heading the trade association is also managing director of the
Arihant Industrial Corp., which manufactured the water slides and
wave pools used at about 60 of the parks.

<P>
   On a recent Sunday, Water Kingdom was full of playful scenes.
There were young lovebirds floating in inner tubes down Drifting
River; lumpy, out-of-shape people lined up to buy french fries and
a Coke at an on-site McDonald's, and families riding the waves in
Wetlantic.

<P>
   Meenaxi Patel, a homemaker, sat astride a large inflatable
crocodile in the wading pool at Goofers Lagoon with a group of
other women from her apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come, all the ladies and kids, no gents,'' she said.
``My husband is very sporting. If I go out with the kids, he feels
good. He's at home relaxing. My mother-in-law is also there,
resting.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others in the park, Patel spoke of freedom and fun as the
parks' big draws. Wearing her own colorful swimming costume, a
style that covered her thighs and upper arms but that was gaily
splashed with fuchsia flowers, she said she and her friends had
left all their worries behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that women stayed at home,'' she said. ``They
wouldn't wear these costumes and come out. But times have changed.
We want to enjoy.''

GOVERNOR PROPOSES GIVING A LAPTOP COMPUTER TO EVERY 7TH-GRADER IN
MAINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story runs without a byline.) 
(DW) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gov. Angus King of Maine announced a plan Thursday to
give every seventh-grader in the state a laptop computer, to use at
school or at home.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the first such statewide initiative, about
17,000 students a year would receive computers as well as Internet
service, beginning in fall 2002. Within six years, all Maine
students above the sixth grade would have laptops that would be
theirs to keep.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said his goal was to bridge the ``digital divide''
between students who have computers at home and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most schools in America have a computer lab,'' he said. ``The
problem is the computer lab is down the hall and once a week. I
want Maine to have the most digitally literate society on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   But the $65 million plan, part of the governor's revised budget
proposal for the two-year period ending June 30, 2001, immediately
met with skepticism from members of the Legislature, many of whom
said they saw far more pressing needs in Maine's education system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know there is a great need for school construction and
renovation, one-time needs that we know are out there,'' said Sen.
Michael Michaud, a Democrat who is co-chairman of the
Appropriations Committee that must review the financing request.
</P>
<P>
   Maine is facing a $200 million backlog of school repair
projects. Just last week, the Education Committee recommended that
the state increase its contribution to local education by $44
million.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Elizabeth Townsend, also a Democrat and co-chairwoman of
the Appropriations Committee, called it a ``flashy and fun''
proposal, but one that had little chance of winning approval in the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear day after day from people who have buckets in their
school buildings to catch the rain,'' Townsend said. ``When I go
door to door and ask people about their concerns, nobody has ever
said to me: `My seventh-grader doesn't have a laptop. Would you fix
that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet King, an independent, said that he had gotten plenty of
positive response from educators as well as members of the
Democratic-led Legislature and that he was not put off by initial
eyebrow-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bold plan, and if it was something that everyone
would immediately say yes to, it would have been done a long time
ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal breaks new ground in other ways, including how it
would be financed. He suggests that $50 million from the state's
unallocated budget surplus be put in a permanent endowment, along
with $15 million in matching funds from Federal and private
sources. The annual interest on the fund would pay for the
computers, estimated to cost about $500 for each student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot think of a precedent of this in state government, to
set up a foundation with state money,'' said Mark W. Lawrence, a
Democrat who is president of the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially taking a chunk of money, setting up a foundation _
that's very different and I think that's going to be debated in the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   The project would not have been feasible without the budget
surplus, King said. He was also encouraged by the Ford Motor Co.'s
recent announcement that it would provide computers and Internet
service for $5 a month to all its employees worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   King also sees the laptop proposal as a good way to change
Maine's reputation as a backwoods state.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think of Maine as a vacation place,'' he said,
yet in 1995 it was the first state to require all its public
schools and libraries to be wired for Internet access. Students
receiving laptops would get Internet access through the existing
school network.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker G. Steven Rowe said he wanted to embrace
technology for students, but he went on to say: ``Fifty million
dollars is a lot of money in Maine; it's a lot money anywhere. This
would be something that certainly would be a nice thing to do, but
we don't have unlimited funds.''
</P>
<P>
   King expects to know within the month whether his idea will have
a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big deal to bring forward late in the legislative
session,'' acknowledged King, who is not running for re-election.
``I didn't want to spend my retirement years looking back on a good
idea that I didn't try. This job is too aggravating not to try new
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he firmly believed that other states were moving toward
the same idea. ``The only question is,'' he said, ``is Maine going
to lead or lag?''  &QL;

c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cheryl Marks has a good job and close friends. She travels
often. She's healthy. What's missing? A relationship. And though
she never defined herself by her marital status, after turning 31
last year, she decided to take action.
</P>
<P>
   So Marks, director of treasury and cash management for the
Children's Television Workshop, did what so many other New Yorkers
do: She signed up for a class, in this case one taught by Marilyn
Graman, a psychotherapist, on how to land a husband.
</P>
<P>
   While feminists might bridle at the course objective and the
curriculum, Marks found herself studying alongside Wall Street
brokers, advertising executives, physicians, computer experts _
women who have a firm handle on the career thing but need a little
help on the home front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women in the corporate world confuse softness and tenderness
with weakness,'' said Graman, 53, a widow. ``My goal is to teach
softness as power.'' She half-jokingly refers to her program as the
Marilyn Graman Finishing School for Feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Graman began her latest class, ``Marriage Works,'' a
six-month, 276-hour course intended to lead businesswomen down the
aisle. The cost is $9,600.
</P>
<P>
   Part therapy session, part personal pep rally, the course is
broken down into modules about aspects of the mating game: 40 hours
to study why participants might have a ``relationship block''; 26
hours to talk with a ``guidess,'' a paid relationship coach cum
cheerleader who has already reaped the fruits of a Graman course;
and 11 hours to discuss color, furniture placement and feng shui,
the Asian art of energy flow.
</P>
<P>
   The course also devotes 9 hours to learning to move gracefully,
8 to wardrobe and 3.5 to the art of gracious gift receiving.
</P>
<P>
   The finale is a field trip to a bridal shop, where women try on
dresses and visualize their wedding day. ``If you see it, you can
have it,'' said Graman, who leads similar workshops in Dallas and
San Francisco. So far, eight women, ages 25 to 65, have signed up
for the Manhattan course.
</P>
<P>
   You can just about guess what the editor of Ms. magazine thinks
of all this. ``I worry when women say women have to be soft
again,'' said Gloria Jacobs, the editor. ``Women are different from
men, but does that mean we're all soft and nurturing? That's
ridiculous. The goal is to have the freedom to be who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jacobs finds the whole concept of Graman's finishing
school rather annoying. ``Everyone wants relationships; that's
human nature,'' she said. `But what I don't get is the idea that
you can buy a relationship, or that if you spend enough money
you'll be able to communicate with another human being if you have
the right clothes or the right furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why aren't men being encouraged to do this?'' Jacobs asked.
``Why does marriage have to be the end result here?''
</P>
<P>
   On a snowy afternoon in mid-February, Marks is in her
600-square-foot Upper West Side apartment with Graman, Robin
Lennon, an interior designer, and Debra Cox, an image consultant.
Today's lesson: making your home more man-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of thoughts do you want him to have when he walks in
the door?'' Graman asked. ``This is a Rorschach test. When a man
walks into a woman's house, he wants to feel that he has a space in
her world. That he belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gazing at her penguin collection, photographs of herself in
exotic locales, a Nordic Track and the bicycle leaning against her
sofa, Marks replied, ``I want to be comfortable here, and I want a
man to be, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work a lot, but I don't want to give that impression,'' she
said. ``I want playfulness in the apartment. I also don't want it
to look like a college dorm.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking from room to room, Lennon deconstructed the apartment
with a firm but gentle hand. Too many tchotchkes. Not enough light.
Dump the boom box. Scatter pillows on the bed. Spritz perfume on
the sheets. Get rid of clutter; it keeps men at bay. Paint the
walls in soft, sexy colors: salmon or peach or rose.
</P>
<P>
   And the bike? ``Do you use it?'' Lennon asked.
</P>
<P>
   Not in months, Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want someone to think you're athletic, it's good,''
Lennon said. ``Otherwise, could we put it in storage?'' Marks
nodded meekly.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the wardrobe. Since November, Marks had been out with 23
different men whom she met online and through dating services.
Mostly, they met after work when she was still in professional
garb.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to have clothes that reflect all the sides of you,''
Cox said as she went through Marks's closet, which was filled with
corporate suits but lacking less formal attire. ``You want to be
professional, approachable, and feminine. You don't want men to
think you're a man.''
</P>
<P>
   She held up a dark blue wool skirt and jacket. ``This is fine
for the work world, but in the dating arena you want something a
little more approachable and feminine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dark suit says, `I'm one of the guys,''' Graman added. ``A
buttoned-up jacket screams `I'm unapproachable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cox then plucked a silk lavender suit from the closet. Her face
brightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference!'' she said. ``You look sexy and young.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks admired her reflection in the mirror. She clipped on a
pair of dangly silver earrings she had borrowed from Graman. The
women oohed and aahed. Marks smiled. Then she scribbled in a little
notebook. There was a lot to remember.
</P>
<P>
   If all this all seems a little dated, a little Cosmo, no one is
forcing women to enroll. According to Marks, her office colleagues
constantly ask for relationship advice and want her to conduct a
seminar based on her newfound knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Graman said the women in her course must first be happy with
themselves; she lives by the motto ``the rose is itself and the bee
comes.'' She does not advise women to change themselves or to
deceive their men.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, she said, she was the stereotypical angry feminist.
But ``there was a softness that was missing in me,'' she said. ``I
wasn't getting everything I wanted that way, and it was time to
stop being angry at others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the feminist movement needed to happen. In order to
make change, you need to go far to the other side. Women had to
stop being like women in order to be successful, and now we're
coming somewhere in the center. We're learning how powerful it can
be to be soft and tender.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women have worked with her and discovered that they do not
want to be married. Others have ended bad relationships. And
contrary to popular perception, she stressed, Manhattan is teeming
with men who are eager to tie the knot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not the enemy,'' she said. ``I see a lot of men in
business who are longing for a wife, for someone by their side.
When the house is empty, they feel lonely. That's why I have no
doubt that I can help a woman find a man, because I know there are
men out there that want to find her.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In that first scene in a Connecticut kitchen _ with
its country table and canisters of beans, Trix cereal and tricolor
pasta on the counter _ you can almost smell the decaf brewing,
taste the lemon almond polenta cake Beth devours down to the last
crumb and ache with her as she confesses to her closest friends,
Karen and Gabe, that her husband, Tom, is leaving her for another
woman.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes through the next six scenes of ``Dinner With
Friends,'' from the bedroom strewn with Beth's crumpled tissues,
where she and Tom ruthlessly confront each other later that
evening; to Karen and Gabe's well-appointed living room, where they
lounge on their couch mulling over Beth's news; to a rustic house
on Martha's Vineyard, where Karen chops garlic for a marinade and
Gabe slices limes for margaritas as they prepare to introduce Beth
to Tom more than a decade earlier; to Karen's sunny patio where,
over fruit salad, she and Beth painfully delve into their
differences; to a Manhattan bar, where the men do the same over
Pellegrino; and finally back to the Vineyard, where Karen and Gabe
slip between their crisp summer sheets and talk about what it takes
to tend a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what it's like to perform the same play, night after
night, week after week, perhaps month after month or more. Does it
reach into the actors' private lives? Cause them to rethink values
or priorities? Perhaps even aggravate troubles in their personal
relationships?
</P>
<P>
   Given its delicate subject matter _ issues that cut so close to
the bone _ ``Dinner With Friends'' would seem to be an especially
challenging acting assignment. The play, written by Donald
Margulies (45, married for 13 years, with one child) and directed
by Daniel Sullivan (59, divorced three times) tackles thorny yet
elemental topics like how the pragmatic minutiae of a marriage _
``having kids ... having to pay the mortgage ... making the
deadline ... marinating the snapper,'' in Gabe's words _ can
eclipse the passion. It also explores what happens to friendships
when they are tested by change and time and whether even the
strongest ties can survive the truth.
</P>
<P>
   While all of this might be easily dismissed as the stuff of
daytime drama or just so much middle-class, middle-aged angst,
``Dinner With Friends'' appears to have proved itself a play for
our time. The universality of its perspective has clearly resonated
with audiences of varied ages. Largely on word of mouth, the play,
which cost $660,000 to mount at the Variety Arts Theater, has been
selling $20,000 worth of tickets a day, which is high for
off-Broadway. And Mitchell Maxwell, one of its producers, said he
expected to break even by the end of March. Postshow discussions
have been lively, indicating that ``Dinner With Friends'' strikes a
nerve and sends people into the street arguing about what they've
seen. Reviewing the play, Peter Marks wrote in The New York Times:
``It is wry and keenly observed and bathed in the unspoken sorrow
that can sneak up on you in middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   And the play, originally commissioned by the Actors Theater of
Louisville, is a hit in Paris, where it has been produced in
translation. The play had its world premiere in the 1998 Humana
Festival of New American Plays; a revised version was produced
later that year by South Coast Repertory in California.
</P>
<P>
   The dead-on realism of ``Dinner With Friends'' _ its familiar
dynamics and resonant details _ makes the play both compelling and
unsettling. The playwright said he once saw a man in the audience
pull on his coat at intermission and say to his companions, ``I'll
meet you after the show; this is just too close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   So if sitting through ``Dinner With Friends'' can be disquieting
for the audience, what, then, can living through it be like for the
actors? In interviews, each of the four performers in the
well-oiled ensemble talked about the experience of performing the
play over a long time. Carolyn McCormick is the only cast member
who has not been with the production since it opened in New York on
Nov. 4; she replaced Julie White as Beth on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The actors all touched on how ``Dinner With Friends'' has made
them look with new eyes at their own marriages and friendships,
along with those of their parents, colleagues and friends. They
said the play had made them examine the degree to which they
resemble the characters they play, relate to them, pity them,
admire them, judge them and forgive them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kilner (Tom)
</P>
<P>
   To watch Kevin Kilner play Tom is to believe that he must be
just like him in real life, so completely does he seem to inhabit
the role of a handsome corporate lawyer in midlife crisis who talks
about his emotional needs yet seems to lack emotional depth. But to
sit with Kilner, 41, over bowls of oatmeal and bananas is to
realize that Kilner plays Tom as thoroughly as he does precisely
because he has perspective on him. The actor has clearly given
considerable thought to what prompts Tom to make the choices he
does, to leave a wife and two children for a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``While he may be able to function as a lawyer, he is
immature,'' Kilner said. ``He lacks the emotional vocabulary that
would enable him to be a good husband or father.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as there is no black and white in Margulies' play, Kilner's
response to his character is more complex than merely critical. In
fact, Kilner said, he has grown to respect Tom's decision to come
clean about his discontent and to try to do something about it.
``He's the first in the group of four to hold his hand up and say,
`I'm not happy,''' Kilner said. ``And the bottom line of anyone's
life is, `I should be happy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kilner's response to his character wasn't always so nuanced. At
first, he said, he doubted his ability to pull off the part and
shared his misgivings with his wife, Jordan Baker, also an actress,
who was working in California at the time. ``I was calling her in
San Diego saying: `I don't know if I can do this guy. I don't
understand him in so many ways,''' Kilner said. ``It's hard to play
someone who's so unconscious when you've become conscious yourself
_ even hyper-conscious. It was hard for me to go back and play
someone who was irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilner said that his role tended to elicit the most visceral _
even vocal _ reactions from the audience and that there had been
performances in which people burst out with such disparaging
responses to Tom's lines as, ``Oh, please, get over yourself'' and
``Tsk, tsk, tsk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kilner said the words of one audience member made him feel
as if he had at least succeeded at making Tom more than a
one-dimensional adulterer, ``I hated you in the first act, but I
understood you in the second.''
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely to ensure that this insight into Tom would be
possible, Kilner said, that he spoke up on the third day of
rehearsal. ``I said, `I have to talk about something that's
bothering me,''' he recalled. ` ``I don't mention my children at
all, and I have no defense of why I did what I do.''' In response,
Kilner said, Margulies agreed to write additional lines for the bar
scene between Tom and Gabe that helped shed some light on Tom's
upbringing and how it might have shaped him.
</P>
<P>
   GABE: Marriages all go through a kind of base-line wretchedness
from time to time, but we do what we can to ride those patches out.
</P>
<P>
   TOM: Like my parents did? Like your parents? They ``rode it
out'' for 50 years! Is that what you'd want me to do? Is it? What
kind of example would that be setting for my kids? That we're all
powerless to change our lives? You make a mistake, too bad, you
just have to live with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get some glimpse of what his childhood was _ that he
was emotionally malformed,'' Kilner said, ``you can hate that _
especially if you have had a bad experience with it _ but then you
have to accept it as a truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilner had been married just a year when he went into rehearsal
for ``Dinner With Friends,'' which he said created an odd
juxtaposition between beginning to build a marriage in real life
even as his marriage in the play was unraveling. ``It was weird to
be so unhappy when I was so happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kilner's last performance will be on March 12; he said he would
then head for Los Angeles to try to earn more money in movies or
television. And while he feels he has no choice financially but to
leave, he said, he will forever be affected by ``Dinner With
Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This play is really about how do you choose to live your life:
each individual person alone has to face this, has to make choices
and live with them,'' he said. ``It has powerful implications in
the arguments between all of them. They continually discover and
define for themselves what they will live with and not live with.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn McCormick (Beth)
</P>
<P>
   All four actors in ``Dinner With Friends'' are married to other
actors; all but Kilner have children, and all described their
relationships with their spouses as self-aware and communicative.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick, who is in her late 30s, said the play prompted her to
think about her own marriage (to Byron Jennings) in relation to
that of her parents, who divorced when she was 24. ``It made me
continue to, with great vigilance, not take anything for granted,''
she said over coffee. ``It reaffirmed to me how delicate marriages
are and how much work and how worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all the actors spoke of marriage as something that takes
attentiveness and effort, given that long-term unions often suffer
from neglect. McCormick seemed to have a particularly relaxed
attitude toward cycles, believing that relationships' cool or tense
periods eventually pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can always be recharged,'' she said. ``Relationships are
not linear.''
</P>
<P>
   Because she is more circumspect than Beth in her own life and
tends to play controlling characters, McCormick said, she relishes
the out-there quality of her current role. ``I just love this
character,' McCormick said. ``I like her openness and her
accessibility. She just calls it like she sees it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is such a great juxtaposition to Karen. Because she
doesn't try to control anything. She's a spewer.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress said the toughest spewing for her occurs in Act II
when she talks to Karen over lunch about how it feels to be in love
again after separating from Tom, and comes up against Karen's
obvious disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   BETH: You know what I think? I think you love it when I'm a
mess.
</P>
<P>
   KAREN: What?!
</P>
<P>
   BETH: You do. You love it when I'm all over the place, flailing
about. I finally find someone who's like a _ like an anchor and you
don't want to hear about it!
</P>
<P>
   KAREN: That is not true.
</P>
<P>
   BETH: As long as I'm artsy and incompetent, everything is fine.
The minute I show any signs of being on equal footing with you,
forget it; you can't deal with it, you have to knock me over!
</P>
<P>
   McCormick said different things influenced her performance,
including the audience. ``When I know someone is in the house, I'll
hear things through their ears,'' she said. ``If I have a friend
out there who's going through divorce or someone who has had a
husband say some of those things. So every night it's a little
different, because different things are coursing through my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You do think a lot about your life,'' added McCormick, who
gave birth to her second son four months ago. (Her first is 3.)
``You think about the kids' reality of a father leaving and just
how truly tragic that is. I still can't help feel a great
sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Arkin (Gabe)
</P>
<P>
   If the roles of Tom and Beth are something of a stretch for
Kilner and McCormick, Matthew Arkin says he was born to play Gabe.
He almost failed to land the part, he said, and told his agent to
tell the director he would ``crawl through glass'' to get it. After
several call-backs, he succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what it says about marriage, about what it takes to
make that commitment work,'' the 39-year-old actor said over a bowl
of Chinese noodles. ``That it's hard, back-breaking work for the
best reward you can possibly get, but if you don't pay attention to
it, it can stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had that philosophy. But this play sharpened it, or
said it in a way that says it better than I ever could.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is not entirely Gabe, Arkin said: ``I'm a little bit
better at confrontation than Gabe is. I'm a little bit better about
getting in there and talking about the hard stuff with my wife. I
go to therapy; Gabe doesn't. I think if Gabe did, he'd be just like
me in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is already very much in sync with his character,
Arkin said, playing the role, along with growing older and being a
parent (he and his wife, Pamela Newkirk-Arkin, have a 2-year-old
son), has changed him in certain ways. ``It's made me be a little
bit more forgiving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Arkin said he had come to realize that Gabe has
little right to feel betrayed by Tom's betrayal of his wife. ``Your
best friend doesn't promise to stay married so you can grow old
together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments in the play, Arkin said, when he is supposed
to cry and can't, as in the final bedroom scene, and moments when
he can't help it, as in the bar scene. ``It's very upsetting to me,
the loss of that friendship,'' he said. ``When I get to the part,
`We had a vow . . .'''
</P>
<P>
   GABE: We had a vow, too, you know. Not a marriage, but something
like it.
</P>
<P>
   TOM: Yeah?
</P>
<P>
   GABE: We were supposed to get old and fat together, the four of
us, and watch each other's kids grow up, and cry together at their
weddings . . .
</P>
<P>
   TOM: It's not like I'm dead, you know . . .
</P>
<P>
   GABE: I guess I mean, I thought we were in this together. You
know? For life.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin said the final scene with Emery, in which Gabe and Karen
talk about ``when practical matters begin to outweigh . . .
abandon,'' is also loaded with emotion for him _ particularly
because he is the child of divorced parents and his father, the
actor Alan Arkin, recently divorced his second wife after 34 years
of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so much in the middle of that now,'' Arkin said. ``What my
wife and I are battling _ how do you keep all that stuff that got
you going in the beginning alive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still scared because of what my parents went through,'' he
continued. ``I worry that there are all these hidden land mines I
don't know anything about. I sometimes say, `Who am I to think I'm
going to make it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Emery (Karen)
</P>
<P>
   The backstage set changes in ``Dinner With Friends'' amount to
something of a show all their own, particularly given how ambitious
they are for a tight off-Broadway house.
</P>
<P>
   On a revolving stage that is within inches of a wall, with the
requisite rapid-fire speed and muscular grace, seven crew members
manage to transform the play's highly specific environments,
designed by Neil Patel, seven times, down to the most specific
details, from the Chex mix on the bar to the toy dinosaurs on the
sisal rug in Karen and Gabe's living room to the square ceramic
plate on a bureau containing odd items that could have been dumped
from Beth's purse or Tom's pocket: a match box, a pencil, a stray
Tootsie Roll, loose change.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who's remembering, building the Martha's Vineyard
house for the top of Act II initially took 50 to 90 minutes in
technical rehearsals before the show opened out of town in
Stamford, Conn. Now the crew does it during the 20-minute
intermission, down to the many household items itemized on the prop
list: ginger grater, shallot, paring knife, four carrot sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Emery, along with her fellow actors, said that those
physical details helped ground her performance, that actually
making a marinade _ she considered jarring it to take home but gave
up on the idea _ made the experience of the play much more real,
even though her hands end up smelling of garlic and scallions for
the rest of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The final scene in a Martha's Vineyard bedroom seems perhaps the
most spare and pristine, from the still unpacked open suitcase
containing fresh linens and an alarm clock, suggesting Karen and
Gabe's recent arrival, to the books on the warmly lighted bedside
tables _ for her ``In Nonna's Kitchen: Recipes and Traditions From
Italy's Grandmothers,'' for him ``State of the Union'' (with folded
reading glasses on top).
</P>
<P>
   With a wicker chest at the foot of the bed and two photos on the
walls, the room becomes a tranquil beach home on a soft summer
evening. One can almost hear the crickets and feel the night's
coolness through the sheer white curtain over the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   At one recent performance, out of sight of the audience, Emery
came in and lay down on her back on the bed before the scene began.
She said later that the scene was the most difficult one to do
because of the part when Gabe says, ``Boo.''
</P>
<P>
   The boo recalls a joke the couple shared when they were young;
Gabe would pretend to scare Karen, and the boo that followed would
lead to lovemaking. ``It was hard at the beginning because I wasn't
sure what was the right approach,'' Emery said over a maple scone.
``I think what we've arrived at is, you see two people who are
still connected, although they don't think that little game is
going to fix anything. But you see them trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Emery, who is in her 40's, said being in a play that is so
familiar felt both simpler and more complicated than other
projects. ``In some ways it's easier,'' she said. ``You don't have
to go in and put on tight foundation garments and high heels.
You're comfortable. You're in your own home, it's just like life,
there's no time tripping.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, that's what makes it hard. You live your
life with your husband and your kid, and you go into the theater
and live your life with your husband and your kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Emery said she and her husband, Josh Pais, already had the kind
of frankness that Karen and Gabe are fumbling toward. ``We're
always stock-taking and kind of assessing our marriage and where it
is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she said, ``Dinner With Friends'' prompted a
deeper level of introspection, as well as an even more profound
appreciation for her husband, their 6-year-old son and what they
have built together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't dive that deeply into a play without its having an
effect on your life,'' she said. ``It permeates your life. Just the
way your life permeates a play.''
</P>
<P>
   WHEN AND WHERE
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinner With Friends'' is at the Variety Arts Theater, 110
Third Ave., at 13th Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200.
Performances are Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 3

PINOCHET, RELEASED FROM BRITAIN, FACES A BATTLE AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also PINOCHET) 
(sw) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Britain abruptly dropped extradition
proceedings on Thursday against Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who then
headed home to Chile where his political opponents were waiting,
intent on making him face months, if not years, of additional court
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   After 16 months of house arrest in distant London, where he
waited out excruciating legal twists and turns, Pinochet was told
by Britain's home secretary, Jack Straw, early on Thursday that
because of his failing health he did not have to stand trial in
Spain on charges of gross human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Straw's ruling ended Pinochet's plight in Europe, his
case is expected to have far-reaching implications in international
law governing human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-year-old former dictator was accused of abducting,
torturing and executing thousands of political prisoners during his
17-year authoritarian rule in Chile. As the case now shifts to his
homeland, it will undoubtedly have an important political impact on
the new civilian government and the still-powerful armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Ricardo Lagos, a Socialist who takes office in
nine days, has promised to let justice run its course. But the
departing government of President Eduardo Frei is quietly pushing a
constitutional reform that would allow Pinochet to give up his
current position in the Senate and retain parliamentary immunity
from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people who had family members disappear during
Pinochet's years in power sat up most of the night holding hands
and singing folk songs while waiting for Straw's decision at the
headquarters of a human rights group. When news arrived that
Pinochet was free, they broke into sobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the last minute we thought Jack Straw would allow the
extradition,'' said Viviana Diaz, president of Family Members of
the Disappeared, ``but we always had to take into account the
enormous political effort our government made toward Britain,
Spain, France and Belgium to free Pinochet.'' But despite her
disappointment, she added, ``Pinochet left Chile as the king of the
world, and he returns a criminal condemned morally by the world.''
</P>
<P>
   By the afternoon, Diaz and other activists were in court filing
a petition to revoke Pinochet's senatorial immunity, which was
granted along with his status as a senator for life under a
Constitution written while he was still in power.
</P>
<P>
   Removal of his immunity would be necessary before an indictment
could go forward in a case alleging his involvement with a military
death squad known as the Caravan of Death, which removed scores of
political prisoners from police and army jails for execution the
month after the 1973 coup that overthrew President Salvador
Allende, a Socialist.
</P>
<P>
   Across Santiago, a hundred supporters of Pinochet celebrated at
the offices of the Pinochet Foundation with patriotic chants and
songs. But while expressing relief that the former dictator was
returning home, they said Chile's sovereignty had been sullied and
their leader had been humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one won, everyone lost,'' said Luis Cortes Villa, a retired
general who is executive director of the foundation, a private
group that promotes the former dictator's image. ``There is really
nothing to celebrate when an ex-president is arrested arbitrarily
and unfairly.''
</P>
<P>
   The government and armed forces are going out of their way to
ensure that Pinochet's arrival on Friday morning will be as
uneventful as possible. He is scheduled to land in a northern
desert town before finally arriving in Santiago, where family
members, military commanders and leaders of the Pinochet Foundation
will give him a ceremonial welcome that will not be open to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The former dictator will then be taken to the Military Hospital
for a medical checkup that will last at least two days. Officials
said he could remain there under tight security for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman Tapia of the Santiago Appeals Court, who is
investigating 60 criminal complaints against the former dictator,
has requested a battery of other medical tests be done by doctors
chosen by the courts in preparation for a possible trial. Under
Chilean law, findings of dementia or mental impairment _ though not
physical ill health _ would protect Pinochet from legal
proceedings. Last month, two newspapers in Spain quoted British
medical reports as saying that he had suffered brain damage during
two minor strokes in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year Chilean officials argued that Spain's
request to have Pinochet sent to Madrid to stand trial on torture
charges was unnecessary because the justice system here could try
him. Now that claim will be put to the test, with the armed forces
and the first Socialist president since Allende watching the case
closely.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman has been engaged in an aggressive investigation into
Pinochet's possible connection to more than 2,000 political deaths
and tens of thousands of tortures. And his ruling last year that an
amnesty decree that covered the years between 1973 and 1978 did not
cover disappearances of people who remain missing has opened the
way for the arrests of about 50 retired military and police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   But to prosecute Pinochet, Guzman must first request that the
Santiago Appeals Court lift the parliamentary immunity that
accompanies his position as a senator for life. That process could
take months or years, including appeals to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In a candlelight vigil on Thursday night in front of La Moneda,
the presidential palace, 500 protesters chanted ``No to the
amnesty, no to immunity, the blood of the dead is not negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in an effort to nudge Pinochet out of his Senate
position, Frei and a coalition of moderate and conservative
legislators have proposed a new constitutional provision that would
allow him to retire from the Congress but retain his senatorial
privileges, including salary and legal immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates say that the measure, which appears
headed for passage at the end of the month, would give Pinochet
extra protection because there would be no provision in the law to
strip immunity from a former president who is no longer serving in
the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has not spoken on the proposed constitutional measure
publicly. But while attending the presidential inauguration of
Jorge Batlle in Uruguay on Wednesday, he said: ``The conditions
exist to judge Senator-for-Life Augusto Pinochet. If that were not
the case, it would be as if to say we have a castrated democracy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Socialists like Lagos who have served in the current
Christian Democratic-Socialist coalition government, working for
Pinochet's release has been a bitter experience forced by their
need to get along with the powerful military and defend the
country's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   That explains why at the moment of a long-sought diplomatic
victory, Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes' reaction to the news
from London was so distraught. ``This has been a disgraceful affair
that has damaged the image of Chile throughout the world,'' said
Valdes, a Socialist. ``And the principal person responsible for
that is General Pinochet himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The coming judicial deliberations in Chile are bound to be
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights lawyers are likely to argue against any
parliamentary immunity defenses and against the 1973-1978 amnesty
decree as contrary to new precedents in international law that
invalidate amnesties and statutes of limitations in cases of crimes
against humanity such as torture. The Supreme Court would most
likely have to rule on this point before lower courts could judge
the former dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pinochet's lawyers are expected to argue that Guzman
does not have grounds to investigate alleged crimes committed on
military premises or during acts of military service and that any
case against the former dictator should be decided before a
military tribunal. In the past, civilian courts have given military
tribunals wide authority in cases involving military personnel.
Again, the Supreme Court would have to decide.

DIALLO FAMILY MEETS WITH JUSTICE OFFICIALS TO SEEK U.S.
PROSECUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The family of Amadou Diallo met with Justice
Department officials Thursday to press for federal prosecution of
the four police officers who were acquitted last week in the death
of Diallo, as hundreds of supporters rallied outside to express
their continuing outrage over the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, the Justice Department's
second-ranking official, released a statement after the meeting
saying that the department was reviewing all information related to
the shooting to determine whether federal civil rights laws were
violated.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, opened the
federal investigation into the shooting soon after Diallo, an
unarmed African immigrant, was killed in a hail of 41 bullets on
Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Holder's statement read in part: ``While I explained that the
standard to proceed in federal court is high, I indicated that the
review is a priority, that we have not ruled anything out and that
it will be conducted as thoroughly and expeditiously as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That review will begin with the case's paper record: pulling
together all documents, from the trial transcript and videotape to
everything collected during the investigation. The officers'
testimony is likely to be examined closely, since it was the first
time they had publicly spoken about the case. If holes are found in
the investigation, federal officials may then undertake further
investigation of their own in an effort to uncover additional
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's parents, Kadiatou and Saikou, and their daughter,
Laura, were accompanied by an entourage that included the Rev. Al
Sharpton; their lawyers; former Mayor David Dinkins; eight members
of Congress; Kwesi Mfume, the president of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People; and the Rev. Jesse Jackson's
wife, Jacqueline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have hope,'' said Kadiatou Diallo, Diallo's mother, after
the meeting. Sharpton said Holder told the family that the review
was a priority not only for him, but for the president and the
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Still, federal officials seem to be trying to make sure the
family's hopes are not too high. At his morning briefing, Holder
reiterated that ``these are difficult cases to prosecute,'' and
said the federal government took on only about two such cases a
year.
</P>
<P>
   To undertake a second, or dual, prosecution of the officers,
there must be a substantial federal interest in the case and the
government must determine that that interest was ``unvindicated''
by the state prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   To find that its interest was not vindicated, the federal
government would have to find, for example, that the prosecution in
the state trial was incompetent _ an argument that the Diallos and
their lawyers have been making with increasing stridency _ or that
there was ``jury nullification,'' when a jury ignores the evidence
before it.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Gair, one of Mrs. Diallo's lawyers, said he believed the
judge's legal instructions to the jury, which were generally
considered favorable to the defense, effectively nullified the
jury's function.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, federal officials are likely to bring charges
only if they believe they have a case in which they could obtain a
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   That depends on whether existing evidence or evidence that was
not known at trial shows the officers had a willful intent to use
more force than was reasonably necessary.
</P>
<P>
   All of those guidelines were explained to the Diallos in the
meeting, which lasted nearly two hours.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Afterward, the Diallos and Sharpton emerged to rally the
protesters gathered outside. ``We do not want this decision to be
used to justify and acquit some other officers who might do the
same thing,'' Mrs. Diallo said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Diallo, the 21-year-old sister of Amadou Diallo, made her
first public appearance, telling the crowd, ``I cannot explain what
I go through every night when I see my mother break down in front
of me or when my two brothers tell me they miss my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo has made a concerted effort to keep her three
remaining children _ Laura and her brothers, Ibrahima and Abdul,
who are 17 and 16 _ out of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting went on inside, a variety of speakers denounced
police conduct in minority communities. Among them was the former
mayor of Washington, Marion Barry, who told the crowd, ``We must do
all we can to stop these mad dog cops.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the crowd, which came from up and down the East
Coast, suggested that anger over the killing and the verdict showed
no sign of abating.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Cox, a 42-year-old postal worker from Paterson, N.J, came
down with two busloads of people from New Jersey. ``When you're
passionate about something you have to show your support,'' she
said. Melody Cooper came from Hastings, N.Y., with her father and
two young children, and said she would keep protesting until she
felt justice had been done. ``Race does matter,'' she said. ``Race
is the very crux of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sharpton emerged after the meeting, he announced that he
would lead the crowd around the Justice Department seven times,
until ``the blue walls of silence'' came down. So enthusiastic was
the crowd that they marched around the building more than a dozen
times.

COWBOYS SIGN CORNERBACK MCNEIL

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Ryan McNeil concedes he is not Deion Sanders, but then,
who else is?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have not officially bid farewell to Sanders, but
McNeil arrived at Valley Ranch yesterday looking a lot like
Sanders' replacement at right cornerback. McNeil, who led the
league with nine interceptions in 1997, became the first
unrestricted free agent from another team to sign with the Cowboys,
agreeing to a five-year contract worth up to $18 million. The deal
can be voided by either side after one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it as replacing him,'' said McNeil, who spent
last season with the Cleveland Browns. ``I look at it as coming in
and doing what I can do and what I've been doing. I don't think
anything's going to change about that. I think I'm pretty good at
what I do. If I wasn't, I wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders remains a member of the Cowboys in name.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who is in spring training with the Cincinnati Reds, has
said his five-year career with the Cowboys is over. On June 2, the
Cowboys are expected to void his contract, which would count $12.7
million against their salary cap next season.
</P>
<P>
   But owner Jerry Jones is not yet prepared to write off Sanders
as an ex-Cowboy despite McNeil's signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should,'' Jones said. ``We're spending some
money \Ron McNeil\S, but I don't want to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeil, who has 20 interceptions and 396 tackles in his career,
chose the Cowboys over the New York Giants and the San Francisco
49ers for the chance to ``get a ring.'' The Cowboys chose McNeil
over New York Giants cornerback Phillippi Sparks because of
McNeil's size and durability.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil, who is 6-foot-2, 192 pounds, has played in 110 of a
possible 112 games during his seven-year career, including 89 as a
starter. He has a streak of 86 consecutive games played.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at him a year ago and thought he was one of the top
guys out there,'' Cowboys defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer said.
``He has an advantage, because of his size and his long arms. We
think he can play bump-and-run against some of the bigger receivers
in our division.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are the fourth team for McNeil since the Detroit
Lions drafted him 33rd overall in 1993. Free agency also took
McNeil to stops in St. Louis and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   He has played for six defensive coordinators in seven seasons,
and he has had a series of one-year contracts. He left more than
$10 million on the table from the Rams in 1998 and instead settled
for a one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he signed a one-year, $1.5 million deal with the
Browns on July 31, a week after training camp had begun.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil has a multiyear contract for the first time in five
years, although it is structured like a one-year deal that will pay
him slightly more than he made last season in base salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good opportunity for us because of the circumstances
that he's had in St. Louis and in Cleveland,'' Jones said.
``Because of his contract negotiations, he's missed some minicamps,
some training camps. I buy into that. Given an off-season where he
doesn't have his contract on his mind, that'll help him get to
where he's physically capable of being as a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the Cowboys' next move will come in finding a backup
quarterback for Troy Aikman. The Cowboys are in the process of
scheduling a visit for Scott Mitchell, a 10-year veteran who spent
last season with the Baltimore Ravens.

NEW ORLEANS SHOWS LUKAS THE MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Trainer D. Wayne Lukas is fibbing. He is, if
you believe he's in the racehorse business because of the money.
</P>
<P>
   OK. So that's a big reason.
</P>
<P>
   But Lukas would have you believe that he isn't always after the
quick buck. With that consideration, maybe he's not kidding when he
says he doesn't hold Exchange Rate with more regard than High
Yield. They appear to be the best colts he has pointed toward the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the situation: While High Yield is training toward the
Derby in Florida, Exchange Rate is based in New Orleans. In our
``Show me the money!'' generation, there's a huge difference
between the two.
</P>
<P>
   The operators at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans are offering a
$500,000 bonus to any horse that wins the Louisiana Derby on March
12 and the Kentucky Derby on May 6. There is no bonus for High
Yield or any horse at Gulfstream Park in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas admits, or boasts, this much: ``We've won more
million-dollar bonuses than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But he won't admit this: Exchange Rate is a better horse than
High Yield.
</P>
<P>
   It looks that way, at least according to the quick-buck litmus
test. Since there is a bonus for sweeping the Louisiana Derby and
Kentucky Derby, wouldn't Lukas have his best horse chasing it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The bonus never enters into our thinking,'' Lukas said. ``It's
great to have it laying out there. Yet, that is not the underlying
thing when we make our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardee har-har. But wait before you laugh. Lukas' plans may
balance in other places besides the accountant's ledger.
</P>
<P>
   It's logical to send High Yield to Gulfstream. He ran a
competitive race there in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, leading with
about a half-mile to go before he wilted under Anees' big run.
</P>
<P>
   High Yield's running style is laced with early speed. And early
speed works at Gulfstream, even if it didn't that one race in the
Breeders' Cup. It did when he shot immediately to the front and won
the Fountain of Youth Stakes two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fair Grounds, on the other hand, has a track configuration with
a longer stretch run. It blunts the advantage of early speed.
</P>
<P>
   And it's widely regarded to have a racing surface that's kind to
a horse's legs. That's what Exchange Rate needs. His 2-year-old
season was cut short when he suffered a condylar] fracture in an
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   He's mended. His victory in the $125,000 Risen Star Stakes two
weeks ago at Fair Grounds offers proof.
</P>
<P>
   But if Lukas isn't running for the quick buck, it looks as if]
the rest of the training community is. Right now, the
bonus-attached Louisiana Derby is shaping up stronger _ way
stronger _ than the Florida Derby. It's usually the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   When High Yield enters the starting gate for the Florida Derby,
it's likely the field of eight or 10 horses will include only one
other horse that's won a major stakes race. And that's Greenwood
Lake, but he hasn't finished in the top three of a race this year
after winning the Champagne and the Remsen Stakes last year.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the horses Exchange Rate is expected to face
in the Louisiana Derby: Captain Steve, More Than Ready, Mighty and
Country Only. More than seven major stakes wins among them, and
three horses (Captain Steve, More Than Ready and Mighty) have won a
stakes race at the Derby site of Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   If Lukas wants someone to show him the money, it's up to
Exchange Rate to get everyone else out of Lukas' view.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley now takes shot at the horse business
Bobby Hurley may no longer be a point guard, his glory days with
back-to-back national championship teams at Duke long behind him.
But he certainly isn't down on his luck.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley is now 28 and was cut from the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies
more than a year ago. But he showed up at the Fasig-Tipton Calder
Selected 2-Year-Olds In-Training Sale in Miami on Tuesday and spent
$1 million on a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley grew up in New Jersey and followed horse racing at area
tracks with his father and other family friends. He was Duke's
starting point guard when the Blue Devils won national
championships in 1991 and '92.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley's horse is one of four in the sale that brought more than
$1 million. The sale-topper was a $1.95 million colt bought by
Monte Carlo-based wagering book operator Michael Tabor.
</P>
<P>
   The colt Hurley purchased is by former 2-year-old champion
Unbridled's Song and out of a mare who has produced two stakes
winners who have earned more than $375,000.
</P>
<P>
   The colt is scheduled to be trained by John Dowd. But that may
be Hurley's only public relations problem in this deal.
</P>
<P>
   Dowd has been hit with a 180-day suspension from stewards at
Aqueduct Racetrack in New York because three of his horses tested
positive for a banned medication. The medication is known as
ergonovine, which use is permitted up to a week away from a race
but not on race day. In humans it's used to help migraine
headaches, but in horses it is designed to restrict bleeding in the
breathing passage. Dowd has appealed the ruling.

SOTHEBY'S REPORTS EARNINGS UNDER CLOUD OF INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   (af)  
 By REED ABELSON and CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sotheby's Holdings could do little to dispel
investors' concerns over the outcome of a federal antitrust
investigation Thursday as it discussed its Internet prospects and
fourth-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   While Sotheby's earnings were slightly better than Wall Street
had expected, the company said it would eliminate its first-quarter
dividend because of ``significant cash needs'' from its online
forays and uncertainty surrounding the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While William F. Ruprecht, the company's new chief executive,
spoke optimistically about Sotheby's future in holding auctions
over the Internet, he acknowledged the fierce competition for
blockbuster works of art and the challenges of proceeding in the
face of a criminal investigation and the threat to its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed Thursday at $22, down $1.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the company's chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, and its
president and chief executive, Diana D. Brooks, stunned the art
world by abruptly resigning. Their departure came as the company
and its archrival, Christie's, were accused of colluding to fix the
commissions charged buyers and sellers. Both companies face tens of
millions of dollars in damages from class-action lawsuits, and
Sotheby's faces lawsuits from its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming Sotheby's president in 1987, Brooks was the face
and voice of Sotheby's and played a vital role in deal-making and
client relations for the company. Ruprecht, who had run Sotheby's
operations in North and South America and is an auction house
veteran, has not been as closely involved with some of the
company's most important and richest clients.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brooks resigned her post, she and Taubman still remain
on the company's board, and she continues to play a role at the
company. During his discussion with analysts and investors,
Ruprecht described Brooks' role as helping the company ``on a
transitional basis with a number of client relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked in an interview later about how long the two would
remain on the board, Ruprecht said he did not know but that the
board would next meet formally in April in London.
</P>
<P>
   Since her resignation, Brooks no longer has an office at the
newly expanded York Avenue headquarters in Manhattan. Nor has she
been in the building, according to a spokesman. But Ruprecht said
Brooks was still on the company's payroll and was attempting to
redirect long-standing client relationships to other executives
within Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Ruprecht, a burly, outgoing man, clearly has a different
management style from the famously micromanaging Brooks. ``I'm
going to be much more a ringmaster than a star of the show,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruprecht shed little light on the progress of the Justice
Department's investigation. He said the company had recently met
with the department to discuss the investigation's ``prompt and
appropriate resolution'' but refused to predict the course of those
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated questions by analysts, the company also
remained silent about whether it was likely to reach a settlement
anytime soon and whether depositions were complete.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has acknowledged that the impact of the matters could
be material, and the company announced Thursday that it had
eliminated its first-quarter dividend of 10 cents a share, partly
as a result of the potential damages.
</P>
<P>
   But the company also faces significant costs for its Internet
sites, Sothebys.Amazon.com and Sothebys.com. The company spent $42
million in 1999 and said it expected to spend another $60 million,
mostly in marketing costs, this year. Sotheby's projected as much
as $100 million in auction sales might take place online in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While investors have focused on the Internet as the company's
future, Sotheby's also acknowledged that the high end of its
business was getting even more competitive and less profitable. The
company also said it did not expect its important spring sales of
Impressionist, modern and contemporary art to be as strong as they
were last year.
</P>
<P>
   In its results, Sotheby's said it earned $34.4 million, or 57
cents a diluted share, on revenue of $188 million in the fourth
quarter. Analysts had expected the company to earn 55 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say a lot is still up in the air. ``I think it
is going to take a lot of time to resolve,'' said Jeanne T. Hanley,
the president of Capital Reflections Inc., an independent research
firm in North Granby, Conn. &QL;

COWBOYS SIGN CORNERBACK MCNEIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Ryan McNeil concedes he is not Deion Sanders, but then,
who else is?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have not officially bid farewell to Sanders, but
McNeil arrived at Valley Ranch yesterday looking a lot like
Sanders' replacement at right cornerback. McNeil, who led the
league with nine interceptions in 1997, became the first
unrestricted free agent from another team to sign with the Cowboys,
agreeing to a five-year contract worth up to $18 million. The deal
can be voided by either side after one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it as replacing him,'' said McNeil, who spent
last season with the Cleveland Browns. ``I look at it as coming in
and doing what I can do and what I've been doing. I don't think
anything's going to change about that. I think I'm pretty good at
what I do. If I wasn't, I wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders remains a member of the Cowboys in name.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who is in spring training with the Cincinnati Reds, has
said his five-year career with the Cowboys is over. On June 2, the
Cowboys are expected to void his contract, which would count $12.7
million against their salary cap next season.

   Shares of Palm Pilot Maker Soar on First Day of Trading
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a wave of enthusiasm for companies involved in the
Internet and wireless communications, investors snapped up shares
of Palm, the maker of the Palm Pilot handheld devices. The shares
traded as high as $165, more than four times the offering price of
$38, before retreating to slightly more than $95. At that price,
the market is valuing Palm at $53.3 billion, far more than the
value of its parent, 3Com, which still owns most of the company.
Palm's market value is higher than that of many far larger
companies, including Ford, General Motors and Chevron.

   DoubleClick Backs Off Data Plan

   Yielding to pressure from privacy advocates and Wall Street,
DoubleClick, the Internet advertising company, said that it would
put a hold on its plan to link personal information to anonymous

up 2.57 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,381.76, while the Nasdaq

<P>
   Shares of Aetna Increase 5.3 Percent
</P>
<P>
   Investors bought up shares of Aetna again, but the buying spree
slowed as it became apparent that rival bidders were unlikely to

Holdings and WellPoint Health Networks. Shares of Aetna rose
$2.8125, or 5.3 percent, to $55.8125.

   February Retail Sales Rose 5.1 Percent
</P>
<P>
   Despite rising interest rates and oil prices, consumers
continued their spending spree in stores and on the Internet, two

separate survey found that $5.3 billion worth of goods and services
were sold online in the fourth quarter of 1999.

SENSUOUS CURVES ASCEND ABOVE THE HARD-EDGED CITY

 By DAVID W. DUNLAP  
(DW) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a Guastavino tile ceiling, the sum of a thousand
right angles is a curve worthy of nature.
</P>
<P>
   True, the ceilings bespeak meticulous craftsmanship with their
intricate coursing, usually in a telltale basket-weave or
herringbone pattern. True, they evoke the architecture of
Catalonia, where the tradition grew of spanning large spaces with
thin, multilayered tile-and-mortar vaults.
</P>
<P>
   But what is most appealing about the ceilings produced in New
York in the early 20th century by the Spanish architect Rafael
Guastavino y Moreno and his son, Rafael Guastavino y Esposito, is
their sublime defiance of the rectilinear city.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   As New York is hard-edged and mechanistic, the ceilings are
sensuously organic; as it is tightly vertical, they are broadly
expansive; as it is brooding, they are joyous.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   What is astonishing about these great curving forms _ the
largest being the 135-foot-diameter dome of the Cathedral Church of
St. John the Divine _ is that they are made up of relentlessly
orthogonal building blocks: flat clay tiles, typically 6 inches by
12 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Today New York has a chance to fall in love again with
Guastavino.
</P>
<P>
   The opening this winter of the Bridgemarket development under
the Queensboro Bridge has focused the civic spotlight on a splendid
array of newly restored cream-colored Guastavino vaults in which
the project is set. It is also a reminder of how many such
treasures endure.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Guastavino spaces are already postcard-familiar,
like the Registry Room at Ellis Island and the Oyster Bar at Grand
Central Terminal, both of which were restored in the 1990s. (But
most New Yorkers probably do not know that the large vault outside
the Oyster Bar works as a whispering gallery. Someone facing the
wall at one corner, speaking very softly, can be heard clearly by
another person facing the wall in the diagonally opposite corner,
40 feet away.)
</P>
<P>
   Other great Guastavino ceilings in Manhattan are in buildings
that may not be widely known but that amply repay a visit, like St.
Paul's Chapel at Columbia University, Holy Trinity Roman Catholic
Church at 213 West 82nd Street, and Recreation Center 54 East at
348 East 54th Street, with a gymnasium ceiling that rivals those of
the churches.
</P>
<P>
   Still others are in landmarks not commonly associated with the
Guastavinos: St. Patrick's Cathedral, Riverside Church, St.
Bartholomew's Church, the Bronx Zoo, the Municipal Building and the
Federal Reserve Bank. In the 38th Street side entrance of Lord &AMP;
Taylor, for example, is a small ceiling of Guastavino tiles
inscribed with a gold-edged fret pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are Guastavino spaces whose existence is almost a
matter of archaeological interest. They are under the traffic
circle at Riverside Drive and 79th Street. A small colony of
basket-weave vaults can be found in an unused arcade near the
southern end of the downtown platform at the 34th
Street-Pennsylvania Station stop on the No. 1 and 9 lines.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   An entire subway station made of Guastavino vaults and arches
lies directly under City Hall Park, closed since the 1940s. A
garage ramp crowned by basket-weave tiles can be spotted on East
44th Street, between Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues, at the base of
an office building reconstructed from the Biltmore Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   By far the best behind-the-scenes view of the Guastavino
engineering system can be had every other Saturday at the Cathedral
of St. John the Divine as part of the aptly named vertical tour,
which involves a 12-story ascent through spiral staircases up the
south side of the nave.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the clerestory, about 105 feet above the floor,
visitors are treated to a breathtaking vista of the vaulted ceiling
from a small bridge across an interior buttress, framed by the
cusps of a multifoil rosette more than 10 feet in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   (Obviously this tour is not for acrophobes.)
</P>
<P>
   The ceiling surface is not in the customary basket-weave
pattern. Instead the courses vary in height and the tiles vary in
width. ``He wanted to give the illusion of a stone vault,''
explained Andrea Yost, director of public education at the
cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The illusion is broken at the next stop on the tour: a vast
attic chamber almost 40 feet high between the top of the nave
ceiling and the peak of the gabled cathedral roof.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Visitors emerge on a slender catwalk where they can begin to
discern the outlines of the 225-foot-long nave ceiling at their
feet as their eyes grow accustomed to the dim light. With its
curves and peaks and folds and protrusions and scales, the ceiling
resembles a gigantic dormant dragon. On closer inspection, though,
one realizes that the scales are actually Guastavino tiles, reddish
brown in color, with a distinctive surface striation. This vantage
affords the chance to appreciate the engineering of a Guastavino
vault, which is self-supporting, made up of layer after layer of
thin tile and thick mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Testament to the durability of a Guastavino vault is the dome
over the cathedral crossing, which was supposed to be only a
temporary covering when it was built 91 years ago. Elsewhere in the
cathedral one can see the familiar basket-weave pattern in the
ceilings of the ambulatory aisle and in two exquisite corkscrew
staircases spiraling to the organ loft.
</P>
<P>
   Another curving Guastavino staircase is on view just inside the
entrance of St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia, completed in 1907. Here
the tiles are close enough to touch, and one can appreciate at this
intimate range another distinctive feature of the Guastavino
system: the raised mortar joints, which extend about one-quarter
inch beyond the tile surface.
</P>
<P>
   St. Paul's is a riot of Guastavino handiwork, from the
48-foot-diameter dome to the apse and even the undersides of the
galleries, all in a rich earth-tone palette of cinnamon, wheat,
chocolate and burnt orange.
</P>
<P>
   An even larger Guastavino dome, some 66 feet in diameter,
ornaments Holy Trinity, which was finished in 1912. Always
majestic, the dome is more glorious since the installation a year
and a half ago of new fixtures at the base of the ceiling that
bathe it in light.
</P>
<P>
   How are the acoustics? ``Magnificent!'' declared the pastor,
Msgr. Thomas P. Leonard, clapping smartly as he said so, allowing
the long return to impress itself on a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miniature Hagia Sophia,'' Leonard said, explaining that
the founding pastor of Holy Trinity, Michael J. Considine, returned
from a trip to the Middle East with the idea of emulating the
Byzantine cathedral of Constantinople. The Guastavino system was
ideally suited for the task of reproducing a broad, shallow dome
like that of Hagia Sophia.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the cohesive strength and the relatively light weight
of tile courses compared with stone, greater spans with a very low
rise were possible, wrote Janet Parks and Alan G. Neumann in ``The
Old World Builds the New,'' the catalog of a Guastavino exhibition
at Columbia University in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect Manhattan solution: you could get this
structure in a building for relatively little money, and it took up
so little room,'' said Parks, curator of drawings at the Avery
Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia, where the
Guastavino company archives are kept.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The older Guastavino was born in Valencia, Spain, in 1842. He
moved to New York in 1881, bringing with him an adaptation of a
centuries-old building technique known as the boveda catalana, or
Catalan vault, that he had perfected as an architect in Barcelona.
The Guastavino Fireproof Construction Co. was incorporated in 1889.
On the death of the founder in 1908, his son took over the business
``so smoothly that many are unaware of the existence of two Rafael
Guastavinos,'' Angela Giral wrote in ``The Old World Builds the
New.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Guastavino lived until 1950, and the company
survived until 1963, when it was liquidated after the completion of
its last big project, the National Shrine of the Immaculate
Conception in Washington. Its archives were transferred to Columbia
at the behest of Prof. George R. Collins, an authority on the work
of the pre-eminent Catalan architect, Antonio Gaudi.
</P>
<P>
   Gaudi comes easily to mind when one stands at the base of the
Municipal Building, across from City Hall. Although it looks like a
Beaux-Arts wedding cake on the skyline, its open-air Guastavino
arcade is a marvel of organic complexity. Billowing curves seem to
bump into one another like giant amoeba in an upside-down petri
dish.
</P>
<P>
   Far more regimented are the vaults under the Queensboro Bridge,
marching four abreast from First Avenue, where they leap across the
street in a 90-foot arc and proceed eastward for another nine bays
that once served as a farmers' market hall for produce coming in
from Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The vaults are typically 30 feet square and rise eight feet from
the top of the columns on which they sit. They are made of one
layer of ``face tile'' _ that is, the cream-colored tile visible
from below _ and four layers of backing tile. (The layering
technique is clearly visible in the edges of the ribs between
vaults.)
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996 the city Transportation Department began a $3
million restoration of the Guastavino tile work as part of a much
larger renovation of the bridge. The contractor was Grow-Perini,
and the masonry restoration subcontractor was the Graciano Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Vollmer, the project manager for Graciano's New York
division, recalled conditions under the Queensboro three years ago.
``You'd be walking around and whap! a tile would come down,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Each vault has more than 1,600 face tiles. They were all tested.
``If it gives a firm sound, the mortar is sufficient,'' said Peter
E. Johe, the director of design and construction at the
Transportation Department for the East River bridges. ``If it
sounds hollow, that probably means there's a void behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   About half the face tiles had to be replaced with new ones made
by Boston Valley Terra Cotta, near Buffalo. Except for the new
tiles' slightly higher sheen, their presence is almost
undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers were impressed that tile failures in the 86-year-old
vaults were randomly dispersed. ``There were no real high-stress
points that we saw,'' said James P. Cusack, engineer in charge of
the Queensboro Bridge reconstruction project at the Transportation
Department. ``That's testimony to how good structurally these
arches are.''
</P>
<P>
   The easternmost bay, however, had to be rebuilt from scratch to
isolate it from steel girders that vibrate heavily with overhead
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first rebuild of a Guastavino vault in the United
States,'' said Gino Marchese of Graciano, who supervised a team
from the Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers union, using skills he
began acquiring as a boy from his grandfather, Americo J. Gonano,
who was a stonemason.
</P>
<P>
   Six bays of the Bridgemarket hall are a Food Emporium. Three
bays have been turned into Guastavino's restaurant, operated by Sir
Terence Conran and Joel Kissin.
</P>
<P>
   It was designed by Conran &AMP; Partners and Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer
Associates. But not too much. ``A space like this is so phenomenal
that the least intervention is the best,'' said the architect Hugh
Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   In picking a name, Kissin said, Guastavino's seemed a good
choice because it established a connection with the site and also
resonated with Quaglino's, the name of a Conran restaurant in
London. ``The one question was whether people would think it's
Italian,'' Kissin said. ``The funny thing, of course, is that he's
Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting under the vaults it seemed only fair that as
Kissin talked about architecture, Pamela Loeffelman of Hardy
Holzman Pfeiffer could make a suggestion about cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to have tilefish,'' she said.

GOOFY, BOGIE AND POIROT IN THE SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goofy, Bogie and Hercule Poirot. A strange trio if ever there
was one, but what they have in common is that on film they go on
reel after reel _ or in this case DVD after DVD.
</P>
<P>
   What they share in common is their timelessness. All of these
figures have been around for years. Humphrey Bogart _ a star from
the `30s through his death in 1957 _ would have been 100 years old
last Christmas Day; Goofy, originally called Dippy Dawg, started
hanging out with Mickey Mouse in 1932; and mystery queen Agatha
Christie first introduced Poirot to readers in 1920 with ``The
Mysterious Affair at Styles.''
</P>
<P>
   With the theatrical success of ``The Goofy Movie,'' Disney has
followed up with the straight-to-video DVD ``An Extremely Goofy
Movie,'' a tale that finds Mickey's friend back in college with his
extreme-games skateboarding son, Max. And living up to its name,
the film is goofy enough that young kids will find it a hoot, while
parents will be able to tolerate repeated viewings.
</P>
<P>
   In celebration of Bogart's centenary, Warners is releasing a
number of his films on DVD and video. A number of classics are
there _ ``Casablanca,'' etc., _ but there are a number of early
Bogie films where he was not only a tough guy but a bad guy. It was
John Huston's 1941 film ``The Maltese Falcon'' for Warners that
made him a good guy _ but still tough.
</P>
<P>
   Hercule Poirot, on the other hand was always a good guy _ fussy
but good. He's been played by some fine actors _ Albert Finney and
Peter Ustinov _ but David Suchet's run as the Belgian detective for
BBC television is the best. Christie's whodunits are strictly by
the book, but Suchet's performances _ along with the impeccable
production values _ make the mysteries a joy to watch. Acorn is
releasing two television movies, ``Death in the Clouds'' and ``The
ABC Murders,'' on DVD. If you didn't catch them the first time
around, do so. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _____
</P>
<P>
   ``Death in the Clouds'' and ``The ABC Murders'' are $24.95 each
on DVD. ``An Extremely Goofy Movie'' is $24.99 on VHS and $29.99 on
DVD. &QL;

KEY OFFICER AT GAP RESIGNS TO BE CHIEF OF WAL-MART.COM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeanne Jackson, the Gap executive who is credited with building
the Banana Republic division into a retail powerhouse and who
started the Gap's online store, has resigned to become the new head
of Wal-Mart.com.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of her departure was made after the market
closed on Wednesday. Shares of Gap declined $3.625 Thursday, or 7.6
percent, to $44.25, in part on the news of Jackson's departure but
also on a report that Gap's sales in stores open at least a year
were up 4 percent, at the low end of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, sales at the Gap division, which have been
lackluster, fell 1 percent to 3 percent; the consensus among
analysts had been for an increase of 3 percent to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is widely seen as a talented executive who helped define
Banana Republic as a leading seller of sleek urban apparel. During
her five years leading the division, sales grew to $1.8 billion a
year from $650 million, according to Dana Cohen, an analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``Over the time period she ran the
business, it had a dramatic turnaround and became an important
leading-edge fashion business and sales and margins increased
substantially,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Gap is such a well-run organization that several
stock analysts argued that Jackson was replaceable. ``The way the
Gap works, Mickey is the king of vision,'' said Richard Baum, a
retail analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, referring to Millard
Drexler, the Gap's highly regarded chief executive. ``The people
running the businesses are still today executing his vision. He is
keeper of the brands.''
</P>
<P>
   By her own account, Jackson has spent about 50 percent of her
time over the last year building up Gap Inc. Direct, the division
that handles Gap's Internet store and the Banana Republic catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Jackson will have her hands full in developing
Wal-Mart.com. Although Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is perhaps the most
efficient competitor in the business on land, its Web site has been
criticized as cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even begin to give you the to-do list; I am not
there,'' Jackson said in an interview. But she acknowledged, ``I
know as a shopper I could wish for easier navigation.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BEACH,' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton and
Robert Carlyle. Directed by Danny Boyle (R, 120 minutes). DiCaprio
plays Richard, a young American vacationing in Thailand who is
given a map that leads him to an island paradise. All of DiCaprio's
charisma and the director's savvy are used to divert us from the
fact that there's not much going on here. While DiCaprio shows some
talent, the movie is simply a Colors by Benetton take on ``Lord of
the Flies,'' with the imperious paradise ruler (Swinton) holding
court as the Promised Land crashes around her. Richard finds
himself living the aphorism that has ruined the life of so many
film protagonists: paradise breeds callousness, a marginal
rethinking of ``beware of the things you want, for you shall have
them'' (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `BOILER ROOM,' starring Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Ben
Affleck. Written and directed by Ben Younger (R, 110 minutes).
Ribisi portrays a young stockbroker in training at a fly-by-night
company called J.T. Marlin. Like Oliver Stone's ``Wall Street,''
``Boiler Room'' tells the story of an ambitious young man's rise,
fall and redemption. And like Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox, Ribisi's
Seth carries some heavy Oedipal baggage _ a troubled relationship
with his demanding, disapproving father _ onto the trading floor.
But at its best, which is awfully good, ``Boiler Room'' avoids the
thumping moralism that has made Stone the least misunderstood
director in Hollywood. It's less about selling your soul than about
feeling your oats (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of last year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron
and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes).
Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of
abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a
Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely
World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the
world. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an
orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs
abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple
(Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but
smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 1940s
``David Copperfield'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `HANGING UP,' starring Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton, Lisa Kudrow and
Walter Matthau. Directed by Keaton (PG-13, 92 minutes). This
chilly, unfunny comedy about three grown-up sisters dealing with
the decline and death of their dear old dad (Matthau), a fading
alcoholic screenwriter, is a series of machine-tooled Hallmark
moments guaranteed not to threaten anyone's sense of well-being.
The characters are one-dimensional, the jokes limp and Ryan more
abrasively perky than usual as a harried party planner and Little
Ms. Fixit who seems to live on her cell phone (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `HOLY SMOKE,' starring Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel. Directed
by Jane Campion (R, 95 minutes). Having roamed so gorgeously
through North Africa as a young hippie mother in ``Hideous Kinky,''
Winslet this time appears in India as Ruth Barron, a headstrong
young Australian seeking enlightenment. Eventually Ruth's mother
coaxes her home, where a ``cult exiter'' named P.J. (Keitel) is
waiting to wean Ruth from her Indian guru. But as the film moves
from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more serious,
confrontational stage, it runs into trouble. It doesn't help that
Winslet's obvious strength and beauty leave Keitel's P.J. looking
overmatched (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE,' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman
Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a
middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a
triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a
movie redeemed by Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the
boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast and loose with
the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian
commune who took up Carter's cause and all but eliminating his
heroic co-defendant, John Artis, from the story. And the minor
characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man
heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still
inspiring (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `JUDY BERLIN,' starring Edie Falco, Madeleine Kahn, Aaron
Harnick and Bob Dishy. Directed by Eric Mendelsohn (not rated, 90
minutes). Much of Mendelsohn's moody black-and-white first film is
set in a sleepy Long Island town during the longest solar eclipse
known to movies. The event transforms the place into an eerie
corner of ``The Twilight Zone'' suffused with a Chekhovian
melancholy. Kahn and Dishy are a loquacious housewife and her
long-suffering school-principal husband, and Harnick their
depressed 30-year-old son, a failing filmmaker. Falco, as a
Hollywood-bound aspiring actress, is the only live wire in this
heap of downed power lines (Holden).

 UNDATED: lines (Holden). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `NOT ONE LESS,' starring Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike. Directed by
Zhang Yimou (not rated, 106 minutes). Zhang Yimou's new drama
enlarges the possibilities of filmmaking even as it grounds itself
in one of cinema's oldest, most basic principles: the camera's
ability to document reality. At the center of the film is Wei (Wei
Minzhi), a 13-year-old primary school graduate who has been pressed
into service as a substitute teacher in the Shuiquan Primary
School. When one of her students is sent to the city to work off
his parents' debts, Wei, who has been promised a bonus if she can
keep her class intact (this is the source of the film's title),
sets out to bring him home. And the movie, which has so far been a
slow, touching study of village life, becomes something else: a
work of lyrical realism that has some of the shattering, redemptive
power of Vittorio De Sica's ``Bicycle Thief'' (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `PITCH BLACK,' starring Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell. Directed
by David Twohy (R, 107 minutes). This snazzily designed, crisply
paced sci-fi horror film follows the survivors of a crash-landing
on a distant planet as they fight off swarms of bat-type carnivores
who streak out of the ground after a solar eclipse plunges the
desertlike outpost into total darkness. Although the lighting never
gets as pitch dark as the title implies, the movie is scary enough
to make you remember when you needed a night light to get to sleep.
And Diesel, as a hulking, thuggish convicted murderer who turns out
not to be as evil as he first appears, demonstrates major
action-hero potential (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `REINDEER GAMES,' starring Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise and Charlize
Theron. Directed by John Frankenheimer (R, 99 minutes). This is a
wheel-within-a-wheel thriller that's a lot of fun until, near the
end, it becomes a Xerox copy of a blueprint of a hit. Affleck, who
suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent _ he wants to keep
his light under a bushel, but he's not quite up to it _ plays Rudy,
an ex-con who gets dragged into a casino heist planned for the
Christmas season. Theron is the girl who lures him into the job.
The seamy kicks of one double-cross after another keep the movie in
motion, and Frankenheimer's ruthless precision keeps it on track
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `SCREAM 3,' starring David Arquette, Neve Campbell and Courteney
Cox Arquette. Directed by Wes Craven (R, 116 minutes). At this
point it goes without saying that the ``Scream'' movies are like
episodes of ``Scooby Doo.'' Like the others, ``Scream 3'' belongs
on the Cartoon Network. This time for a better reason: The film is
funny and brisk, with enough good lines to make the comedy more
satisfying than the somewhat routine but still unsettling jolts to
the spine. Craven and his group recognize that the franchise's real
competition is not the recent hit films ``The Blair Witch Project''
and ``The Sixth Sense'' but rather ``Scream'' itself. ``Scream 3''
doesn't skimp on jacked-up scares, but it's as much a personality
show as it is a slasher film (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did last year. Instead of a
love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched
personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the
composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing,
frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they
held sway (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WHOLE NINE YARDS,' starring Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis.
Directed by Jonathan Lynn (R, 100 minutes). Oz (Perry) is a
nice-guy dentist beaten down by his bored wife. When the confident
Jimmy (Willis) breezes into the house next door, Oz's anxieties are
ratcheted up several points on the Richter scale. It turns out that
Jimmy is a former Chicago organized-crime figure who ratted out his
associates. The movie has an intricate plot, with hit men, love
interests, large sums of money and allegiances constantly in
motion. But the film is missing the verve of someone who can take a
simple idea to the extreme; it must have been directed by a
sleepwalker. Despite Perry's plucky slapstick and the treacherous
gunplay that accounts for the second half of the movie, ``Yards''
is underwhelming, amusing only in fits and starts (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `WONDER BOYS,' starring Michael Douglas, Frances McDormand and
Tobey Maguire. Directed by Curtis Hanson (R, 112 minutes). This
film boasts a first-rate cast, a credible literary source and a
director whose last film, ``L.A. Confidential,'' showed a
prodigious ability to capture both the headlong rhythms of a
complex plot and the particularities of a motley assortment of
characters. But even with so much going for it, this adaptation of
Michael Chabon's novel about a pot-smoking middle-aged novelist
burdened by romantic and creative problems is flat and
unconvincing. There's no shortage of screwball material: a dead
dog, an errant tuba and a very tall drag queen, for starters. But
Hanson, perhaps aiming for wry understatement, has smothered
whatever antic rhythm the story might have had. In spite of a
brilliant supporting turn by Robert Downey Jr. as a gay book
editor, ``Wonder Boys'' is like a George Cukor movie with a bad
head cold: slow, muffled and vague (Scott).

GOOFY, BOGIE AND POIROT IN THE SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goofy, Bogie and Hercule Poirot. A strange trio if ever there
was one, but what they have in common is that on film they go on
reel after reel _ or in this case DVD after DVD.
</P>
<P>
   What they share in common is their timelessness. All of these
figures have been around for years. Humphrey Bogart _ a star from
the `30s through his death in 1957 _ would have been 100 years old
last Christmas Day; Goofy, originally called Dippy Dawg, started
hanging out with Mickey Mouse in 1932; and mystery queen Agatha
Christie first introduced Poirot to readers in 1920 with ``The
Mysterious Affair at Styles.''
</P>
<P>
   With the theatrical success of ``The Goofy Movie,'' Disney has
followed up with the straight-to-video DVD ``An Extremely Goofy
Movie,'' a tale that finds Mickey's friend back in college with his
extreme-games skateboarding son, Max. And living up to its name,
the film is goofy enough that young kids will find it a hoot, while
parents will be able to tolerate repeated viewings.
</P>
<P>
   In celebration of Bogart's centenary, Warners is releasing a
number of his films on DVD and video. A number of classics are
there _ ``Casablanca,'' etc., _ but there are a number of early
Bogie films where he was not only a tough guy but a bad guy. It was
John Huston's 1941 film ``The Maltese Falcon'' for Warners that
made him a good guy _ but still tough.
</P>
<P>
   Hercule Poirot, on the other hand was always a good guy _ fussy
but good. He's been played by some fine actors _ Albert Finney and
Peter Ustinov _ but David Suchet's run as the Belgian detective for
BBC television is the best. Christie's whodunits are strictly by
the book, but Suchet's performances _ along with the impeccable
production values _ make the mysteries a joy to watch. Acorn is
releasing two television movies, ``Death in the Clouds'' and ``The
ABC Murders,'' on DVD. If you didn't catch them the first time
around, do so. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _____
</P>
<P>
   ``Death in the Clouds'' and ``The ABC Murders'' are $24.95 each
on DVD. ``An Extremely Goofy Movie'' is $24.99 on VHS and $29.99 on
DVD. &QL;

TODDLER TIPS COME IN SHADES OF PINK AND BLUE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By NANCY HEWITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   caption, Authors Leslie Zinberg, left, and Laurie Waldstein are
making two local appearances to promote ``The Pink and Blue Toddler
and Preschooler Pages.'' Toddler tips come in shades of pink, blue &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Being the parent of a toddler is one of the most demanding yet
rewarding jobs you will ever have.
</P>
<P>
   If you check most bookstores, you will find shelves of helpful
books that address different phases of toddlerhood. But until now
there wasn't one comprehensive manual that included the most common
situations parents must deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Authors Laurie Waldstein and Leslie Zinberg have put together a
colorful, informative book called ``The Pink and Blue Toddler and
Preschooler Pages.'' ``We wanted to write a book by parents for
parents,'' says Waldstein. ``When our children were toddlers, we
didn't have the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of two years, both women did their research,
including soliciting responses from those in fields such as
nutrition, psychology, education and dentistry. Waldstein's husband
is a pediatrician, so she was able to tune in to questions he was
being asked when she worked at his office. ``We took questions we
had as parents,'' Waldstein continues, ``and included them with
questions others had, then put it together as a book.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is not organized in order of importance nor is it
alphabetical. Sections range from caregivers and toilet training to
behavior and safety. Sprinkled through the book are helpful hints
such as: ``Take your child to the store and let him pick out his
new underwear,'' found in the toilet training chapter. Or ``If your
child is not ready to use her manners, do not make it a power
struggle,'' in the chapter on behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The book also presents both sides of an issue as well as the
hints and tips. ``It's a book for busy parents of today,'' Zinberg
emphasizes. ``It is not a cumbersome book. It's comfortable. We
want it to be like you're calling a friend, especially since many
of us are separated from family.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldstein agrees. ``We didn't want people to be intimidated.
Parents need it simple and want it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Both authors encourage parents using the book to use common
sense for most situations because ``you know your own child.'' But
Waldstein adds: ``We give the most comprehensive information
available. But you should always defer to your pediatrician for
other questions you need answered.''
</P>
<P>

   &UR; The Urge To Branch Out &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Albert Brooks is on the sidewalk outside a bright
green house in West Hollywood, staring between the bars of a metal
gate toward a middle-aged woman with a broom. ``I can't see your
eyes, Albert,'' shouts his director, Christine Lahti, from her seat
behind the video monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The way the camera is placed, Brooks has to obscure his face
behind the bars to be looking into the eyes of the actress with the
broom. Lahti, who is making her feature-film directing debut with
the project, ``My First Mister'' (after winning an Oscar for the
first short film she directed,``Lieberman in Love,'' in 1995),
tries to decide what to do. Should the camera be moved? A lot of
time and trouble. Perhaps Brooks should move slightly to the left.
He takes a step. No, not enough. He takes another step. Oops, a
little too far. He inches back. ``Perfect,'' Lahti says.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, Brooks is now staring at metal bars and can no
longer see the face of the actress opposite him. Can he finish out
the scene performing to a pair of metal bars? ``OK,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Lahti smiles. ``Albert, you're a trouper!'' she calls out, then
shakes her head. ``I wouldn't do it,'' she says. ``I can't act to
metal. I need two eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   People in Hollywood are often simultaneously maintaining an
image and reinventing themselves. And that was part of what was
happening on this scraggly residential street off Melrose Avenue.
Brooks, largely known as the star of his own quirky films, would
very much like audiences and studio executives to realize that he
is more versatile than that, that his critically praised supporting
role in Steven Soderbergh's ``Out of Sight'' was no fluke. And
Lahti, a veteran actress who has distinguished herself on Broadway,
in films that include Bill Forsyth's ``Housekeeping'' (1987) and on
television series like ``Chicago Hope,'' would like to be seen as a
director of feature films.
</P>
<P>
   ``My First Mister'' is the story of a 49-year-old clothing store
owner (played by Brooks) who crosses paths with a young Melrose
Avenue hipster (Leelee Sobieski). They overcome their differences
and are drawn together by the loneliness they have in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying for a long time to act more,'' Brooks said.
``I'd like to be able to dig my teeth into something. I'd like to
play a lot of things. Whatever. The villain. The crazy person who
cuts people's heads off. I can do that. I really can. I think what
I need is two or three good roles, one right after the other, to
make people see that. With luck, this will be the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   A short while later, Lahti was working her way through a salad
in her trailer. ``I knew this was going to be challenging,'' she
said. ``But I guess I didn't realize quite how fulfilling it would
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lahti said she had looked through dozens of feature-length
scripts right after winning the Oscar but couldn't find anything
she wanted to direct. ``Fortunately, I'm in a position where I
don't have to do something; I can afford not to,'' she said. ``And
I am married to a director, so I know how difficult and
all-consuming the job can be. I didn't want to take that much time
unless it was a story that I had to tell.'' (Her husband, Thomas
Schlamme, has directed dozens of television episodes, including,
recently, the pilot of ``The West Wing.'')
</P>
<P>
   Finally this script, which is by Jill Franklyn, came to her, and
the film was shot at various Los Angeles locations in 29 days.
Next, Lahti said, she would like to go back to Broadway, although
she hasn't found the right play yet. And then maybe direct again,
if she can find something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be a director for hire,'' she said. ``But if
another good script were to come along ... ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nine-Yard Formula &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 movie in America for two weeks in a row has been a
modestly budgeted gangster comedy called ``The Whole Nine Yards.''
Since the film stars Bruce Willis and is being released widely by
one of the major studios, Warner Brothers, with a prominent
director, Jonathan Lynn (``My Cousin Vinny''), many people may not
realize what a relative shoestring operation it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not at all an expensive movie to make, and we were able
to shoot it in 35 days,'' Lynn said. ``This was possible only
because we rehearsed it quite thoroughly before we began
shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   What is also not readily apparent to audiences is that despite
the Warner logo, the film was actually fully financed by a new
company called Franchise Pictures, whose chairman, Elie Samaha, has
burst on the Hollywood scene in the last year and carved out deals
with some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Willis, John
Travolta and Sylvester Stallone. Franchise's ambitious slate of
pictures, most of which are to be distributed through Warner
Brothers, are only now beginning to hit theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta will be seen in one Franchise project this summer,
``Battlefield Earth,'' and Stallone will be seen in another, ``Get
Carter.'' It is Franchise's plan to hire top names, offer them
lower-than-normal salaries but potentially lucrative profit-sharing
deals, and then make the movies economically. If all the films do
as well as ``The Whole Nine Yards,'' it is a model others will soon
be copying.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this film, there was a budget and a shooting schedule,
and we were all very clear that this was never going to change,''
Lynn said. ``I didn't mind that. It made everyone very intense and
concentrated. It was actually very fun.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Kung Fu Fan &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Forest Whitaker will be one of the alien villains in
``Battlefield Earth,'' but before that he is starring as a
samurai-obsessed hit man in Jim Jarmusch's ``Ghost Dog: The Way of
the Samurai,'' which he discussed over a plate of pancakes and
vegetarian sausage at a health food restaurant in West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started studying martial arts when I was a kid, growing up
in South Central L.A.,'' Whitaker said. ``I used to carry around
this beat-up paperback called `The Wisdom of Kung Fu.' Even before
that, when I was really young, in East Texas, I remember seeing
some of those early kung fu movies at the local drive-in.''
</P>
<P>
   So he had some definite ideas for ``Ghost Dog,'' he said. For
one thing, there had to be at least one really good kung fu scene.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, whose Spirit Dance Productions employs 14 people in
West Hollywood (and is about to open a new office in London) and
has projects in the works for television series and feature films,
met Jarmusch when he went to pick up some film stock at a technical
house. The two agreed that they would like to work together
someday. It's the kind of thing people say all the time. ``But he
called in about a year and said he had this idea,'' Whitaker said.
``And it was perfect.''

PLANS FOR MEXICAN SALT PLANT ARE CANCELED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Yielding to pressure from environmental groups,
the government and Mitsubishi of Japan canceled plans Thursday to
build a giant salt factory at a pristine Pacific Coast lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to block the proposed plant at Laguna San Ignacio,
a spawning ground for the gray whale set in a breathtaking Baja
California desert, galvanized an unusually broad coalition of
environmental groups, generating petitions by prominent scientists
and a boycott against Mitsubishi products.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo said he had decided not to go forward
with the $100 million project even though an environmental study
released Thursday by the salt company, owned jointly by the Mexican
government and Mitsubishi, showed that the plant would not harm the
whales.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said there was a risk that the project, which would have
paved the desert around the lagoon with huge evaporating pools,
could ``alter the landscape'' that Mexico wanted to preserve.
</P>
<P>
   A Mitsubishi executive, James E. Brumm, said the company was
convinced that it could not predict the plant's effects on the
surroundings.

<P>
   ``Bueno Aires 1910: Memories of the World to Come'' is the
latest ripple in a wave that has been undulating through art,
architecture and entertainment for almost a generation: the rise of
the city as an icon for cultural globalization. In museum shows,
scholarly books and MTV dance marathons, not to mention tourism
promotions, individual cities are being recast as the neighborhoods
of one vast cosmopolitan condition.
</P>
<P>
   Images of Moscow, New York, Prague, Brasilia, Berlin, Vienna,
Lisbon, Chicago, Havana, Dublin, Lagos, Macao, Barcelona and others
are converging like segments of an ever-expanding Baedeker map. The
Buenos Aires show, on view at the World Financial Center, adds a
few new folds.
</P>
<P>
   First presented last year in Buenos Aires, the show was
organized by Margarita Gutman, a professor of urban history at the
University of Buenos Aires, in association with the Getty Research
Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities. Incorporating
more than 500 photographs, drawings, maps and miscellaneous
ephemera, ``Buenos Aires 1910'' documents one of the 20th century's
most dramatic stories of urban growth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, Argentina staged a massive nationwide celebration to
honor the centenary of its independence from Spain. The
modernization of the capital city was the main focus of the event.
Architects and engineers drew up extensive plans _ some practical,
others fantastic _ to guide Buenos Aires into the future.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining vestiges of colonialism were to be cast aside as
the city remade itself in the image of a modern cosmopolis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1895, 15 years after Buenos Aires became Argentina's capital,
the city's population was 663,000. Today, the metropolitan region
is home to 12 million souls. The pivot for this explosive growth
was 1910, a moment when the city gave itself permission to face the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 19th-century industrial cities in Europe and the United
States, Buenos Aires confronted the need for physical expansion
beyond a dense historical core. Local opinion was divided over what
form the expansion should take. One group favored a grid of
straight streets. Another faction fought for diagonal avenues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1909, the government adopted the Centennial Plan, devised by
Joseph M. Bouvard, chief of public works in Paris. Incorporating a
grid overlaid with diagonals, like Pierre L'Enfant's plan for
Washington, Bouvard's plan was arranged in the form of a fan, with
the Plata River port lying at the handle end of the design.
</P>
<P>
   The diagonal avenues radiated inland from the riverfront, which
is in the southwest corner of the city. In effect, the plan was a
microcosm of the entire country, with the port occupying the
position of Buenos Aires on the map. Only portions of this plan
were realized.
</P>
<P>
   Drawings and photographs of public spaces and transportation
infrastructure make up the core of the show. Massive new bridges, a
subway system, parks, avenues and highways, along with industrial
fairs dedicated to the cars that would use them: these feats of
engineering, landscape and industry laid down the capital's
connective tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of iron fabrication, like the hulking black piers of
the Nicolas Avellaneda transport bridge, were permanent versions of
the scaffolding that covered much of Buenos Aires in 1910, when the
city was an immense construction site.
</P>
<P>
   In counterpoint to the city's mostly horizontal infrastructure,
the show presents a series of images that point the way toward the
development of Buenos Aires as a vertical city. Elevated highways,
train viaducts, airplane and balloon corridors are layered above
the streets to serve the city as its buildings increased in height.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly imaginative plan published in a leading
newspaper depicts an elevated train in the form of a roller coaster
ride that soars and dips precariously over the roofline.
</P>
<P>
   Like the fantastic renderings of New York in the same era, these
pictures lie halfway between architecture and advertising. They are
posters in a campaign to promote an image of progress as yet
unsullied by the social upheaval and environmental degradation that
technology would bring in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   The new Buenos Aires was to be more than a symbol of national
pride. It represented a bid for membership in the international
community of advanced industrial production. In effect, the city
became a permanent world's fair, dedicated to international trade.
</P>
<P>
   As one writer observes in the show's impressive catalog, the
city was the country's calling card on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of the centennial events are among the show's most
captivating images. Anticipating the rise of the theme park
metropolis, they depict the citizens surging through streets
adorned with banners and festive lighting, as if they were a grand
opera chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Other sections of the show document more ephemeral forms of the
urban spectacle. Pop songs. Newspapers. Centennial souvenirs.
Nightclubs. Cafes. An appearance by Halley's comet. And that
rousingly theatrical vision of stylized sex, the tango, a dance
that has done infinitely more than architecture to broadcast the
idea of Buenos Aires abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, it took two men to tango. The show is somewhat coy
about this social arrangement. We are shown a provocative picture
of male couples dancing, big bruisers dressed in butchers' aprons.
But we are not told why a dance considered too racy for women to
perform in public would be acceptable when danced by men.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We can speculate about the reasons, but it would be useful to
have the phenomenon explained. How a culture handles dualisms in
one area of life can shed light on others. It took two to design
Buenos Aires, too, as we see in the implicit dichotomies between
architecture and engineering, vertical and horizontal, the grid and
the diagonal plans.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away toward the rear of the show is a section on social
conflict, featuring pictures of striking workers, brandished copies
of left-wing newspapers and an anarchist bomb explosion at the
grand Teatro Colon in 1910. The section illustrates the severity of
political oppression during the centennial events.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of an industrial society was contingent on the fear
provoked by censorship, mass arrests and other police operations.
The classical order of Beaux-Arts architecture represented the
unattainable ideal of a society torn apart by its progressive
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Hodgetts and Ming Fung, two architects based in Los
Angeles, designed the show's installation for its original
presentation in Buenos Aires last year. Their design's handsome
metal armature has been retained for New York, but the show's
setting is otherwise disagreeable.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation has been split in two. One half is installed on
the northern pedestrian bridge of the World Financial Center, the
other on a balcony-level gallery adjacent to Cesar Pelli's Winter
Garden. This arrangement creates problems with continuity and
access.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bridge is in the midst of a remodeling. The
gallery looks like an afterthought to the restaurant court below.
It is disheartening that New York cannot provide a more receptive
venue for such an intelligent exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, lessons to be gained from contrasting the
show to its surroundings. The appeal of city shows like this one
lies in their representation of cultural difference. The message at
the World Financial Center, by contrast, is homogenization.
</P>
<P>
   With its corporate architecture, mall-like shops and
airport-style eating spots, the Winter Garden is Manhattan's
foremost example of the monoculture, the prefabricated environment
brought into being by mass tourism, business travel and industrial
standardization. The retro design of Battery Park City's apartment
buildings adds to the theme park effect.
</P>
<P>
   In this alien setting, visitors are unintentionally prompted to
see the growth of Buenos Aires as symptomatic of the monoculture's
industrial roots. Although the city tried to shed its colonial
image, it packaged its future in a Beaux-Arts image. This was the
image pursued by many European and American cities in the late 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   It was, by design, an international style. Difference mattered
less than similarity. All the calling cards were printed in the
same cursive script.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that big a stretch from this way of thinking to the
outlook embodied at the World Financial Center, which is
essentially an airport without planes. In this complex of buildings
designed by Pelli (a native of Argentina, coincidentally), the
Beaux-Arts model has been run through an edge-city processor. The
place offers the illusion of public space within a high-security
environment patrolled by private guards.
</P>
<P>
   This context puts a sinister spin on the use of urban history to
enrich the promise of cultural globalization. The tendency today is
to look at the emerging global culture in optimistic terms. Many of
us look forward to a time that will respect cultural difference, a
time when the West will surrender its colonial insistence on
judging other civilizations according to our terms. Ideally, shows
like ``Buenos Aires 1910'' should support global diversity.
</P>
<P>
   It could be, however, that shows like this are just diversions
from the homogenization of everything urban. At the World Financial
Center (home of American Express), we stand on the brink of a time
when older urban centers have themselves become edge cities,
providing hotel rooms, work stations, duty-free shopping and
``authentic'' historical entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Urban populations, meanwhile, are transformed into the Mickeys,
Minnies, Snow Whites and Goofys of their hometowns. Airplanes may
not fly through the streets, as envisioned by the architects of
Buenos Aires, but entire cities may be reduced to picturesque
service centers for air carrier hubs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the consortium Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 is credited
as national benefactor for the New York presentation of this fine
traveling show. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Buenos Aires 1910: Memories of the World to Come'' is at the
World Financial Center, Courtyard Gallery and North Bridge, 225
Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, through March 26. In conjunction
with the exhibition, there will be free performances celebrating
Argentina's music, dance, literature and cultural heritage.

`SUENO': WHEN LIFE IS NOT A DREAM BUT AN UNENDING NIGHTMARE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In ``Sueno'' (Dream), Jose Rivera stands on its head
a Spanish theatrical masterpiece about the traps sprung on a person
plodding through the complexities of life as if in a dream. In
Rivera's play _ produced by the MCC Theater under Lisa Peterson's
direction _ the audience is caught in the dream, in which a parade
of bondage, rape, torture, mutilation, murder, treason and civil
war, accompanied by the music and rhythms of flamenco, arouses the
uneasy laughter of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera calls his work a translation and adaptation of ``La Vida
Es Sueno'' (Life Is a Dream), written by Pedro Calderon de la Barca
around 1638. In Calderon's story a king, warned by astrologers that
his son will be a raging maniac, imprisons the baby in a tower,
with but one human contact, an old guardian (Yusef Bulos, whose
sure grip on a complicated character often seems to hold this play
together). After 25 years he frees the captive, only to find that
he may have made his son the monster he feared. A subplot brings in
a woman in armor seeking vengeance on her unknown father, who
abandoned her mother before she herself was born.
</P>
<P>
   Calderon, a superb poet with deep psychological insights,
explored astonishingly modern concerns: an intellectual elite
manipulating nature, determinism undermining free will, child abuse
producing criminality, men subjugating women. His play should
translate easily into captivating present-day theater. That does
not happen here. It is as though Rivera was hesitant about the
Calderon play, unwilling to simply translate it (heroic labor in
itself), or send it up, or lift it into modern times in a modern
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead we get the old play with distracting moments of odd
comedy and with characters wise-cracking in current cliches that
make them seem singularly vacant. At the climax, when the king's
son (John Ortiz, a formidable presence who never fuses the untamed
savage and the awakening world citizen that are combined in this
character) realizes that his liberty gives him the moral freedom to
be just rather than vengeful, he says, ``I've won a great victory
over myself today.'' No wonder viewers giggle nervously. Another
character calls ``Sueno'' ``this tortured soap opera.'' At least
someone is awake.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the comic moments, most of them supplied by three
people, deserve their applause even when they seem out of place.
David Greenspan as the cowardly companion of the female knight
makes high camp the way of wisdom, albeit shatteringly shrill
wisdom. James Urbaniak as a witless duke who wants to usurp the
throne turns the movements of a dancer and the eye of a mime into
body language that makes every remark a tickling lie.
</P>
<P>
   The face of Rebecca Wisocky, as the duke's greedy sister, lets
you see her mind turn 180 degrees away from comprehension of her
lines even as she speaks them. When she wants to express deep
emotion she can turn her spine into something like an accordion, a
trick that produces equal gasps of laughter and disbelief _ perhaps
the best response to ``Sueno.''  &QL;

 REMARKS UNITE CHRISTIAN RIGHT AGAINST McCAIN 
(ADDS ``the Rev.'' in front of Jerry Falwell and Al Sharpton in 3rd

 (rk) 
 By KEVIN SACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is hard to know how many Bob Harrisons are out
there. But each one is a nightmare for Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, a 60-year-old electrical engineer and a leader of the
choir at Atlanta's Mount Paran Church of God, was once an
enthusiastic McCain supporter. He liked the Arizona senator's
heroic military background. He liked his positions on education and
health care. And he liked his penchant for straight talk. ``I was
really pulling for him,'' Harrison said. ``He was the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That all changed this week. Harrison, who considers himself a
Christian conservative voter, was deeply offended by McCain's
attacks on Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, whom he
described in a speech on Monday as ``agents of intolerance''
comparable to Louis Farrakhan and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was out of line,'' Harrison said, pausing on
Wednesday night between dinner in the church fellowship hall and
choir practice. ``It's almost like a John Rocker episode. I don't
agree with everything Robertson and Falwell say, but McCain was
attacking the faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Harrison is leaning toward voting for Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas in Tuesday's Republican primary in Georgia. And if McCain
happens to win the party's nomination, Harrison may stay home in
November rather than casting his traditional Republican vote. ``I
just haven't gotten over this,'' he said, ``and I probably won't.''
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of interviews this week, both the leaders and the rank
and file of the religious conservative movement said that McCain
may succeed in accomplishing what Robertson and Falwell could not.
By unleashing an offensive against the movement's two most visible
spokesmen, in a strategic appeal to moderate Republicans and
independents, McCain seems to have energized Christian conservative
support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the Virginia primary on Tuesday, held the day after McCain
made his widely publicized remarks, Bush won the votes of nearly 80
percent of those who considered themselves part of the religious
right, a significantly higher percentage than in previous
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Not only may McCain have miscalculated by alienating voters like
Harrison and by rousing those who leaned ambivalently toward Bush,
he also may have created for himself a formidable repair job should
he win his party's nomination. Seventeen percent of voters in the
presidential elections of 1992 and 1996 were white Christians who
identified with the religious right, and nearly two-thirds of them
voted for the Republican nominee, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McCain's remarks are irresponsible,'' said Dr. Paige
Patterson, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the
country's largest Protestant denomination, with 14 million members.
``And I would say if he wins the primary, they are the remarks of a
man who apparently doesn't want to be president of the United
States, because it's difficult for me to believe that a Republican
can win the election while deliberately abusing a considerable
segment of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Can McCain win back Christian conservative voters? ``I'd say
it'd be pretty difficult,'' said Patterson, a North Carolinian who
supports Bush. ``I hope evangelical Christians are always willing
to forgive. But I've certainly not seen any disposition on the part
of Mr. McCain to do anything other than critique people of
evangelical faith.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain only deepened his problems with evangelicals by telling
reporters on Tuesday that Robertson and Falwell exerted an ``evil
influence'' on the Republican Party. Those comments followed nearly
two weeks of heavy criticism by McCain of Bush's decision to speak
at Bob Jones University on Feb. 2 without renouncing the
fundamentalist school's ban on interracial dating and the
anti-Catholic views of its leaders. While many Christian
conservatives, including many of the movement's leaders, also
object to the university's practices, they were made uncomfortable
by McCain's intense focus on a Christian college.
</P>
<P>
   McCain apologized on Wednesday, but only for the ``evil
influence'' comment, which he characterized as a ``flip remark.''
Gary Bauer, a Christian conservative leader who endorsed McCain
after withdrawing from the Republican race, issued a statement on
Wednesday repudiating McCain's ``unwarranted, ill-advised and
divisive attacks on certain religious leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Until McCain's speech, the Christian conservative movement had
been riven this year by a debate over its place in American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious conservatives, disillusioned by President
Clinton's political survival and the failure of the
Republican-controlled Congress to change national policy on
abortion, school prayer and gay rights, have advocated a retreat
into the life of the church and the family. That, they say, is the
most effective way to bolster the country's moral standing. Others
insist that Christians must continue to fight for political
influence, while developing the sophistication to understand that
politics is a game of compromise and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who encourage continued political activism, Bush has
been a clear preference over McCain. But the level of fervor for
Bush, a United Methodist, has not approached that enjoyed by Ronald
Reagan or Robertson in their presidential campaigns, according to
movement leaders and academic authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's occasional references to his own conversion
experience and to his admiration for Jesus Christ, some religious
leaders question his level of commitment to their causes. For
instance, Bush favors a constitutional amendment to ban abortion
but supports exceptions in the case of rape, incest and danger to
the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's comments, which were incited by Robertson's
campaigning against him in South Carolina and Michigan, may at
least temporarily unify the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the short run it could be counterproductive and
mobilize the faithful to rally against McCain as much as rally for
Bush,'' said Charles Reagan Wilson, the director of the Center for
the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi and
the author of a book on religion in the South.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Green, a professor at the University of Akron who
studies religion and politics, speculated that McCain's attacks
might even prolong the life of Robertson's Christian Coalition.
``They really thrive on adversity,'' he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Monday, delivered in Robertson's home town of
Virginia Beach, Va., McCain strove to draw distinctions between
Robertson and Falwell on one hand and other evangelical leaders who
he said were ``changing America for the better.'' By contrast, he
said that Robertson and Falwell ``have turned good causes into
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   But that nuance seems to have been lost on many Christian
conservatives. While many do not agree with either the political
views or tactics embraced by Robertson and Falwell, they often
admire their record in winning converts to Christ. And already
sensitive to what they see as a media caricature of them as
zealots, they clearly view McCain's attack on Robertson and Falwell
as a broad assault on all evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rather liked McCain for a while,'' said Marion J. Fisher, a
70-year-old retired secretary who was interviewed during the
Wednesday night fellowship at Southside Baptist Church in Lakeland,
Fla. ``But lately, talk about hate-mongering. I mean, the religious
right, quote unquote, gets a lot of flak about promoting hate. To
me, that's what he's doing now, throwing mud and bad-mouthing
people who have faith and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most grating to many Christian conservatives is their
feeling that McCain pandered to their detractors by playing on the
stereotype that they are a homogeneous collection of intolerant
extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff plays well with people whose conception of a
fundamentalist Christian is that they're not smart enough to be
enlightened,'' said Ron L. Plemmons, the 37-year-old pastor at
Southside Baptist Church in Lakeland. ``What bothers me about it is
that you paint with such a broad stroke of the brush. And what's
amazing to me is that Ronald Reagan was elected to two terms by
embracing the pro-life, pro-conservative religious movement. And
here's someone, John McCain, who claims to be a Reagan Republican
yet tries to run against the very same people.''

KARIEL GARDOSH, WHO CREATED ISRAELI ICON, DIES AT 79  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: France)  By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Kariel Gardosh, an Israeli political cartoonist who
captured the national psyche in depictions of his country as an
innocent boy in a tough neighborhood, died on Monday in Tel Aviv.
He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac arrest, his newspaper, Maariv, said.
</P>
<P>
   Gardosh was popularly known as Dosh, the name he signed on his
cartoons. His trademark was the impish figure Srulik, a boy in
shorts, sandals and a brimless Israeli sun hat whose expressions
reflected the sharp swings of the Israeli public mood:
alternatively defiant, mournful, triumphant or perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   Often facing down a hostile Arab world in cartoons published in
the 1960s and 1970s, Srulik reflected the self-image of a small
embattled nation, a perception that has faded as Israel has made
peace with some of its neighbors and emerged as a regional power.
But Srulik remains a national icon, featured on posters and
stickers and celebrated in a stamp issued to commemorate Israel's
50th anniversary in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dosh's Srulik is the symbol of Israel, like Marianne is the
symbol of France, John Bull is the symbol of Great Britain and
Uncle Sam is the symbol of the United States,'' wrote Gardosh's
friend Yosef Lapid, an Israeli legislator, in a published tribute.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Budapest, Gardosh went through forced labor camps in
World War II and lost his family in the Holocaust. He studied
literature at the Sorbonne before immigrating to British-ruled
Palestine in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   An aspiring journalist hampered by a lack of knowledge of
Hebrew, he began drawing for newspapers of Lehi, a militant Jewish
underground group.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953 he was hired by Maariv, where his cartoons appeared
until his death. English versions of his cartoons were published in
The Jerusalem Post. From 1981 to 1983 he served as the cultural
attache in the Israeli Embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
   A political conservative who also wrote occasional columns,
Gardosh often used his cartoons to depict a beleaguered Israel
confronting the world, particularly the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   In his last cartoon, published in Maariv last week, he commented
on recent Arab condemnations of Israel after it bombed power plants
in Lebanon. His drawing showed mosques topped by crescents lined
with menacing teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Collections of Gardosh's cartoons were published in several
books. One volume published after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war was
titled ``Sorry We Won.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardosh is survived by his companion, Tova Pardo, a daughter, a
son and three grandchildren.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ At every campaign stop, Sen. John McCain introduces
his wife, Cindy McCain, as ``the one who everyone says, `Why isn't
she the candidate?''' But until a few months ago, no one, including
either of the McCains, saw her as someone who could take on so much
as a supporting role in a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even some friends considered her not only disinterested, but
simply too fragile _ and in the rough calculus of political life,
probably a liability. Her life in Arizona, where her husband has
joined her on weekends and holidays throughout his Senate career,
had always revolved around their children and her parents, who live
across the street. Politics was a subject the McCains rarely
discussed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And if the public had heard of her at all, it was probably as a
result of the 1994 headlines about a federal investigation into her
theft of painkillers from a medical charity she ran. Or because of
the Keating Five savings and loan scandal a few years earlier,
which she was drawn into as well. Today, drug-free since 1993, she
looks back on that time in their lives as a moment that ``nearly
destroyed both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in contrast, news reports about Mrs. McCain have been
uniformly positive. Crowds like her, the camera loves her, and, not
insignificantly, her husband seems to have noticed, too: ``She's
really blossomed,'' he said. Those who know the couple say it is a
profound relief for Mrs. McCain to find that she is widely
perceived as a political asset to him.
</P>
<P>
   And in this new role, at age 45, she seems to be seeing not Sen.
McCain but herself in another light: ``It's overwhelming,'' she
said, ``how much interest there is in the partner.''
</P>
<P>
   For months now, more than any other presidential candidate's
wife, she has been a regular on the campaign trail. Through 14-hour
work days, she is almost constantly at her husband's elbow, smiling
as she double-steps to keep up with him in crowds, and nodding at
just the right moments during the speech she has heard hundreds of
times.
</P>
<P>
   Getting on the campaign's Straight Talk Express bus again one
morning last week, she said she had expected to hate campaigning,
and planned to avoid it as much as possible. And no one was more
surprised than she was, she says, that she has instead really taken
to life on the road: ``For most of the 20 years we've been married,
he's been in Washington all week while I'm in Arizona with the
kids,'' she explained. ``I've never spent this much time with my
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign trail, of course, does not offer much quality time
for the candidate and his wife, either. But she says she is mostly
here to help, and she certainly does: She smoothes her husband's
hair and helps him with his jacket _ the injuries he suffered as a
prisoner of war prevent him from raising his arms over his head _
and watches his diet, too, though often in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Intensely protective, she also gives a pretty good stiff arm to
photographers who try to get too close _ not to her, but to her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   And she tries to see that he sleeps. During the flap about his
Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, carrying his own feather
pillow on the road, someone asked Senator McCain whether, he, too,
had brought a pillow from home. Yeah, he said, and gestured towards
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   She is a quiet presence on the bus, and by far its best turned
out passenger, in her St. John knit suits and patent leather pumps,
with a soft-spoken femininity that does recall her role model,
Jackie Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hip haircut that an aide insists is sweeping
Washington, she carries herself in a way that is distinctly
unmodern: Years of dance training have endowed her with perfect
posture, and she usually stands with one foot forward, in the
fourth position.
</P>
<P>
   Often, she sits up front reading magazines and fielding calls
from her kids while her husband holds forth with reporters in back.
But when he does bring her into the conversation by teasing her, as
he did one day in New Hampshire _ when he referred to ``a certain
dyed blond'' and she pretended to throw something at him _ she
beams, and basks in the attention.
</P>
<P>
   She seems always to have revered her war hero husband, 18 years
her senior, whom she met when she was only 25: ``I see the crowds
and their faces and they're looking at him with hope and it's nice
people agree with me. He's a real inspiration.'' Then she stopped
and added, ``I guess anyone would say that about their husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, seeing that her husband needed a day off, she pinch
hit for him while he took a break in Arizona. ``She did a very
stoic thing, while we all went to the cabin and grilled chicken and
drank beer and slept for 12 hours,'' said his longtime aide Mark
Salter.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Mrs. McCain doesn't speak much to voters, but does make
a striking appearance, and her husband's admirers frequently tell
him they are wowed by her looks: ``I like your taste in women,''
one woman told him last weekend as Mrs. McCain sat at his side. A
supporter in San Diego last week waved a sign that said, ``Cindy is
a Babe.''
</P>
<P>
   Her assistant says that the number one question she gets is how
she manages to look at all moments as though she just returned from
a week at a spa. When asked that question yet again, she blushed
and said, ``I don't do anything special. I just love being with my
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Far less flattering questions get a similarly positive response.
When asked whether she ever worried about how her addiction to
painkillers had affected her children, the oldest of whom was 7 at
the time she was dependent on Percocet and Vicodin, she said, ``No.
It was more for me that I missed a
</P>
<P>
   great deal. I missed a lot of what went on. But I'm a better
person and a better parent for having gone through that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And she went through quite a bit. In 1991, her husband was
rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee for exercising poor judgment
in meeting with federal regulators who were investigating Charles
Keating Jr., the owner of a failing savings and loan who was also a
friend and donor. Mrs. McCain was involved in the matter as well
because she had helped keep her husband's books and could not find
receipts showing that they had reimbursed Keating for flying on his
corporate jet to his vacation home in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   It was under pressure of that scandal, and after back surgery,
that she became addicted to painkillers. And though her drug
problem went on for a couple of years, her husband never noticed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was not McCain but his wife's parents who became
worried by her erratic behavior and confronted her. More than a
year later, when federal authorities began investigating reports
that she had stolen drugs from the charity, the senator finally
learned of his wife's addiction _ just before her troubles, too,
hit the front page.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, news of Mrs. McCain tends to focus on her constant
cell phone conversations with her children. And one of her closest
friends, Sharon Harper, said that she is enjoying every minute of
her moment: ``She does really well so there's a lot of
reinforcement, a lot of validation and reassurance along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCain herself suggests that as a stay-at-home mom, the
little gold stars were harder to come by: ``There have been times,
particularly in Washington, when they shake your hand and look over
your head _ ``Where's John?'' _ but I don't really care what they
think.''
</P>
<P>
   The only child of a wealthy Phoenix beer distributor, Jim
Hensley, she was a little lonely growing up, she said, and always
knew she wanted children.
</P>
<P>
   After college and graduate school at the University of Southern
California _- an institution her husband refers to as the
University of Spoiled Children _ she shunned a major role in the
family business and taught for a few months as a special education
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   When she met McCain, and they ``fell in love at first sight,''
as she said, he was still married and living with his first wife.
But she was so shy, so obviously not the initiator, his first
wife's friends have said, that even then, no one blamed her.
</P>
<P>
   After years as ``a background spouse,'' as Salter referred to
her, McCain only got her to go along with his presidential plans by
promising that she would never have to set foot in Iowa or New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But then, over the course of the campaign, she began to feel
needed.
</P>
<P>
   At a town hall meeting in Peterborough, New Hampshire, last
October, someone in the audience asked about Mrs. McCain's agenda.
``Her special project? It would be keeping me under control,'' her
husband said, winking at the audience before handing the microphone
over to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right,'' she began, ``my first concern is to keep him
under control, but I'm a stay-at-home mother. If our family is
running well and our home is running well that enables my husband
to do his job better. I don't like labels, but if there's a label
for me, it would be traditional, and I'm very proud to be
traditional,'' she said, to huge applause.
</P>
<P>
   Her issues as first lady, she says, would be adoption and foster
care.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her years in Narcotics Anonymous, Mrs. McCain doesn't
mention drug treatment as a principle focus, and in fact advocates
a return to Nancy Reagan's `Just Say No' anti-drug philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even as her husband's most loyal supporter, how does
she appear ever rapt during the stump speech _ and filled with
delight at every retelling of his jokes? She laughed. ``Let's just
say it's very exciting when there's a new joke.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of times, she has cried in full view of reporters, most
recently on the day of the South Carolina primary. ``Losing is not
what bothered me,'' she explained. ``It was how we lost. When they
criticized me for having an adopted child of color, that capped it.
That was despicable.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to reports, disputed by the Bush camp, that
there were campaign leaflets characterizing Mrs. McCain as a drug
addict who had adopted a black baby; her 8-year-old daughter
Bridget was born in Bangladesh, and Mrs. McCain brought her here
for medical care. She decided to adopt her on the flight back,
before talking to her husband, and at the airport, told him, ``Meet
your daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on his campaign plane, McCain referred to that
display of emotion as ``the only time I saw her slip during this
whole thing'' and called her ``very emotional'' and ``not a
political sophisticate.''
</P>
<P>
   And when, at the end of yet another long day during which Mrs.
McCain spent virtually every moment supporting him, the senator was
asked to describe his marriage to her, he rubbed his hands over his
face before answering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most marriages,'' he said, sitting next to her on the
plane, ``it has a lot of revolving around our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   If these are not exactly the words every wife is longing to
hear, however, Mrs. McCain did not protest, or register any
reaction at all.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would describe his wife to a friend who did not
know her, the senator said, ``as a very kind person, committed to
her children, and never before this campaign politically involved.
She's really blossomed.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, she pulled a blanket over him and watched
as he drifted off to sleep.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bronx neighborhood where Amadou Diallo died was
in mourning Thursday for yet another unarmed man who died in a
confrontation with police, but Mayor Rudolph Giuliani cast the case
as starkly different, saying the victim had a history of drug
crimes, was carrying heroin and had fled from and struggled with an
officer.
</P>
<P>
   As the killing confronted City Hall and New Yorkers with new
questions over police conduct, Diallo's parents and the Rev. Al
Sharpton met with Justice Department officials in Washington to
press for the filing of federal civil rights charges against the
four officers acquitted in Diallo's death a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Disputing new allegations of overly aggressive police tactics,
Giuliani and senior police officials took some pains Thursday to
reconstruct and explain the death of Malcolm Ferguson, 23, who was
killed Wednesday night by a plainclothes officer, Louis Rivera, 33,
at 1045 Boynton Ave., in Soundview, two blocks from the doorway
where Diallo died.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Diallo, a black man with no criminal record who was
standing in his doorway and killed in a hail of 41 bullets by four
white officers who said they mistook his wallet for a gun,
Ferguson, who had been in and out of jail, fled as officers
approached him and identified themselves, and was shot once in the
head as he grappled with the pursuing officer on a dark stairway.
</P>
<P>
   Police noted that Ferguson was black, while the officer who shot
him is Hispanic, and the four officers with him at the time
included two white men and two black men. Senior police officials
said that there appeared to be no racial implications in the case,
as critics saw in the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a totally different situation,'' Giuliani said. . He
called the dead man ``a serious criminal'' with nine prior arrests
and said: ``The police have to arrest drug dealers. If police
officers act in the line of duty to protect a community from
violent criminals and drug dealers, then that community should
stand up and support them.''
</P>
<P>
   But friends and relatives of Ferguson disputed aspects of the
police version of events, and expressed anguish over what they
called the needless death of a young man who was troubled but not
violent, quiet-spoken, friendly, easy-going, and even trustworthy
as a baby-sitter.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people gathered Thursday night for a peaceful
protest outside the building where Ferguson died. And as candles
flickered over flowers banked in a makeshift shrine on the
doorstep, an anguished mother, Juanita Young, insisted that her
son's death was more than a terrible accident, and could not be
justified by his criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   ``They murdered my son,'' she said in a brief interview.
``That's it. They murdered my son. The mayor is going to judge a
person just by what's on a piece of paper? What they're saying
about him is a stone-faced lie. That boy was human, like you and
me. They didn't have to kill him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were signs taped to the door, proclaiming, ``Malcolm we
love you'' and ``Justice for Malcolm. Another bore the pictures of
people shot by the police in New York in recent years. ``We're not
here to fight the police, we're here to protest,'' one speaker
shouted as scores of officers stood by silently.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Ferguson lived in the South Bronx, but
spent most of his time with friends at 1045 Boynton Ave., a
four-story tenement. It is midway on a block of similar buildings
scarred by decades of neglect and by what police call a culture of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they had made 144 drug arrests on the block since
1997, and 86 of them have been at 1045 Boynton. Within recent
weeks, after making several heroin buys at the building, undercover
officers raided a second-floor flat and arrested Julio Reyes, 24,
and William Cadiz, 18, both friends of Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes and Cadiz, free on bail pending their trials, had spent
the afternoon Wednesday with Ferguson, and all three were in the
lobby together when the events of the fatal confrontation began to
unfold, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, a police officer since 1995 who has had two
unsubstantiated civilian complaints and four citations for
excellent or meritorious duty, is normally assigned to the
department's housing division street narcotics unit, but was
working Wednesday night with a unit that patrols housing projects
on the lookout for drug sales, public drinking or other problems.
</P>
<P>
   He and four other plainclothes team members _ Officers Kevin
Woods, Sean Ianucci, Joel Brathwaite and Kenneth Washington _ were
walking to the Bronx River Houses nearby and were passing 1045
Boynton about 6:20 p.m. when Ianucci saw three men inside the
doorway and signaled that he had seen some suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
   The door opened as Rivera approached, apparently because someone
was exiting. Before the door slammed shut, however, Rivera rushed
forward and squeezed in. As he did so, police said, Ferguson bolted
down a 45-foot hallway. .
</P>
<P>
   While two other officers entered and put Cadiz and Reyes up
against a wall to frisk them, Rivera drew his gun, a 16-shot Smith
&AMP; Wesson semiautomatic, and chased Ferguson along the hall, only
steps behind.
</P>
<P>
   A turn to the left at the end of the hall brought the fugitive
and his pursuer to the dark stairway. From that point, Ferguson and
Rivera were alone, and could no longer be seen by the others.
</P>
<P>
   The two men raced up toward the second floor. But before
reaching the second floor, a struggle occurred and Rivera's gun
discharged once, police said. The bullet struck Ferguson in the
left temple, and he slumped dead across the top few steps, his
right arm draped over the black and white tiles on the second floor
and his head slumped toward the railing.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, invoking a right of police officers to remain silent for
48 hours, has not been interviewed about what happened. But
investigators, going on physical evidence at the scene and accounts
of two witnesses in an adjacent building who saw part of the events
through a window on a landing, said there appeared to be little
doubt that Ferguson was killed in a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses, they said, saw the struggle, though not the
shooting.

BUSH AND McCAIN TRADE BITTER CRITICISM AS CAMPAIGNS IN NEW YORK (rk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain and George W. Bush head into New York Friday to
begin personally campaigning in a state whose primary seems likely
to help determine their fate, after setting a bitter stage Thursday
with a harsh round of exchanges about the way each man is trying to
win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in particular, seemed angered over a tough new round of
attacks Bush and his New York supporters launched this week in
anticipation of next Tuesday's primaries. They portrayed the
Arizona senator as anti-New York and as an opponent of breast
cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is, Governor Bush, get out of the gutter,'' McCain
said in Los Angeles. ``Let's stop this kind of campaign.`
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign aides were also infuriated by a political
commercial that popped up on television stations in New York, Ohio
and California. The ad labels its sponsor as ``Republicans for
Clean Air,'' _ a group that the McCain campaign contended was a
front for Bush, which would violate campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference and later on his campaign bus, McCain
returned repeatedly to what he described as the negative nature of
the Bush campaign, and asserted that he would risk getting pulled
into a back-and-forth argument about campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   At one point on the bus, McCain cited one of his campaign
strategists, Mike Murphy, declaring, ``There's a famous Murphy
saying, which he stole from somebody: `When you wrestle with a pig,
you both get dirty and the pig likes it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in his own brief meeting with reporters, raised questions
about the temperament of his opponent, repeatedly using the word
``angry'' to describe McCain. ``Mr. McCain is running an angry
campaign,'' Bush said. ``And I'm going to talk about how to make
the education system better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's press secretary, Karen Hughes, dismissed McCain's
suggestion that the Bush campaign had resorted to low-road tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a habit in this campaign,'' she said. ``Every time
someone disagrees with Senator McCain on a substantive policy issue
he vilifies, he begins calling them names.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two main Republican contenders quarreled in California,
Bush's two main New York supporters _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
Gov. George Pataki _ turned on each other in an ever-more-public
quarrel over how Bush should take on McCain's challenge. Pataki and
his advisers have counseled Bush to run an aggressive campaign, and
as his surrogates, they have attacked McCain over votes he has
taken in Congress that might hurt him with New York voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani, who has shown no shyness during his political
career over such attacks, including in his current race for Senate
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, has demurred in this case, refusing
to participate Thursday in a news conference attacking McCain. His
campaign manager, Bruce J. Teitelbaum, said the mayor would avoid
these kind of events and criticized the governor's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comprehend why it's so difficult for some people to
understand that the mayor has made a principled decision not to
engage in negative attacks against John McCain,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's chief political adviser, responded: `I am
puzzled about how the Giuliani administration could perceive that a
senator's voting record isn't something that should be looked at
and carefully examined.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere that was evident as the candidates prepared for
the final weekend of campaigning before next Tuesday's vote was
charged by the orchestrated attacks Bush made on McCain's voting
record, in radio advertisements, a television commercial and
mailings.
</P>
<P>
   And it was heightened by the purchase of air time in New York,
Ohio and California by the clean-air group, which McCain's campaign
said was a ``shadow organization'' operating with the approval of
Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers denied the contention, although records show
that the firm that bought the television time in New York,
Multi-Media Services Corp. of Virginia, has a long record of
working with Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   In placing the advertisements, Republicans for Clean Air
provided a post office box in Virginia as its address. That box is
also the address of a political action committee led by Rep. Henry
Bonilla of Texas, a close Bush ally. Lydia Meuret, the executive
director of Bonilla's committee, said Thursday that she owned the
box and that she was a consultant to Republicans for Clean Air. But
she said there was no connection between Bonilla and the group that
bought the ad.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, which praises Bush's record on clean air while
criticizing McCain's, prompted irate responses from
environmentalists who said it distorted the truth.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the commercial says that as governor of Texas, Bush
``led one of the first states in America to clamp down on old
coal-burning electric power plants.'' But environmentalists said
the program was voluntary and ultimately ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Rockefeller, a prominent Republican environmentalist in
New York, said, `` George W. Bush has probably one of the worst
environmental records of any governor in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans for Clean Air was unknown to the Federal Elections
Commission and to political professionals in both parties. It has
no telephone listing in New York state or Washington and has no Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, said the commercial
violated federal rules requiring disclosure of who is behind
political advertising, and he suggested collusion between the
sponsors and the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are questions of whether this is being done in
connection with the Bush campaign,'' Davis said, ``I call upon the
Bush campaign to explain what relationship they have with this
group and what they may have done in coordination with this
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the sponsors had bought $1.5 million worth of air
time for the ad in New York _ a large amount for a single week _
and more than $400,000 for similar commercials in California and
Ohio, which also hold their primaries on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, spokesman for Bush, said that neither the
governor nor his campaign aides knew who was behind the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to do with these ads, and the governor will
continue to run a campaign that unites our party and nation without
vilifying those who disagree with him,'' he said. ``The senator
keeps hurting himself by going too far on just about everything. He
keeps going on the attack against just about everything that moves.
He's only hurting himself, so we're happy to let his attack speak
for itself.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mucha, a spokesman for Pataki, said that she and the governor
also had no knowledge of the group or its advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to two television spots touting Bush's record, there
is a radio ad, being broadcast in the New York area, attacking
McCain over breast cancer, an often hot political issue.
</P>
<P>
   The radio commercial features Geri Barish, a leader of One in
Nine, a breast cancer patients and survivors group, chastising
McCain for opposing funding for several breast cancer research and
treatment projects in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The raw material for the ads came from McCain's own campaign Web
site, where he lists hundreds of items that he says he would cut
from the current federal budget. The site calls the projects
``wasteful, unnecessary and low-priority spending.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about what's on his Web page,'' Bush told
reporters Thursday after appearing at a charter school in Chula
Vista, Calif. ``He put on his Web page that these programs, he was
going to cut back on these programs. This is something John McCain
laid out.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain declined to discuss the charges and countercharges. ``I'm
going to do everything in my power not to get down into those
weeds,'' he said in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The breast cancer ad is part of a strategy that Bush's New York
supporters have turned to in their efforts to stop McCain. They
contend that he has voted against spending in areas like breast
cancer research, mass transit, home heating oil subsidies and solar
energy, that are of particular interest here.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides countered that in many of those votes, he did not
object to the projects themselves, but the way they were approved
without being considered in committee and competing with other
projects on their merits. Instead, the items were usually inserted
into bills just before floor votes at the behest of powerful
sponsors.

OIL MINISTERS AGREE PRODUCTION SHOULD INCREASE
</HEADLINE>
  (CORRECTS name to ``Ali al-Naimi'' in 6th graf; ADDS quote from
French industry minister   in 1st graf of optional trim) 
 (rk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With the high cost of oil and gasoline spreading alarm
through western economies, oil ministers from Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and Mexico _ all among the world's major exporters _ met
here Thursday and agreed that production should be increased to
stabilize prices, but they declined to make firm commitments on the
timing or the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Oil market traders interpreted the absence of such commitments
as an indication that producers may not meet demands by the United
States and other oil-consuming nations for a substantial increase
in output.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices, which have risen to nine-year highs in recent weeks
and jumped 4 percent on Wednesday, ended little changed Thursday on
the vague outcome of the oil ministers' meeting in London.The
London price of Brent crude for April delivery rose to $29.47 a
barrel before settling back to $29.22, up 10 cents. In New York,
oil for April delivery briefly rose to $32.15 a barrel before
retreating to settle at $31.69, down 8 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is to meet in
Vienna on March 27 to decide whether to increase production or to
maintain the present reduced output, as some exporters led by Iran,
Libya and Algeria are demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC still has moderates and still has price hawks,'' said
Peter Gignoux, an oil analyst with Salomon Smith Barney here. ``We
still need to get a consensus'' for the Vienna meeting, he said.
``I think we are looking at high oil prices for a bit to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, acknowledged Thursday that
``there is need for additional production. The issue is when and
how much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uppermost in our minds is to maintain stability in the
market,'' he said, but he refused to specify the likely scope of a
production increase. ``I think the number will be put forward when
we finish our consultation with all other members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are seeking the number, you are not going to get it
today,'' he told reporters. He also declined to say whether he was
aiming at a specific price level and would not comment on
suggestions that producers want oil prices in the United States to
sink below $25 a barrel. ``We are going to leave that up to the
market for now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates at the discussions here have said privately they
expect production to be increased next month by 1 million or 1.2
million barrels a day. The United States would like to see
production increase by 2 million to 3 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   World oil consumption runs at around 77 million barrels per day
but, since OPEC agreed deep production cuts last March, production
has dropped to 75 million barrels a day. The shortfall of 2 million
barrels a day has tripled oil prices since December 1998, when they
had fallen to $10, the lowest in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Retail gasoline prices have reached an average of $1.421 per
gallon in the United States, the world's biggest oil-consumer, and
there is some expectation they will reach $2 by the summer driving
season, when demand is highest.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. energy secretary, Bill Richardson, who has just
returned to Washington after a visit to major oil producers has
called the rising prices and dwindling supplies a threat to global
economic growth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those views were echoed Thursday by the French industry
minister, Christian Pierret, who also warned producers that high
prices would strangle their own markets in the West. ``As far as
France is concerned, the persistence of high prices could affect
world economic growth and weigh on the inflationary pressures that
might appear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's production cuts are set to expire on March 31.
Historically, however, demand for oil falls in the second three
months of the year with the arrival of spring in the Northern
Hemisphere, and prices tend to weaken. That cyclical shift has
provided OPEC's hawks with the argument against increased
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept that oil prices are high at the moment, but they will
fall in the second quarter when we expect demand to drop by 2.8
million barrels per day,'' said Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, an
Iranian oil ministry official. ``If we increase output while demand
is falling it will be detrimental to prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran has previously called for the OPEC production cuts to be
maintained through September and the official's remarks seemed to
signal continued deep division within OPEC about raising production
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly no decision taken yet,'' said Frederic
Lassere, an analyst at Societe Generale in Paris, who argued that
of the three oil-producers meeting here, Mexico was probably under
greatest pressure from the United States to increase output.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is not a member of OPEC, which accounts for around one
third of worldwide oil production, but has agreed to cooperate with
the group's decision at its Vienna meeting later this month. ``An
increase in production is warranted'' because of a dramatic
increase in demand, the Mexican oil minister, Luis Tellez, said
Thursday. ``We believe there is a need for more oil in the
market,'' he said, but indicated that Mexico would prefer not to
break ranks while OPEC was seeking a broad agreement among its
members. ``We will wait to see this consensus before making our
independent decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The move to raise oil production won further cautious support
Thursday when Norway, another non-OPEC country that joined in last
year's production cuts, indicated that it backed a return to less
volatile prices. ``It is a goal that we should reach long-term
stability that is fair to both producing and consuming countries.
There is a danger when the price is very low and when it gets very
high,'' Marit Arnstad, the Norwegian oil minister, said in Paris
Thursday.

 McCAIN'S NEW YORK REBELS MAKE THEIR STAND IN UNPRETENTIOUS PLACES  
 (bl)  
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAVA CENTER, N.Y. _ Travelers driving through the wintry brown
hills of western New York state might miss this place, technically
considered a town. Its center comprises little more than a railroad
crossing, a Roman Catholic church and the Sad Dog Saloon.
</P>
<P>
   The saloon is a roadside place, a place with a portrait gallery
of poker-playing dogs, fish-fry dinners on Fridays and a police
scanner to serenade the regulars. But lately, the Sad Dog has
become a cell of rebellion, where people hope to rattle the state
Republican leadership in Albany, 300 miles to the east, by plotting
against its chosen one, George W. Bush, in the state party's
presidential primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Let the word go forth: the Sad Dog is for the other guy, John
McCain. And if you need lapel stickers or want to make a round of
calls for the cause, go see that man behind the Coors Light, Thomas
Moran, a retired railroad worker, Sad Dog habitue and the 27th
Congressional District coordinator for the McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many stickers you need?'' he shouted to one of the bar's
elder statesmen, who was immersed in his daily game of euchre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gimme five,'' creaked the answer from behind a handful of
cards. ``My sister might want one.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Moran's territory _ a rural stretch of dairy farms,
vineyards and small towns south of Buffalo and west of Rochester _
seems as far removed as one can get from the Bush-McCain fight for
the state's Republican delegates. New York City and Albany, yes.
But Java Center? Where the town name is pronounced JAY-va Center,
as if to thwart confusion with some smug Manhattan cafe? Where CB
radio can disrupt the reception of the Sad Dog's television?
</P>
<P>
   But each of the state's 31 congressional districts has three
delegates and three alternate delegates for the candidates to win.
In a way, that makes the district's small towns of Arcade, Clarence
and Java Center just as important to the state Republican Party as
White Plains or Mineola. As Dan Allen, a state party spokesman,
said, ``It's like 31 special elections across the state.''
</P>
<P>
   They are especially vital to the Sad Dog candidate, that senator
from Arizona. Having lost primaries to Bush in Virginia, Washington
and North Dakota this week, McCain desperately needs to come
roaring back in the Super Tuesday primaries in 13 states, including
California, Ohio, Massachusetts _ and New York. A loss may very
well transform that McCain poster, hanging beneath the Coors Light
mirror, from statement to novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all Tuesday,'' said Moran, 51, whose loss in a state
Assembly race two years ago gave him a taste of what he describes
as big-time politics. ``Tuesday's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran is one in a cadre of Republican rebels and newcomers who
have helped to turn next week's Bush-McCain matchup into the first
contested primary since Alfonse D'Amato challenged Sen. Jacob
Javits in 1980. There are Michael O'Sullivan, a travel agent and a
political neophyte, coordinating the effort in Rockland County, and
Seth Arluck, a lumberyard owner, working in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bob McNeil, the St. Lawrence County treasurer and a
normally obedient Republican, is fielding dozens of e-mails from
McCain supporters near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the state campaign has been based in what Gerry
O'Brien, the state's political director, calls ``a ramshackle
series of offices in the St. George section of Staten Island, with
a scenic view of the ferry terminal.'' But O'Brien _ a political
consultant who worked on Larry Rockefeller's ill-fated run for the
Senate in 1992 _ said that room was recently made for a group of
advisers from McCain's national headquarters in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call them the cavalry,'' he said, ``and are we delighted to
see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several McCain coordinators said the David-and-Goliath feel to
the McCain-Bush fight fills them with bravado and dread. They
rejoiced when state Republican leaders gave in to charges of
bossism and granted McCain access to the ballot. But the ballot's
structure is intended, they said, to skew the contest in favor of
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Here is why. The names of proposed delegates will appear in
large type, while the names of presidential candidates will appear
immediately below, but in small type. Since the Republican
leadership supports Bush, the familiar names of prominent party
members _ county chairmen, state senators, members of Congress _
will essentially be shouted as Bush delegates on the ballot, while
those of lesser Republican lights will be whispered as McCain
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the really big challenge for Senator McCain,'' McNeil
said. ``The delegates for Bush are generally really big names.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27th District is a case in point. The three Bush delegates
are Robert E. Davis, the Erie County Republican chairman, and two
state senators, Michael F. Nozzolio and Mary Lou Rath. Of the three
McCain delegates, Moran might be the best known because he was Java
Center's part-time supervisor and was once the chairman of Wyoming
County's board of supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, the spokesman for the state Republican Party, disputed
that contention, saying the candidates' names are easy to find. As
for having big-name delegates pitted against little-known
delegates, he said, ``It's a matter of having a message that
resonates with Republican leaders across the state, and that's why
Mr. Bush got their support.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, the faint whiff of droit du seigneur _ along with having
read McCain's autobiography _ drove Moran from dutifully endorsing
Governor Bush of Texas to embracing the underdog. With some words
sent in an e-mail to the McCain campaign's Web site,
www.McCain2000.com, followed by a few conversations with officials
on Staten Island, he wound up being Big John's man in the 27th.
</P>
<P>
   So empowered, Moran unilaterally declared the Sad Dog to be
district headquarters. He then invited volunteers to come today to
meet him, pick up lists of get-out-the-vote phone calls to make,
and maybe even have a beer.
</P>
<P>
   It was more of a charming offer than a serious edict. Java
Center, after all, does not even have a stoplight; it is 8 miles
from the nearest supermarket, in Arcade, and 11 miles from the
nearest movie theater, in East Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   Moran, a short, white-haired man who could pass as McCain's
younger brother, fanned out some bumper stickers and placards on a
table, ordered his usual and waited. The police scanner squawked, a
couple of regulars debated the finer points of car motors, and the
owner, Dave Hackett _ whose ever-forlorn visage gave name to his
saloon _ hovered.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, Doug Berwanger, a dairy farmer and the town
supervisor of Arcade, and Jim Schlick, the Republican commissioner
for the county board of elections, walked in and ordered beers.
Berwanger is an alternate delegate for McCain; he shoved the Arcade
phone list into a pocket of his maroon blazer. Schlick professed
neutrality, but agreed to take the Attica phone list for his wife,
an avid McCain supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Time passed. The owner scolded Moran for putting campaign
literature on a table reserved for the daily euchre game.
</P>
<P>
   Then four seniors from Clarence High School, more than an hour
away, walked in. They said their interest in the McCain campaign
stemmed from a class on government and politics. Now, they said,
they could not wait to wave signs and make calls for their
candidate. Two of them will vote on Tuesday; the other two will
turn 18 in time to vote in the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
   Moran handed them lists with a total of 1,400 phone calls to
make in Clarence, and offered some advice: ``You say something
like, `Hello, I'm Kristina, and I'm for John McCain, and I hope
you'll support us on Tuesday.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's easy!'' chirped one of the students, Kristina Hartzell.
Soon she and her friends were out the door, arms laden with bumper
stickers and placards.
</P>
<P>
   More time passed. Outside, a heavy rain turned the dirt parking
lot to mud. Inside, snippets of bar talk provided distraction.
Someone asked a man at the end of the bar whether he supported
Hillary. ``I'm not familiar with the man,'' he said earnestly.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, Doug Hill, 38, an elementary school teacher,
stopped by to pick up a phone list of 450 names; he had driven 40
miles from Le Roy to participate in his first campaign. Then came
Jeremiah Thompson, 21, the campaign's coordinator at the State
University at Geneseo.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he was devoted to a candidate who had caught his
fancy with a stint on the Comedy Central cable network.
</P>
<P>
   The beer lights in the Sad Dog now glowed all the brighter,
which meant that darkness had come. But progress had been made. The
bar owner, a bartender, two customers, and one of the euchre
players were all wearing McCain stickers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's man in Java Center was ready to call it a night. He
ordered another beer.

CHARGES EXPECTED IN ATTACK ON A WEB SITE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI seized a computer two weeks ago from a
17-year-old New Hampshire resident who the Los Angeles Police
Department said Thursday night would be charged in connection with
attacks on the Web site of an antidrug organization.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal law enforcement official who asked not to be
identified said Thursday night that the teen-age hacker, who goes
by the nickname Coolio, was not a suspect in last month's attacks
on Yahoo, eBay and other major e-commerce Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. John Pasquariello, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police
Department, said Thursday night that Coolio, whose real name was
not released because he is a juvenile, was under investigation for
defacements on Nov. 14 and Nov. 17 of the Web site of the antidrug
organization DARE America.
</P>
<P>
   Pasquariello said that the Los Angeles district attorney's
office was preparing charges and that the teen-ager would probably
be arrested next week in connection with the DARE attack. The
organization is based in Inglewood, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Parsons, executive director for DARE, which stands for
Drug Abuse Resistance Education, said that a person who attacked
the site on Nov. 14 and Nov. 17 left a profane message glorifying
drugs. He said the vandal signed both attacks ``Coolio,'' in the
second case writing, ``Craftily owned by Coolio..D.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons said he had reported both attacks to the Los Angeles
police, the FBI and the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   A federal law enforcement official said Coolio had admitted in
writing to having been responsible for several attacks, but the
official did not specify whether the DARE attack was among them.
</P>
<P>
   The official said, however, that Coolio was not a suspect in the
attacks last month on Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think he's good for the others,'' the official said.

U.N. OFFICIAL CONCERNED ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS last graf to clarify.)  (js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The United Nations' top human rights official
expressed deep concern here Thursday over what she called a
``deterioration'' in China's human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about three areas: freedom of expression,
freedom of religion and freedom of association,'' said Mary
Robinson, the high commissioner for human rights, at a news
conference following meetings with senior Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   Her critical assessment came less than three weeks before the
annual session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission, starting on
March 20 in Geneva, where the United States is offering a
resolution censuring China's rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson declined to comment on the resolution. Her remarks here
may bolster the U.S. case, but the resolution has little chance of
passing, diplomats say, because China can muster a majority of
countries to oppose it as unwarranted meddling in its internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings Thursday with Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen and
other officials, Robinson presented her concerns about developments
over the last year and a half. These included the arrests and
lengthy prison sentences given to democracy advocates, what
Robinson termed ``a notable clampdown on religious expression,''
and the repression of labor organizers and the Falun Gong spiritual
movement.
</P>
<P>
   She gave the Chinese government a written report detailing
violations of international rights standards and listing numerous
individuals who have been imprisoned without fair legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time that Robinson spoke, the Foreign Ministry
said in a regular press briefing that only the people of China had
the right to judge whether their rights were worsening or
improving. ``The Chinese people are satisfied'' with the freedoms
they enjoy, said a ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzhao, calling on the
high commissioner to cooperate with China ``on the basis of mutual
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a former president of Ireland, was clearly mindful of
China's prickliness and offered praise for what she called the
country's continued progress in ``economic and social rights'' and
efforts to improve criminal procedures. But she was frank in her
critique of China's record in the core freedoms and legal
safeguards enshrined in international declarations.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had hoped for agreement this week on a long-discussed
program of technical cooperation with China, to study how its laws
and criminal practices can be brought into compliance with the two
international rights covenants that China has signed but not
ratified.
</P>
<P>
   No such agreement was announced Thursday, but Robinson said she
had been assured that the Chinese expect to sign on to the program
later this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robinson said she was encouraged that China's parliament had
begun discussions about the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights, which China signed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But she said no such progress was evident in the case of the
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed in 1998, and warned
that China would have to make wide-ranging changes to bring its
legal practices in line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
   Among other needed changes, Robinson said, China's notorious
system of ``reform through labor,'' in which accused criminals and
opponents of the state are sent to labor camps for up to three
years without a trial or basic legal protections, would have to be
phased out.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government's own figures, as of 1997 some
230,000 people were held in such labor camps, and the government
has given no public sign that it would seriously consider
abolishing the system.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said she had been alarmed to hear of proposals for a
new law to govern the reform-through-labor system, as though that
would raise its international legitimacy. ``Bad law can be a
tyranny,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was in Beijing attending a U.N. workshop on human
rights in Asia. The Chinese press on Thursday featured the workshop
as a sign of progress and carried President Jiang Zemin's message
of congratulations to the forum in which he praised the global
development of human rights _ in keeping with the cultural
traditions and needs of each country.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has made tremendous efforts on the human rights front,
and it has achieved successes that have astonished the world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after the U.S. State Department in its annual rights
report castigated China for regressing last year, China issued its
own report on human rights violations in the United States like
racism and the mistreatment of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   China's papers have prominently covered the trial of four New
York City police officers who fatally shot Amadou Diallo, a West
African immigrant, and were acquitted of all charges.

<P>
   LONDON _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet was allowed to fly home to Chile
Thursday after Britain dropped extradition proceedings against him
and put an end to his 16 months of house arrest in England.
</P>
<P>
   A Chilean military plane lifted off from Waddington Royal Air
Force Base in Lincolnshire at 1:10 p.m., just hours after the
decision to free the 84-year-old former Chilean dictator was
announced by Home Secretary Jack Straw.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the plane was airborne, Straw told the House of
Commons that he was ending the complex legal and judicial case
because of the failing health of Pinochet. Four European countries
had been seeking the general's extradition. Spain had initiated the
case by asking that he be sent to Madrid to stand trial on charges
of torture dating from his authoritarian rule of Chile from 1973-90
in which more than 3,000 people died or disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to ambassadors of the four countries released
Thursday morning, Straw argued that the general's declining health
had produced a ``memory deficit'' that would have compromised his
ability to understand charges and direct his attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Before Pinochet could even arrive in Chile, both human rights
activists and supporters of the former dictator began preparing for
the next legal battle over whether he will be obliged to stand
trial there. Human rights activists were already in court by
afternoon, presenting evidence to a judge and hoping to keep the
case alive.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinochet case will be remembered and cited long after its
swift and undramatic end Thursday. Its most significant legacy is a
fundamental change in international law that gives universal
jurisdiction to the prosecution of crimes that are considered human
rights atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has established beyond question the principle that those
who commit human rights abuses in one country cannot assume they
are safe elsewhere,'' Straw told parliament. Already, human rights
groups are using rulings in the Pinochet case as a legal basis for
trying Hissene Habre, the former president of the central African
nation Chad, in Senegal on torture charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these impediments, Senator Pinochet would be unable to
follow the process of a trial sufficiently to instruct counsel,''
Straw said in his letter to the Spanish mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have had difficulty in understanding the content and
the implications of questions put to him and would have inadequate
insight into this difficulty,'' the letter continued. ``He would
have difficulty in making himself understood in replying to
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Straw had first signaled his intention to make Thursday's move
in January after medical tests conducted by four British
specialists claimed that the general was unfit to stand trial.
Spain, France, Belgium and Switzerland challenged that finding, and
Straw was subsequently ordered by a three-judge panel of Britain's
High Court to send the four governments the records of the
examination.
</P>
<P>
   None of the governments or human rights organizations that had
mounted legal challenges to Pinochet's release pressed to bring an
appeal in the scant time available before Pinochet could leave
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There was clearly an effort to get him out of the country with
as little attention as possible. A convoy of police vehicles and
motorcycle outriders escorted the limousine carrying the former
Chilean dictator from the suburban enclave south of London where he
had been living and sped the 150-mile distance to the airbase.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet left the Surrey residential estate south of London by a
road that skirted the main exit, where protesters and the press
were camped out.
</P>
<P>
   In 5 a.m. darkness, the Chilean Air Force Boeing 707 that had
been parked at Brize Norton Royal Air Force Base in Oxfordshire
since late January flew unannounced to the Waddington field.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting impact of the Pinochet case stems from two decisions
by the Law Lords of the House of Lords, Britain's highest court.
They ruled that Pinochet was not immune from prosecution even
though he was head of state at the time that the alleged crimes
against humanity took place.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To rights groups, the rulings that emerged in the Pinochet case
amounted to a coming of age for international law, a framework that
has gradually shifted from the notion that states do not interfere
in each other's affairs to a belief that human rights transcend
domestic jurisdictions. Amnesty International said Thursday that
the case represented the greatest advance for international law
since the Nuremberg trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible disappointment for Pinochet's thousands of
victims that he will not face trial in Spain,'' said Reed Brody,
advocacy director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, which
has been among the groups pursuing the case. ``But the very fact
that he was arrested and that his claim of immunity was rejected
has already changed the calculus of dictators around the world. The
Pinochet case signified the beginning of the end of their
impunity''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was originally arrested on Oct. 16, 1998, while he was
in a London clinic recuperating from back surgery. British police
made their surprise move in response to an application from a
Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, seeking Pinochet's extradition to
Madrid to stand trial on charges of genocide, torture, kidnapping
and murder in connection with the disappearance of 3,197 people in
the years after he seized power in a coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, considered something of a maverick in the Spanish
judiciary, had gathered his evidence during an investigation into
the so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the 1970s. There was
no expectation at the time that his unorthodox move to arrest
Pinochet would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government, though forced by circumstance to pursue
the case, has shown little enthusiasm for the case from the outset,
and Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, said Thursday that,
``I will respect Straw's decision.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Pinochet won his first legal battle to overcome the charges in a
ruling by the High Court on Oct. 28, 1998, which upheld his claim
to sovereign immunity.
</P>
<P>
   But in a ruling that was to create the case's legacy, the Law
Lords a month later overturned that decision, saying that being a
head of state did not excuse crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The case returned to the House of Lords after one of the
original judges, Leonard Hoffmann., was found to have had an
association with Amnesty International, a party to the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the second Lords' decision, on March 24, 1999, was even more
emphatic on the principle than the first, although it drastically
reduced the number of charges, narrowing the scope to torture and
conspiracy to torture. The case then moved on to the validity of
the actual extradition order itself, which was upheld by a London
magistrate last October and remained under appeal with a hearing
scheduled for this March 20.
</P>
<P>
   In the one appearance in court that Pinochet was obliged to
make, on Dec. 11, 1998, he maintained the defiant attitude he had
adopted from the beginning, saying that he did not recognize the
jurisdiction of any court outside Chile to try him and that he was
innocent of ``all the lies of Spain.'' He later described himself
as ``England's only political prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   At every hearing and court date, throngs of supporters and
opponents have angrily faced down one another from behind
barricades, trading taunts and jeers and displaying flags and
placards with accusatory slogans and pictures of missing friends
and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 months, the general has been living under 24
hour police custody with his wife Lucia in a rented mansion in one
of London's exclusive southern suburbs. He has had periodic visits
from Chilean supporters and other backers in this country, the most
visible and voluble of whom has been former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   She has argued that rather than holding him in custody, Britain
should extend its gratitude to Pinochet for the support he gave the
country in 1982 during the Falkland Islands war with Argentina.
``His reward by this government,'' she told reporters Thursday on
the steps of her Belgravia home, ``was to be held prisoner for 16
months.''

   THE DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY'S WIFE CAMPAIGNS: In a sign of spousal and female unity,
Bill Bradley's wife, Ernestine, is expected to tour upstate New
York starting Friday with the wives of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan
and the Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson. Mrs. Bradley will
visit Rochester, Buffalo and Albany with Elizabeth Moynihan and
June Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   GORE DAUGHTER RAISES MONEY: Karenna Gore Schiff, the oldest
daughter of Vice President Al Gore, raised $40,000 for her father's
presidential campaign last night at Cities, a Washington
restaurant, packing in 150 young professional Gen-Xers like
herself. She said that her generation tried to ``cultivate an
ironic detachment'' but she urged her listeners to overcome their
cynicism and support her father.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   BUSH LEADS IN GEORGIA: Though making only one appearance in
Georgia in recent weeks, Gov. George W. Bush is well ahead of Sen.
John McCain in the state, which holds Tuesday's only Southern
primary. An American Research Group poll, conducted on Monday and
Tuesday, found Bush had the support of 62 percent of likely primary
voters and McCain had 23 percent. McCain led among Democrats and
independents, but the state will have its own Democratic primary
that day, in which Vice President Al Gore is considered a heavy
favorite over Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARY CLEARED IN CALIFORNIA: The California Supreme Court
denied a request for an injunction to bar election officials from
reporting party votes in next week's presidential primary here.
That means the state's unusual two-tiered election, in which all
candidates will appear on the same ballot but only votes cast by
registered party members will apply in selecting convention
delegates, can proceed as planned. The separate partisan tally was
enacted under a law that amended a 1996 voter initiative that set
up the so-called blanket primary. Barry Keene, a former state
senator, contended that the law was unconstitutional, because it
amended a ballot initiative without voter approval.
</P>
<P>
   THE MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE RACE FOR KANSAS: Lawmakers in Kansas, who earlier this
year canceled the Republican primary in the face of a tight state
budget and what looked like a cakewalk for George W. Bush, are now
considering whether to reinstate it. The state is doing better and
the race is more competitive. ``Now we have money, and this primary
might matter,'' said Mark Parkinson, the state party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY'S SCHEDULES
</P>
<P>
   BILL BRADLEY: Hartford, Portland, Me., and Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH: Stony Brook, N.Y., and Buffalo.
</P>

JAMES J. O'LEARY, AN ECONOMIST AND BANK EXECUTIVE, DIES AT 85  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., N.C.)  By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James J. O'Leary, an economist and a former vice chairman of the
U.S. Trust Corp., died Monday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was
85.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. O'Leary was vice chairman of U.S. Trust, a money management
company based in New York, from 1970 until 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He also served on the board of the National Bureau of Economic
Research and was its chairman from 1976 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Manchester, Conn., on May 7, 1914, O'Leary graduated
from Wesleyan University, where he also earned a master's degree.
He received his doctorate from Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he taught at Wesleyan and at the Air
Navigation Flight Preparatory School in Middletown, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, O'Leary became a consultant for the Connecticut
General Life Insurance Co., taught briefly at Duke and served in
various positions with the Life Insurance Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   He was also chairman and chief economist at Lionel D. Edie &AMP; Co.
from 1967 to 1969, the year he joined U.S. Trust as an executive
vice president and economist. After his 10 years with U.S. trust,
he was an economic consultant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, O'Leary published the book, ``Stagnation or Healthy
Growth?: The Challenge to the United States in the '90s''
(University Press of America).
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Rita, died in 1997. He is survived by three sons,
James P., of Goshen, Conn.; Paul H., of Fairport, N.Y.; and Mark
E., of Montauk, N.Y.; a daughter, Martha E. O'Leary of Garden City,
N.Y.; and five grandchildren. &QL;

IN LIEU OF PATRIOTS, HARTFORD GETS A $2.4 MILLION SETTLEMENT ON
STADIUM DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.) (Eds: Story is also being filed in `s' category.) 
(DW) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   HARTFORD _ Ten months after the
New England Patriots backed out of a $375 million deal that would
have made Hartford a star in the National Football League's
constellation of football cities, Connecticut finally got some
payback Thursday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exactly $2,399,060.66.
</P>
<P>
   That is the amount the league wired to Connecticut Thursday
afternoon to settle an embarrassing episode for the state and Gov.
John G. Rowland, the foremost champion of the deal that evaporated
almost overnight last April. It called for the state to finance a
new stadium for the Patriots in exchange for a 30-year lease.
</P>
<P>
   The money compensates the state for costs incurred during the
preliminary stages of negotiations with Robert K. Kraft, the team's
owner, Rowland said. The amount includes $667,000 that the state
paid to study the environmental impact of a new stadium on a slice
of downtown envisioned as the site of a sweeping redevelopment
known as Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's finality to this; the check has even been sent
directly to us,'' Rowland told reporters during a news conference
outside the governor's mansion Thursday. ``As far as I'm concerned,
this chapter of all of our lives is concluded.''
</P>
<P>
   None too soon for the governor, who suffered one of the worst
defeats of his career last April after Kraft decided to try to keep
his team in Massachusetts after all but promising to relocate to
Hartford. Kraft made his decision just three days after
Massachusetts legislators offered him a $70 million subsidy to help
build a new stadium at the team's home in Foxboro, south of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we made the best of a situation that perhaps many of
us wished might have been different, but I think it does bring
closure,'' said the state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, one
of three Connecticut officials to sign the agreement with the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 months since the deal collapsed, Blumenthal had been
looking into the possibility of suing the team or the league for
essentially using Hartford as leverage in Massachusetts. But any
legal action, Blumenthal said, would have been ``very costly,
time-consuming, difficult and uncertain,'' and the agreement signed
Thursday prevents the state from seeking any further remedy in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the Patriots organization were referred to the league,
which declined to discuss details of the settlement. ``We
appreciate the state's participation in the good-faith negotiations
that achieved a fair compromise of the interests of all
concerned,'' Paul Tagliabue, the league's commissioner, said in a
two-paragraph printed statement.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sticking points in the months of negotiations between
the state and the NFL was whether Kraft would be responsible for
paying any part of a settlement cost. Thursday's agreement makes no
reference to any amount the team might pay, though Blumenthal said
some of the $2.4 million settlement would probably be paid back to
the league by the team.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland noted the ``coincidental'' nature of Thursday's
announcement, coming one day before he is to introduce the state's
plans to turn the Adriaen's Landing site, still occupied by an
aging steam plant, into a shopping and entertainment mall.
</P>
<P>
   But . Rowland played down the betrayal he and many state
lawmakers felt in the weeks after their bid for the Patriots
collapsed. ``It was a risk worth taking,'' he said. ``We knew from
Day One that maybe we're being played against other states.'' Asked
if he was still angry, Rowland shrugged. ``No,'' he responded,
``and I never really was.''

PERCIVAL LIKES TEAM'S CHANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ When the Angels let pitcher Chuck Finley leave
via free agency during the off-season, some players were left to
consider their own future with the club. One of them was Troy
Percival, who said he'd welcome a trade to a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone mentioned my name and asked me a question and I
answered it,'' Percival said. ``But I'm here. I'm an Angel. I never
demanded a trade. This is where I come from. I've spent 11 years in
this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as going to a contender, Percival said he now believes
the Angels ``without question'' are a contender in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of it depends on the health of pitchers coming off
injuries, and Percival is among them. He had a large bone chip
removed from his right shoulder during the off-season, and won't be
permitted to throw in a Cactus League game until March 10 at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   But the signs that Percival will return to the top of his game
are there. He's back to pitching over the top, instead of
three-quarters or side-arm, which was a result of the pain in his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving 100 percent, but I don't have 100 percent
strength,'' he said. ``It's at about 85-90 percent. And it's coming
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   MIKE'S BACK: Mike Colangelo is a longshot to make the club as a
reserve outfielder, but he does have one thing going for him a
lifetime batting average of .500 in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo got his shot with the Angels last season amid all the
injuries and became a statistic himself, before he could finish his
first major league game.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting .339 at Double-A Erie and .362 at Triple-A
Edmonton, he was called up by the Angels on June 13. He led off the
bottom of the first inning against the Arizona Diamondbacks with a
single.
</P>
<P>
   He was 1 for 2 with a walk when his dream turned into a
nightmare. In the seventh inning, Colangelo, playing left field,
raced toward left-center field to catch a fly ball. Problem was,
center fielder Reggie Williams had the same idea, and the two
collided. Colangelo left the field on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how bad it looked, Colangelo was fortunate to escape
with only a torn ligament in his left thumb. But it meant the end
of his season and a missed opportunity. Still, Colangelo doesn't
feel sorry for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't control what happened,'' he said. ``The only thing
I can control is getting ready for this year. I don't know what the
future holds, no one does. So every day I come to the field and
play the game as hard as I can. Hopefully I'll get another shot.''
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG LEFTIES: Left-handed pitcher Scott Schoeneweis is
competing for a starting spot along with Ramon Ortiz, Jarrod
Washburn and Brian Cooper. Washburn is the other lefty in the
group, but it is doubtful both lefties will make the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both definitely have the stuff to pitch in the major
leagues,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``But they're different.
Schoeneweis is really aggressive, maybe too intense. Washburn has a
quiet confidence. He goes about his business. Washburn uses his
changeup more, Schoeneweis has better movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn will start today's Cactus League opener against the
Mariners. Schoeneweis, who threw two hitless inning vs. Arizona
State Wednesday, will make his next start next week.
</P>
<P>
   SHORT HOPS: Jim Edmonds returned to camp after missing
Wednesday's workout and game because of a family matter. . . . The
Angels signed pitchers Ramon Ortiz, Brian Cooper and Juan Alvarez
to contracts for the 2000 season, and renewed the contracts of
third baseman Troy Glaus and pitchers Scott Schoeneweis and Al
Levine for 2000.

BELTRE TALKS DRAG ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. -- The progress in the Adrian Beltre
negotiations continued at a snail's pace Thursday, but both sides
agreed the finish line is, at most, probably a week away.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Boras, Beltre's agent, and Dodgers managing general
partner and CEO Bob Daly both said it was unlikely they sides would
talk about a three-year deal after the mandatory March 11 signing
date for players with less than three years experience. But during
the latest two-hour meeting, financial terms were discussed for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get this thing done by (the mandatory renewal
date), I don't think it will be done,'' Boras said. ``If it's not
completed by then, I think we have to look at this as a point of
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   So they have nine days to negotiate a deal before major league
rules man dates the Dodgers sign Beltre. But after the fourth day
of meetings, the parties aren't expected to have significant talks
again until Monday, and a deal is not considered imminent despite
lengthy negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Boras and Daly have met for 10 1/2 hours this week. Both
parties, considered top-flight negotiators well versed in patience,
remain optimistic. And while neither side talked about the
financial particulars of the case, Boras continues to compare
Beltre favorably to many major league players making at least $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to give the impression that we're inches away
from a deal ,'' said Daly, who's returning to Los Angeles on Sunday
night. ``We are discussing concepts, exploring new concepts. We're
not going to renew the player, we're going to wait until the
appropriate time, and hopefully by that point, we will either know
we can make a deal or we won't.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the impending hearing of the grievance filed on
Beltre's behalf by the players association. Arbitrator Shyam Das,
who just ruled on the John Rocker case, could set a hearing date
next week. But Boras said it was unlikely Beltre's case would be
ruled on before opening day, which would create an enormous
headache for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of our discussions, in any way, have been arguing with
each other ,'' Daly said. ``There's never a date you set to stop
negotiating until the arbitrator rules. As a practical matter, I
think we should try to set (March 11) as a date we should try to
get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Grapefruit League play begins today and Beltre is
expected to play third base -- without a contract. If he's injured,
Beltre is protected under the collective bargaining agreement.
Boras added that Beltre has a disability policy to guard against
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, 20, batted .275 with 15 homers and 67 RBI last season.
He's seeking free agency because the Dodgers violated baseball
rules by signing him at the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this deal to get done you're going to have to believe
Adrian Beltre is going to be a superstar player,'' Boras said.
``The thing is, they have said he is. ...That's one major
philosophical point that allows this element to continue. When they
say that, I believe them. The question is to what level?''
</P>
<P>
   Grading Grudzielanek: After a winter of working out, converted
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek gets his first shot to play second base
under game conditions when the Dodgers begin Grapefruit League play
today. And while manager Davey Johnson said Grudzielanek could
start the season now, he's glad there's a month until the season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was going to give him a grade over there so far, it would
be B+,' ' Johnson said. ``I was probably more proud of the work and
the effort from start to finish of him than anyone on the club last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: The Dodgers signed catcher Angel Pena to a
one-year deal. He will make $210,000 with the big league club and
$82,500 if he plays in the minor leagues. ...One difference
Grudzielanek's noticed in playing second is a change in throwing
motion, and he's been icing his right arm because of tenderness.

EDITORIAL: MILITARY RUMBLINGS OVER TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, March 3:
</P>
<P>
   The triangular relationship between China, Taiwan and the United
States seems to veer from one crisis to the next. The latest one
was provoked last week by Beijing's threat to take over Taiwan by
force if island leaders do not soon agree to reunification on the
mainland's terms. Now Taiwan and its supporters in the Pentagon and
Congress want Washington to provide the island government with four
American destroyers equipped with sophisticated Aegis radar and
antimissile technology. There must be a more constructive way to
manage the sensitive issue of Taiwan's future status.
</P>
<P>
   A showdown over Taiwan is in no one's interest. Any Chinese
effort to take control of Taiwan by force would risk an armed
confrontation with the United States. Taiwan on its own could not
long resist a Chinese attack, even with advanced American weapons.
An escalation of Chinese threats and American arms sales to Taiwan
can only make the equation more explosive. Yet Washington will have
little choice but to accept that escalation if China persists in
trying to intimidate Taiwan. Fortunately, there is time to pursue
other options.
</P>
<P>
   China, which started this crisis, needs to modify its course.
Beijing's pressured approach to reunification is not productive.
Someday it may be possible to work out a political arrangement that
both mainlanders and Taiwanese find acceptable. But that is not
feasible today. China should back off from its threats before they
do lasting damage to its important relationship with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has recently shown greater sensitivity in its own
approach to the reunification issue. It has stepped away from
provocative suggestions that its leaders were preparing for
independence. But at this point it should not be clamoring for the
Aegis destroyers, one of America's most technologically advanced
weapons systems and one that has never been sold abroad completely
equipped. Even with these destroyers, which would probably not be
delivered for five years and not become operational for several
more, Taiwan would not, on its own, be able to withstand a
full-fledged Chinese attack.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, for its part, should urge moderation on both sides,
while not stepping back from its promise to treat any forcible
attempt to reunite Taiwan with the mainland as a matter of grave
concern to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It would be beneficial to America, China and Taiwan to see
Beijing admitted to the World Trade Organization under the
reasonable terms negotiated last year. But China is now pressing
its luck in Washington. Its bullying attitude toward Taiwan will
increase congressional opposition to WTO membership. The
longer-term risk is that continued Chinese threats could lead to
dangerous military tensions in the Taiwan Strait. That would be the
least promising way to deal with Taiwan's future.  &QL;

 &HT;    Thrill is gone, it appears from latest debates
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the past couple of nights the stage for the
nation's presidential debate has been one that resembles one of
those new millionaire shows, bespeaking the fact that the race has
arrived in California, and the big time.
</P>
<P>
   If politics worked the way quiz shows do, the Democratic and
Republican debates sponsored by the Los Angeles Times and CNN would
have packed the most punch of any so far.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous trove of convention delegates that will be decided
in Tuesday's primaries and caucuses across the country are by far
the biggest payoff of the nominating season.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the suspense has drained away from both races, and
these two nights lacked the electricity of the last Republican
debate before the South Carolina primary, or the Democrats' meeting
at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, much of the debate had to do with who
had to be there. Gov. George W. Bush complained during his visit to
Atlanta that he changed plans to be in Los Angeles for the forum,
only to find that McCain would be beamed in from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in the first question, was called on to give the strategic
rationale of why he is more electable than McCain, if his rival has
greater appeal to independents and Democrats. McCain, in turn, was
called on to explain how a Republican can win without the support
of religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Both gave serviceable answers: Bush said there was time to win
over non-Republicans after the Republican primaries, and McCain
argued it was Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson he attacked in his
speech Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the passion seems to have gone out of the argument, in the
wake of Tuesday's results in Virginia, North Dakota and Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly an hour before there was any genuine flash of
controversy, and then the catalyst was the third man onstage: Alan
Keyes, who announced he couldn't vote for McCain because he doesn't
consider him pro-life, and then launched into a denunciation of his
views on campaign finance reform. At best, however, this just
seemed a fast-forward replay of how earlier GOP debates have gone.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons not at all clear, the Democratic debate the night
before was 30 minutes longer than the Republican forum, even though
there was one less candidate and a whole lot less to argue about.
</P>
<P>
   With no realistic hope of overtaking Vice President Al Gore,
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley took the stage Wednesday, it
seemed, to give himself a graceful way out of a race that has had
its bruising moments.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to their exchange at the Apollo, the Democrats found
little to differ on, and as the 90 minutes wore on, the list of
things they basically agree on grew long: hate crimes, racial
profiling, Al Sharpton, China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seemed unable at times to resist a weary sigh at some of
Gore's chipper answers, but only in the last few minutes were the
two opponents coaxed into an argument over whether Gore ever voted
to give tax-exempt status to Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a very un-California subject, anyway, and better left
for the other party to fight over.

MILITIA LEADER ON TRIAL OVER A CUSTODY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Idaho, Texas)   (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENFIELD, Conn. _ On this point, at least, the prosecution and
the defense agree: On the afternoon of Sept. 30, 1996, Bo Gritz, a
former Green Beret commando and a leader of the far-right militia
movement, was sitting in a car in the parking lot of McAlister
Middle School in Suffield, Conn., a small town on the Massachusetts
border far from his favored stomping grounds in the Idaho hills.
</P>
<P>
   But in closing arguments in state Superior Court here Thursday,
the opposing lawyers offered starkly different explanations of what
exactly he was doing in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   According to the prosecution, he was waiting to snatch one of
two young boys he believed had been unjustly taken from their
mother in a custody dispute. Gritz (pronounced GRITES) is charged
with attempted kidnapping, conspiracy, custodial interference and
loitering.
</P>
<P>
   According to the defense, Gritz was merely trying to investigate
the situation and to use his celebrity as a syndicated radio
talk-show host and an elder in the far-right Patriot movement to
draw attention to a grave injustice: the awarding of the boys'
custody to their father, who has been accused by their mother,
Gritz and others of sexually abusing the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Gritz, whose full name is James G. Gritz, and his son, James
R. Gritz, were arrested that afternoon in 1996 while sitting in a
car owned by Linda M. Wiegand, the boys' mother. She had recently
appeared on the elder Gritz's radio program. In the car, police
found photographs of the boys, a school floor plan, a class
schedule, two-way radios and other documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Gritz just happen to show up at the school in the mother's
car at precisely the time school was to let out?'' the assistant
state's attorney, John H. Malone, asked the jury in his closing
argument Thursday morning. ``You can reasonably draw the inference
that what was going to happen was the crime of kidnapping.'' Malone
accused Gritz of wanting to carry out ``a rescue mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz's lawyer, David Kritzman, said that the police officer who
arrested his client had been sitting in a marked cruiser, clearly
visible in the school parking lot. ``It did not make sense that my
client would try to kidnap that boy,'' Kritzman said. ``It makes no
sense whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   The closing arguments wrapped up a two-month trial in which
Gritz has been tried along with a co-defendant, Sheldon Robinson.
The younger Gritz will be tried separately. Robinson, a Texas
businessman and an associate of Gritz's, was charged as an
accomplice and accused of all the same crimes, except for
loitering, because he did not go to the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution charged that Robinson was in Suffield with Gritz
in 1996 and planned to use a private plane to get the boys out of
Connecticut. Robinson's lawyer, Wendy Doolittle, told the jury
Thursday that he had not acted secretly but had rented cars and
hotel rooms using his own name and credit card. ``This was a
businessman on a business trip,'' she said. ``He did nothing out of
the ordinary.''

ROENICK IS WELL-HATED, UNKNOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ For somebody whom nobody knows, everybody seems to
have an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are the same,'' Roenick said. ``They don't like
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said. ``I'd say that's
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's Roenick is an enigma wrapped in a riddle awash with
contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   He could score 100 points this season, yet he plays with a 1970s
Broad Street Bullies-like style.
</P>
<P>
   He exudes cockiness, brashness and machismo during games, yet
he's quite unassuming one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   He counts the Stars' Mike Modano and Chicago's Tony Amonte among
his friends in the NHL, yet he has gone after both of them with,
let's just say, less-than-clean hits in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my mother was out there, I think I'd do the same thing,''
Roenick said. ``When you are on the ice, you have to play to win.
You can't play to make sure your buddies don't get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Good 'ol J.R. Just when you think you have him all figured out,
he says something that makes you realize you don't.
</P>
<P>
   Like the whole jaw-breaking thing. Roenick has to hate Hatcher,
right? Hatcher did, after all, shatter Roenick's jaw with a hit
last spring, causing him to miss the first six games of Phoenix's
first-round playoff series with St. Louis. He returned for Game 7
only to watch his team be eliminated by the Blues. He then spent
his summer vacation sipping dinner through a straw.
</P>
<P>
   So he hates Hatcher, right? Well, not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game between the Stars and Coyotes at Reunion Arena
this season, Roenick skated up to Hatcher and said, ``Stay away
from me.'' He then skated away chuckling with a huge grin on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher said he felt awkward. Not Roenick. He loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' Roenick admitted. ``What do you play sports for? You
play sports for rivalries. You play sports to get the better of the
better teams and players. Sometimes, you break a jaw. Sometimes,
you get your jaw broken.''
</P>
<P>
   He has had his it's-just-part-of-the-game mentality since
breaking into the league 11 seasons ago with the Chicago
Blackhawks. One time, he took a crosscheck to the face by a St.
Louis player. There was no penalty called on the play, but after
the whistle Roenick calmly skated up to the referee, spit into his
hand and extended his palm. There sat his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what scares you about him,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``When the player we play against is focused, he's very hard
to play against. He seems to be able to do pretty much anything on
the ice he wants to. He's been a hard guy this year for us to play
against, very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes certainly haven't been a walk in the park for the
Stars. They're in second place in the Pacific Division, five points
behind the Stars coming into tonight's game. It wasn't too long ago
that the Coyotes held the division lead, and Roenick is a big
reason why. He has a team-leading 30 goals and 38 assists in 58
games.
</P>
<P>
   So why then don't people around the league like him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are a lot of guys in this league who don't like
my style or my yapping or my crankiness,'' Roenick said. ``When I'm
done, I don't want other teams or players to say `Oh, I liked
playing against Jeremy Roenick.' You know why? That probably means
they beat me a lot. Those are the guys who are fun to play
against.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars can say a lot of things about Roenick, and usually do.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody says he's fun to play against. They just don't like
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I wouldn't know him from a hole in the ground,''
Stars winger Mike Keane said. `` I just know what I've heard.''
</P>
<P>
   What's to hear? Well, let's just say that at the All-Star game,
where the unwritten rule is nobody hits anybody, Roenick was hit
three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the perception of Jeremy is he's a loose cannon and
he's living in the fast lane,'' Coyotes coach Bob Francis said.
``Everybody has made mistakes. It's how you come through those
mistakes. ... The perception of Jeremy isn't what he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is all well and good, except for the fact that Roenick
sounds like a man who doesn't really care.
</P>
<P>
   He won't exactly say it, but he kind of likes the fact that
nobody understands him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of what people really think of me,'' Roenick
said. ``What's good for Jeremy Roenick is good for Jeremy
Roenick.''

 BUSH AND McCAIN TRADE CHARGES OVER RELIGION AND POLITICS 
 (sw) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM and ALISON MITCHELL  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The setting was surreal Thursday night, with Gov.
George W. Bush standing at a lectern and his main opponent, Sen.
John McCain, beaming from a television monitor a few feet away. Yet
all of the bitterness of the Republican presidential race was on
full display as the rivals rehashed mutual recriminations in a
debate four days before a round of critical primaries across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Capping weeks of acrimony, McCain stood by the phone calls that
his campaign made to Roman Catholic voters, alerting them to Bush's
appearance at Bob Jones University, while Bush once more protested
about being characterized as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to tell people exactly what Governor Bush had
done,'' McCain said, arguing that he had not accused Bush of
``being an anti-Catholic bigot'' but simply pointed out that Bush
had waited weeks to repudiate the anti-Catholic teachings of Bob
Jones. That, he said, was ``a factual statement and one that I
stand by.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush quickly shot back, ``Yeah. I appreciate that. If you don't
think those phone calls labeled me an anti-Catholic bigot, then you
weren't paying attention to what your campaign was putting out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear message,'' he added, ``was I was an anti-Catholic
bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge and countercharge came even though each man started
out trying to stand above the fray and present a positive case for
himself in a debate that ranged across foreign policy, education,
gun control and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called himself ``somebody who's been a proven leader,
someone who has set an agenda, somebody who has risen above
politics.'' And McCain, who participated by way of a satellite
link-up from a studio in St. Louis, turned a question about his
characterization of leaders of the religious right as ``agents of
intolerance'' into a statement that ``ours is a message of
inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, the third candidate, made his most pointed remarks
when he accused McCain of not vigorously opposing abortion, and
said he could never support his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the testiest moments in the one-hour debate belonged to the
ongoing battle between Bush and McCain over religion and politics.
Bush once again said he regretted that he had not spoken out
against the teachings of Bob Jones University when he visited the
institution while campaigning in South Carolina last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about bringing people together,'' he said, ``so
America can achieve its greatness. I talked about lifting the
spirit and the soul of this country. I regret I did not speak out
against that school's anti-Catholic bias. I missed an opportunity.
I make no excuses. I make no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he turned on McCain and said, ``What I regret is the
politics of smearing somebody's reputation. That's what I regret.
And I don't appreciate it one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   When McCain asked for time to respond, Bush said, ``I didn't
attack Senator McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain on Thursday night gave his most detailed explanation for
his sharp attacks on the Rev. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson by
describing how they differed with him in their views of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted to impeach President Clinton,'' McCain said. ``I don't
believe he's a murderer. Falwell believes that he's a murderer.
Robertson has espoused some cockamamie theories about the
Freemasons. I believe they have led some very good and wonderful
people in a message of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush each seemed uncomfortable at times on issues of
domestic policy. Asked what he had accomplished on education across
18 years in Congress, McCain had to reach back to his years in the
House to cite his service on the House Education Committee and
spoke vaguely of ``being involved in the effort in my state for
reform in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was so vague that the Bush campaign promptly put out
a statement mocking the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed equally uncomfortable on gun control. Asked about
whether trigger locks on guns should be mandatory, he said, ``Ask
about education, will you?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said that while he did not mind trigger locks, ``the
question is how do we enforce it. Are we going to have trigger lock
police knocking on peoples' doors, saying, `Show me your trigger
lock?'''
</P>
<P>
   The face-off came four days before the critical Super Tuesday
primaries in a dozen states including the powerhouses of New York
and California. All together, nearly 60 percent of the delegates
needed to win the Republican nomination will be chosen then.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing Bush leading by nearly 2-1 among Republicans
in California and McCain pinning more of his hopes on New York, the
Republican race has become increasingly acrimonious and the debate
itself _ sponsored by CNN and The Los Angeles Times _ almost became
the victim of the rancor.
</P>
<P>
   In a week of feints and parries, McCain said he would not debate
because he had a planned a campaign schedule in New York and New
England when Bush had refused to commit. Then the senator abruptly
changed his mind and agreed to participate by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   That led Bush too to threaten to debate by satellite. But then
on the heels of his sweeping victories in Virginia, North Dakota,
and Washington on Tuesday, he said he would attend in person to
showcase his commitment to California.

EDITORIAL: POSITIVE OVERTURES ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, March 3:
</P>
<P>
   Some encouraging things are being said about the need for
stronger gun control laws in the wake of this week's fatal shooting
in Michigan of a first-grader by a 6-year-old classmate and the
rampage at two fast-food restaurants in Pittsburgh. Republican
congressional leaders, who bear responsibility for the legislative
logjam on gun control, need to listen hard. So for that matter do
the Republican presidential contenders, Gov. George W. Bush and
Sen. John McCain, who have budged little from their reflexive
anti-gun-control records.
</P>
<P>
   During the Democrats' debate Wednesday night, both candidates
expressed dismay at the incidents and reiterated support for much
tougher gun control plans than the rather modest set of measures
now stalled in a House-Senate conference committee. Former Sen.
Bill Bradley restated the bold gun control agenda that may well
turn out to be a major legacy of his campaign. Bradley has broken
an old political taboo by daring to recommend that guns be licensed
and registered, and he did so again. Vice President Al Gore, while
stopping short of Bradley's call for universal gun registration,
reaffirmed his support for a new system of photo licensing and
testing for handgun purchasers, a ban on junk Saturday night
specials and reinstatement of the three-day waiting period for all
gun purchases, which expired two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton added his voice when he appeared on the
``Today'' show on Thursday morning. He noted that despite having a
higher percentage of people in jail than other advanced countries,
America has a much higher gun death rate. ``That's because they
don't have an NRA in their country,'' Clinton explained, ``and they
take sensible steps to protect children and society as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Republicans who run Congress sense the public's
hunger for stricter gun laws may be known next week, when Clinton
will invite lawmakers to the White House to try to win agreement on
the package stalemated in committee. That package includes a
minimal child trigger-lock provision and a provision requiring
background checks on prospective purchasers at gun shows that the
National Rifle Association wants to weaken. Clinton will also seek
funding to speed development of personalized guns, which can be
fired only by the authorized owner. By approving this package,
Republicans can begin to show that it was not just the Democrats
who heard this week's gunshots.

STADIUM BILL HUNTS LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY NENA BAKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - It's third and long for a proposal that outlines
funding for a new $341 million Cardinals stadium, with time running
out in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   All week long, powerful lobbyists have put an NFL-style blitz on
Arizona lawmakers in hopes of winning support for a package that
includes money for tourism and Cactus League activities.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan's chances remain as iffy as the Cardinals'
late-season offense, with political obstacles littering the playing
field like a stack of downed linemen.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, March 2, supporters had yet to find a sponsor,
nor had they finalized the bill's language. It's been changing day
by day as lobbyists tweak the bill in an effort to enlist votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The largest obstacle is the perception this is just a stadium
bill, which is no longer the case,'' said Steve Betts, the
Cardinals' chief lobbyist. ``As we get around and talk to
individual legislators and explain the breadth of the package . . .
there appears to be broad support.''
</P>
<P>
   Betts, apparently, is not talking about Senate Majority Leader
Russell ``Rusty'' Bowers, R-Mesa, who takes a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it dies,'' Bowers said. ``I don't support public
financing for these big businesses. These kind of deals just rankle
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals and the NFL have pledged $75 million toward a
78,000-seat facility with a retractable roof. The Fiesta Bowl,
which says it needs the new facility to maintain its position in
college football's Bowl Championship Series, and other users are
expected to come up with an additional $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   But legislators are leery the stadium package could be perceived
as corporate welfare by tax-averse voters. And inside the
statehouse, Senate President Brenda Burns, R-Glendale, who has the
procedural power to block any package, is adamant that no public
money should be used to build professional sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The ground has gotten so rocky that Gov. Jane Hull, who started
things in November by forming a stadium task force, has distanced
herself from the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium proponents must convince lawmakers _ and ultimately
Maricopa County voters, who would decide the matter in November if
it made it through the Legislature _ that the benefits of a new
stadium outweigh the plan's costs.
</P>
<P>
   To make it as attractive as possible, the package includes money
for expanding the Cactus League, with the intention of luring the
Los Angeles Dodgers and the Texas Rangers. At the same time,
tourism promotion money, earmarked for Maricopa County, would
immediately be doubled. There also is about $2 million a year set
aside for amateur and youth sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started on this, I never thought we would have a
proposal that benefited so many stakeholders,'' said Mike Bidwill,
Cardinals vice president and general counsel. ``With that as a
backdrop, the more people hear about it, the more they like it.''
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the package, the plan would:
</P>
<P>
   Increase hotel taxes by 1 percent in Maricopa County.
</P>
<P>
   Establish a 3.25 percent surcharge on vehicles rented in
Maricopa County by non-residents.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicate state income taxes from NFL salaries and
stadium-generated sales taxes toward the project.
</P>
<P>
   A legislative hearing on the proposal is expected; supporters
are aiming for as early as Monday. Detailed financial projections
should then be available, said Ted Ferris, Hull's chief deputy.
</P>
<P>
   He described the package as having ``very minimal'' impact on
state residents, amounting to an annual incremental cost of less
than $1 million per year over 30 years of financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the $341 million cost of the stadium, just $18 million is
paid by Arizona taxpayers,'' Ferris said. ``This amounts to less
than a quarter per person, per year. If you don't attend a game,
rent a hotel room or car, then you don't pay a cent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, with a 27-39 record over the past four seasons,
have shared ASU's Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe since moving to the
Phoenix area in 1988. They are the only NFL team playing in a
college stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials say the Cards are in desperate need of their own
stadium to help them stay competitive with other NFL franchises
that increased their revenue in new facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But the team's last attempt to win approval for a new stadium
was defeated in May when Mesa voters soundly rejected a
quarter-cent sales tax to help fund a combined stadium/convention
center project. And lawmakers still are stinging from criticism
over a general sales tax increase that was used to help fund Bank
One Ballpark, the home of the Diamondbacks, which opened two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium supporters have already backed away from a statewide
hotel and rental-car tax increase in favor of a regional tax in an
effort to make the plan more palatable _ the theory being that the
areas that would benefit economically from the stadium should foot
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   They also point out that a state Tourism and Stadium Authority
would choose the site and own the facility, even though the Cards
would retain the prized stadium-naming rights.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists have used a list of talking points to play up the
project's benefits, including economic benefits of $300 million a
year from events held at the new facility, and $200 million a year
from a beefed-up Cactus League.
</P>
<P>
   But such figures fail to impress Bowers, who describes the
stadium plan as ``a big burrito that's always got to be wrapped in
something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First it was a convention center, now it's tourism, and next
it will be teacher salaries and education. The point is: Just do a
straight-up stadium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the proposed plan, Bowers said he'd rather slow down
a scheduled 1 percent repeal in the corporate income tax rate and
earmark the money for a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the corporations want this baby,'' he said, ``maybe we
should have them pay for it.'' &QL;

BREDAHL IS BRIMMING WITH CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Like any first-time, foreign visitor to Las Vegas,
Johnny Bredahl's weekend is slightly overbooked.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow night, Bredahl claims he will end the reign of World
Boxing Association bantamweight champion Paulie Ayala of Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   And then Sunday, Bredahl and his wife plan to restate their vows
in one of the city's many quaint marriage chapels. Just like any
starry-eyed tourist couple from Copenhagen, Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wedding was so perfect that we're going to take it one
more time over here,'' said Bredahl, who was married to Jacqueline
in December 1997. ``And I told my wife that I will remarry her with
my \Rtitle\S belt on.''
</P>
<P>
   A 61/2-1 betting underdog heading into the scheduled 12-rounder
at the Mandalay Bay Events Center, Bredahl was brimming with
confidence during and after the final news conference for ``Bring
on Heat. Caliente!'' yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just open your eyes and open your ears, know what I mean?''
said Bredahl, 31, the European champion at 118 pounds. ``This is my
fight. This is not for Europe or nobody else. This is for me. And
I'm going to do it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As challenger, Bredahl spoke before Ayala during the formal
portion of the Top Rank news conference and said this pay-per-view
fight was the culmination of a 12-year dream. Bredahl also reported
that he and Ayala met for the first time Wednesday night in the
resort's spa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down to get some tan, and he was coming out of the
steam room,'' said Bredahl, the WBA's No. 4-ranked contender. ``I
asked him if he's got some problem with the scales \Rmaking
weight\S. We just laughed. And it was just, how are you doing? We
were talking and I said, `Let's settle this in the fight. There's
no need to be enemies.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a nice guy. No doubt about that. But he knows after this
talk we had, he knows he's going to lose. If you have doubts, you
know it in the heart. Deep inside. I can't feel that. And then when
I saw him that night ... goosebumps. It's there. I knew it in my
heart. I am ``soooo'' confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Bredahl has claimed a number of lesser-recognized alphabet
bantamweight belts _ International Boxing Organization,
International Boxing Council, World Boxing Union _ since suffering
his only professional setback in December 1995. Bredahl was stopped
in the eighth round by Wayne McCullough in their bout for the World
Boxing Council bantamweight title, an outcome Bredahl contends was
orchestrated in favor of a popular champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stopped so he could get ready for his next fight,''
said Bredahl, 45-1 with 23 knockouts. ``There was no reason, and
that's a problem in my heart. The referee just stopped the fight _
no warning, nothing at all. They took my chance away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Staged before McCullough's rabid fans in Belfast, Northern
Ireland, the fight was the first of only two Bredahl has contested
outside of Denmark as a pro. Since losing against McCullough,
Bredahl has won 19 consecutive fights, 14 by either technical
knockout or knockout. That run of power, Bredahl said, has
coincided with his reunion with trainer Kjeld Krough, who tutored
him and older brother/retired world champion Jimmi Bredahl from
1988 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I got him back, it was knockout after knockout after
knockout,'' said Bredahl, whose brother is a former World Boxing
Organization junior lightweight (130 pounds) champion.
</P>
<P>
   With a family boxing background that goes back 25 years, Johnny
Bredahl said there is little he has not experienced inside the
ring. Bredahl acknowledged that Ayala has been on a roll since
scoring a 12-round decision against the formerly unbeaten Johnny
Tapia here to win the WBA title in June. That fight was selected by
``The Ring'' magazine as Fight of the Year, and Ayala was voted
Fighter of the Year for his 12-round slugfests against Tapia and
former No. 1-ranked contender Saohin Srithai Condo of Thailand in
Fort Worth in October.
</P>
<P>
   But at 5-foot-8-inches tall, Bredahl will enjoy a three-inch
height and a five-inch reach advantage against Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got two arms, two legs, just like me,'' said Bredahl.

 &HT;    GOP candidates break little new ground in debate
 &HT;    By Ken Herman and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Super Tuesday's crucial set of 13 primaries
and caucuses just four days away, Thursday night's televised debate
among the three Republican presidential candidates probably did
little to change the overall picture. There were plenty of clashes,
but no one seemed to deliver any death blows. Nor did anyone
falter.
</P>
<P>
   So after 60 minutes of tough grilling by three reporters and
accusations and countercharges by the three candidates, the
political terrain appeared unchanged: Texas Gov. George W. Bush
remains the front-runner after his stunning victories in two
primaries and a caucus this week. Arizona Sen. John McCain still
needs a strong showing Tuesday to keep his insurgent race alive.
And radio commentator Alan Keyes is an impressive orator but trails
the other two by so much that he's really not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   The debate format was unusual, with Bush and Keyes on stage in
an auditorium in the Los Angeles Times building in California, and
McCain joining by satellite from a studio in St. Louis. Bush, Keyes
and the audience watched and heard the Arizona senator on a large
screen television positioned where a third podium would have been.
</P>
<P>
   That was close enough for Bush, who after two weeks of
long-distance finger-pointing, confronted McCain about campaign
phone calls that Bush say branded him as an ``anti-Catholic
bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking up on the most persistent theme of recent weeks, Bush
said he regrets not speaking out against Bob Jones University's
anti-Catholic policies when he appeared at the South Carolina
school last month. But he said McCain has misconstrued the visit in
telephone calls to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I regret is the politics of smearing somebody's
reputation, and I don't appreciate it one bit,'' Bush said, ``and
the good news is: Catholics around the country are coming to my
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain defended the phone calls, labeled as a ``Catholic voter
alert,'' as fair and accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was straight talk because we wanted to tell people exactly
what Governor Bush had done. It did not accuse him of being an
anti-Catholic bigot, it did not say anything except that he was (at
Bob Jones University) and waited three weeks before he repudiated
it,'' McCain said. ``The fact is that was a factual and fair
statement and one that I stand by, unlike many of the phone calls
and the negative ads that are being broadcast all over
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told his opponent: ``If you don't think those phone calls
labeled me an anti-Catholic bigot, then you weren't paying
attention to what your campaign was putting out, I guess, because
the clear message was I was an anti-Catholic bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why people all over the country were wondering about my
heart for awhile. The good news is that Americans reject that kind
of politics,'' Bush said. ``The good news is we put that behind us
in 1960 with John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and Catholic leaders all
across the country are coming to my defense.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Bush and Keyes compete Tuesday in 13 primaries and
caucuses around the nation that will award 613 delegates, almost 60
percent of the 1,034 needed for nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes provided some fire in a debate that remained civil. Asked
why his campaign wasn't catching on, he blamed a ``media blackout''
and suggested that the major broadcast networks were ignoring him
because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys play the game, put the mask over the eyes of the
people and then ask why they don't see me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he could not support McCain, who earlier in the
campaign said it would be his daughter's decision on whether to
have an abortion if she got pregnant. Keyes said he could not
support a candidate who is not pro-life and that McCain's answer
proves he supports abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the debate, McCain and Bush clashed on campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he supports unlimited contributions from individuals,
with instant disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best reform policy is to say individuals can give and we
ought to have instant disclosure on the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after that, McCain said Bush's ``description of
campaign finance reform is one of the most bizarre that I have
experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also questioned the practice of allowing some of Bush's
big contributors, his ``pioneers,'' to spend the night in the
Governor's Mansion in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush responded that the people who have spent the night have
been his longtime friends, and in some cases, his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush went on the attack suggesting that McCain's pledge to
reduce the influence of special interests by breaking the so-called
iron triangle of lobbyists, big money and legislation does not
square with his own campaign fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about the iron triangle and you're ringing it like a
dinner bell with all those fund-raisers in Washington, D.C.'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Given another chance to respond, McCain said, ``If' I'm ringing
the dinner bell, you've got both feet in the trough because you've
raised five times the amount of money in Washington that I have.''
</P>
<P>
   At earlier debates, Bush and McCain frequently talked of each
other as friends. Now, as they trade negative ads, the friendship
has definitely cooled. Thursday's war of words began before Bush
and McCain hooked up for the evening event.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is hot about a Bush radio ad, airing in New York, noting
that he opposed two breast-cancer research projects as ``garden
variety pork.'' The ad features a New York woman who has had breast
cancer and says she will not vote for McCain because ``we deserve a
candidate with a record on women's issues we can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is, Governor Bush get out of the gutter,'' said
McCain. ``I have strongly supported breast cancer research.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he opposed cancer research money when it was tacked onto
military spending bills he believed lacked sufficient pay hikes for
military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are literally taking bread out of the mouth of military
families. We've got 12,000 enlisted people on food stamps. We need
to take care of them,'' McCain said. ``The funding for breast
cancer research obviously should come out of the appropriations for
health and human services.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he does not plan to respond in kind to Bush's
aggressive ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do everything in my power not to get down into
those weeds,'' McCain said. ``When you wrestle with a pig, you both
get dirty and the pig likes it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chula Vista, Calif., where he spoke at a charter school, Bush
defended the ad as accurate, though it does not mention McCain's
support for other breast-cancer measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like Senator McCain is becoming increasingly angry
as the campaign goes on,'' said Bush. ``We're talking about what's
on his Web page.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign Web page includes the breast cancer programs
among ``garden variety pork'' projects he has opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's schedule seems to indicate he has no plans to drop the
issue. He will stage a ``leadership forum on breast cancer
awareness'' today in Stony Brook, New York.

EDITORIAL: A FUND-RAISER'S GUILTY VERDICT
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, March 3:
</P>
<P>
   A sorry chapter in the Democrats' 1996 fund-raising abuses led
on Thursday to the conviction of the only person in the scandals to
face a trial so far. The verdict was a blow to Vice President Al
Gore, even though no evidence has surfaced suggesting that he knew
of the scheme at the center of this case. The vice president is
affected indirectly, however, because Maria Hsia, a longtime Gore
supporter, was found guilty of all five counts related to her
involvement in an illegal scheme to raise money at the Hsi Lai
Temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif., where Gore famously appeared.
The vice president later denied that he knew of any fund-raising
going on at the temple.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been much doubt that illegal fund-raising took
place at the temple. The monks, nuns and others who wrote checks
and were later reimbursed admitted their participation. At issue in
the trial was the prosecution's charge that Hsia in effect
masterminded the scheme. The jury on Thursday obviously rejected as
implausible her assertion that she was unaware of it. But the
lingering question is whether anyone else higher up in the
fund-raising hierarchy knew what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hsia denies that she knew of anything illegal, it is
unlikely that she will turn around now and start naming higher-ups
with guilty knowledge. But what seems obvious from the trial is
that people who should have ensured that no shady things were
happening either looked the other way or were too busy raising
money to ask. That is the central embarrassment of an over-the-top
fund-raising effort by the Democrats in 1996 that Gore himself has
acknowledged was too lax.
</P>
<P>
   The trial featured a videotape of the vice president at the
temple, clasping his hands in gratitude and meeting with Hsia.
Republicans have already tried to get a copy, no doubt for use in
campaign ads if Gore gets the Democratic presidential nomination.
Television viewers may become quite familiar with this disgraceful
episode. It would be even better if they became outraged enough to
demand campaign finance reform that would ban unregulated donations
to political parties known as ``soft money.'' Until soft money is
ended, further scandals are almost guaranteed. &QL;

   &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ John McCain tried to get his Straight Talk Express
back on the high road Thursday, March 2, amid complaints that his
campaign has become bogged down in its preoccupation with tactics
and by McCain's criticism of religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is fighting for his political life in the days
remaining before the Super Tuesday primaries, tried to absorb the
blame for three rocky days that resulted from statements he made
against leaders of the Religious Right.
</P>
<P>
   He has also had to handle internal bickering over his decision
to stay out of or to attend Thursday's, March 2, debate that nearly
led to the resignation of one of his top lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, McCain remained steadfast in his criticism
of certain leaders of the Religious Right but admitted he had
allowed the campaign to momentarily spin out of his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of mistakes in this campaign primarily
because we haven't got the most brilliant candidate. But one of the
things we are going to try to do is keep it on the issues,'' McCain
told reporters at a press conference in East Los Angeles. ``I am
going to try to keep it on the issues and not get bogged down in
this tit-for-tat kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a trying week for McCain, beginning with his speech
on Monday, Feb. 28, lacerating Christian religious leaders Pat
Robertson and Jerry Fallwell as divisive and intolerant.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Feb. 29, McCain made comments aboard his campaign
bus suggesting that certain elements of the religious conservative
movement were ``evil.'' That prompted a McCain supporter, former
presidential candidate Gary Bauer, to ask for an apology from
McCain for his remarks and touched off a fusillade of questions
from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCain was forced to put down rumors that his
national communications director, Dan Schnur, was resigning over
McCain's original decision to forgo the California debate. And to
top it off, McCain's team was reeling from Tuesday's shutout in the
Washington, North Dakota and Virginia contests.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that if the campaign has sagged in recent days, it
``might be because we have gotten too involved in the process,
about who is doing what commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain stood defiantly behind his comments about religious
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make a strong statement about the direction of the
party,'' McCain said. ``Are we going to be reformist, inclusionary,
expansionist? Or are we going to be less inclusionary, to say the
least, and suffer electoral defeats? That statement needed to be
made.''
</P>
<P>
   One top aide to McCain said that the recent turbulence in the
campaign was a temporary condition and that the operation has been
righted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns are like this,'' said Ken Kachigian, McCain's top
adviser in California. ``You have to take each day at a time.
Sometimes, the dialogue in the campaign is a little different than
you would like it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the campaign headed back to the Northeast, where McCain
will stump in New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut, Kachigian
said the campaign is ``back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got five days until election day, and we're headed in
the right direction,'' Kachigian said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did his best to return to the issue that has been the
cornerstone of his campaign by reminding a group of largely Latino
voters in East Los Angeles that he favors setting aside much of the
projected budget surplus to keep Social Security afloat and to pay
down the debt.
</P>
<P>
   But two new ads attacking McCain, one by the campaign of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and another by an independent environmental
group, made it difficult for McCain to stay on message. Even at the
press conference where he insisted he was back to issues, McCain
lashed out at his opponents' ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Governor Bush has decided to again take the low
road on the issue of breast-cancer research, alleging that I am
opposed to it. I voted many, many times in favor of breast-cancer
research,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the Bush ad running in New York that
criticizes McCain for including breast-cancer research money on a
$13 billion list of ``pork barrel'' spending. &QL; 
 &QL; 
John McCain tried to get his campaign back on track Thursday after
a difficult three days in which he was frequently on the
defensive. &QL;

CAP DEAL SAVES STATE $700 MIL

   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Arizona ended a seven-year legal battle with the
federal government Thursday, March 2, over how much the state owes
for construction of the $4.7 billion Central Arizona Project.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Arizona Water Conservation Board voted, 12-1, to
approve a settlement with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation that over
the next 50 years will reduce the state's CAP debt and save Arizona
taxpayers as much as $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark decision lays the groundwork for final resolution
of a host of other critical water issues, too.
</P>
<P>
   The state will give up 200,000 acre-feet of CAP water, 13
percent of the canal's total annual capacity. The federal
government will use that water to help settle longstanding disputes
with several Indian tribes. The tribes, in turn, could lease the
water to some of Arizona's fastest-growing cities.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also signals a change in the way the state
allocates its most precious natural resource. Farmers will slowly
lose the cheap and abundant water the CAP has offered for more than
a decade as the state moves to ensure long-term supplies for its
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a mammoth financial dispute with the federal
government, and that's a scary thing,'' said board member Grady
Gammage, one of the settlement's architects. &QL;

GUN-CONTROL BID TO BE RESURRECTED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Outraged by deadly shootings this week, President
Clinton and congressional leaders agreed Thursday to meet next week
to revive gun-control legislation lying dormant in Congress for
almost eight months.
</P>
<P>
   While still sharply divided over restricting weapons sales at
gun shows, congressional Republicans and Democrats indicated
agreement was likely on requiring trigger locks for guns in the
wake of the shooting death of a Michigan first-grader Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently the child who was killed was killed by another with
a stolen gun,'' Clinton told reporters in the Oval Office. ``If we
had child trigger locks on all guns, it wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, set for Tuesday, is aimed at raising public
discussion about guns in the United States, Clinton said. Twice
this week, Clinton has interrupted speeches on other topics to
complain about lack of action by Congress and opposition to the
legislation by the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this tragic death will help,'' the president said
Thursday, referring to the shooting death of a 6-year-old girl by a
classmate using a stolen .32-caliber semiautomatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
   The president's call for action, and talk of compromise on
Capitol Hill, was fed by public outrage over the killing of Kayla
Rolland, who was shot while in class at Mount Morris Township,
Mich. The next day, a gunman fatally shot two men and wounded three
others at fast-food restaurants near Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we waiting for, more of these deaths?'' said Sen.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped inside a bill to crack down on juvenile crime, the
stalled gun-control measure would require background checks on all
gun show sales, prohibit violent juvenile offenders from ever
owning guns, ban high-capacity ammunition clips and require that
all guns be sold with childproof trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House is pushing for the legislation to pass
intact, sentiment was growing among Democrats and Republicans to
separate the child safety lock issue and schedule a quick vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take whatever we can get _ gun shows, clips, safety
locks,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, a South Dakota
Democrat. ``We have sat paralyzed now for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's possible. I'm open to compromise,'' said Rep. Henry
Hyde, an Illinois Republican who chairs the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old saying: `If you can't get dinner, get a
sandwich','' Hyde said, adding: ``Our challenge is to navigate
between the two extremes on this issue and the gun show provision
in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate last year included the gun provisions in a juvenile
justice bill, but the House stripped the gun-control measures from
the legislation. The last meeting between House and Senate members
trying to reach a compromise was in early August.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said new laws will not prevent gun deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 17 federal laws and, I think, 16 state laws that
were violated at Columbine and they didn't stop that,'' Hyde said,
referring to the April 20 attack by two armed students at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo. Fifteen people, most of them
students, were shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert blamed Democrats for the
lack of action on gun control, saying they walked away from
negotiations. Republicans in August agreed to legislation that
included child safety locks and other restrictions but did not go
as far as Clinton wanted in background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the House Democrat leadership drops its obstructionist
tactics and agrees to work with us to pass common-sense gun
legislation,'' said Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding gun show sales, Republicans agreed to a 24-hour delay
in obtaining a gun to give authorities time to do a background
check on the purchaser, with an additional two days if the
``instant'' check raises questions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are pushing for a three-day waiting period, which
would end most gun show sales. Gun shows normally are held on
weekends and are only one- or two-day events.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who also wants gun buyers to be licensed, blamed
the impasse on the pro-gun lobby, headed by the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most Americans have any idea what a stranglehold
the NRA has had on this Congress,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the NBC ``Today`` show Thursday, Clinton said
13 children are killed with guns every day in America, a rate nine
times higher than the world's 24 largest countries combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because they don't have an NRA in their country and
they take sensible steps to protect children and society as a whole
from people having guns who shouldn't have them, doing things they
shouldn't do with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NRA spokesman Bill Powers said the group supported the GOP
compromise that would have required safety locks, instant gun-show
checks and other provisions. But, he said, Clinton insisted on
restrictions that even some key Democrats revolted against.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's comments are simply not true,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice president, said Clinton and
most congressional Democrats are pushing the legislation ``as a
safety-lock bill and gun-show-check bill when actually what it is
is a phone-book volume of federal regulation that only hits the
law-abiding, not the criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all just politics,'' LaPierre told The Associated Press.
``It has nothing, in my opinion, to do with making America safer
and that's sad.''

BUSH AND McCAIN TRADE BITTER CRITICISM AS CAMPAIGNS IN NEW YORK(REMOVES hyphen in company name ``Multi Media'' in 16th graf) 
 (rk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain and George W. Bush head into New York Friday to
begin personally campaigning in a state whose primary seems likely
to help determine their fate, after setting a bitter stage Thursday
with a harsh round of exchanges about the way each man is trying to
win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in particular, seemed angered over a tough new round of
attacks Bush and his New York supporters launched this week in
anticipation of next Tuesday's primaries. They portrayed the
Arizona senator as anti-New York and as an opponent of breast
cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is, Governor Bush, get out of the gutter,'' McCain
said in Los Angeles. ``Let's stop this kind of campaign.`
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign aides were also infuriated by a political
commercial that popped up on television stations in New York, Ohio
and California. The ad labels its sponsor as ``Republicans for
Clean Air,'' _ a group that the McCain campaign contended was a
front for Bush, which would violate campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference and later on his campaign bus, McCain
returned repeatedly to what he described as the negative nature of
the Bush campaign, and asserted that he would risk getting pulled
into a back-and-forth argument about campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   At one point on the bus, McCain cited one of his campaign
strategists, Mike Murphy, declaring, ``There's a famous Murphy
saying, which he stole from somebody: `When you wrestle with a pig,
you both get dirty and the pig likes it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in his own brief meeting with reporters, raised questions
about the temperament of his opponent, repeatedly using the word
``angry'' to describe McCain. ``Mr. McCain is running an angry
campaign,'' Bush said. ``And I'm going to talk about how to make
the education system better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's press secretary, Karen Hughes, dismissed McCain's
suggestion that the Bush campaign had resorted to low-road tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a habit in this campaign,'' she said. ``Every time
someone disagrees with Senator McCain on a substantive policy issue
he vilifies, he begins calling them names.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two main Republican contenders quarreled in California,
Bush's two main New York supporters _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
Gov. George Pataki _ turned on each other in an ever-more-public
quarrel over how Bush should take on McCain's challenge. Pataki and
his advisers have counseled Bush to run an aggressive campaign, and
as his surrogates, they have attacked McCain over votes he has
taken in Congress that might hurt him with New York voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani, who has shown no shyness during his political
career over such attacks, including in his current race for Senate
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, has demurred in this case, refusing
to participate Thursday in a news conference attacking McCain. His
campaign manager, Bruce J. Teitelbaum, said the mayor would avoid
these kind of events and criticized the governor's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comprehend why it's so difficult for some people to
understand that the mayor has made a principled decision not to
engage in negative attacks against John McCain,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's chief political adviser, responded: `I am
puzzled about how the Giuliani administration could perceive that a
senator's voting record isn't something that should be looked at
and carefully examined.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere that was evident as the candidates prepared for
the final weekend of campaigning before next Tuesday's vote was
charged by the orchestrated attacks Bush made on McCain's voting
record, in radio advertisements, a television commercial and
mailings.
</P>
<P>
   And it was heightened by the purchase of air time in New York,
Ohio and California by the clean-air group, which McCain's campaign
said was a ``shadow organization'' operating with the approval of
Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers denied the contention, although records show
that the firm that bought the television time in New York,
Multi &UR;  &LR; Media Services Corp. of Virginia, has a long record of
working with Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   In placing the advertisements, Republicans for Clean Air
provided a post office box in Virginia as its address. That box is
also the address of a political action committee led by Rep. Henry
Bonilla of Texas, a close Bush ally. Lydia Meuret, the executive
director of Bonilla's committee, said Thursday that she owned the
box and that she was a consultant to Republicans for Clean Air. But
she said there was no connection between Bonilla and the group that
bought the ad.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, which praises Bush's record on clean air while
criticizing McCain's, prompted irate responses from
environmentalists who said it distorted the truth.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the commercial says that as governor of Texas, Bush
``led one of the first states in America to clamp down on old
coal-burning electric power plants.'' But environmentalists said
the program was voluntary and ultimately ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Rockefeller, a prominent Republican environmentalist in
New York, said, `` George W. Bush has probably one of the worst
environmental records of any governor in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans for Clean Air was unknown to the Federal Elections
Commission and to political professionals in both parties. It has
no telephone listing in New York state or Washington and has no Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, said the commercial
violated federal rules requiring disclosure of who is behind
political advertising, and he suggested collusion between the
sponsors and the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are questions of whether this is being done in
connection with the Bush campaign,'' Davis said, ``I call upon the
Bush campaign to explain what relationship they have with this
group and what they may have done in coordination with this
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the sponsors had bought $1.5 million worth of air
time for the ad in New York _ a large amount for a single week _
and more than $400,000 for similar commercials in California and
Ohio, which also hold their primaries on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, spokesman for Bush, said that neither the
governor nor his campaign aides knew who was behind the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to do with these ads, and the governor will
continue to run a campaign that unites our party and nation without
vilifying those who disagree with him,'' he said. ``The senator
keeps hurting himself by going too far on just about everything. He
keeps going on the attack against just about everything that moves.
He's only hurting himself, so we're happy to let his attack speak
for itself.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mucha, a spokesman for Pataki, said that she and the governor
also had no knowledge of the group or its advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to two television spots touting Bush's record, there
is a radio ad, being broadcast in the New York area, attacking
McCain over breast cancer, an often hot political issue.
</P>
<P>
   The radio commercial features Geri Barish, a leader of One in
Nine, a breast cancer patients and survivors group, chastising
McCain for opposing funding for several breast cancer research and
treatment projects in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The raw material for the ads came from McCain's own campaign Web
site, where he lists hundreds of items that he says he would cut
from the current federal budget. The site calls the projects
``wasteful, unnecessary and low-priority spending.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about what's on his Web page,'' Bush told
reporters Thursday after appearing at a charter school in Chula
Vista, Calif. ``He put on his Web page that these programs, he was
going to cut back on these programs. This is something John McCain
laid out.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain declined to discuss the charges and countercharges. ``I'm
going to do everything in my power not to get down into those
weeds,'' he said in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The breast cancer ad is part of a strategy that Bush's New York
supporters have turned to in their efforts to stop McCain. They
contend that he has voted against spending in areas like breast
cancer research, mass transit, home heating oil subsidies and solar
energy, that are of particular interest here.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides countered that in many of those votes, he did not
object to the projects themselves, but the way they were approved
without being considered in committee and competing with other
projects on their merits. Instead, the items were usually inserted
into bills just before floor votes at the behest of powerful
sponsors.

REPRIEVE FOR HOUSTON TV STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lee P. Brown, the mayor of Houston, stepped in to prevent a
scheduled shutdown of the ABC television station Thursday by
announcing that he had won an agreement from ABC and Time Warner's
cable unit to extend their contract in Houston for seven days.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have been locked in a bitter dispute over the
transmission rights to the station. Brown said he had won an
agreement for a seven-day ``cooling off period'' during which he
hoped serious new negotiations could take place.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has demanded concessions to allow Time Warner's cable
systems to continue carrying ABC-owned stations. The concessions
included a fee of 70 cents a subscriber for the Disney Channel, as
well as the addition of two other Disney-owned channels, the Soap
Opera Channel and Toon Disney, to Time Warner's system.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had charged Time Warner with refusing to negotiate. Time
Warner accused ABC of reneging on a previous deal.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had already extended its deals with Time Warner by a month
in other locations, like New York City, but had said it would
terminate the transmission rights in Houston as of Thursday night
at midnight. That would have removed the ABC station, KTRK, in
about 650,000 homes in Houston. ABC had started offering to pay for
some viewers to install satellite dishes to receive the station.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives have accused ABC and its parent, Walt
Disney Co., of trying to extort an agreement that would cost Time
Warner $100 million.

EDITORIAL: THE STORY OF A METEORITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, March 3:
</P>
<P>
   In the history of the Willamette Meteorite, there are at least
two memorable photos. The first shows the meteorite in Oregon,
resting on a rough sledge made of logs, its inertia almost
palpable. The second shows the meteorite chained to a heavy dray,
about to be unloaded at the American Museum of Natural History in
1906. Somehow, it looks even heavier in New York. Since 1935 the
Willamette Meteorite, the largest ever found in the United States,
has been housed in the Hayden Planetarium. Now it is mounted
beneath the Hayden Sphere in the new Rose Center for Earth and
Space.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, just as the Rose Center first opened, the
Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community in Oregon asked
the museum to turn the meteorite over to them. They say that when
it still lay in the hills southeast of modern Portland, the
meteorite was an important object of tribal culture. They argue
that it falls under the Native American Graves Repatriation and
Protection Act, which is designed to restore historic Native
American artifacts in museums to the tribes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Natural History has gone to court to legally
establish its ownership of the meteorite based on a clear
succession of title back to 1855, when the land on which the
meteorite rested was obtained by treaty. In 1905 the Oregon Supreme
Court settled the question of ownership in favor of Oregon Iron and
Steel, which sold it to the Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to sympathize with the members of the Grand Ronde.
But the museum has a very strong legal case, based largely on the
clear descent of ownership and some important limitations in the
Native American Graves Repatriation and Protection Act that protect
rightfully established owners. The museum also has a very strong
ethical case. The Willamette Meteorite is a celestial object with a
history that includes all of us _ the Grand Ronde as well as the 50
million people who have seen it since it first came to New York.
Because it was once part of a planet and embodies a record of
violent forces in the universe, the Willamette Meteorite still has
much to contribute to science, especially now in a new era of
planetary discovery. It belongs to us all, and is best left in the
custody of the museum. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Brian J. O'Connell, a sociologist who was dean of St.
John's University's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and a
former president of Niagara University, died on Monday at a
hospital in Rockville Centre, N.Y. He was 59 and lived on the St.
John's campus in the Jamaica section of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   He had been receiving cancer treatments, said a statement from
Niagara University, in Niagara Falls, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell became dean of the College of Liberal Arts and
Sciences at St. John's in August 1999 after being a trustee at the
university for 10 years. He was president of Niagara from 1989 to
1995. During that time, its residence halls were renovated and
incoming students' academic profiles improved. He wrote ``Blacks in
White Collar Jobs'' (1979) and scholarly articles on urban housing,
employment and demographic shifts.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell was born in Hartford, Conn. He earned a theology
degree from Mary Immaculate Seminary in Northampton, Pa., was
ordained in 1968 and received a doctorate in sociology in 1974 from
Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two brothers, Jeremiah of Sudbury, Mass., and
Daniel of Titusville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Danell, 38, Noted Punk Guitarist
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Danell, a guitarist in the influential Orange County punk
band Social Distortion, died Tuesday after collapsing at his home
in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 38.
</P>
<P>
   The cause apparently was a brain aneurysm, said Jim Guerinot,
the band's manager.
</P>
<P>
   Danell had embodied the punk spirit since his days at Troy High
School in Fullerton, Calif., when he and his friend and fellow band
member, the singer and songwriter Mike Ness, stood out by virtue of
their leather jackets and daring haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   In Social Distortion, his friendship with Ness was as important
as his aggressive rhythm guitar playing. His sunny disposition
complemented the brooding Ness, and he helped his bandmate overcome
heroin addiction in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Danell did not even know how to play the guitar when Ness
brought him into the band, but over the course of the band's seven
albums his musical involvement increased. He occasionally co-wrote
songs, including several on 1988's ``Prison Bound.'' He also formed
another band, Fuel, with John Mauer, Social Distortion's bassist,
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Christie; his mother, Dee; a son; a
daughter; three brothers; and a sister.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy B. Reed, 75, Who Wrote Musicals &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Binns Reed, a composer of musicals and operas, died on
Saturday at her home in Burke, Va. She was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who wrote some 250 compositions, ranging from songs to
marches to operas, achieved her widest success with the 1953 pop
song ``Oh, Happy Day,'' which she co-wrote with Don Howard Koplow
and which Koplow (under the name Don Howard) turned into a
million-seller. The song was recorded by other artists as well.
</P>
<P>
   Reed also wrote a historical musical, ``Tocqueville!'' in 1976
and ``The Blue Opera,'' a contemporary treatment of the mythical
figures Orpheus and Eurydice.
</P>
<P>
   She was also the author of three children's books, ``A Tale of
the Heidelberg Lion,'' ``The Sun and the Moon'' and ``The Magic
Gourds.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Ogden Cartwright Reed, died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Amy Reed Geiger of Fairbanks,
Alaska; three sons, Hayward C., of Spokane, Wash., Ogden Cartwright
Reed Jr. of Philadelphia and Chris B., of Los Angeles; a brother; a
sister; and five grandchildren.

LAKERS HAVE PLENTY IN RESERVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Lakers didn't just reclaim their place as the
NBA's top team this week. They gave the league another four reasons
to worry that they are on top for good.
</P>
<P>
   Those reasons are Robert Horry, Derek Fisher, Rick Fox and Brian
Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers - no longer just the Shaq, Kobe and Rice show - are
winning games on bench strength. Over the last five games of their
13-game winning streak, the Lakers have gotten an average of 31
points per game from their reserves.
</P>
<P>
   It was the bench that put away Vancouver on Wednesday, beat the
vaunted reserves of Portland on Tuesday and carried the Lakers
through a victory at Cleveland last week. Against the Grizzlies and
Cavaliers, the reserves played a huge role when Shaquille O'Neal
sat with foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shared trust and confidence that players get with
coaches and teams have with each other,'' said coach Phil Jackson,
``and I think the confidence level that they have, operating in a
system and being able to take on a game on their own is a trial
basis. And we have two examples of ourselves having to play without
Shaq in the lineup, in Cleveland and last night (against Vancouver)
for short periods of time, not extended periods of time, but we
responded very well.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a strength they'll need come playoff series time, and even
tonight, when the Indiana Pacers come to Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, who lead the East, have one of the league's best
bench corps, led by Austin Croshere, Travis Best, Chris Mullin and
Sam Perkins. Croshere and Best led the fourth-quarter surge that
beat the Lakers in January.
</P>
<P>
   Horry, who is averaging 9.0 points over the last five games,
said the bench surge is a product of ``being more aggressive.... We
just have to shoot the ball. Shaq's so big down there, if we miss
it, five times out of 10 he's going to get the offensive board, so
we just try to be more aggressive and shoot the rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Streakers: Last time the Lakers played Indiana, the Pacers
snapped their winning streak at 16 games. Now they carry a 13-game
streak into tonight's game against the Pacers, but their odds of
continuing the string are better this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are a league-best 26-2 at home but under .500 on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it says something about their new building (Conseco
Fieldhouse), their fans - they have fans that are very intense and
very dedicated to their home team,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   He also speculated that aging Reggie Miller is no longer as
effective on the road, and ``they've got younger players that have
to perform on the road. That's not as easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Shaw is day to day after spraining his left ankle
Wednesday night. The Lakers held only a light practice, but Shaw
would have been held out of any full-speed drills.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher suffered a bruised right forearm Wednesday but is not
expected to miss any playing time.
</P>
<P>
   LAKERS vs. INDIANA
</P>
<P>
   Tipoff: 7:30 p.m., Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports Net; KLAC-AM (570).
</P>
<P>
   Lakers (47-11) update: No team has swept the Lakers in a series
this season, but the Pacers have a shot after beating them in
Indiana in January. The Lakers, winners of seven straight home
games, are 20-2 against the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers (39-17) update: They had won nine of their last 10 games
heading into this road trip, which began Thursday in Phoenix. Dale
Davis has a pulled left hamstring and is listed as day to day.
Austin Croshere has been starting in his place.

TRINIDAD-REID BOUT LACKS A PROMOTIONAL PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Felix Trinidad thinks he is the man. He talks as if
he is the man. He is the man in Puerto Rico. But to everyone else
he remains an enigma _ an insular figure who stays on his estate in
Cupey Alto, P.R., when he is not boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad (36-0), the WBC and the IBF welterweight champion, will
meet David Reid (14-0), the WBA superwelterweight champion, in a
12-round title bout at Caesars Palace Friday night. Both fighters
weighed in Thursday at 153 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The fight, which will be broadcast on pay-per-view by Showtime
Event Television, should be a sold-out ratings grabber, matching
two undefeated champions in their prime.
</P>
<P>
   But the promotion has suffered. The promoter Don King alleges
sabotage from his rival, Bob Arum, who has predicted everything
from an outright cancellation to rain and sleet for the fight at
the 10,000-seat outdoor arena.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem with the promotion lies with the fighters.
Trinidad, 27, is not an engaging personality, and Reid, a gold
medal winner at the 1996 Olympic Games, is not a household name.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Reid's limited experience (14 fights overall and three
world championship bouts), many are saying the 26-year-old will
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the writers that have participated in the poll they
know Tito is a champion, an excellent welterweight champion and he
does not need to demonstrate anything more than he already has,''
said Felix Trinidad Sr., Trinidad's father and manager.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Trinidad and his father only speak Spanish and
must rely on an English translator has contributed to the fighter's
image not catching up to his abundant talents. Some argue that
great champions like Roberto Duran of Panama, and Julio Cesar
Chavez of Mexico, never spoke English and it did not hurt their
careers with American boxing fans.
</P>
<P>
   But Duran and Chavez emitted a fire and passion that burned down
language barriers. Trinidad lacks the magnetism of Duran and
Chavez. Trinidad's demeanor is that of a humble, young family man,
who boxes for a living. There is nothing wrong with that, but it
will never lift him to the matinee-idol status of Oscar De La Hoya,
or put him in the same financial strata.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, however, believes that his victory over De La Hoya
makes him the superior fighter. It is an attitude he has retained
in the negotiations for a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fought him, I beat him,'' Trinidad said. ``If he wants to
fight he must come to me and fight on my terms. It can't be the way
he wants it. It has to be the way that I want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad said last January that he was ready to make a rematch
with De La Hoya. He said a meeting was set up in New York at the
HBO offices, but De La Hoya never showed up. Lou DiBella, HBO's
senior vice president of programming for HBO/TVKO, said De La Hoya
was not supposed to be at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had shown up, I would have made the fight at 147
pounds,'' Trinidad said. ``The money didn't matter. I was ready to
sign. It would have been my last fight at 147 pounds. But now, it
can only be made on my terms.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal-breaker for Trinidad is the weight limit of 152 pounds.
De La Hoya does not want to fight Trinidad over 150 pounds. The
fight may never happen. De La Hoya has agreed to fight Shane Mosley
at 147 pounds on either June 10 or June 17.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad says he is also prepared to move on. He said he does
not have anything to prove by fighting De La Hoya again. He wants
to unify the 154-pound titles, which will mean fights against
Fernando Vargas and Javier Castillejo of Spain. But first he has to
get past Reid, who lacks experience, but has incredibly fast hands
and a devastating right hand. It promises to be a great fight,
better than De La Hoya's mismatch against Derrell Coley at Madison
Square Garden last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Reid and I will deal with his right hand and every
other punch he throws,'' Trinidad said. ``I hope the press
carefully observes my fight and that they watch me very closely. I
have worked very, very hard and I am going to demonstrate how great
a champion I am and how great a WBA 154-pound champion I will be.''

AIR OF MYSTERY CLOUDS A PITCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (With REPUBS-ADS) 
(rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new advertisement lends a bit of mystery to the presidential
campaign. The mystery is the advertisement's sponsor, Republicans
for Clean Air, a group unknown to political professionals and the
Federal Elections Commission. The Bush campaign says it knows
nothing about the group. Advertising time was bought by the Multi
Media Services Corp., an advertising firm that worked on the
campaign for a 1996 environmental referendum pushed by Gov. George
Pataki, the chairman of Gov. George W. Bush's campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The group lists an address that is a post office box in Virginia
belonging to Lydia Meuret, a consultant who runs a political action
committee headed by Rep. Henry Bonilla of Texas, a Bush ally.
Meuret said there was no connection between Republicans for Clean
Air and Bonilla or his political action committee, other than that
she was a consultant to both, and she refused to say any more about
who paid for the advertisements. The advertisement praises Bush's
environmental record, while criticizing Sen. John McCain's;
environmental groups like the Sierra Club say neither man has a
good record, though McCain's might be marginally better.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: McCain's face is superimposed against a backdrop
of smokestacks belching dark clouds.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``Last year, John McCain voted against solar and
renewable energy. That means more use of coal-burning plants that
pollute our air. New York Republicans care about clear air. So does
Governor Bush. He led one of the first states in America to clamp
down on old coal-burning electric power plants. Bush clean air laws
will reduce air pollution more than a quarter million tons a year.
That's like taking five million cars off the road. Governor Bush:
Leading so each day dawns brighter.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: There are flaws in every claim. The clampdown on
coal-burning plants that the advertisement cites was, in fact, a
voluntary program in Texas for which relatively few companies
signed up, and with which even fewer complied, and exempted many of
the dirtiest plants, environmentalists and Texas newspapers say.
Environmental groups, which say the pollution reduction claim is
overstated, give Governor Bush poor marks on clean air issues.
McCain did vote against solar and renewable energy spending
programs; he has also voted for them. The vote mentioned in the
advertisement was one of many that he has cast against spending
bills to object to the way they were approved, rather than their
content.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: This advertisement is intended to appeal to New
York's moderate, pro-conservation Republican voters, as the Bush
campaign tries to portray McCain as being too far to the right, a
switch from previous primaries, when Bush called the senator too
liberal for the party. But with the outcry from environmentalists
who say the advertisement is inaccurate, it is unclear how
effective it will be.

BUSH, McCAIN TRADE BARBS OVER RELIGION 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &UR; LOS ANGELES _ George W. Bush and John McCain dueled anew
Thursday night about support from conservative Christians and Roman
Catholics _ and the effect both critical constituencies may have in
the glut of primaries next week as well as the national election
this fall. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally televised debate, Bush said McCain's attacks on
him for visiting Bob Jones University in South Carolina, a school
with strongly anti-Roman Catholic views, had backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, governor of Texas, said Catholic leaders around the
country were rallying to his defense after he repudiated the
school's stance.
</P>
<P>
   McCain pilloried the visit once again by exclaiming, ``I want
the party of Abraham Lincoln, not the party of Bob Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a senator from Arizona, also refused to back off his
caustic assessment of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, two leaders
of the religious right, but he argued that their followers would
still support him in the general election if he is the Republican
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was the candidates' final joint encounter before the
glut of primaries Tuesday, the richest day of the nominating
season, in which 613 delegates _ or about 30 percent of the total _
are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Because the most important contests Tuesday are open only to
registered Republicans, McCain took pains to rule out bolting the
party if he should win more popular votes than his delegate count
reflects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a loyal Republican,'' McCain said, promising: ``No matter
who the nominee it, I will support that nominee.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   McCain defended his campaign's calls to voters in some states
pointing out Bush's visit to Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was straight talk,'' McCain said, but ``it did not
accuse (Bush) of being an anti-Catholic bigot. It did not say
anything except that he was there and waited three weeks before he
repudiated'' the school's anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shot back, questioning McCain's sincerity and command of
his insurgent campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't think those phone calls labeled me an
anti-Catholic bigot, then you weren't paying attention to what your
campaign was putting out, because the clear message was I was an
anti-Catholic bigot,'' Bush said. ``That's why people all over the
country were wondering about my heart for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news,'' Bush said, ``is that America rejects that
kind of politics. The good news is that we put that behind us in
1960 with John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and Catholic leaders across the
country are coming to my defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Reagan administration official Alan Keyes, who has had
little practical political impact on the campaign and is not
expected to figure prominently in Tuesday's voting, also
participated in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Keyes, a fundamentalist conservative, asserted that he was
``the sentimental favorite'' of a majority of Republicans and
deserved votes as well as vocal plaudits. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' spirited exchanges were a contrast to the
largely agreeable debate Wednesday night between the Democratic
front-runner, Vice President Al Gore, and former Sen. Bill Bradley,
who seemed to be acknowledging with his low-key performance that
the prize had almost certainly eluded him.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was beamed by CNN from the headquarters of the Los
Angeles Times. McCain, who had initially backed out of the
face-off, participated by satellite hookup from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leads McCain in delegates, 170 to 105, with Keyes holding
five, according to The Associated Press count. The senator
acknowledged the possibly decisive nature of the voting next week.
``I think we're going to find out everything next Tuesday,'' McCain
told reporters on his campaign bus before the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leads handily in California and several other states voting
Tuesday, including Ohio, according to recent polls. McCain leads in
New England. The two leading contenders are in a dead heat in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was most important for McCain, who was battling back
from a triple loss to Bush on Tuesday in North Dakota, Virginia and
Washington state as well as the fallout from his attack on
conservative religious leaders Robertson and Falwell as ``forces of
evil.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has a reputation for a sharp tongue and easily
aroused temper, tried to back off the remark Wednesday, calling it
a poor attempt at humor.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said in the debate that although he had publicly
``regretted the leadership'' of Robertson and Falwell, he had
confidence he could rally their supporters if he is the nominee.
``I share their values and their goals,'' McCain said of adherents
of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will desert, I hope, the intolerance and wrongheadedness
of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson,'' McCain said, accusing the men
of leading ``our party in the wrong direction.``
</P>
<P>
   McCain excoriated Falwell for arguing that President Clinton is
a murderer and Robertson for ``some cockamamie theories'' about
Freemasonry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In the reference to Falwell, McCain was talking about
videotapes that the evangelist sold implicating Clinton in the
death of former White House deputy counsel Vince Foster. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bush again defended his support for the death penalty and the
record number of executions in Texas during his terms.  &UR; Bush
expressed certainty that the men and women executed during his
tenure were guilty of the crime for which they were convicted and
had been afforded full legal review of their trial and death
sentence. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bush said he was concerned about Wednesday's federal court
order in Texas that a man held on death row for 16 years be
released. The U.S. District judge noted that the attorney for the
man, Calvin Burdine, had dozed during the trial and that the state
had missed a Jan. 27 deadline to retry him for capital murder. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bush, indicating he believed the man was already free, said:
``I`m sorry he's out. He's a really violent man.'' He called for
the man to face a new trial quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials were given five days to release Burdine, enough
time for the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to rule on an emergency
request for a stay the state filed Wednesday. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; On the issue of campaign finance, Bush said free-speech rights
means there should be no limits on how much money individuals can
give to political parties. But McCain said $1 million in
contributions from one individual in 1996 to the Democratic Party
resulted in questionable transfers of technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush just said he wants unlimited contributions from
individuals. Maybe that explains why there have been sleep-overs at
the Governor's Mansion in Austin by the Pioneers,'' McCain said,
referring to reports that eight of Bush's top presidential
fund-raisers have spent the night at the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush retorted that those individuals were longtime friends and
relatives before they were campaign fund-raisers. He blasted McCain
for breaking his own promise to destroy the ``iron triangle'' of
money, lobbyists and legislation by holding Washington fund-raising
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about the iron triangle, but you're ringing it like a
dinner bell with all those fund-raisers in Washington, D.C.,'' Bush
told McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm ringing it like a dinner bell, you've got both feet in
the trough because you've raised five times as much money in
Washington as I have,'' McCain replied.
</P>
<P>
   In a warm-up for the debate, Bush and McCain traded charges
earlier in the day about a new Bush commercial suggesting McCain
opposes breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of the gutter,'' McCain said. ``I have strongly
supported breast cancer research.``
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like Senator McCain is becoming increasingly angry
as the campaign goes on,'' Bush shot back.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said his commercial was based on an item on
McCain's campaign Web site in which the research program was part
of one cited as an example of ``everyday, garden-variety pork''
which the senator has pledged to eliminate if he reaches the White
House. ``The list includes funds for breast cancer research,'' said
Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't have it both ways,`` McCain also complained about
commercials being sponsored by a group called Republicans for Clean
Air that attack his environmental record and laud Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   McCain suggested the group was a Bush front, but he offered no
substantiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praising Governor Bush's record on the environment is like
praising Bill Clinton for honesty and candor,'' said McCain
campaign manager Rick Davis.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also visited the heavily Hispanic neighborhood of East
Los Angeles to announce the endorsement of Sheriff Lee Baca, Los
Angeles County's top-ranking Republican elected official.
