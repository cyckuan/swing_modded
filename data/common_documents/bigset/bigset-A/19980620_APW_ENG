Greene equals world record in 100, but wind negates mark AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Maurice Greene, who says he will break the
world 100-meter record this year, tied it Friday night in the USA
Championships, but his 9.84-second clocking won't count because of
a prevailing wind.
	   The confident Greene matched the mark set by Canada's Donovan
Bailey in the 1996 Olympics. However, a wind reading of 3.3 meters
per second, or 7.38 mph (11.88 kph), negated the mark, which came
in a quarterfinal heat. For a time to be considered for a record,
the wind reading must be no more than 2.0 meters per second, or
4.43 mph (7.13 kph).
	   Greene ran even faster on May 31 at Eugene, Oregon, clocking
9.79 in the Prefontaine Classic. A strong wind also negated that
time.
	   Three other runners _ Obadele Thompson, Carl Lewis and Andre
Cason _ have run under 9.84, all wind-aided. Lewis and Cason did it
twice each.
	   Greene then came back and won his semifinal heat in a legal
9.96. He got out of the blocks slowly after false starting once,
but rallied to beat Dennis Mitchell (10.02) by two feet.
	   The 23-year-old Greene burst into world prominence last year by
consistently running under 10 seconds, highlighting his season by
winning the world championship in 9.86, the fastest legal time of
his career.
	   Despite the sensational clocking in Friday's quarterfinals,
Greene was unhappy with his race.
	   ``It was terrible, technically terrible,'' he said. ``My mind
wasn't in it. I wasn't focused. My mind was wandering around.''
	   Greene was satisfied with his technique in the semifinals, but
said he had to be cautious after his false start. He also said he
had to stop thinking about the world record.
	   ``The first round, I'm sorry to say I was thinking too much
about the world record instead of running my race and letting it
come to me,'' he said. ``It's time to step away from the world
record, put it out of my mind and just run.''
	   In another quarterfinal heat, Greene's teammate, Jon Drummond,
won in 9.94, the fourth fastest legal time of the year.
	   Drummond had an inflamed groin at the end of the race, and
scratched from the semifinals.
	   Marion Jones, the women's 100 world champion, also ran two
sizzling times in her quarterfinal and semifinal heats. She won her
opening race in a wind-aided 10.75, then equalled her legal best,
10.71, in the semis, breaking Gwen Torrence's 1996 meet record of
10.82.
	   Jones, the world champion, defending champion and world's
top-ranked women's sprinter, first ran 10.71 in China on May 12,
matching the fifth fastest time in history. Only Florence Griffith
Joyner, whose world record is 10.49, has run faster than Jones,
with four performances under 10.71.
	   The wind reading on Jones' quarterfinal race was 4.1 meters per
second, just over 10 mph (16 kph). In her semifinal, the wind was
just at the allowable 2.0 meters per second.
	   ``Technically, there's always room for improvement,'' Jones said
after her semifinal.
	   ``I was just running down the track. I was feeling good. I was
floating. I knew if I ran the way I could, I could do a 10.70
something. Let's hope tomorrow (in Saturday's final), it will be a
10.60 something.''
	   Jones ran so effortlessly that it didn't appear she was being
pushed.
	   ``I know I'll be pushed in the final,'' she said.
	   Chryste Gaines won the other semifinal in 10.96, matching her
career best.
	   John Godina, seeking to become the first shot put-discus winner
since Parry O'Brien in 1955, repeated as discus champion with a
throw of 220 feet, 1 inch (67.09 meters). Godina, the two-time
world champion in the shot put, will try for his first national
title in the event Saturday.
	   Lynn Jennings, 37, won her seventh 10,000 title in 12 years and
her 10th national outdoor title, including one in the 5,000 and two
in the 3,000, holding off Jen Rhines down the stretch in 34:09.86.
	   In other finals, Windy Dean of Southern Methodist University won
the women's hammer throw with a meet-record and personal best 210-4
(64.11 meters); Olympian Tom Pukstys won his second straight and
fifth overall javelin title with a heave of 270-3 (82.39 meters);
Roland McGhee captured the men's long jump at 27-2 (8.28 meters) on
his final attempt; Marc Davis, the 1993 winner in the 3,000
steeplechase, won the 5,000 in 13:40.62; Tim Seaman took the men's
20-kilometer walk in 1:35:08; Kellie Suttle captured the women's
pole vault at 14-0, and Joanne Dow won the women's 10-kilometer
walk in 47:07.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ A look at the second round Friday of the
U.S. Open, played over the par-70, 6,797-yard (6,213-meter) Lake
Course at The Olympic Club:
	    &UR; Leader: Payne Stewart shot a 71 for 3-under 137.
	    &UR; Lurking: Jeff Maggert (69) and Bob Tway (70) are at 138.
	    &UR; Leaving: Davis Love III, Tom Watson, Steve Jones, Fuzzy Zoeller
and Nick Faldo were among those who missed the cut.
	    &UR; Low amateur: Matt Kuchar, who finished 21st in the Masters,
shot a 69 and was at one under.
	    &UR; Low legend: Jack Nicklaus (147) made the cut with a 20-foot
(6-meter) birdie on the 18th hole. He has made the cut in both
majors this year.
	    &UR; Round of the day: Lee Janzen (66), who was six under for the
day until a double bogey at No. 17.
	    &UR; Shot of the day: Lee Porter holed a wedge from 112 yards (102
meters) for eagle at No. 18 to get to 1-under 139.
	    &UR; Quoteworthy: ``I come to the U.S. Open expecting nothing to be
fair.'' _ Janzen.
	    &UR; Noteworthy: Stewart came back to the field with bogeys on the
last two holes. Two years ago at Oakland Hills, he did the same
thing by bogeying two of the last three.
	    &UR; Key statistic: With his finish Thursday and start on Friday,
Stewart had six straight birdies.
	    &UR; Key pairings: Payne Stewart and Jeff Maggert; Bob Tway and Matt
Kuchar; Casey Martin and Jose Maria Olazabal; Tiger Woods and Lee
Westwood; Jack Nicklaus and Tom Sipula.

All Blacks beat 14-man England 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ Lock Danny Grewcock became England's
second player to be sent off in test history as New Zealand scored
a record 64-22 win at Carisbrook on Saturday.
	   Grewcock was dismissed after 30 minutes for kicking an opponent
in the head during a ruck near England's line. Referee Wayne
Erickson was one of the few to spot the incident in the crowd of
players, and produced a red card.
	   Grewcock's dismissal came as England hung on doggedly and it
took the pressure off an All Blacks lineup which appeared to be
laboring in their first test of the season. The only other
Englishman to be marched in a test was Mike Burton against
Australia 23 years ago.
	   The All Blacks finished with nine tries to three at the ground
nicknamed the ``House of Pain,'' and records for their highest
score and biggest winning margin against England. But captain Matt
Dawson, who missed the 76-0 loss to Australia two weeks ago added
some late respectability for his side as they finished with two
tries in the final 10 minutes.
	   ``The send off was crucial, but the other players did their
country proud,'' said Dawson. ``100-0 we were going to lose by, I'm
just glad we proved some people wrong.''
	   New Zealand led 9-3, all from penalties, when Grewcock was
marched but the All Blacks ran in three tries in the next five
minutes to take complete control.
	   ``Anyone who kicks someone else in the head deserves to go,''
said New Zealand captain Taine Randell.
	   Fullback Christian Cullen's double, taking his tally to 23 from
23 tests, was split by one from giant winger Jonah Lomu, who scored
four against England at the 1995 World Cup.
	   England was a tougher outfit than the one thrashed in a test
record 76-0 by Australia two weeks earlier, and hooker Richard
Cockerill had the final say of the first half by waddling through
weak defense to post a defiant try.
	   Cockerill showed his delight by booting the ball high into the
stands, but after the break New Zealand turned on its trademark
running and passing game to overwhelm the visitors.
	   Randell, leading the All Blacks in a test for the first time
after the retirement of Sean Fitzpatrick, scored four minutes after
the resumption before his Otago teammate Jeff Wilson grabbed a
double in three minutes on the right wing.
	   Flanker Josh Kronfeld's try took the All Blacks to 48 and past
New Zealand's biggest score against England of 45-29 in 1995. The
win also easily surpassed New Zealand's biggest previous margin of
27.
	   Randell added his second through weak defense before England's
late resistance.
	   Dawson sneaked over for England's second try while replacement
Tom Beim added a third. The All Blacks were disappointed by the
late lapse but had the final say when center Mark Mayerhofler
scored on debut.
	   Andrew Mehrtens kicked the conversion to finish with 19 points.
	   ``We let them in for more tries than we want,'' said Randell.
``But we scored some good ones ourselves.''
	   Scorers:
	   New Zealand 64 (Christian Cullen 2, Jeff Wilson 2, Taine Randell
2, Jonah Lomu, Josh Kronfeld, Mark Mayerhofler tries; Andrew
Mehrtens 5 goals, 3 penalty goals) def. England 22 (Richard
Cockerill, Matt Dawson, Tom Beim tries; Tim Stimpson 2 goals, 1
penalty)
	   Lineups:
	   New Zealand: Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Mark Mayerhofler,
Walter Little, Jonah Lomu, Andrew Mehrtens, Ofisa Tonu'u, Taine
Randell, Josh Kronfeld, Michael Jones, Robin Brooke, Ian Jones, Olo
Brown, Anton Oliver, Craig Dowd. Reserves: Caleb Ralph, Carlos
Spencer, Mark Robinson, Todd Blackadder, Mark Carter, Carl Hoeft,
Norm Hewitt.
	   England: Matt Perry, Tim Stimpson, Nick Beal, Josh Lewsey,
Austin Healey, Jonny Wilkinson, Matt Dawson (c), Steve Ojomoh, Pat
Sanderson, Ben Clarke, Danny Grewcock, Gareth Archer, Phil Vickery,
Richard Cockerill, Graham Rowntree. Reserves: Tom Beim, Scott

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ City officials will send hundreds of extra
police and inspectors into the streets Saturday when soccer fans
gather to celebrate Mexico's World Cup match with Belgium,
newspapers reported Friday.
	   Some 40 people were treated for cuts and bruises due to scuffles
and out-of-control celebrations around the Monument to Independence
following last week's 3-1 victory over South Korea.
	   Some of the police will be assigned to protect the monument,
which rises from a grassy traffic circle on the Paseo de la Reforma
boulevard in central Mexico City. The monument, topped with a
gilded angel, holds the bones of several of Mexico's independence
heroes.
	   It also has become the traditional gathering place for Mexican
soccer celebrations.
	   The chief of the district where the monument is based, Jorge
Legorreta, told the newspaper La Jornada that officials near the
site would try to ban the sales of glass or metal soft drink
containers, as well as the aerosol foam fans spray on one another.

	   ATOTONILCO DE TULA, Mexico (AP) _ While much of Mexico struggles
with drought, heavy downpours forced hundreds of people in three
states to flee their homes in central and southern states.
	   In the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco, streets flooded and
river levels rose sharply during a sudden downpour that reminded
some residents of 1997's Hurricane Pauline, a storm whose rains and
flooding killed about 150 people there.
	   A downpour on Thursday in Atotonilco caused flooding that forced
the evacuation of about 200 people from 43 houses in this town, 40
miles (65 kilometers) north of downtown Mexico City.
	   Heavy rains in the southern state of Oaxaca on Friday damaged
100 houses in Santiago Amoltepec and forced the evacuation of 49
families in Tuxtepec, Notimex reported. Fourteen houses were
damaged by hail in the northern part of that state.
	   Rains and hail also damaged more than 100 poorly constructed
houses in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, Notimex reported.
	   Meanwhile, in drought-stricken Torreon, 360 miles (580
kilometers) to the northwest, Roman Catholic Bishop Juan de Dios
Caballero said a mass appealing for rain before 5,000 worshipers,
including Coahuila Gov. Rogelio Montemayor.
	   ___
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Suriname has signed an agreement to
allow U.S. forces to pursue smuggling suspects into its territorial
waters.
	   The United States has reached similar agreements with other
Caribbean countries in an effort to strengthen its drug
interdiction efforts, but Suriname was reluctant to sign the accord
for fear it would infringe upon its sovereignty.
	   Other Caribbean countries have criticized the United States for
pressing for the so-called ``shiprider'' agreements while ignoring
the other problems of the region's small nations, including the
economic conditions that encourage smuggling.
	   In addition to drug smuggling, Suriname has experienced problems
with piracy in its waters. Pirates in speedboats have robbed
fishing boats of their catch and money and some fishermen have been
seriously wounded.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A deputy state attorney general suspected of
threatening a U.S. consul has resigned, newspapers reported Friday.
	   Humberto Guevara resigned Thursday for ``family reasons,''
according to the Quintana Roo state attorney general's office.
	   Guevara was involved in a controversy over the U.S. decision to
pull consul David Van Valkenburg out of the region in June 1997
because of perceived death threats during an investigation into the
car-crash death of a U.S. citizen.
	   The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday quoted diplomats as saying
that Guevara told the consul: ``Drive very carefully. Not only
tourists die in car accidents.''
	   Guevara denied making any threat. Gov. Mario Villanueva also
insisted his administration had not threatened the consul. U.S.
officials said evidence of a threat ``was not conclusive.''

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Payne Stewart worked the gum ferociously in
his mouth and watched with folded arms as his 8-foot (2.5-meter)
birdie putt on the 18th hole at the U.S. Open neared the cup,
nearly stopped then proceeded on its merry way.
	   ``I really thought I would have about 3 or 4 feet (about 1
meter) coming back up the hill,'' Stewart said after he shot a 71
Friday to be at 3-under-par 137, one-stroke ahead of Jeff Maggert
and Bob Tway after two rounds at The Olympic Club.
	   ``Then all of a sudden it's 20 feet (6 meters),'' the 1991 U.S.
Open winner said with the exasperated look of a man who knows how
the USGA sets up a golf course with deep rough, fast greens and
difficult pin placements.
	   ``That was borderline ridiculous where they had the pin,'' he
said. ``I wasn't really pleased about that.''
	   Stewart missed the putt coming back.
	   Adding to his annoyance was the fact that it was his third bogey
in five holes as a three-stroke lead became one just like at the
1996 U.S. Open when he made bogeys on two of the final three holes
of the second round to let a lead slip to one stroke and ended up
finishing 27th.
	   But on a day in which Casey Martin and his cart made the cut for
the weekend rounds and player after player succumbed to the unique
demands of a U.S. Open golf course, Stewart managed to make just
enough putts to keep the lead.
	   Lee Janzen grabbed a share of that lead briefly with birdies on
Nos. 15 and 16, but he went from the rough to the bunker on the
468-yard (428-meter) 17th hole and made a double bogey and still
shot a 66.
	   ``I was actually thinking abut shooting a 62 and shooting the
lowest round in major championship history,'' Janzen said. ``You
don't get greedy in a U.S. Open.''
	   Janzen was at 139 along with 19-year-old amateur Matt Kuchar and
32-year-old journeyman Lee Porter, while Nick Faldo and Davis Love
III missed the cut of 7-over 147.
	   While others around him were unraveling _ including Tiger Woods,
Colin Montgomerie and Fred Couples _ Stewart, who finished the
first round with three consecutive birdies, started Friday with
three more.
	   He then settled into doing what needs to be done to win a U.S.
Open _ make a lot of putts to save par, including key ones on Nos.
11, 13 and 16.
	   But bogeys on Nos. 14, 17 and 18 let a lot of players back into
the tournament. One of those was David Duval, who shot a 68 and was
lurking at 143, suddenly only six strokes back going into the
weekend.
	   Nine players started the second round under par, but that number
dwindled as the day went on and the thick El Nino-fed rough
swallowed up shots and the wind-dried greens grew faster by the
minute.
	   Of those nine, only Maggert was able to improve on his score,
shooting a 69.
	   ``The style of golf that we play at the U.S. Open suits my game
very well,'' said Maggert, who was in a final-round duel with
Montgomerie, Ernie Els and Tom Lehman last year at Congressional
before finishing fourth.
	   ``I took a lot away from that tournament,'' he said. ``I am
looking forward to getting myself in a position like that again and
hopefully I can better my performance than what I did last year.''
	   Maggert rebounded from bogeys three times on Friday and _ in
perhaps the key to winning a U.S. Open _ managed to make bogey his
worst score on any hole.
	   Woods was not as lucky. He had a second four-putt green in two
days _ this one on No. 6 _ and made his fifth double bogey in his
last six U.S. Open rounds. He shot a 72 and was at 146, nine
strokes back.
	   Defending champion Ernie Els shot a 70 and was at 145.
	   Perhaps the most surprising player to hang tough _ and in fact
gain on the field _ was Kuchar, who shot a 69 to get to 139.
	   ``I'm definitely playing the weekend right?'' Kuchar said. ``I
made my major goal. I wanted to be out here for Father's Day and my
birthday,'' both of which are Sunday.
	   Sunday will be a special day for Kuchar, whose smile charmed the
galleries at Augusta National in April when he finished 21st at the
Masters, because his father, Peter, is also his caddie.
	   Joining Kuchar in making the cut for the weekend rounds was
Martin, the 26-year-old Nike Tour player who successfully sued the
PGA Tour to be allowed to ride a cart because of a circulatory
problem in his right leg.
	   Martin shot a solid 71 in the second round and was at 5-over-par
145.
	   ``From where I was eight or nine months ago'' when his legal
status was in doubt, ``I am very lucky to be here,'' Martin said.
	   Stewart threatened to sprint away from the field when he started
Friday with birdies on the first three holes to get to seven under
par.
	   But Olympic is a course where you have to put strokes in the
bank when you have the chance because withdrawals from that account
can come at an alarming rate.
	   One of the best examples of how quickly things could go wrong
was Justin Leonard.
	   Leonard had a 25-foot (7.5-meter) birdie putt on the par-3 15th
hole to go to even par but had a four putt, missing twice from 3
feet (1 meter), and then made consecutive bogeys to finish with a
75 for a 146.
	   Whoever wins this Open will certainly have to endure more of the
same on the weekend _ including ``ridiculous'' pin placements.

	   AGAWAM, Mass. (AP) _ First-round leader Heather Daly-Donofrio
and second-day upstart Marilyn Lovander were tied for the lead near
the midway point of the storm-marred LPGA Friendly's Classic on
Friday.
	   Both were at 7-under-par, although Daly-Donofrio wasn't able to
play her final hole because of the heavy rain and electrical
storms.
	   Lovander, with the help of a 30-foot (9-meter) eagle putt on No.
7, had a 68 Friday for 137. Daly-Donofrio carded a 5-under 67 in
the first round and was 2-under Friday going to the 18th tee.

Sri Lankan media praises India for win 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan newspapers on Saturday
showered praise on the Indian cricket team for its victory over the
hosts, saying skipper Mohammad Azharuddin's men outplayed them in
every department of the game.
	   India defeated reigning world champions Sri Lanka by eight
wickets Friday in the first match of the three-nation Independence
Cup. India successfully chased the victory target of 244 run in
43.4 overs.
	   This was the first time in four years that the Sri Lankans were
defeated on home turf.
	   ``Indian batsmen dominated a dismal Sri Lankan bowling attack
... (Sri Lankans) were outplayed in every department,'' said The
English language Island newspaper. ``Indian batsmen were simply in
great shape.''
	   India's opening pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Saurav Ganguly put
up 115 runs and made the foundation for an easy victory.
	   The paper praised the Indians for good fielding and tight
bowling, recalling that they conceded only 48 runs in the final 10
overs during which the Indians also took four wickets.
	   India will play Sri Lanka again on July 1.
	   New Zealand is the third team in the tournament. A total of nine
matches will be played between the teams before the final match on
July 8.

Mexican, U.S. legislators hold tense joint session 
</HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MORELIA, Mexico (AP) _ Responding to perceived U.S. violations
of Mexico's sovereignty, Mexican congressman took their American
counterparts to task during a joint legislative session.
	   The 37th annual Mexico-U.S. Interparliamentary session heard
Mexican congressmen complain Friday about a recent U.S. money
laundering investigation, immigration and political issues that
have marred bilateral relations.
	   ``Nothing lasts that is built on deceit and hiding things. We
want to have a true friendship built on frankness, candor and
mutual respect,'' said Porfirio Munoz Ledo, an opposition-party
leader of Mexico's lower house.
	   The U.S. delegation, which included 12 representatives and two
senators, was the smallest ever sent to the bilateral sessions.
	   Rep. Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican, said congressmen on both
sides of the border had considered canceling the session because of
tense relations.
	   ``But when there is a family argument, that is not the time to
shut one's self off and close the doors,'' Kolbe said.
	   The Mexican government has been angered in recent weeks by a DEA
moneylaundering investigation known as Casablanca, which netted
mid-level employees at several of Mexico's top banks.
	   Mexican officials said they were not properly notified about the
investigation, and that parts of the operation conducted here
violated Mexico's sovereignty.
	   Mexicans were also angered by an apparent mis-translation of
comments made earlier this week by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, which appeared to indicate the U.S. was
pressuring Mexico to resolve internal political matters.
	   But the U.S. delegates had their own bones to pick with their
Mexican counterparts at the session, held in the colonial city of
Morelia, 135 miles (220 kilometers) west of Mexico City.
	   ``On our own side we have suffered a loss from the brutal
killing of a DEA agent,'' said U.S. Rep. William D. Delahunt
referring to the 1985 torture-killing of DEA agent Enrique
Camarena.
	   During the session, which will last through Saturday, Mexican
congressmen are expected to press for better treatment of Mexican
immigrants to the United States, hundreds of whom die each year in
attempts to cross the border.
	   Trade, drug trafficking and environmental issues are also on the
agenda for the Saturday session. U.S. legislators stressed that
U.S.-Mexico trade has increased by dlrs 26 billion in the last
year, making Mexico the United States' second largest trading
partner after Canada.

Singapore's May trade figures show economy continuing to slow 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economy continued to slow in May as
the Asian crisis worsened, but the pace of the downturn was not not
as bad as expected, the government said in a report released
Saturday.
	   The country's non-oil domestic exports, a key measure of overall
economic performance, fell 4.8 percent to 7.06 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 4.3 billion) in May compared to a year earlier, the
report said. That was better than the government's prediction of a
6 percent decline.
	   Finance Minister Richard Hu told Parliament in early June that
the government would wait for a more complete economic picture from
the Trade Develpment Board's May economic report before deciding on
possible actions to halt the economic slowdown.
	   The government has conceded it will revise its growth forecasts
for the year, which it had optimistically set at 2.5 to 4.5
percent, and analysts agree that the new forecast will likely be
more in line with private sector predictions which are almost all
lower.
	   At least four international investment houses have forecast
outright recession at some point in the year.
	   In the Saturday report, the government said trade in May was
worse than in April, when non-oil domestic exports dropped only 1.7
percent.
	   ``The weak performance reflected the continued oversupply of key
electronic products in the global market as well as the regional
economic crisis,'' the Trade Development Board said.
	   Singapore's electronics sector is the engine for the country's
manufacturing base. The small island republic relies heavily on
high-tech industries like disk drive and semiconducter
manufacturing.
	   ``Domestic exports of disk drives continued to decline, by 8.2
percent,'' the report revealed. ``In addition, domestic exports of
integrated circuits and printed circuit board(s) ... fell by 6.6
percent and 8.9 percent respectively.''
	   Analysts have said that back-to-back export declines for April
and May might heighten fears of a sharp contraction in Singapore's
economy during the second and third quarters.
	   ``People may be expecting the bad news, but once it comes out
and is confirmed, people don't react well,'' Nicholas Brooks, an
economist at Santander Investment Securities Singapore told
DowJones Newswires on Thursday.
	   He added that the May non-oil domestic export figures would have
to be several percentage points better than the earlier government
forecast of a 6 percent decline to please the markets. Bad
sentiment would linger even with a 4 percent drop in May exports.

Dissidents urge Clinton to remember blood shed at Tiananmen 
</HEADLINE>
By RENEE SCHOOF
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton should remember the
blood spilled in the crackdown on democracy protests nine years ago
when he reviews Chinese troops during a welcoming ceremony at
Tiananmen Square, dissidents said in a letter released Saturday.
	   The letter signed by seventy dissidents urged Clinton to visit
Ding Zilin, a retired professor whose 17-year-old son died in the
crackdown, Bao Tong, who was a top aide to ousted Communist Party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, and other dissidents.
	   Ding for years has lead appeals to the government to investigate
the killings in June 1989, determine who was responsible and
release the death toll. Bao, the highest party member jailed in the
crackdown, spent nearly eight years in custody.
	   The letter said Clinton would be stepping on ``fresh, scarlet
blood'' in the square.
	   ``We have reason to remind you of the heavy significance of a
democratic country's human rights diplomacy toward the world's most
populous country, and of the earnest yearning for human freedom in
the world's most barren and desolate place,'' it said.
	   Clinton does not plan to meet with dissidents during his visit
next week, Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, said in Washington on Friday.
	   The U.S. government was concerned that if Clinton visited
dissidents, the Chinese government might harass them after he
leaves.
	   Clinton's visit next week will be the first by an American
president since the 1989 crackdown that ended the democracy
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. Hundreds, perhaps thousands,
were killed.
	   The letter to Clinton, dated Friday and faxed to The Associated
Press Saturday, was written by Ren Wanding, a veteran democracy
activist who was jailed for seven years for making speeches during
the 1989 protests.
	   In a separate appeal on Friday, a group of 57 dissidents, some
of whom signed Ren's letter, urged Clinton to meet with longtime
activist Xu Wenli after the meetings with President Jiang Zemin.
	   Xu was imprisoned from 1981 to 1993, mostly in solitary
confinement, for campaigning for democracy during the late 1970s.

Hong Kong government land fetches U.S. dlrs 6 million 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A plot of land near Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport
which will close next month was sold Saturday for 46.8 million Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 6 million), the government announced.
	   Government land auctions are watched closely as a gauge of
economic confidence, especially now, as Hong Kong feels the effects
of Asia's economic crisis.
	   But analysts said the 1,889-square-meter (20,333-square-foot)
site in Hong Kong's Kowloon Bay district was too small to
accurately reflect market sentiment.
	   The Department of Lands said Interseed Company Ltd., a
subsidiary of Hong Kong developer Kerry Properties Ltd., outbid six
other bidders for the plot which was designed for industrial and
office space.
	   Land and property prices in Hong Kong, among the highest in the
world, have dropped about 40 percent since last July, shaken by the
increased volatility of the Hong Kong's stock market. About 70
percent of shares on the stock market are linked to property.
	   Kai Tak, which has been in use for 75 years, will be replaced
July 6 by a U.S. 20.1 billion airport built on an outlying island.

DETROIT: this season. Orioles 7, Blue Jays 4, 15 innings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Baltimore, Rafael Palmeiro hit a three-run homer with two
outs in the bottom of the 15th, ending the 5-hour, 49-minute game.
	   The score was 4-4 from the sixth inning until Palmeiro
connected. By the time it ended, only a few thousand fans remained
from the original announced crowd of 47,012.
	   The game was one minute away from being suspended. It could not
have gone beyond 15 innings because AL rules prohibit an inning
from starting after 1 a.m. The 15th started at 12:59 a.m.
	   Brady Anderson got the Orioles started in the 15th with a
one-out walk off Bill Risley (0-4). Anderson took second on a
single by Joe Carter and moved to third when Eric Davis hit into a
fielder's choice.
	   Palmeiro then lined a 1-0 pitch over the center-field wall,
ending the game just before 1:30 a.m. with his 20th homer.
	   Norm Charlton (2-1), the last pitcher remaining in the Baltimore
bullpen, got the final two outs in the 15th.

Four drug traffickers condemned to death by Vietnamese court 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A court in central Vietnam has condemned
four drug traffickers to death after they were convicted of trading
nearly 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of heroin, a court official said
Saturday.
	   The drug syndicate was uncovered in April 1997 when two Laotians
were arrested for trafficking 7.2 kgs (15.8 pounds) of heroin at a
border checkpoint in Nghe An province, north of Ha Tinh province.
	   Their confessions led to the arrests of two other Laotians and
four Vietnamese, and all eight arrested persons were convicted in
the trial that ended Friday in Ha Tinh.
	   Two Vietnamese men and two men from neighboring Laos were
condemned to death, while a Laotian man and two women _ one
Vietnamese and one Laotian _ were given life sentences. A third
woman, a Vietnamese, was given a five-year jail term.
	   The court official said the network, which trafficked 49
kilograms (107.8 pounds) of heroin from Laos, had shifted its
operation from northern Vietnam to central Vietnam in 1996 after
officials had uncovered another gang in the north.
	   Eight members of the Vu Xuan Truong drug syndicate _ named after
the police captain who headed it _ were condemned to death in May
last year after a high-profile trial.
	   The Ha Tinh trial was the biggest drug trafficking case in
central Vietnam and the country's second biggest after the Vu Xuan
Truong case, in which there were 22 defendants including police and
border guard officers.
	   The official said some 700 local people converged at the Ha Tinh
courthouse to listen to the two-hour verdict which was broadcast
over loudspeakers.
	   Earlier this week, a court in Hanoi sentenced to death two drug
traffickers, one a police captain.
	   The National Assembly last year passed a revised Criminal Code
which toughened penalties for drug trafficking. According to the
revised law, trafficking of 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of heroin is
punishable by death.
	   Last year 26 people were condemned to death for drug
trafficking.
	   Official statistics show that there are 133,000 drug addicts in
Vietnam and drug abuse is spreading to young people, including
school and college students.
	   The People's Army newspaper reported Saturday that a survey of
9,400 drug addicts in Hanoi showed that 304 are school students and
279 are university students.

Asia's first airline plunges close to collapse

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A year ago, tycoon Lucio Tan had
Philippine Airlines' planes emblazoned with the logo of a rising
sun to herald a rebirth of a carrier he once likened to a
terminally ill cancer patient.
	   Tan, said to be an ardent believer in Chinese geomancy, or feng
shui, had hoped the powerful symbol could help reinvigorate the
floundering airline, which he took over in 1995 despite warnings it
could be business suicide.
	   But no magic or business wizardry has been able to save PAL from
the wave of misfortunes that followed. Asia's currency crisis
struck last July, just as the airline was beginning an ambitious
dlrs 4 billion modernization and refleeting program. Then its
625-member pilots' union launched a crippling strike two weeks ago.
	   With barely a dozen of its 54 planes in the air and 80 percent
of its operations paralyzed, Asia's first airline says it is on the
brink of collapse and has laid off 5,000 workers _ nearly 40
percent of its workforce _ in the biggest single retrenchment in
the Philippines in years.
	   ``It's a waste,'' an exasperated Tan said of PAL in a recent
meeting of airline officials, according to an airline executive.
	   ``But we have to go on, we have to go on,'' added Tan, who
reportedly has lost 15 billion pesos (dlrs 375 million) on the
airline.
	   PAL, founded in 1941, conceded Friday it will be unable to meet
its debt payments and filed a rehabilitation plan seeking to
restructure dlrs 2 billion in loans, mostly for the purchase of new
aircraft.
	   Under the plan, PAL says it will sell 40 of its 54 planes,
suspend more than two-thirds of its routes and sell some
subsidiaries, in addition to the layoffs.
	   Senior Vice President Avelino Zapanta said PAL will decide in
three months whether to stay in business or close down, depending
on the outcome of the rehabilitation plan.
	   The airline already was wallowing in losses before the pilots'
strike, having lost 21.12 billion pesos (dlrs 528 million) in the
last 12 years.
	   But the strike ``was the key factor that aggregated the already
shaky financial condition of the airline, pushing it to the
brink,'' PAL said in a statement.
	   It says the walkout has cost the airline more than dlrs 50
million in lost revenue and scared off potential investors,
including Northwest Airlines, and ``effectively robbed PAL of all
options other than to immediately downsize.''
	   The pilots went on strike over an airline plan to retire certain
pilots who have reached 20 years of service or flown 20,000 hours,
regardless of age.
	   Last week, the airline announced it would not accept back the
625 striking pilots because they had defied back-to-work orders
from the labor department. That leaves PAL with only 25 management
pilots.
	   PAL, derided by critics as standing for ``Plane Always Late''
because of frequent delays and bad service, was run by the
government until it was sold in 1992 to a consortium that included
members secretly funded by Tan.
	   In 1995, Tan gained control of the carrier after a long fight
with the government and minority shareholders but failed to make it
profitable. Labor unrest, tougher competition after the government
deregulated the airline industry in the early 1990s and a drop in
revenues caused by Asia's financial storm all contributed to the
loss.
	   Restrictions imposed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
on the entry of Philippine airliners in the United States from 1995
to 1997 also prevented PAL from using its new larger aircraft to
service transpacific routes. The FAA cited security concerns in
making its decision.
	   But some also blame tobacco and beer magnate Tan, one of the
Philippines' richest and most controversial businessmen, for PAL's
fate.
	   The airline's unions claim union members have been targeted in
layoffs, and that Tan has removed profits from the airline by
forming separate companies to handle its moneymaking catering and
ground operations services.
	   Both had previously cushioned the airline's losses since PAL
provides such services to most foreign carriers operating in the
Philippines.
	   Tan, a Chinese immigrant who rose from janitor to become one of
Asia's billionaires, isn't new to controversy. He has fended off
allegations of tax evasion, illegally obtained wealth and of being
a ``crony'' of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   Under Marcos, Tan monopolized the tobacco and cigarette business
in the Philippines. He expanded into banking, beer, property
development, pig farming and chemicals _ businesses that succeeding
governments said really belonged to Marcos and were fronted by Tan
in illegal deals.

U.S. chip-maker Texas Instruments to close Singapore factory 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. electronics giant Texas Instruments will
close its wholly owned subsidiary in Singapore and move the
operation to Taiwan, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The company announced Thursday that it would eliminate 3,500
jobs worldwide because of the weak semiconductor market, hit by
lower prices from Asian competitors and reduced demand for computer
memory chips.
	   Texas Instruments will close Silicon Systems Singapore, a
factory producing integrated circuits for hard disk drives, by the
end of the year, a move expected to save the company dlrs 270
million, The Straits Times newspaper reported.
	   ``The transfer to Taiwan is an attempt to utilize our resources
better,'' Goh Geok Ling, Texas Instruments managing director in
Singapore, was quoted as saying. ``Our test sites in Malaysia and
primarily Taiwan are bigger than in Singapore and have excess
capabilities.''
	   All 600 employees, who are mainly production line workers, will
be layed off in two or three phases over the course of the year,
the report added.
	   The U.S. chip-maker's global sale of its dynamic random-access
memory business to Micron Technology, in addition to the local
plant closure, will reduce Texas Instruments' staff in Singapore to
about 200 employees in its marketing, customer operations and
regional distribution center, the newspaper said.

Japan's oldest person dies at 114 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's oldest person, Suekiku Miyanaga, died
Saturday at a hospital in southern Japan, the director of her
nursing home said. She was 114.
	   Miyanaga was born April 7, 1884. Her life spanned Japan's rise
as an imperial power, its crushing World War II defeat and later
recovery to become the world's second-largest economy.
	   She died in Osumi, 950 kilometers (590 miles) southwest of Tokyo
in Kagoshima prefecture, according to Shigeo Sakasegawa, director
of Osumi Takeyama-en nursing home.
	   Miyanaga married in 1908 and had four sons and seven daughters.
She outlived all but two of them, the nursing home director said.
	   Miyanaga loved to sing and dance, and she played the traditional
Japanese three-stringed ``shamisen'' guitar until she was 107,
Kyodo News reported.
	   A vegetarian, Miyanaga made buckwheat noodles, or soba, until
she fell ill several years ago, Kyodo said. Her health deteriorated
after a bad cold six years ago, and had been bedridden since then.
	   Miyanaga's death leaves Asa Takii, 114, who is several weeks
younger, as Japan's oldest person, Kyodo said. She lives in
Kurahashi, on a small island about 680 kilometers (420 miles)
southwest of Tokyo.
	   Japanese have the world's longest life expectancy _ 83 years for
women and 77 years for men, according to the Health and Welfare
Ministry.

Death toll in bus accident rises to 55 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Rescue workers Saturday pulled out 22
more bodies from the wreckage of a bus that fell into a deep gorge
in India's northern Kashmir state, taking the death toll in the
accident to 55.
	   Most of the victims were members of a marriage party who were
traveling to Jammu, Kashmir's summer capital. Others were pilgrims
returning from a revered Hindu religious shrine. The accident took
place Friday evening, 25 kilometers (14 miles) outside Jammu town.
	   Traffic officials said the driver failed to make a sharp turn on
the steep mountain road and lost control of the bus. It plunged
into a deep gorge, killing 52 people on the spot. As many as 18
were injured, three of whom later died.
	   Police put the number of dead at 51 but rescue workers said they
had pulled out 55 bodies from the wreck of the bus.
	   The 15 survivors are being treated in Jammu, police said.

Dissidents urge Clinton to remember blood shed at Tiananmen 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton should remember the
blood spilled in the crackdown on democracy protests nine years ago
when he reviews Chinese troops during a welcoming ceremony at
Tiananmen Square, dissidents said in a letter released Saturday.
	   The letter signed by 70 dissidents urged Clinton to visit Ding
Zilin, a retired professor whose 17-year-old son died in the
crackdown, Bao Tong, who was a top aide to ousted Communist Party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, and other dissidents.
	   Ding for years has lead appeals to the government to investigate
the killings in June 1989, determine who was responsible and
release the death toll. Bao, the highest party member jailed in the
crackdown, spent nearly eight years in custody.
	   The letter said Clinton would be stepping on ``fresh, scarlet
blood'' in the square.
	   ``We have reason to remind you of the heavy significance of a
democratic country's human rights diplomacy toward the world's most
populous country, and of the earnest yearning for human freedom in
the world's most barren and desolate place,'' it said.
	   Clinton does not plan to meet with dissidents during his visit
next week, Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, said in Washington on Friday.
	   The U.S. government was concerned that if Clinton visited
dissidents, the Chinese government might harass them after he
leaves.
	   Clinton's visit next week will be the first by an American
president since the 1989 crackdown that ended the democracy
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. Hundreds, perhaps thousands,
were killed.
	   The letter to Clinton, dated Friday and faxed to The Associated
Press Saturday, was written by Ren Wanding, a veteran democracy
activist who was jailed for seven years for making speeches during
the 1989 protests.
	   In a separate appeal on Friday, a group of 57 dissidents, some
of whom signed Ren's letter, urged Clinton to meet with longtime
activist Xu Wenli after the meetings with President Jiang Zemin.
	   Xu was imprisoned from 1981 to 1993, mostly in solitary
confinement, for campaigning for democracy during the late 1970s.
	   In Xian, where President Clinton will begin his China visit on
Thursday, police on Saturday morning detained television reporter
Ma Xiaoming, who has been close to the dissident movement, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said in a statement.

Deposed leader won't boycott Cambodian elections 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBIN McDOWELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The leader of Cambodia's main
opposition party, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said Saturday he will
not join a boycott of upcoming elections despite concerns they will
not be free or fair.
	   He warned of an increase in violence as the July 26 election
date nears. There have been several new reports of
politically-motivated killings of opposition members in the
provinces in the past week.
	   ``I am committed to participating in the elections, sure,'' he
told reporters.
	   Instead of boycotting or calling for a postponement of the
elections, he said pressure should be exerted on Cambodian leader
Hun Sen to ensure the polls will be as free and fair as possible.
	   On Friday night, opposition politician Sam Rainsy announced that
his party is withdrawing from the election campaign because it
failed to meet minimal conditions for fairness.
	   He said he was announcing the boycott in anticipation that the
so-called Friends of Cambodia _ a grouping of Western and Asian
countries seeking an end to the country's continuing political
unrest _ were about to endorse the July 26 polls.
	   Ranariddh said he would look to the Friends of Cambodia, meeting
in Bangkok, Thailand this weekend, to assess the political climate
and pressure Hun Sen to put minimum conditions in place for fair
polls.
	   Opposition politicians Sam Rainsy and Son Soubert announced
Friday that their parties were prepared to withdraw from the
campaign because they did not think the elections will be credible.
	   Ranariddh was ousted by his co-premier Hun Sen in a coup d'etat
one year ago which shattered a tense dual premiership formed after
U.N.-brokered elections in 1993.
	   In an effort to win back international legitimacy and foreign
aid that had been held back after the coup, Hun Sen agreed to
proceed with a new election on July 26. Under pressure from foreign
aid donors, he allowed Ranariddh to return to participate.
	   Killings of opposition activists, however, have continued to
mount _ with one Sam Rainsy Party member discovered dead in Kompong
Cham province this week and another reported missing Friday _ and
politically-motivated murders have consistently gone unpunished,
Sam Rainsy and Son Soubert said.
	   They also said opposition party organizers in the provinces are
being threatened and intimidated by ``thugs'' within Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party and that legal institutions remain stacked
in the ruling party's favor.
	   But Ranariddh said Saturday, ``we should not let Hun Sen do it
alone.''
	   A full withdrawal by the opposition would set a precedent for
all Cambodian elections to come, he said. ``If we let him do it in
1998, it will be the same in 2003, and so on.''
	   ``It is better to continue to plan for July 26 elections and at
the same time to continue to raise all concerns about the
conditions leading to free, fair and credible elections to put
pressure on Phnom Penh, he said.
	   At least two provincial FUNCINPEC members have been assassinated
in the last week, Ranariddh said Friday, adding that given the
climate of impunity from prosecution in Cambodia he feared more
bloodshed in coming weeks.
	   ``If strong measures are not taken, there will be more
violence'' in the run up to the elections, Ranariddh warned.

Poll shows Singaporeans want greater say in government decisions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A government poll released Saturday shows
Singaporeans feel the state does not consult them when making
decisions, is unable to accept criticism, and inhibits freedom of
speech.
	   In a survey of 1,075 respondents questioned by mail, only 22
percent said the government consults them when forming policy.
Asked whether it should, 67 percent said yes.
	   Additionally, 40 percent of respondents said the Singapore
government was unable to take criticism, compared to 28 percent who
thought it could. The remaining 32 percent had no opinion.
	   Only a quarter agreed with the statement, ``There is freedom of
speech in Singapore,'' compared to 41 percent who felt otherwise.
	   There was no margin of error given, and the poll did not say
whether all the people sent questionaires responded.
	   Published in The Straits Times, the survey was conducted as part
of a feedback exercise by Singapore's government, which has been
described as benevolent-authoritarian by supporters, and repressive
by critics.
	   Singapore politics have been dominated by one party since
independence, with few voices of dissent. The People's Action Party
had held power since modern Singapore was formed, and in the last
general elections of early 1997, it won all but two seats in
Parliament.
	   The unflattering poll response was tempered by the 88 percent
who said they trust the government to run the country, and 83
percent who felt it was committed to serving citizens.
	   At a Saturday conference on citizens' feedback to the
government, Education Minister Teo Chee Hean said ``good governance
must include effective consultation and consensus building,'' and
that ``communication and feedback is central'' to that.
	   But he warned that ``good governance cannot be policy making by
the polls, but decisions made in the long term national interest,''
and that government ``cannot make everyone happy with every
individual policy that is implemented.''

All Blacks beat 14-man England 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quotes from coaches, Grewcock to face judiciary; EDITS
<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ Lock Danny Grewcock became just the
second player to be sent off in England's test history as New
Zealand scored a record 64-22 win at Carisbrook on Saturday.
	   Grewcock was dismissed after 30 minutes for kicking an opponent
in the head during a ruck near England's line. Referee Wayne
Erickson was one of the few to spot the incident in the crowd of
players, and produced a red card. Grewcock will face a judiciary
hearing Sunday, putting him in doubt for next week's second test.
	   Grewcock's dismissal took the pressure off an All Blacks lineup
which appeared to be laboring in their first test of the season.
The only other Englishman to be sent off in a test was Mike Burton
against Australia 23 years ago.
	   England coach Clive Woodward was furious that his opposite
number, John Hart, had spoken to Erickson at half time, but the All
Blacks coach said he did so to protect the English.
	   ``This is the first time in my coaching career I've had to
criticize the referee,'' Woodward said.
	   Hart said he merely told Erickson that the All Blacks would go
easy in the scrum in the second half because they outnumbered
England eight to seven in the pack.
	   ``We could have absolutely slaughtered them,'' Hart said. ``If
we hadn't taken the pressure off, someone could have been seriously
injured and I didn't want to be responsible for that.''	   
	   The All Blacks finished with nine tries to three at the ground
nicknamed the ``House of Pain,'' and records for their highest
score and biggest winning margin against England. But captain Matt
Dawson, who missed the 76-0 loss to Australia two weeks ago through
injury, added some late respectability for his side as it finished
with two tries in the final 10 minutes.
	   ``The send off was crucial, but the other players did their
country proud,'' said Dawson. ``100-0 we were going to lose by, I'm
just glad we proved some people wrong.''
	   New Zealand led 9-3, all from penalties, when Grewcock was
marched, but the All Blacks ran in three tries in the next five
minutes to take complete control.
	   ``Anyone who kicks someone else in the head deserves to go,''
said New Zealand captain Taine Randell, when asked if he had any
sympathy for Grewcock.
	   Fullback Christian Cullen's double, taking his tally to 23 from
23 tests, was split by one from giant winger Jonah Lomu, who scored
four against England at the 1995 World Cup.
	   England was a tougher outfit than the one thrashed in Brisbane,
and hooker Richard Cockerill had the final say of the first half by
waddling through weak defense to post a defiant try.
	   Randell, leading the All Blacks in a test for the first time
after the retirement of Sean Fitzpatrick, scored four minutes after
the resumption before his Otago teammate Jeff Wilson grabbed a
double in three minutes on the right wing.
	   Flanker Josh Kronfeld's try took the All Blacks to 48 and past
New Zealand's biggest score against England of 45-29 in 1995. The
win also easily surpassed New Zealand's biggest previous margin of
27.
	   Randell added his second before England's late charge.
	   Dawson sneaked over for England's second try while replacement
Tom Beim added a third for a try on debut. The All Blacks were
disappointed by the late lapse but wrapped it up when center Mark
Mayerhofler also scored on debut.
	   Andrew Mehrtens kicked the conversion to finish with 19 points.
	   Scorers:
	   New Zealand 64 (Christian Cullen 2, Jeff Wilson 2, Taine Randell
2, Jonah Lomu, Josh Kronfeld, Mark Mayerhofler tries; Andrew
Mehrtens 5 goals, 3 penalty goals) def. England 22 (Richard
Cockerill, Matt Dawson, Tom Beim tries; Tim Stimpson 2 goals, 1
penalty).
	   Lineups:
	   New Zealand: Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Mark Mayerhofler,
Walter Little, Jonah Lomu, Andrew Mehrtens, Ofisa Tonu'u, Taine
Randell, Josh Kronfeld, Michael Jones, Robin Brooke, Ian Jones, Olo

China needs better trained lawyers, judges: official 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Only 25 percent of China's lawyers have a college
undergraduate degree, a Chinese law professor said at a seminar on
legal education.
	   But Zhao Xianglin, vice president of the China University of
Political Science and Law, added that China has 300 law schools at
universities with about 60,000 students enrolled. The country
currently has about 100,000 lawyers.
	   ``Poor professional education is one of the knottiest problems
of China's legal system,'' Huo Xiandan of the Legal Education
Department of the Ministry of Justice said at the seminar, a joint
China-U.S. meeting of law school deans, the China Daily reported
Saturday.
	   Lawyers now are getting more education to help them pass newly
required bar examinations, the report said. But many judges and
prosecutors are not required to pass professional exams, it quoted
Huo as saying. There have been many complaints about unfairness in
the courts.
	   China began a three-year juris master course in 1996 to train
judges, prosecutors and lawyers.
	   The report quoted Paul Brest, dean of the law school at Stanford
University, as saying he saw signs China was moving toward the rule
of law and away from rule by whatever individual leaders want.
	   ``You cannot have a market economy if you do not have the rule
of law,'' Brest was quoted as saying.

Asia-Pacific countries voice concern over free trade 
</HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Several Pacific Rim countries have
worries about opening their markets completely in the economically
battered region, a top U.S. official said Saturday.
	   Under the so-called Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization, or
EVSL, trade barriers and tariffs in nine select industries would be
removed over the next few years among the 18 economies of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   John Wolf, U.S. ambassador to APEC, said there was a great deal
of support among the countries, however, ``there are several
economies that have concerns.''
	   ``We're trying to come up with the best way possible to advance
trade and investment in the region given the financial
uncertainty,'' Wolf said to reporters after closed-door talks with
senior officials.
	   He noted it was not an easy task given the scope of products
covered by the EVSL, which he said represented dlrs 1.5 trillion in
trade.
	   Officials have been reluctant to point a finger at the countries
holding up the EVSL proposals for which were slated to be completed
in time for the arrival of trade ministers who will meet Monday and
Tuesday.
	   Many officials have, however, said the support of Japan, the
world's second largest economy, was crucial.
	   Japan appears committed to the process but, given the state of
its rapidly sliding economy, has raised concerns that the EVSL goal
of liberalization by 1999 was unrealistic, officials said.
	   A Japanese official said a proposal to the EVSL was being
prepared and that Japan intended ``to make a contribution'' to the
liberalization effort. However, another Japanese official said
Friday, ``We have many reservations'' about the EVSL.
	   Countries including Malaysia have openly voiced concerns about
losing control of their national economy by opening it up to
foreign investors. The worries have deepened with the crisis.
	   Negotiators are striving to eliminate tariffs and other trade
barriers in nine industries: environmental products and services,
energy, fishery, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   Japan has said that fish, forestry, toys, and gems and jewelry,
were ``sensitive'' industries. In particular, the forestry and fish
industries are heavily subsidized and seen vulnerable to foreign
competition.
	   Those are precisely the areas which big commodity exporting
countries, such as Canada, would like to see opened up.
	   APEC has selected six additional sectors that would be
liberalized as part of a second phase but still ahead of the
group's goal, which is completely open markets by 2020.
	   Those sectors are food, natural and synthetic rubber,
fertilizers, oilseeds and oilseed products civilian aircraft and
automobiles.
	   A South Korean delegate said his country ``had reservations ''
about opening its forestry and fishing industries to the APEC
marketplace.
	   Chile and Mexico have opted not to participate in the EVSL,
which was drawn up at last year's Vancouver summit and expected to
be ready for final signatures by this November's Kuala Lumpur APEC
summit.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, scheduled for admission in November,
have sent their ministers as observers.

Police kill 10 Maoist rebels in Nepal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Police in Nepal shot dead 10 Maoist
rebels and arrested five of their comrades this week in an
operation to flush them out of their jungle hideout, officials said
Saturday.
	   The guerrillas oppose Nepal's constitutional monarchy and demand
that the Himalayan state be turned into a republic. More than 200
people have been killed since the insurgency began two years ago.
	   In this weeks fighting, eight of the rebels were killed in
Jajarkot district when a group of 40 guerrillas ambushed the police
who returned fire, the home ministry said. Jajarkot is about 320
kilometers (200 miles) west of the Nepalese capital, Katmandu. Two
others were killed nearby.
	   A total number of 54 rebels have been killed in the three-week
operation, police said. Two policemen have died in the fighting and
another 39 have been injured in gun battles with the rebels.
	   Nearly 1,500 policemen are combing 10 districts in mid western
Nepal to clear them of rebels.

currency markets that threatens to throw the region's economies
back into a tailspin.
	   The meeting in Tokyo was one of the broadest since Asia's
financial crisis began almost one year ago and comes just days
after dramatic intervention by the United States and Japan to stop
the yen's recent freefall against the dollar.
	   Meeting Saturday were deputy finance ministers from the Group of
Seven industrialized countries, Asian finance officials and
representatives of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank
and the Asian Development Bank.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who was

	   The officials had been expected to agree to coordinate efforts
to stabilize Asian currencies and to reemphasize the importance of
shoring up the yen's value against the dollar.
	   ``We want to regain trust at home and abroad by moving quickly
and decisively to clean up the bad loans,'' Japanese Finance
Minister Hikaru Matsunaga was quoted as saying before Saturday's
meeting by Kyodo News agency.
	   Before the meeting began the Clinton administration made it
clear that interventions like the one earlier this week can only do
so much _ and that the situation may well worsen again quickly
without more serious, long-term action by Japan.
	   Clinton said Friday he had told Japanese leaders ``that no
short-term efforts would work unless there was a serious long-term,
very comprehensive commitment to economic reform.''
	   Earlier this week, the United States and Japan made a sudden
joint foray into world currency markets after the Japanese currency
fell Wednesday to its lowest level against the dollar in eight
years.
	   The yen-buying action pushed the dollar down 7 yen in a mere
three days.
	   The yen's slide had raised fears that Asian countries may be
forced to engage in another round of competitive devaluations,
triggering a repeat of last year's disastrous free fall in regional
currencies.
	   On Friday, Summers concluded a series of high-level meetings
with Japanese government officials and extracted promises that
Japan will take swift action to boost its ailing economy.
	   Summers and Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga vowed to
intervene again in currency markets to stabilize the yen if
necessary.
	   But experts worry that no amount of government intervention in
the currency market will restore long-term confidence in the yen
unless Japan takes swift action to clean up its ailing banking
system.
	   Saturday's meeting was being watched closely for signs of just
how serious Japan will be in its efforts at the longer-term
structural reforms most experts agree it badly needs.
	   Analysts say that Japan needs to commit more public money to
help rid its banks of 76 trillion yen (dlrs 563 billion) left on
their books from the collapse of the property market in 1992.
	   The country also must also stop coddling banks with regulations
_ even if that means letting the weaker ones go under, they say.
	   Many fear the big test may come sooner than expected. Major
Japanese newspapers reported that the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd., once a mainstay of Japanese industrial policy, was
franticly searching for a white knight after its stock plunged
Friday following a downgrade by Moody's Investors Services.
	   Japan has said it will implement a program to clean up the bad
loans at the nation's banks and put together a package of tax cuts
aimed at boosting the economy.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has reportedly decided
to slash corporate taxes and announce a permanent income tax cut
before elections for the upper house of Parliament on July 12.
	   During his talks Friday, Summers told Japanese officials that it
is more important for Japan to stimulate the economy than balance
its enormous budget deficit by tightening spending.
	   He also received assurances from senior members of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party that Japan will set up a special financial
institution to take over debts at failed banks.

Former Cambodian leader criticizes amnesty for Khmer Rouge leaders 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian government's decision
to welcome back into the fold five important leaders of the dying
Khmer Rouge rebel movement smacked of hypocrisy, ousted co-premier
Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Saturday.
	   Hun Sen, the country's strongman, last week welcomed the
defecting members of the rebel movement's inner circle, including
former deputy premier Chan Youran, after they agreed to cut ties
with their old comrades and to give up their fight against the
government.
	   They were also asked to sign an agreement recognizing Cambodia's
constitution and the role of His Majesty the King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   Ranariddh, deposed by Hun Sen in a coup d'etat a year ago, said
that his own negotiations with the Khmer Rouge in the days that
preceded his ouster were nearly identical.
	   But his actions were not treated as a victory heralding the end
of the guerrilla movement, as Hun Sen's recently have been.
	   Hun Sen, then Ranariddh's co-premier, had denounced Ranariddh's
talks with the guerrilla's nominal president, Khieu Samphan, as
illegal, and used them as an excuse to stage his coup.
	   After Hun Sen took power, his government charged Ranariddh with
conspiring with outlawed guerrilla group, accusing him of having
plotted his own takeover.
	   The prince was tried in absentia and given a 30-year jail term,
but received a royal pardon from King Norodom Sihanouk so he could
participate in elections now set for July 26.
	   The trial was widely seen as a political effort by Hun Sen to
cripple his opposition in the run-up to the polls. As the son of
the popular king, Ranariddh is considered Hun Sen's biggest threat.
	   ``When I was dealing with Khieu Samphan I was condemned to 30
years!'' said Ranariddh, adding that the standards have changed so
dramatically because, ``everything from Hun Sen is OK.''
	   Longtime Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot _ who died in mid-April of a
reported heart attack _ led a Maoist-inspired regime in the late
1970s that was responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million
people from overwork, disease and systematic executions.
	   The Khmer Rouge were toppled in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion
but continued to wage guerrilla warfare against successive
governments. Defections by thousands of war-weary guerillas in 1996
crippled the group as a fighting force.
	   The government took over the last major stronghold of the group
in April this year.
	   A trio of veteran rebel leaders, including Khieu Samphan, still
remains in the jungle, along with perhaps several hundred followers
while smaller bands of Khmer Rouge roam remote areas of the
country.

Taiwan to boost economy with major public projects 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The government will spend an estimated 100
billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.9 billion) in major
infrastructural projects to bolster the economy and offset the
impact of the regional financial crisis.
	   Plans for those projects, including highways and a high-tech
park, were scheduled to be implemented by 2000.
	   But Premier Vincent Siew ordered the appropriation of more funds
to move up the implementation by June next year, according to a
government statement issued late Friday.
	   Siew also said authorities have simplified re-zoning procedures
to encourage private investment in public housing and other
infrastructural projects.
	   The planned investments could help offset the impact of flagging
exports, officials said.
	   Because of reduced demands from Asian countries embroiled in a
financial crisis, Taiwan's exports fell 7.6 percent to U.S. dlrs
9.38 billion in May.
	   Officials said the sagging financial markets could also hurt
domestic consumption. As of Saturday, share prices have falled 13
percent since the regional economic turmoil began last July.
	   The government now projects a 6.02 percent economic growth this
year, down from 6.18 percent predicted earlier this year. But
several private economic research institutions have said growth
could fall as low as 5 percent.
	   In a separate report, the government Council for Economic
Planning and Development said private investment could slow down
after registering a record high growth of 42.8 percent in the first
three months this year.
	   The report issued Friday noted machinery imports fell 6.9
percent in April, as industries have slowed down investment because
of uncertainties over future export prospects.
	   Reduced world demand for semiconductors is also expected to
dampen domestic investment in the field, the report said.

Dissidents urge Clinton to remember blood shed at Tiananmen Roth comment, tightens.

Eds: CORRECTS in 2nd graf that 71 signed letter sted 70; moves up
By RENEE SCHOOF
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton should remember the
blood spilled in the crackdown on democracy protests nine years ago
when he reviews Chinese troops during a welcoming ceremony at
Tiananmen Square, dissidents said in a letter released Saturday.
	   The letter signed by 71 dissidents urged Clinton to visit Ding
Zilin, a retired professor whose 17-year-old son died in the
crackdown; Bao Tong, a top aide to ousted Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang and the highest party member jailed in the
crackdown; and other dissidents.
	   The letter said Clinton would be stepping on ``fresh, scarlet
blood'' in the square.
	   Clinton does not plan to meet with dissidents during his visit
next week, Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, said Friday in Washington. The U.S.
government was concerned that if Clinton visited dissidents, the
Chinese government might harass them after he leaves.
	   Clinton's visit next week will be the first by an American
president since the 1989 crackdown that ended the democracy
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. Hundreds, perhaps thousands,
were killed.
	   The letter to Clinton, dated Friday and faxed to The Associated
Press today, was written by Ren Wanding, a veteran democracy
activist who was jailed for seven years for making speeches during
the 1989 protests.
	   In a separate appeal on Friday, a group of 57 dissidents, some
of whom signed Ren's letter, urged Clinton to meet with longtime
activist Xu Wenli after the meetings with President Jiang Zemin.
	   Xu was imprisoned from 1981 to 1993, mostly in solitary
confinement, for campaigning for democracy during the late 1970s.
	   In Xi'an, where President Clinton will begin his China visit on
Thursday, police today detained television reporter Ma Xiaoming,
who has been close to the dissident movement, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said in a statement.

World financial officials urge Japan to revive economy TRIMS. 
</HEADLINE>

By MARTIN FACKLER

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ World finance officials urged Japan on Saturday to
revive its hobbled economy and fix its troubled financial system _
for its own good and for the region's recovery.
	   Japan must restore its banking system to health, achieve
domestic demand-led growth and open and deregulate its markets,
deputy finance ministers from the Group of Seven nations and 11
Asian countries said in a statement after Saturday's meetings.
	   ``The restructuring and revitalization of the Japanese economy
and financial system is urgently needed,'' the statement said.
	   The officials had been expected to agree to coordinate efforts
to stabilize Asian currencies and to reemphasize the importance of
shoring up the yen's value against the dollar.
	   ``We want to regain trust at home and abroad by moving quickly
and decisively to clean up the bad loans,'' Japanese Finance
Minister Hikaru Matsunaga was quoted by Kyodo News agency as saying
before the meeting.
	   The Clinton administration has made it clear that interventions
like one earlier this week to shore up the yen can only do so much
_ and that the situation may worsen again quickly without long-term
action by Japan.
	   Clinton said Friday he had told Japanese leaders ``that no
short-term efforts would work unless there was a serious long-term,
very comprehensive commitment to economic reform.''
	   Earlier this week, the United States and Japan made a sudden
joint foray into world currency markets after the Japanese currency
fell Wednesday to its lowest level against the dollar in eight
years. The yen-buying action pushed the dollar down 7 yen in a mere
three days.
	   The yen's slide had raised fears that Asian countries may be
forced to engage in another round of competitive devaluations,
triggering a repeat of last year's disastrous free fall in regional
currencies.
	   On Friday, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
concluded a series of high-level meetings with Japanese government
officials and extracted promises that Japan will take swift action
to boost its ailing economy.
	   Summers and Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga vowed to
intervene again in currency markets to stabilize the yen if
necessary.
	   Saturday's meeting was being watched closely for signs of just
how serious Japan will be in its efforts at the longer-term
structural reforms most experts agree it badly needs.
	   Japan has said it will implement a program to clean up the bad
loans at the nation's banks and put together a package of tax cuts
aimed at boosting the economy. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
reportedly has decided to slash corporate taxes and announce a
permanent income tax cut before elections for the upper house of
Parliament on July 12.
	   Analysts have said Japan needs to commit more public money to
help rid its banks of 76 trillion yen (dlrs 563 billion) left on
their books from the collapse of the property market in 1992. They
also have urged the country to stop coddling banks with regulations
_ even if that means letting weaker ones go under.

Five dead in raid on village in northwestern Cambodia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Five people, including two children,
were killed in an attack on a village in northwestern Cambodia, a
newspaper report said saturday.
	   Between 50 and 100 armed men launched the 90-minute attack late
Thursday night on the village near the Thai border in Banteay
Meanchey province, razing houses and looting the market of food and
other supplies, the Cambodia Daily reported.
	   The marauders then headed to the nearby office of the Cambodian
Mine Action Center, which coordinates land mine removal activities
in the area.
	   Two deminers were killed as the attackers fired rifles and at
least one B-40 rocket-propelled grenade at the compound, the
newspaper reported.
	   In addition to the five dead, 10 other people were injured and
evacuated to a nearby Thai hospital.
	   ``This is the worst tragedy we've ever encountered,'' said Sam
Sotha, the national director of the demining group. He said three
deminers were taken hostage by the group but released about 6 hours
later.
	   The motive for the attack was no known.
	   The attackers were believed to be anti-government guerrillas
based in camps about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the village,
said a military attache briefed on the incident, according to the
daily.

Party rallies behind Mahathir's leadership, for now 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ruling party members on Saturday
urged support for Malaysia's prime minister, but there were murmurs
of discontent among some delegates over his economic leadership.
	   The third day of the four-day United Malays National
Organization conference continued with further public endorsements
of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``What we need now is not a change in leadership but reform
within the party,'' said Syarifah Noli Syed Hussain, a party
representative for Selangor state.
	   Nearly 2,000 delegates from the party that has ruled Malaysia
since independence from Britain in 1957 were gathered for the first
party convention since the nation's economy began sliding toward
recession.
	   Political fault lines appeared to deepen when the party's youth
leader ignored Mahathir's warnings to shirk subjects that could
embarrass UMNO and spoke out against cronyism within the party.
	   ``Lots of people, especially the younger generation, aren't
happy with Number One's leadership,'' said a senior UMNO delegate,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Still, delegates from Syarifah's state earlier put forward a
motion saying that there shouldn't be any contests for the posts of
party president and deputy president during next year's general
assembly.
	   The motion is likely to be decided by senior UMNO officials on
Sunday. If it passes, it could safeguard the offices of Mahathir
and Anwar as top party leaders.
	   The resolution would also assure Mahathir of another three-year
term as prime minister since there are no opposition parties
capable of challenging UMNO during general elections scheduled for
2000.
	   Mahathir, 72, has often been at odds with his hand-picked
successor, Anwar, over the handling of the economy. Nevertheless,
Mahathir and Anwar have continued to back each other in public.
	   Political observers say that it is uncommon at UMNO meetings for
members to criticize the government leadership directly _ and the
rumblings against Mahathir could be significant.

Tens of thousands commemorate old president's death in Indonesia

	   BLITAR, Indonesia (AP) _ Beset by an economic crisis but with
new political freedoms in the air, Indonesians turned out by the
tens of thousands at the grave site of their first president
Saturday to mark the anniversary of his death.
	   Bloody turmoil and economic chaos characterized the rule of
Sukarno. Still, the faithful lined up for more than one kilometers
(half a mile) to file past the old leader's tomb, exactly 28 years
after he died.
	   Many whispered Muslim prayers and some held copies of the Koran
as they shuffled by the grave protected by an elaborate
glass-enclosed pavilion.
	   ``I love Sukarno,'' said Gatot Suwignyo, 43-year-old resident of
Blitar, where the ex-president was born in 1901.
	   The anniversary of his death has been marked for many years. But
crowds at the town, about 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of
Jakarta, were far greater this year.
	   Some estimated that more than 30,000 people had come to pay
their respects. Many people also gathered outside a home still
owned by the Sukarno family.
	   Less than a month ago Sukarno's successor, Suharto, stepped down
after 32 years in office following protests and riots that shook
the world's fourth most populous nation.
	   New President B.J. Habibie has promised political reform that
has heralded in a new era of free speech _ speech that had been
muffled by his predecessor.
	   ``Sukarno served his country first. Not himself or his family,''
said one fan, Edi Supryanto, 23, referring to allegations that
Suharto used his position and power to enrich his children and
friends.
	   Of all of Indonesia's three president Sukarno was the most
charismatic, and arguably, the most controversial.
	   Known as Bung Karno, ``Brother Karno,'' he garnered support from
the poor by whipping up nationalism with colorful rhetoric and
brash diplomatic moves.
	   He is still admired. His portrait posters are still sold on
street corners.
	   As a leader within the independence movement against the Dutch
since 1927, he collaborated with occupying Japanese forces in World
War II. With their defeat, he declared independence from colonial
rule in 1945.
	   After a four-year war to keep the Dutch from returning, Sukarno
led the country through a turbulent experiment with democracy until
1959 when he imposed authoritarian rule. He later became
``president for life.''
	   He was removed from office after Suharto, then an army general,
crushed what was said to have been a communist-backed coup attempt
in 1965.
	   Stripped of power, Sukarno died in 1970. He was honored with a
state funeral and was buried in a simple grave that was replaced by
an ornate monument in 1978 on Suharto's orders.
	   Thousands of people are expected to attend a night time prayer
service. Among those expected to take part are Sukarno's children,
including his daughter Megawati Sukarnoputri, a prominent
opposition figure who had been sidelined from Indonesian politics
by Suharto's government after she called for greater democracy.

Intestinal virus claims four more lives 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ An intestinal virus has claimed the lives
of four more children in Taiwan, raising the death toll to 50, the
government said Saturday.
	   Hsu Kuo-hsiung, a Health Department official, said the latest
deaths were reported Saturday, including one in eastern Taiwan,
where no such cases were detected before. No other details were
provided.
	   Doctors say the enterovirus 71 virus had entered the lower part
of the brain and nerve system of the infected children, who have
not been previously exposed to it and lacked antibodies. Many of
them have recovered because of early diagnosis.
	   The virus, which spreads by physical contact, hits Taiwan every
summer, but this year's outbreak has been especially severe.
	   Hsu urged children of 12 or younger to stay away from public
swimming pools this summer to avoid being infected. He also called
on local governments to suspend summer camps or other large-scale
activities, including several planned international children's
fairs.
	   Some nursery schools have been closed in parts of central Taiwan
hit hardest by the virus. Authorities have advised parents to
ensure that their children wash frequently and to avoid taking them
out in public.
	   Early symptoms of the virus resemble the flu, with fever,
headache or vomiting. Ulcers or blisters in the mouth and a rash on
the hands and feet can also develop. Later, possible deadly
complications can include encephalitis, meningitis and acute
inflammation of the heart muscle.

Communist chief calls for change in Russian leadership 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of Russia's Communist Party said
Saturday the goal of his party was the impeachment of President
Boris Yeltsin and if the masses rose up in anger, the president
could be forced to resign.
	   Gennady Zyuganov told a party plenum that the goal of the party
was ``impeaching the president in a peaceful way,'' the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   He said that unless there was a change in leaders, ``people's
patriotic forces will not be able to resolve a single existing
task, there may be no government of national trust in the
conditions of an anti-people regime.''
	   ``Wave nine of the people's anger is close,'' he warned, saying
that Yeltsin could be forced to resign by mass protest actions.
	   He said the Communist Party has shed its Leninist-Stalinist
platform, which the Central Committee had found to be ``politically
erroneous,'' the ITAR-Tass report said.
	   On Friday, the lower house of parliament voted to begin
preparing an impeachment motion against Yeltsin but gave itself 1
1/2 years to launch it, signaling the effort would probably fade
away like previous such attempts.
	   The Communists and their allies in parliament have accused
Yeltsin of a range of transgressions, including instigating the
collapse of the Soviet Union, launching the botched war in Chechnya
and ruining the country's economy.

Prison island readied as illegal immigrants threaten to flood Singapore 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore is preparing a small island near its
shores as a detention center for a potential flood of illegal
immigrants from economically troubled neighbors, a news report said
Saturday.
	   Authorities are readying St. John's Island, a former political
prison, The Straits Times reported, adding that old buildings on
the tiny island are being refurbished and ringed with barbed wire.
	   Instability in neighboring countries has already led to a surge
in illegal immigrants looking for work in this affluent city-state,
which imports much of its labor force from overseas.
	   A Hong Kong-based think-tank said Saturday that more could be on
the way.
	   With the economy worsening in Indonesia, ``the prospect of yet
another wave of Indonesians trying to slip into Singapore ... has
risen significantly,'' the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy
said in a report made available Saturday.
	   Singapore fears an increase in crime as these illegal foreigners
swamp the country, and has conducted a series of highly-publicized
nationwide raids since the start of the year against illegal
immigrants.
	   The PERC said there are other dangers to consider: a glut of
small boats carrying illegal immigrants dangerously clogging the
busy waterways around Singapore.
	   The crowding could ``threaten the entrepot trade which forms the
basis of the Singapore economy,'' the think-tank said.
	   Singapore remains one of the busiest ports in the world, while
the congested shipping lanes skirting the island republic and
neighboring Indonesia witness heavy traffic, occasionally leading
to costly accidents.
	   ``This is quite apart from the negative international publicity
Singapore may bring upon itself as it attempts to stem the tide by
caning immigration offenders,'' the PERC report added.
	   Illegal immigrants face up to six months jail and 12 strokes of
the cane if convicted of unlawful entry into the country.
	   In April, Singapore created a special court located inside its
existing immigration prison for the sole purpose of trying illegal
immigrants, while it has held special sessions in its regular
courts to try large batches of accused foreigners.
	   The number of illegal immigrants arrested last year rose 33
percent to 7,600 people, a figure that is likely to be easily
eclipsed by the end of 1998.

Rebels hold airport, gunfire rattles through Bissau 
</HEADLINE>
By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Gunfire rattled through the northern
outskirts of Guinea-Bissau's capital on Saturday as the country's
breakaway army leaders held off advancing Senegalese troops near
the city's airport, rebel radio and military officials said.
	   Although the renegade soldiers have been cut off from the city
and their main supply of ammunition, they continued to hold the
airport, a Senegalese military commander said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Senegal has sent at least 1,300 troops to reinforce soldiers
loyal to the government of President Joao Bernardo Vieira in
Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip.
	   The rebels, led by former army chief of staff Ansumane Mane,
were forced from their stronghold military garrison where the
revolt began on June 7 in Bissau last week, but have reinforced
their position at the nearby airport.
	   Rebel Radio Bombolon said Mane's forces were dug in at the
Bissalanca airport.
	   ``This is a well organized military action by a professional
military junta,'' said the radio broadcast, monitored in the
Senegalese border town of Mpak.
	   A communique from Senegal's military command in Dakar said last
week the rebel forces had been driven from the Bra military
garrison and had abandoned stores of ammunition.
	   Mane earlier this month staged an attack on Vieira in a bid to
oust the longstanding leader of Guinea-Bissau. Mane, fuming over
accusations of smuggling guns to Senegalese separatist guerrillas,
was fired shortly before staging his coup attempt.
	   Almost two weeks of artillery and ground battles have left
downtown blocks in the capital charred and battered. An exodus of
almost the entire city of 300,000 people has threatened to create a
humanitarian crisis of internally displaced refugees.
	   Food and water shortages have been reported in Bissau and
elsewhere.
	   Shelling at the Senegalese border has cut off land access to
Guinea-Bissau.
	   The United Nations relief agency World Food Program said
Guinea-Bissau's government ``requisitioned'' two storage complexes
containing 2,700 metric tons (2,970 tons) of U.N. food, much of it
intended for hungry refugees.
	   ``The World Food Program wants the government to give back the
two stores of food,'' spokesman Wagdi Othman said in Abidjan, Ivory
Coast. The U.N. agency was worried the food would be used to feed
fighters, Othman said.
	   The government, however, told Portuguese media the food will be
used to feed the people and not the military.
	   Attempted peace talks failed just they started to get under way.
Gambian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sedat Jobe returned to his country
after failing to meet with Mane.
	   The rebels earlier said they would only negotiate with their
chosen mediator, Senegalese opposition legislator Landing Sauane.

Japan Air System plane makes emergency return after wheel system trouble 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japan Air System domestic flight carrying 172
people made an emergency return to the New Chitose Airport in
northern Japan on Saturday because of faulty landing gear, airport
officials said.
	   No injuries or major damages were reported from the incident,
according to an air traffic controller at the New Chitose Airport
in Sapporo, 800 kilometers (500 miles) northeast of Tokyo.
	   The problem occurred just as the pilot of JAS Flight 25 was
preparing to land at the Memambetsu airport, 280 kilometers (170
miles) northeast of Sapporo.
	   As the pilot deployed flaps of the main wings and wheels for
landing, he noticed the hydraulic pressure to activate the landing
gear had dropped, leaving the door of wheel hangar open, said the
air traffic control officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The plane then turned back to land safely at the Chitose
airport, which has a longer runway, with the door of the wheel
hangar scratching the runway, the official said.
	   The cause of the hydraulic pressure problem was not immediately
known.

North Korea builds small power stations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Energy-starved North Korea has built
1,900 small power stations this year, with cities and counties
trying to meet their own electricity needs, an official news report
said Saturday.
	   For years, the communist state's central power supply system has
remained moribund because of fuel shortages and lack of parts to
repair its outdated national grid.
	   ``Korea encourages the construction of minor power stations as
part of plans to meet demands for electricity by local efforts,''
the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.
	   Those power stations use flowing water, wind power, methane,
charcoal gas and other power resources to generate between several
and a few thousand kilowatts of electricity, it said.
	   More and more small cities and counties were cutting off state
supply lines and setting up their own local supply system, KCNA
said.
	   South Korean officials say most of North Korea's aging power
plants are fossil-fired and only produce about 1.5 million
kilowatts daily, about one-fifth of their total capacity, because
of fuel shortages.
	   Foreign tourists have reported frequent power outages, even in
Pyongyang, the capital. Defectors from the North have reported a
rising number of plants sitting idle because of power shortage.
	   A U.S.-led international consortium is building two
1,000-megawatt nuclear power plants in North Korea under a 1994
deal aimed at freezing and eventually dismantling the North's
nuclear weapons program.
	   The United States also is providing 500,000 tons of fuel oil
annually until the first of the two reactors goes on line around
2003.
	   North Korea insists that its nuclear program was solely for
power generation. But U.S. officials believe that it has been used
to extract weapons-grade material.

Czechs vote for new parliament in early elections throughout. Polls open from 0500 to 1200GMT; first results expected just after polls close. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with estimates on number of voters so far, EDITS
By NADIA RYBAROVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Roughly half of all Czechs voters
cast their ballots on the first day of elections, local media
reported Saturday.
	   Voting for all 200 seats in the lower house of parliament, which
will form a new government, began Friday and resumed at 7 a.m.
(0500) Saturday. Polls were expected to close at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT).
Initial results were expected shortly afterward.
	   ``According to our estimates, about 50 percent of voters voted
by the time polls closed'' on Friday, Petr Safranek, deputy
chairman of the Central Election Committee told the daily Mlada
Fronta Dnes.
	   There are 8.09 million eligible voters in the country.
	   Heading into the elections, the Social Democrats, led by Milos
Zeman appeared poised to form the first left-of-center Czech
government since the collapse of Communism in 1989. The center-left
party led pre-election polls with more than 20 percent, at least 5
percent ahead of the second-place Civic Democratic Party of former
Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   The elections come two years early, following the collapse of
Klaus' center-right coalition last winter. A caretaker government
under banker Josef Tosovsky has been running the country.
	   But unlike the previous elections in 1996, when people had made
up their minds who they would support weeks before voting started,
many Czechs were still undecided shortly before going to the polls,
the government-funded Institute for Research of Public Opinion
said.
	   According to the institute, about 52 percent of 1054 voters
polled knew who they would support ahead of time, while 23 percent
said they still might change their mind. No margin of error was
given.
	   Analysts fear such indecision will be reflected in the new
house, as neither of the leading parties are expected to win a
clear majority.
	   There is little chance that Zeman would join with his bitter
rival Klaus in a ``grand coalition'' of left and right.
	   Five smaller parties are expected to clear the 5 percent
threshold needed for representation in parliament, including the
old guard Communists and the extreme Republicans. But all the
mainstream parties have rejected both as possible coalition
partners.
	   This leaves only the small Christian Democrats, the Freedom
Union _ a party of center-right rebels favored by President Vaclav
Havel _ and the populist Pensioners for Secure Living as potential
partners.
	   The Social Democrats say ideally, they would form a coalition
with the centrist Christian Democrats who, in turn, suggest taking
on the Freedom Union.
	   But if the Freedom Union refuses to cooperate, the Social
Democrats could be forced to try and make a coalition with the
Pensioners and tacit support from the Communists.
	   Difficult coalition negotiations are expected to follow the
vote, with Havel playing a key role. Havel's spokesman Ladislav
Spacek told state radio talks might begin as early as Monday.

Indonesian leader offers to free rebel leader in retrun for recognition 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president Saturday offered
to release imprisoned East Timor rebel leader Jose Xanana Gusmao in
return for world recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over the
disputed territory.
	   In an interview with Australian journalists in Jakarta,
President B.J. Habibie said he would also withdraw thousands of
Indonesian troops from, and grant special status to, the former
Portuguese colony.
	   Details of the offer were presented privately to United Nations
officials on this week by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.
	   Habibie announced the proposal to the reporters as Gusmao
celebrated his 52th birthday in Jakarta's Cipinang prison, where he
is serving a 20-year sentence for fighting a guerrilla war for
independence.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year
later.
	   The half island territory has endured hit-and-run warfare and
human rights abuses since then.
	   Habibie came to power a month ago after the resignation of
longtime autocrat Suharto. Since he has announced a wide range of
political reforms. Recently he released about dozen East Timor
rebels from prison.
	   He said the United Nations, Portugal and the world community
should now recognize East Timor as Indonesia's 27th province.
	   ``We will give Timor special status and we will ... release
Xanana,'' Habibie was quoted as saying by Australian Associated
Press.
	   ``But then the former colonial masters (Portugal) and the whole
world should stop making problems about East Timor and they should
accept East Timor as an integral part of Indonesia. This is what I
am going to do to end everything.''
	   Under Suharto, who ordered the 1975 invasion, Indonesia made no
concessions to calls for independence or greater autonomy by East
Timorese.
	   Habibie said he had the power to reduce Gusmao's sentence to the
time the rebel commander has already served since his capture in
1992. He said he would do so once international agreement to the
new plan had been secured.
	   Over the past few weeks East Timorese protesters, who want full
independence, have repeatedly called for a referendum to be held on
their homeland's future.
	   It is unclear whether Gusmao or other East Timorese leaders
would accept Habibie's deal. However, the province's Gov. Jose
Abilio Soares met Gusmao in prison on Wednesday.
	   Until now Indonesia has maintained that Gusmao is a violent
criminal not a political prisoner.
	   Under Habibie's proposed special status arrangement, the
Indonesian government would grant extra funds for development.
	   East Timor's provincial government, rather than the national
government in Jakarta, would decide how to spend this.
	   Habibie also promised to make other special grants for education
and business development if 200 or 300 rebel fighters still hiding
out in East Timor's rugged interior laid down their arms and
integrated with the rest of the population.
	   Habibie said he would discuss the plan next week with East
Timor's two Catholic bishops, including Nobel Peace Prize winner
Bishop Carlos Belo.
	   East Timor's 800,000 people are predominately Catholic compared
with mainly Muslim Indonesia.
	   He hoped to have what he described as a family discussion with
East Timorese leaders on the plan.
	   Habibie said it would also be discussed further with the United
Nations, the United States, the European Union and other nations.

Kremlin has no plans to recall ambassador from Belarus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has no immediate plans to recall its
ambassador from Belarus because of a dispute over diplomatic
housing, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday.
	   The Belarusian government has been trying to force ambassadors
out of their homes in a diplomatic residential compound on the
outskirts of the capital Minsk, claiming the compound is badly in
need of sewer and plumbing repairs.
	   ``Our Belarusian friends are not acting via diplomatic means,''
Primakov told the Zerkalo television program. ``One can't do
that.''
	   Primakov said he hoped that ``this misunderstanding will all be
sorted out somehow, but not at the expense of recalling all the
ambassadors''
	   On Friday, the government of Belarus cut water and power to the
compound in an effort to force the diplomats to leave.
	   The ambassadors have refused to leave, saying the order violates
the Vienna Convention which designates ambassadors' homes as
territory of their countries.

Sixth grader stabs alleged bully to death 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CABANATUAN CITY, Philippines (AP) _ A 12-year-old boy stabbed to
death a 13-year-old classmate he accused of bullying him, police
said Saturday.
	   The younger boy cried as he gave himself up to the class teacher
shortly after stabbing the older boy Friday inside their classroom
at the Aca Elementery School in Cabanatuan City north of Manila,
said homicide investigator Estelo Ganao.
	   Ganao said the boy claimed the bully had planned to kill him.
	   The 6th grade teacher, Gloria Pamintuan, said the two boys had
been arguing heatedly earlier in the day. She ordered them to take
their seats and gave them some homework.
	   The younger boy, seated behind the victim, stood up and stabbed
the alleged bully once in the back with a bayonet. The victim died
on the way to the hospital.
	   Police placed the boy in the custody of the social workers
pending the homicide charges, Ganao said.

	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ A West African enclave of farming plateaus
and mangrove swamps, Guinea-Bissau was showing signs of emerging
from decades of economic malaise when disaster struck this month.
	   The country had shed its post-colonial Marxist system and begun
to attract outside investment and development aid in recent years
to relieve staggering poverty that put it among the world's 10
poorest nations.
	   But a failed coup has degenerated into a military standoff in
the capital and plunged Guinea-Bissau back into darkness. It also
has unleashed fighting elsewhere in a region of complicated
enmities and alliances.
	   Bissau, the capital city of about 300,000 people, is nearly
deserted. Downtown blocks are torn by explosions and scarred by
bullet holes after two weeks of artillery shelling and ground
fighting.
	   The population is on the move, fleeing for safety and facing the
prospect of little food and barely any clean drinking water. Relief
workers, unable to reach Bissau or other parts of the country, say
tens of thousands of refugees are in dire need of assistance.
	   ``The people are sick. They have no shelter, and we still can't
help,'' Jerome Da Sylva, the Red Cross delegate in neighboring
Senegal, said Friday.
	   The crisis that began with an attempt to oust President Joao
Bernardo Vieira on June 7 has its roots in the region's failure to
find stability since the colonial powers pulled up stakes.
	   The coup leader, former Brig. Ansumane Mane, is seeking revenge
against Vieira for being removed as Guinea-Bissau's army chief of
staff for alleged involvement in an arms smuggling scheme.
	   Some people felt Vieira offered up Mane as a scapegoat to
appease Senegal's complaints about smugglers running guns from
Guinea-Bissau to rebels in neighboring Casamance, a Senegalese
region that is separated from the rest of the country by Gambia.
	   What Mane hadn't counted on was military intervention by Senegal
and another neighbor, the Republic of Guinea.
	   As a result, he unleashed a chain reaction in the region that
now has Guinea-Bissau locked in a deadly conflict that is being
used as a proxy for wider historic differences.
	   The fighting has rekindled fears on both sides about a murky
intellectual movement that campaigns to restore a pre-colonial
empire covering Guinea-Bissau, Gambia and Casamance, Western
diplomats and a local historian said.
	   The idea, some believe, is for Casamance to win independence
from Senegal, after which the three countries would form a new
confederation, historian Abdoulaye Bathily said.
	   Thus, the Senegalese are taking advantage of Guinea-Bissau's
crisis as a pretext to crush the Casamance rebellion.
	   Coming to aid of Vieira, Senegal's army has led the fight
against Mane, driving him and his troops from their stronghold in
an army garrison on the outskirts of Bissau.
	   But in the northern border region, Senegalese troops also are
pursuing large-scale artillery and rocket attacks on the towns of
Ingore and Bula, where Casamance rebel bases are reportedly
located.
	   ``Guinea-Bissau and Gambia occupy strategic ground for the
separatists in Casamance,'' Bathily said. ``The history of
Casamance's problems are closely tied with Guinea-Bissau.''
	   Unlike most nations in West Africa, Guinea-Bissau won its
independence only after a protracted and bloody uprising led by the
African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde,
which had links with the separatists in Casamance. After 14 years
of fighting, Portugal cut Guinea-Bissau free from colonial rule.
	   Exploited for so long by the Portuguese as little more than a
vast peanut and palm plantation, Guinea-Bissau began as a sovereign
state with little industry and little hope. Its people lived on
average only 35 years and almost half its children died before age
5.
	   Marxist ideology and central planning did little to relieve the
burden, and Vieira began to slowly restructure the economy in 1986.
	   In recent years, foreign investment and infrastructure projects
helped build up a small industrial base and transport network that
attracted foreign business interests.
	   Now Mane's coup and the resulting fighting has sent most
foreigners packing.

Czechs vote for new parliament in early elections throughout. Polls open from 0500 to 1200GMT; first results expected just after polls close.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Roughly half of all Czechs voters
cast their ballots on the first day of elections, local media
reported Saturday.
	   Voting for all 200 seats in the lower house of parliament, which
will form a new government, began Friday and resumed at 7 a.m.
(0500) Saturday. Polls were expected to close at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT).
Initial results were expected shortly afterward.
	   ``According to our estimates, about 50 percent of voters voted
by the time polls closed'' on Friday, Petr Safranek, deputy
chairman of the Central Election Committee told the daily Mlada
Fronta Dnes.
	   There are 8.09 million eligible voters in the country.
	   Heading into the elections, the Social Democrats, led by Milos
Zeman appeared poised to form the first left-of-center Czech
government since the collapse of Communism in 1989. The center-left
party led pre-election polls with more than 20 percent, at least 5
percent ahead of the second-place Civic Democratic Party of former
Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   The elections come two years early, following the collapse of
Klaus' center-right coalition last winter. A caretaker government
under banker Josef Tosovsky has been running the country.
	   But unlike the previous elections in 1996, when people made up
their minds early on who to support, many Czechs were still
undecided shortly before going to the polls, the government-funded
Institute for Research of Public Opinion said.
	   The institute found 23 percent of voters surveyed ahead of the
vote said they could change their mind. No margin of error was
given for the poll.
	   Analysts fear such indecision will be reflected in the new
house, where neither of the leading parties is expected to win a
clear majority.
	   There is little chance that Zeman would join with his bitter
rival Klaus in a ``grand coalition'' of left and right.
	   Five smaller parties are expected to clear the 5 percent
threshold needed for representation in parliament, including the
old guard Communists and the extreme Republicans. But all the
mainstream parties have rejected both as possible coalition
partners.
	   This leaves only the small Christian Democrats, the Freedom
Union _ a party of center-right rebels favored by President Vaclav
Havel _ and the populist Pensioners for Secure Living as potential
partners.
	   The Social Democrats say ideally, they would form a coalition
with the centrist Christian Democrats who, in turn, suggest taking
on the Freedom Union.
	   But if the Freedom Union refuses to cooperate, the Social
Democrats could be forced to try and make a coalition with the
Pensioners and tacit support from the Communists.
	   Difficult coalition negotiations are expected to follow the
vote, with President Vaclav Havel playing a key role. Havel's
spokesman Ladislav Spacek told state radio talks might begin as
early as Monday.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II, on the second day of
his three-day pastoral visit to Austria, recalled Saturday the
``unspeakable suffering'' that had been imposed on Jews in Europe.
	   Reconciliation with the Jews is a fundamental duty for all
Christians in Europe, the 78-year-old pontiff told church
dignitaries, political leaders and diplomats at Vienna's downtown
imperial Hofburg palace.
	   ``We must not forget that European history is closely
intertwined with the history of the people from which Jesus has
emanated,'' John Paul said.
	   ``In Europe, unspeakable suffering has been inflicted on the
Jewish people,'' he said. ``We cannot necessarily presuppose that
all roots of this injustice have been irretrievably weeded out.''
	   Speaking about the need to bring Eastern and Western Europe
close together, the pope said: ``Another big task faces the
builders of Europe: to create from a West European island of
affluence an all-European zone of freedom, justice and peace.''
	   John Paul arrived in Salzburg on Friday for the third visit to
Austria of his papacy. Small children greeted him, raising signs
saying, ``We are with you.''
	   The pope was interrupted by applause several times during his
homily at Mass on Friday in Salzburg's 14th-century cathedral.
Cheers became especially loud when he said he was confident that
young people ``can again put a Christian face on the old Europe.''
	   But not all young people responded enthusiastically.
	   ``The pope is old, I find it hard to identify with him,'' said
Anne Pichler, a 21-year-old psychology student.
	   The Austrian church has been shaken by dissent since the pope's
1988 visit and rocked by sexual scandal.
	   A reform movement called ``We are the Church'' gathered a
half-million signatures in Austria in 1995 and spread elsewhere in
Europe and the United States. The group wants the church to drop
its requirement that priests be celibate, allow women into the
priesthood and give greater voice to lay Catholics.
	   The pope forced Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, accused of sexually
molesting young boys, to relinquish all his duties in April. Groer
went into exile in Germany, but likely will be allowed to return
soon after the papal visit.
	   Vienna Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn said he hopes the pope's
visit will show that, despite its problems, ``the Austrian church
is not sick, that it is alive and well and full of vitality.''
	   The pope is scheduled to beatify three people, including a nun,
Sister Restituta Kafka, who was beheaded by the Nazis in 1943.
Beatification is the last formal step before possible sainthood.
	   John Paul was to return to Rome late Sunday.

World financial officials urge Japan to revive economy comments on other Asian economies 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ World finance officials meeting in Tokyo Saturday
urged Japan to revive its hobbled economy and fix its troubled
financial system _ for its own good and for the region's recovery.
	   The officials also praised China's commitment to keeping its
currency stable and commended economic and politicial reforms by
Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia.
	   Japan must restore its banks to health, achieve domestic-led
growth and throw open its markets to greater competition, finance
officials from the Group of Seven industrialized countries, 11
Asian nations and international lending institutions said in a
statement after Saturday's meetings.
	   These steps are ``of vital importance to Japan, to the recovery
of Asia, particularly those countries affected by financial market
turbulence, and to the entire world economy,'' the statement said.
	   The meeting in Tokyo is one of the broadest since Asia's
financial crisis began almost one year ago and comes just days
after dramatic intervention by the United States and Japan to stop
the yen's recent freefall against the dollar.
	   The yen's declines in recent weeks had roiled other Asian
financial markets by stirring concerns about a new wave of currency
devaluations like those that triggered the region's economic crisis
last year.
	   The focus of the talks in Tokyo was Japan's efforts to revive
its recession-bound economy, which caused the yen's plummet in the
first place.
	   ``We are very serious about structural, particularly financial,
reforms in this country,'' Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance
minister for international affairs, said after the meeting.
	   Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga promised the
gathering that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will put
together a plan to deal with the banking system's bad loan problem
when it meets June 23.
	   Earlier this week, the United States and Japan made a sudden
joint foray into world currency markets after the yen fell
Wednesday to its lowest level against the dollar in eight years.
The yen-buying action pushed the dollar down 10 yen in a mere two
days.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who was
dispatched Thursday on an emergency mission to hold talks on
Japan's economic woes and the yen's weakness, said Japanese leaders
recognized the urgency to act quickly before the effect of the
intervention fade.
	   ``They recognize that the window of opportunity is here now and
may not always be here,'' Summers said after the meeting.
	   Before the meeting, Summers and Matsunaga vowed to intervene
again in currency markets to stabilize the yen if necessary.
	   The officials praised China's role in containing Asia's
financial crisis by not devaluing its currency, the yuan, also
known as the renminbi, despite losing export market share.
	   ``China's commitment to maintain the stability of the renminbi
was welcome,'' Summers said.
	   The officials also cited Thailand and South Korea for taking
bold, painful steps to fix their financial problems, and they
welcomed Indonesia's ``renewed commitment'' to economic and
political reform.
	   The officials ``agreed that in countries most affected by the
crisis, it is important to restore confidence and growth, achieve
stability of exchange rates and contain inflation,'' the statement
said.
	   Deputy finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized
countries, finance officials from Asian nations and representatives
of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank attended Saturday's hastily called meeting.
	   The meeting was being watched closely for signs of just how
serious Japan will be in its efforts to clean up 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 563 billion) in failed loans left on the books of its banks
from the collapse of the property market after 1992.
	   Before the meeting, Japanese lawmakers said they wanted to
create a public company to take over bad loans from failed banks,
the same approach the United States used to clean up its savings
and loan debacle in the early 1990s.
	   Lawmakers have also said the country must stop coddling banks
with regulations _ even if that means letting the weaker ones go
under, they say.
	   Many fear the big test may come sooner than expected. Headlines
in Saturday morning newspapers blared that the Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd., once a mainstay of Japanese industrial policy,
lacked the strength to writeoff its 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10
billion) in failed real estate loans and was franticly searching
for a white knight.
	   Japanese leaders have also started discussing a package of tax
cuts aimed at pulling the economy out of recession.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has reportedly decided
to slash corporate taxes and announce a permanent income tax cut
before elections for the upper house of Parliament on July 12.
	   During talks Friday, Summers told Japanese officials that it is
more important for Japan to stimulate the economy than balance its
enormous budget deficit by tightening spending.

Best security won't stop determined hooligans, British police say 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES in 12-13 with English fan sentenced
By FRANCK DEMAY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ The best laid security plans cannot stop
a horde of determined hooligans from disrupting World Cup soccer,
according to British police helping prepare for Monday's match
between England and Romania.
	   ``Nobody, British or French, has said we could guarantee a
trouble-free event,'' Tim Hollis, the top British police officer
advising the French, told a news conference Friday.
	   This southwestern city, site of the match, is the focus of
attention by World Cup officials, local authorities and police on
both sides of the English Channel.
	   A barrage of measures are being put into place to try to avoid
the kind of clashes that occurred before, during and after last
Monday's match in Marseille between England and Tunisia during
which 80 people were detained.
	   Marseille authorities were also bracing for possible violence
ahead of Saturday's match between the Netherlands and South Korea,
increasing police strength.
	   But regional Prefect Jean-Paul Proust relented on a strict
alcohol ban announced earlier, under pressure from cafe and
restaurant owners. Proust agreed Thursday to allow alcohol to be
sold an hour later, until midnight, and said cafes and restaurants
could remain open until 4 a.m.
	   In Toulouse, cafes and bars were forced to close at 11 p.m.
starting Thursday and continuing through Monday, instead of the
usual 2 a.m. closing time. The nationwide music festival has been
postponed in Toulouse until July 11 and, with it, a series of other
festivities.
	   Two giant World Cup screens for ticketless fans are being
eliminated. A screen on Marseille's Prado beach was the sight of
violence during Monday's game.
	   Police strength is being increased, with the 1,300 police to be
backed by two or three 80-member units of riot police or motorized
gendarmes, police officials said.
	   ``Our plan is in place, but it is worth nothing if you have 500
guys who don't fear arrest and who want to wreck everything,'' said
British liaison officer Eddie Curtis, attached to his country's
Football Association.
	   Hollis said that 200 hooligans who rampaged in Marseille have
been identified and so-called British ``spotter'' police would be
on the lookout for them in Toulouse.
	   One of them, Carlton Maddock, was sentenced late Friday to two
months in jail. He also was banned from returning to France for a
year. Police spotted the 34-year-old from Cheshire in a bar in the
southern city of Montpellier.
	   He pleaded guilty to charges of throwing chairs and beer cans at
Marseille police.

In Alaska, falls on Mount McKinley leave injured climbers stranded have fallen; EDITS to conform. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with park service saying two more climbers
By MAUREEN CLARK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) _ Two more climbers fell into a
treacherous snow chute on the slopes of Mount McKinley early
Saturday, the third such accident on North America's highest peak
in as many days.
	   The condition of the climbers, both British, was not known after
their 1,500-foot (460 meters) fall at about 17,000 feet (5,200
meters), National Park Service spokeswoman Jane Tranel said. It was
also not clear whether the climbers were trying to come down after
an earlier accident or were climbers ascending to help.
	   The accidents began Thursday, when three British climbers fell
300 feet (90 meters) into the snow chute known as the Orient
Express. The next morning, two Americans fell nearly 3,000 feet
(900 meters) in the same chute.
	   It's not known what caused the accidents on the 20,320-foot
(6,195-meter) peak about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of
Anchorage.
	   News of Saturday morning's fall came only a few hours after a
helicopter slipped through the clouds and whisked one of the
injured Americans to safety.
	   Jeff Munroe, 25, of Anchorage was picked up at a camp at 14,000
feet (4,300 meters)late Friday and flown to the nearby town of
Kantishna. Unconscious and in critical but stable condition with a
head injury, he was taken to a hospital.
	   ``We were able to find a hole in the clouds and get the
high-altitude helicopter in,'' Tranel said.
	   Still on the mountain were the nine-member British team and the
other injured American, Billy Finley, 24, of Anchorage. He was also
at 14,000 feet (4,300 meters), with fractured ribs and ankle and
knee injuries.
	   The two Americans were brought down by rangers from 15,500 feet
(4,725 meters). They had been found by two members of the British
team, including Phil Whitfield, 23. He suffered only minor injuries
in Thursday's fall.
	   While the American was at 14,000 feet (4,300 meters), members of
the British team were much higher, at 19,000 feet (5,800 meters).
Temperatures at the summit were 20 to 30 degrees below zero (-30s
Celsius), with a wind chill of about 80 below (-60 degs. Celsius).
	   Martin Spooner, 35, had a broken ankle and Steve Brown, 26, was
unconscious with a head injury. Two other climbers were with them,
though rangers said late Friday that two men _ it was unclear who _
had started down. Three other members of the British group had been
camped at about 16,000 feet (4,875 meters) with a radio.
	   Fifteen climbers have died in falls on the Orient Express route
since 1972, Tranel said.
	   ``Its notorious for being a place where, if you fall ... you
could fall thousands of feet,'' she said. ``Basically there's
nothing to stop you, unless you self-arrest.''
	   Self-arresting is when a climber stops his or her fall with an
ice ax.
	   Both groups were roped together when they fell. The British team
was heading toward the summit when the three lost their footing
Thursday. The Americans were heading down after making it to the
top.
	   The British group was made up of members of the 1st Battalion,
Princess of Wales Royal Regiment. The group was on a
climbing-and-kayaking expedition in an effort to become the first
team to travel from the highest point in Alaska to sea level.

Best security won't stop determined hooligans, British police say news wires. 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES in 12-13 with English fan sentenced. Has also moved on
By FRANCK DEMAY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ The best laid security plans cannot stop
a horde of determined hooligans from disrupting World Cup soccer,
according to British police helping prepare for Monday's match
between England and Romania.
	   ``Nobody, British or French, has said we could guarantee a
trouble-free event,'' Tim Hollis, the top British police officer
advising the French, told a news conference Friday.
	   This southwestern city, site of the match, is the focus of
attention by World Cup officials, local authorities and police on
both sides of the English Channel.
	   A barrage of measures are being put into place to try to avoid
the kind of clashes that occurred before, during and after last
Monday's match in Marseille between England and Tunisia during
which 80 people were detained.
	   Marseille authorities were also bracing for possible violence
ahead of Saturday's match between the Netherlands and South Korea,
increasing police strength.
	   But regional Prefect Jean-Paul Proust relented on a strict
alcohol ban announced earlier, under pressure from cafe and
restaurant owners. Proust agreed Thursday to allow alcohol to be
sold an hour later, until midnight, and said cafes and restaurants
could remain open until 4 a.m.
	   In Toulouse, cafes and bars were forced to close at 11 p.m.
starting Thursday and continuing through Monday, instead of the
usual 2 a.m. closing time. The nationwide music festival has been
postponed in Toulouse until July 11 and, with it, a series of other
festivities.
	   Two giant World Cup screens for ticketless fans are being
eliminated. A screen on Marseille's Prado beach was the sight of
violence during Monday's game.
	   Police strength is being increased, with the 1,300 police to be
backed by two or three 80-member units of riot police or motorized
gendarmes, police officials said.
	   ``Our plan is in place, but it is worth nothing if you have 500
guys who don't fear arrest and who want to wreck everything,'' said
British liaison officer Eddie Curtis, attached to his country's
Football Association.
	   Hollis said that 200 hooligans who rampaged in Marseille have
been identified and so-called British ``spotter'' police would be
on the lookout for them in Toulouse.
	   One of them, Carlton Maddock, was sentenced late Friday to two
months in jail. He also was banned from returning to France for a
year. Police spotted the 34-year-old from Cheshire in a bar in the
southern city of Montpellier.
	   He pleaded guilty to charges of throwing chairs and beer cans at
Marseille police.
	   Meanwhile, the prefect of Toulouse's Haute-Garonne region, Alain
Bidou, said Friday night that a decision has been made not to
install fences inside the stadium to control hooligans.
	   British officials had argued against using fences on the grounds
they could prove dangerous should a commotion arise. The fences
themselves tend to breed enmity, the argument went. FIFA head Sepp
Blatter agreed.
	   French authorities had been considering using fences to control
any rowdiness by hooligans.
	   Stricter measures were also put in place in the French capital,
including banning alcohol consumption on the streets around Parc
des Princes stadium on match days.
	   Area bars will be ``asked to close'' on those days, the police
statement said.
	   Alcohol is also banned around the large World Cup viewing
screens built outside City Hall, near the Eiffel Tower and three
other locations, the statement said.

Tibetan leader encouraged by Clinton's upcoming China visit

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the
Dalai Lama, said Saturday he welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to Beijing next week and said he hoped it would result in the
resumption of Tibetan-Chinese talks.
	   ``President Clinton personally has shown concern and sympathy
about Tibet,'' the Dalai Lama said. ``When he visits China, the
Tibetan issue will be on the agenda. Certainly, he will urge the
Chinese government to open a dialogue with me.''
	   Clinton visits China June 25 through July 3, the first visit of
a U.S. president since the 1989 Tiananmen massacre on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing.
	   On Thursday, Clinton said that during his trip he will speak out
on religious freedom and urge Beijing to resume talks with the
Dalai Lama.
	   The Tibetan leader, on a visit to Finland, told reporters that
Clinton's Chinese tour will ``certainly be very helpful'' in
resuming talks with Beijing, but declined to speculate when they
would begin.
	   China invaded Tibet in 1950, a year after a communist takeover.
An abortive uprising in 1959 prompted the Dalai Lama to lead an
exodus to India of more than 100,000 Tibetans.
	   Further resistance to Chinese rule was virtually broken after a
series of riots in the late 1980s brought Chinese martial law.
	   The Tibetan leader was in Helsinki at the invitation of the
Museum of Art and Design, which is displaying an exhibition of
Tibetan art, partly from the Dalai Lama's own collection.
	   Sitting in front of a Tibetan drawing, the Dalai Lama giggled
and said he didn't always understand art.
	   ``But art, including painting and music, can be a very important
vehicle to carry a message of peace, love and compassion,'' he
said.
	   The 1989 Nobel peace laureate said the prize had not changed him
but had drawn attention to the Tibetan cause.
	   ``I am a simple Buddhist monk, no more no less,'' he said.

Report: 39 sickened by food poisoning after party 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Contaminated food sickened 39 people who at a hotel
reception sponsored by a medical supplies sales company, putting
three of the victims in the hospital, a news report said Saturday.
	   The victims, among 955 people at a party Wednesday in Nagashima,
325 kilometers (200 miles) southwest of Tokyo, began complaining of
vomiting and diarrhea the next day, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The report quoted local health officials. Prefectural officials
were not immediately available for comment Saturday.
	   Kyodo said it was unclear what bacterial caused the sickness or
which food was contaminated. Smoked salmon and vegetable salads
were among the dishes served at the reception.
	   Salmon roe from Japan's northern island of Hokkaido _ suspected
of sickening several people recently with the deadly O-157 strain
of E. coli bacteria _ was not served, the report said.
	   Those who were hospitalized had been discharged by Saturday,
Kyodo said.
	   In a major outbreak of the O-157 strain of E. coli in Japan two
years ago, 12 people, mostly small children and elderly people,
died and 10,000 others were sickened.

Indonesian president to meet families of slain students 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's government plans to
declare four student protesters shot dead by security forces last
month as ``heroes of reform,'' a newspaper said Saturday.
	   The paper Suara Pembaruan quoted State Secretary Akbar Tanjung
as saying President B.J. Habibie would also meet with the families
of the dead students.
	   The four were gunned down during a pro-reform rally at Jakarta's
Trisakti University on May 12.
	   Their deaths triggered a wave of rioting that killed about 1,200
and helped force former President Suharto to quit after 32 years in
power. Habibie replaced Suharto and has since promised sweeping
reforms.
	   The military has charged 18 police officers in the deaths.
	   ``The four students ... will be declared heroes of reform,''
Akbar said. The report did not say when the honor would be
bestowed.

World Cup: Saudi Arabia coach to meet with officials over his status 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   MELUN-SENART, France (AP) _ Saudi Arabia coach Carlos Alberto
Parreira said Saturday he'd heard news reports that he may be out
as the national soccer coach, but had nothing official on his
status at the World Cup.
	   ``I haven't heard anything official on it. But if the reports
are true, I'm ready for it,'' Parreira told The Associated Press at
the team's hotel, as he departed for a meeting with Saudi
officials.
	   ``I don't know why they called me but I'll find out when I get
there,'' the Brazilian said.
	   Asked who was to be blamed for Saudi Arabia's poor showing at
France 1998, he said, ``I guess the coach gets it.''
	   ``What I did for the team was to the best of my ability.''
	   Saudi Arabia lost 1-0 to Denmark and 4-0 to France in Group A.
The team plays its final first-round match against South Africa on
Wednesday.
	   Parreira wore a suit and sunglasses, in contrast to his favorite
attire of a warmup suit.
	   Before he left for the meeting at an undisclosed location, some
of the Saudi players put their arms around his shoulders, as if to
commiserate with im. The mood was subdued at the team hotel.

Turkish students launch march head scarf ban 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Some 100 pro-Islamic students began
Saturday a 450-kilometer (280 miles) march to protest a government
ban on head scarves, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   The students left Istanbul's main train station and were
expected to reach Ankara, Turkey's capital, on Tuesday.
	   The government says head scarves have become a political symbol
of a too-fervent Islam threatening Turkey's secular system. It has
called for stricter enforcement of the scarf ban in schools and
public offices.
	   A deputy of the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, Abdullatif Sener, told
the marchers that the struggle for the lifting of the ban would
continue, Anatolia reported.
	   Clashes between security forces and pro-Islamic students have
occurred often outside universities.

Watts leads in Yomiuri Open 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NISHINOMIYA, Japan (AP) _ American Brian Watts shot a
4-under-par 68 Saturday and took a one-stroke lead going into the
final round of the Yomiuri Open.
	   On Friday, rain washed out the second round of the 100 million
yen (dlrs 730,000) event. The scheduled 72-hole event was thus
reduced to 54 holes with the purse also cut by one-fourth.
	   Watts' round of five birdies and a bogey left him at a 10-under
134 total. He's seeking his first victory of the season and 11th
overall in Japan.
	   Kaname Yokoo fired a 69 for 135.
	   Another stroke back at 136 were Satoshi Higashi, who shot the
day's best round of 66, Katsumasa Miyamto and Shigeki Maruyama.
	   First-round leader Toru Suzuki, winner of last week's Sapporo
Tokyu Open, had a 72 for 137.

Kidnappers of Russian envoy make ransom demand 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The kidnappers of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya are demanding dlrs 2 million for his
release, a news agency reported Saturday.
	   It was the first time that the kidnappers made a ransom demand
for the release of Valentin Vlasov, who was abducted at gunpoint
May 1 while traveling from Grozny, the Chechen capital, to the
neighboring republic of Ingushetia.
	   Magomed Magomadov, Chechnya's deputy prosecutor general, told
the Interfax news agency that the dlrs 2 million was a ``tentative
demand'' for the release of Vlasov. He did not provide details of
who made the demand or how it was received.
	   Magomadov said that Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov had taken
personal charge for the search for Vlasov. Maskhadov told Interfax
by telephone that he was optimistic that Vlasov would eventually be
released.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions, usually for ransom, since the region's
two-year war for independence from Russia ended in 1996.
	   At least 60 people are currently held captive in Chechnya.
including two Britons, two Hungarians, a Frenchman and a Turk,
despite repeated pledges by Chechen officials to find and release
them.

Saudi Arabia fires Brazilian coach Parreira 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia has sacked Brazilian
coach Carlos Alberto Parreira after the national team's dismal
performance at the World Cup in France, the official Saudi Press
Agency reported Saturday.
	   Parreira, who led Brazil to its record fourth World Cup title in
1994, was the eighth coach to be sacked by the Saudis in less than
four years.
	   The decision was taken by the Saudi soccer federation, which met
in an extraordinary session in Paris late Friday.
	   The federation, headed by Prince Faisal bin Fahd, Saudi King
Fahd's son, discussed the performance of the national team and its
early exit from the finals, the agency said.
	   In its six-hour meeting, the federation decided to call up Saudi
coach Mohammed al-Khuraishi to take charge of the team in its last
match against South Africa on Wednesday, it said.
	   A committee was also formed to investigate the poor showing of
the players, the agency said.
	   Saudi Arabia has lost its two matches so far, the first against
Denmark 0-1 and the second against host France 0-4.
	   On the eve of the match against France, Prince Faisal
confidently told reporters that his country would win and move on
to the second round to match its performance in 1994.
	   ``The federation expresses its apology and sorrow for the
loving, loyal sports fans in the kingdom and the Arab and Muslim
world for failing to meet their hopes and expectations,'' the
agency quoted the federation as saying.
	   In 1994, Saudi Arabia became the only Gulf team to reach the
second round of the World Cup.
	   Parreira, one of the most accomplished coaches in the world,

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ World finance officials urged Japan on Saturday to
revive its hobbled economy and fix its troubled financial system _
for its own good and for the region's recovery. Japan must restore
its banking system to health, achieve domestic demand-led growth
and open and deregulate its markets, deputy finance ministers from
the Group of Seven nations and 11 Asian countries said in a
statement after Saturday's meetings. ``We want to regain trust at
home and abroad by moving quickly and decisively to clean up the
bad loans,'' Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga was quoted
by Kyodo News agency as saying before the meeting.
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Gunfire rattled through the northern
outskirts of Guinea-Bissau's capital on Saturday as the country's
breakaway army leaders held off advancing Senegalese troops near
the city's airport, rebel radio and military officials said.
Although the renegade soldiers have been cut off from the city and
their main supply of ammunition, they continued to hold the
airport, a Senegalese military commander said on condition of
anonymity. Senegal has sent at least 1,300 troops to reinforce
soldiers loyal to the government of President Joao Bernardo Vieira
in Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony on Africa's western
tip.
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president Saturday offered
to release imprisoned East Timor rebel leader Jose Xanana Gusmao in
return for world recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over the
disputed territory. In an interview with Australian journalists in
Jakarta, President B.J. Habibie said he would also withdraw
thousands of Indonesian troops from, and grant special status to,
the former Portuguese colony. Details of the offer were presented
privately to United Nations officials on this week by Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and
annexed it a year later. The half island territory has endured
hit-and-run warfare and human rights abuses since then.
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton should remember the
blood spilled in the crackdown on democracy protests nine years ago
when he reviews Chinese troops during a welcoming ceremony at
Tiananmen Square, 71 dissidents said in a letter released Saturday.
Clinton does not plan to meet with dissidents during his visit next
week. The U.S. government was concerned that if Clinton visited
dissidents, the Chinese government might harass them after he
leaves. Clinton's visit next week will be the first by a U.S.
president since the 1989 crackdown that ended the democracy
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. Hundreds, perhaps thousands,
were killed.
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The leader of Cambodia's main
opposition party, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said Saturday he will
not join a boycott of upcoming elections despite concerns they will
not be free or fair. He warned of an increase in violence as the
July 26 election date nears. There have been several new reports of
politically-motivated killings of opposition members in the
provinces in the past week. Instead of boycotting or calling for a
postponement of the elections, he said pressure should be exerted
on Cambodian leader Hun Sen to ensure the polls will be as free and
fair as possible. Opposition politician Sam Rainsy has announced
that his party is withdrawing from the election campaign because it
failed to meet minimal conditions for fairness.

Floods swell across Romania, one man dies in shelter collapse 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Heavy floods across northern Romania
have claimed a first victim, a man crushed by a load of sand after
he took shelter from torrential rain, the news agency Mediafax said
Saturday.
	   Heavy rain has fallen for a week in some parts of Transylvania,
where soldiers waded deep into floodwaters to rescue inhabitants,
build dikes and hand out food, Mediafax said.
	   Mures county in northwestern Romania was declared an emergency
zone, with 6,000 hectares (14,800 acres) of arable land and more
than 2,000 farms under water. More than 1,000 people have been
evacuated.
	   The first victim, a 47-year-old man, died Friday in a village in
northeast Romania, when a load of sand crushed his shelter,
Mediafax said. Four friends with him were treated for minor
injuries.
	   In Romania's northeast, a poor and isolated region, thousands of
hectares (acres) of crops, farms, bridges, railway lines and roads
were cut off by flooding, news agencies reported.

Eritreans remember war dead; vow, if need be, to fight Ethiopia again

<TEXT>
	   WAKE DUBA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritreans, bearing flags that snapped
in hot blasts of wind, Saturday remembered those killed in a
30-year war for independence from Ethiopia as they again faced the
same enemy in a border conflict.
	   Diplomatic efforts have failed to resolve the 6-week dispute
that has spread to three fronts and jeopardizes the stability of
the Horn of Africa.
	   Fighting, which broke out May 6, has ebbed since June 11.
	   At dawn on Martyrs' Day, thousands of people carrying wilting
flowers walked 6 kilometers (4 miles) from the capital Asmara north
to Wake Duba to remember 130 civilians slaughtered 23 years ago by
Ethiopian troops.
	   Crouched on a rocky, thorn-covered hill, they listened to
patriotic speeches and songs paying tribute to the dead and vowed
to send even children to the front to protect their hard-won
freedom.
	   ``We have learned from experience that we must fight for our
freedom,'' said Paulos Menghistu, 53, whose parents were killed in
Wake Duba.
	   ``Even the children are ready to fight against the Ethiopians,
because they remember their family members who sacrified their
lives for independence.''
	   At a candlelight memorial service Friday night, Regional
Administrator Weldemicael Gebremariam told a crowd of thousands,
``This year's Martyrs' Day is special because Eritrea is in
conflict again with the same enemy and will ask for your lives.''
	   It is the horrors of three decades of war, little noticed by the
outside world, that have hardened Eritreans' resolve.
	   About 65,000 Eritreans died in the fight for independence. It
ended in 1991 after Eritrean rebels helped Ethiopian rebels oust
the Marxist dictatorship of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam.
	   Eritreans voted overwhelmingly for independence in a 1993
referendum backed by Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
	   On Friday, Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, a comrade-in-arms
of Meles in the struggle, urged the two nations to ``put our
alliance back in place so that we contribute to each other's
stability and to the stability of the region.''
	   Recalling the slaughter in Waka Duba, priest Mathew Eyasu said
Ethiopian troops surrounded the village where three weddings were
being celebrated on Feb. 1, 1975.
	   While enemy soldiers killed 30 people in their homes, others
sought refuge in St. Mary's Debre Kuscum Church, he said. But the
Ethiopians came and ordered the Eritreans outside, stripped them
naked, then shot or knifed them one-by-one until the death toll
reached 100 men, women and children.
	   Paulos' parents were among those killed.
	   ``On this day, I am really happy we found peace and freedom.
When everyone died in our village we were in tears, even
fightened,'' he said.

Estrada says his government will pursue cases against Marcos 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada said
Saturday his government will pursue cases against the bank accounts
of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   ``It doesn't mean that just because he is buried, so are the
cases against him,'' Estrada said.
	   The government is claiming more than dlrs 500 million in Marcos'
Swiss bank accounts, which he allegedly illegally amassed during
his 20-year administration.
	   His government has also been accused of torturing and murdering
political dissidents.
	   Marcos' widow, Imelda, has been convicted for graft and
sentenced to 12 years in prison and is free on bail pending her
final Supreme Court appeal.
	   Estrada said he will give a government agency in charge of
recovering Marcos' alleged ill-gotten wealth one year after he
takes office to complete its work.
	   Estrada, the current vice president, will take office on June 30
when President Fidel Ramos ends his six-year term.
	   He stirred a controversy that pitted pro- and anti-Marcos forces
when he decided to allow Marcos' remains to be buried at the
Heroes' Cemetery.
	   Opponents say Marcos, who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 three
years after he was toppled in a ``people power'' revolt, would
``desecrate'' the burial ground.
	   Marcos was found liable for numerous human rights abuses by a
Hawaii court and his estate was ordered to pay dlrs 2 billion to
9,539 Filipinos who suffered under his strongman rule. No payment
has yet been made.
	   Former President Corazon Aquino, who was swept into power by the
1986 revolt, said Marcos does not deserve to be buried in the
cemetery because ``he is not a hero.''
	   Human rights lawyer Rene Saguisag said his wife's family has
decided to remove the remains of her father, a World War II
veteran, from the cemetery if Estrada insists on burying Marcos
there.
	   Marcos' supporters say he should be allowed to be buried there
because he was a decorated veteran who fought during World War II.
	   Estrada, who was close to the Marcos family when he served as a
suburban mayor in the 1970s through the 1980s, said burying Marcos
would end the bitter conflict between Marcos' supporters and
opponents.
	   He also said the former president will not be given state honors
during the funeral, set for July 11.
	   Both Mrs. Aquino and Ramos refused to allow Marcos to be buried
a Heroes' Cemetery partly because of possible clashes between
Marcos loyalists and opponents.
	   His body was not allowed back in the Philippines until 1993,
when it was flown to his hometown of Batac in northern Ilocos Norte
province and placed in a glass casket inside an air-conditioned
crypt.

Saudi Arabia fires Brazilian coach Parreira 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia has sacked Brazilian
coach Carlos Alberto Parreira after the national team's dismal
performance at the World Cup in France, the official Saudi Press
Agency reported Saturday.
	   Parreira, who led Brazil to its record fourth World Cup title in
1994, was the eighth coach to be sacked by the Saudis in less than
four years.
	   The decision was taken by the Saudi soccer federation, which met
in an extraordinary session in Paris late Friday.
	   The federation, headed by Prince Faisal bin Fahd, Saudi King
Fahd's son, discussed the performance of the national team and its
early exit from the finals, the agency said.
	   In its six-hour meeting, the federation decided to call up Saudi
coach Mohammed al-Khuraishi to take charge of the team in its last
match against South Africa on Wednesday, it said.
	   A committee was also formed to investigate the poor showing of
the players, the agency said.
	   Saudi Arabia has lost its two matches so far, the first against
Denmark 0-1 and the second against host France 0-4.
	   On the eve of the match against France, Prince Faisal
confidently told reporters that his country would win and move on
to the second round to match its performance in 1994.
	   ``The federation expresses its apology and sorrow for the
loving, loyal sports fans in the kingdom and the Arab and Muslim
world for failing to meet their hopes and expectations,'' the
agency quoted the federation as saying.
	   In 1994, Saudi Arabia became the only Gulf team to reach the
second round of the World Cup.
	   Parreira, one of the most accomplished coaches in the world,
signed a one-year contract with the Saudi federation in December
for a reported dlrs 3 million.
	   Parreira led Kuwait in 1982 and the United Arab Emirates in 1990
to the World Cup finals. Saudi Arabia won the Asian Cup in 1988
under him.

Australia beats Scotland 33-11 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY HARPER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's superior backline set up
a 33-11 victory over a spirited Scotland team to clinch their rugby
union series 2-0 at Ballymore on Saturday.
	   A dour match, pinned down under the heavy hand of English
referee Brian Campsall, was illuminated rarely but when the Wallaby
backs lit up they made the breaks count.
	   Fly-half Stephen Larkham started one try and finished off
another in the Wallabies' three tries to one win which gave it
three from three to start the season.
	   ``We made too many mistakes and if we make that many in the
tri-nations series we're no chance,'' said a downbeat Australian
captain John Eales, looking ahead to the series against New Zealand
and South Africa.
	   Scotland changed its game plan from the open running style it
used in the record 45-3 loss in the first test last week and was a
much tougher opponent for it.
	   But while the visitors tackled strongly they were sadly lacking
in attacking options and, with eight minutes to play and Australia
20 points ahead, the Scots made an embarrassing admission of defeat
when they opted to take a penalty shot at goal instead of running
the ball.
	   Replacement Duncan Hodge missed the kick but then scored the
first try to be conceded by Australia this season when he crossed
four minutes from the end.
	   ``We made too many mistakes in attack,'' said Scotland captain
Rob Wainwright. ``We have still failed to express ourselves in
attack on this tour and that disappoints me.''
	   Australia opened the scoring on six minutes with a stunning
backline try. Larkham chipped over the defensive line off his
weaker left foot and winger Joe Roff claimed it on the full,
sending the ball through Daniel Herbert and Matthew Burke before
Ben Tune finished off the 60 meter move with a try in the corner.
	   Burke missed the conversion and Scotland winger Derrick Lee cut
the margin to two points with a penalty goal in the ninth minute.
	   Lee had two chances to put the Scots ahead with penalty shots
which he pushed wide.
	   Burke kicked a penalty and Lee matched it before the home side
finished off the half with a try to Larkham. Larkham's refusal to
pass cost Tune a second try minutes before the break but he atoned
when he went across after an inside pass from center Tim Horan.
	   Lee missed his third penalty from five attempts in the first
minute after halftime and then Burke banged one through three
minutes later as the Wallabies pulled out to a 16-6 lead.
	   Burke kicked a third penalty and Australia continued to shade
its opponents on the rare occasions Campsall allowed play to flow.
	   Tune went through several defenders in midfield to put Australia
in a good position and two plays later he spilled a ball with the
line open after a strong angled run from scrum half George Gregan.
	   Gregan persisted, and set up the Wallabies' third try on 60
minutes, flipping a short pass inside to replacement forward Willie
Ofahenguae, who carried two defenders across the line.
	   Australian center Jason Little came on as a second half
replacement to win his 50th test cap while Nathan Grey crossed
minutes from the end for a try on debut.
	   Scorers: Australia 33 (Ben Tune, Stephen Larkham, Willie
Ofahengaue, Nathan Grey tries, Matthew Burke 2 goals, 3 penalty
goals) def. Scotland 11 (Duncan Hodge try, Derrick Lee 2 penalty
goals).
	   Lineups:
	   Australia: Matthew Burke, Ben Tune, Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan,
Joe Roff, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu, David
Wilson, Matt Cockbain, John Eales (captain), Tom Bowman, Andrew
Blades, Phil Kearns, Richard Harry. Reserves: Chris Whitaker,
Nathan Grey, Jason Little, Willie Ofahengaue, Owen Finegan, Dan
Crowley, Jeremy Paul.
	   Scotland: Glenn Metcalfe, Derrick Lee, Cameron Murray, Rowen
Shepherd, Shaun Longstaff, Gregor Townsend, Bryan Redpath, Eric
Peters, Gordon Simpson, Rob Wainwright (captain), Stuart Grimes,
Scott Murray, Matthew Proudfoot, Kevin McKenzie, David Hilton.
Reserves: Craig Joiner, Duncan Hodge, Graeme Burns, Adam Roxburgh,
Stewart Campbell, Gordon McIlwham, Steven Brotherstone.

Dutch economic affairs minister leaving politics 
</HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM J. KOLE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Popular Economic Affairs Minister
Hans Wijers, whose party took a beating in national elections last
month, is leaving politics, Dutch media reported Saturday.
	   Wijers opted not to return to the new government being formed
after the May 6 elections that decimated his Democrats 66. The
centrist party, a junior member of the Netherlands' governing
coalition, lost 10 of its 24 seats in parliament's 150-seat lower
house.
	   The blow made it unlikely that Wijers would have had enough to
clout to continue on as finance minister. There was no immediate
word on a possible successor.
	   ``Making this decision was like holding a gun to my chest. It
wasn't easy,'' he told the daily De Volkskrant, adding that his
immediate plans were uncertain.
	   Wijers, 47, is best known for the turbulence he encountered in
staking out a tough government position against Fokker NV, the
debt-ridden Dutch aircraft maker that eventually ended up filing
for bankruptcy and laying off 5,600 workers.
	   Leaders of Prime Minister Wim Kok's left-of-center Labor Party
and the right-leaning Liberal Party _ the two big winners in last
month's elections _ have been meeting with D66 leaders to reshape
the coalition.
	   The current Labor-led coalition has been praised across Europe
for the Netherlands' robust economy and its jobless rate of 4.6
percent, a rate less than half that of neighboring Germany.
	   This week, the Dutch government statistics agency said the
number of people out of work dropped to an unadjusted 289,000 _ the
first time the number of jobless has dropped below 300,000 since
June 1981.
	   Dutch newspapers reported this week that a new government likely
would be in place by mid-July, just in time for Queen Beatrix's
annual address to parliament. It typically takes months to form a
new government in the Netherlands; in 1977, it took more than 200
days to accomplish.
	   Coalition governments have ruled for the past 80 years in the
Netherlands, where there are a dozen sizable parties, none of which
has been able to garner enough votes to take control outright.
	   Wijers' announcement is the latest blow to D66. Last month,
Justice Minister Winnie Sorgdrager, a D66 leader, said she would
not return to the new Cabinet.
	   It remained uncertain whether Health Minister Els Borst or
Foreign Affairs Minister Hans van Mierlo, both from the D66 party,
would be part of the next government, and if so, what part they
might play.

Clashes in southeastern Turkey kill 27

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Clashes in southeastern Turkey have left
dead 18 Kurdish rebels and nine Turkish soldiers and pro-government
village guards, news reports said Saturday.
	   Turkish soldiers killed 18 members of the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers Party during fighting in the province of Siirt Thursday,
the daily Hurriyet reported.
	   Also on Thursday, some 30 rebels launched a rocket attack on a
village in the far eastern province of Hakkari, killing a
lieutenant, four soldiers and four pro-government village guards,
the report said.
	   Turkish authorities gave other figures in a statement Saturday.
They said that 26 rebels had been killed in the two provinces. The
statement did not confirm the deaths of the security forces
members.
	   The rebels have been fighting for an autonomous Kurdish region
in the southeast since 1984. An estimated 37,000 people have been
killed in the conflict.

Other nations urge Cambodian parties not to boycott election

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Cambodia's neighbors and other
countries said Saturday that Phnom Penh's upcoming elections will
not be perfect, but they urged all parties to take part for the
sake of democracy.
	   The Friends of Cambodia _ a group of Western and Asian countries
seeking an end to the country's unrest_ met to review whether the
July 26 election can be free and fair.
	   Critics of the election preparations say that Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen has used killings, intimidation and control of
the state machinery to ensure a victory for his Cambodian People's
Party.
	   Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in a
coup d'etat a year ago, shattering a tense dual premiership formed
after U.N.-brokered elections in 1993.
	   Prominent opposition politician Sam Rainsy on Friday announced
he was pulling his party out of the election because minimal
conditions to ensure fairness were not in place. The main
opposition party, FUNCINPEC, did not join in his boycott, however.
	   ``If you want to have a second-class election for a third-world
country like Cambodia, yes, you can pretend that we will have an
election,'' Sam Rainsy said Saturday.
	   He challenged the international community to withdraw its
support for the election process if Hun Sen did not improve
conditions.
	   Sam Rainsy said the failure of the Friends of Cambodia and
Southeast Asian nations to tackle the election shortcomings was a
``comedy that will lead to a tragedy for Cambodia.''
	   A communique issued by the Friends of Cambodia said the group
``looked forward to seeing the elections take place and in
conditions that allow the Cambodian people to choose freely their
next government.''
	   In encouraging the government to take certain steps to promote
``a climate conducive to the holding of free, fair and credible
election,'' the statement implicitly recognized most of the
criticisms made by the opposition.
	   Opposition complaints have focused on their lack of access to
media, and the use of violence and intimidation towards voters and
party workers.
	   At a post-meeting news conference, the Philippine foreign
minister strongly urged all Cambodian political parties not to
boycott the election as it would jeopardize democracy in the
troubled-plagued country.
	   ``A boycott will only strengthen the one who is in power now,''
said Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon. ''You have to play. It's
game time. This is not for the weak of heart. This is the price for
liberty and democracy,''
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said progress towards a
reasonably free and fair election is in place, although more
improvements are needed.
	   ``What we are concerned with is the entire structure, not just
one particularly person or party,'' said Surin, referring to Sam
Rainsy's criticisms.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czechs soundly backed the
center-left Social Democrats in early parliamentary elections,
according to an early exit poll released Saturday.
	   The poll showed the center-left Social Democrats, led by Milos
Zeman, leading the race with 32 percent, but far short of winning a
parliamentary majority, Czech television said.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus was second with 26 percent of the vote, according to the poll
conducted by the Austrian IFES institute.
	   Five other parties were shown as clearing the 5 percent
threshold needed for parliamentary representation, but trailed the
leaders by a large margin.
	   The poll confirmed earlier indications Social Democrats could
have a chance to form a center-left coalition government for the
first time since the anti-Communist revolution in 1989.

	   Voting for all 200 seats in the lower house of parliament, which
will form a new government, began Friday and continued Saturday
with polls closing at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT). The country has 8.09
million eligible voters.
	   The elections come two years early, following the collapse of
Klaus' center-right coalition last winter. A caretaker government
under banker Josef Tosovsky has been running the country.
	   IFES polled 15,000 voters in over 240 election precincts with a
2 percent margin of error, officials said. First official results
were expected around 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).
	   Despite the expected victory, Zeman lacks clear majority and
will have to go through painful negotiations to form a government
coalition.
	   His potential partners are the small Christian Democrats, the
Freedom Union _ a new party favored by President Vaclav Havel _ and
the populist Pensioners for Secure Living, if they clear the 5
percent threshold.
	   The Social Democrats say ideally, they would form a coalition
with the centrist Christian Democrats who, in turn, suggest taking
on the Freedom Union.
	   But if the Freedom Union refuses to cooperate, the Social
Democrats could be forced to try and make a coalition with the
Pensioners and tacit support from the Communists.
	   Coalition negotiations are expected to follow the vote, with
Havel playing a key role. Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek told
state radio talks might begin as early as Monday.

Synagogue plundered, possible mass Jewish grave found 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thieves plundered a synagogue in the
northwestern city of Oradea, smashing benches and window panes and
stealing 14 candelabras of great sentimental value to the small
local Jewish community, reports said Saturday.
	   In southern Romania, another small Jewish community asked local
authorities in the city of Ploiesti to investigate what it said was
a suspected mass grave of 40 Jews buried near the city railway
station in 1941 after dying while being deported from the
northeastern city of Iasi.
	   During World War II, Romania was a Nazi ally. After King Carol
fled the country, the fascist Iron Guards of Marshal Ion Antonescu
ruled, launching some of Europe's most fearsome pogroms on 800,000
Jews then living in Romania.
	   Those who survived emigrated en masse during the decades of
Communist rule to Israel, leaving only 14,000 mostly elderly Jews
in Romania today. A few hundred Romanian Jews have returned from
Israel since communism fell in 1989 to do business.
	   Teodor Koppleman, former head of the Jewish community in Oradea,
450 kilometers (280 miles) northwest of Bucharest, told the
Mediafax news agency it was the second time since World War II that
the synagogue plundered sometime last week had been robbed. The
break-in was discovered Friday morning, and police are
investigating, he said.
	   In World War II, tens of thousands of Jews in northwest Romania
were deported to concentration camps in regions controlled by
Hungary. Most Jews died.
	   There are 29 synagogues in Oradea, but only two are in use.

<TEXT>
	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Julie Halard of France won the dlrs
27,000 first prize in the WTA Heineken Trophy grass court final
here Saturday, easing past Dutchwoman Miriam Oremans in straight
sets 6-3, 6-4.
	   Both unseeded players looked sluggish because of their marathon
matches on Friday to reach the final.
	   With a shaky start, an inconsistent Oremans found herself
trailing 2-5 at one point, eventually losing the first set, 3-6.
	   In the second set, Oremans won the first two games quickly and
easily, but lost her stamina and struggled to find consistency,
allowing the 27-year-old Halard to win the set and match.
	   Oremans was also the losing finalist here last year.
	   With this rain-plagued Wimbledon warm-up tourney back on
schedule, Australian top seed Patrick Rafter was scheduled to face
Dutchman Dennis van Scheppingen in the men's semifinals later
Saturday.
	   And the other final place will go to the winner of the match
between Czech Martin Damm and Dutch seventh seed Jan Siemerink.

Police fire in air as protests in Yemen continue 
</HEADLINE>
By AHMED AL-HAJ
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Hundreds of riot police and soldiers fired
into the air Saturday in clashes with thousands of Yemenis
protesting a 40 percent hike in fuel prices.
	   The demonstrators took to the streets for the second day,
throwing rocks at police cars, smashing billboards and shouting
chants against the government, a security official said.
	   Most shops remained closed in the capital San`a. Protesters
burned tires in the city's main streets and used rocks to close
vital roads, the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Baton-wielding police chased demonstrators in streets and fired
tear gas, but there were no reports of casualties.
	   The protesters chanted against Prime Minister Abdul Karim
al-Iryani, who came to power last month.
	   ``Iryani you fool, you raised the price of fuel,'' shouted a
crowd gathered in front of the parliament building.
	   The demonstrators called on the government to reverse its
decision, announced Thursday and implemented Friday, to raise the
prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas by about 40 percent.
	   The hikes were in line with requirements of the International
Monetary Fund to remove subsidies on petroleum products and other
commodities like flour and sugar by the end of 1998.
	   On Thursday, the state-run Yemen Oil Company said 1 gallon (3.8
liters) of gasoline would cost 133 riyals (dlrs 1), up from 95
riyals (69 cents) and 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of kerosene would sell
for 57 riyals (41.8 cents), up from 42 riyals (30 cents).
	   Cooking gas bottles would cost 200 riyals (dlrs 1.5), up from
150 riyals (dlrs 1.1), the company said.
	   The new hikes follow a decision by the government to raise the
price of petroleum products by 25 percent in July 1997.
	   The monthly salaries of civil servants range between 1,880
riyals (dlrs 142) and 26,500 riyals (dlrs 200).
	   The increase in oil prices was scheduled for January, but was
never carried out because of conflicts over political and economic
policies between former Prime Minister Faraj Bin Ghanem and
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the real power in this poor country.
	   Bin Ghanem, who spent less than a year in office, was replaced
by Abdel-Karim al-Iryani in May.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.
	   To help Yemen recover from the effects of the 1994 civil war,
the World Bank has approved a dlrs 80 million credit to support its
economic reform program.
	   Yemen produces 380,000 barrels of oil a day, earning 31 billion
riyals (dlrs 235 million) a year from exports.

European Union ambassadors to leave Belarus 
</HEADLINE>
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The ambassadors of the European Union are
returning home Monday for consultations with their governments on
the Belarusian government's attempt to evict them from a diplomatic
compound.
	   The ambassadors of Britain, France, Greece, Italy and Germany on
Saturday went to the Foreign Ministry and delivered a note to the
head of protocol saying they were leaving Belarus on Monday.
	   ``We have just delivered a note to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs on behalf of the countries of the EU represented in Minsk
to inform the ministry that the ambassadors will leave on Monday
afternoon,'' British ambassador Jessica Mary Pearce said.
	   The Belarusian government has been trying to force ambassadors
out of their homes in a diplomatic compound on the outskirts of the
capital Minsk, claiming the residences are badly in need of sewer
and plumbing repairs.
	   Pearce said the ambassadors were returning home ``for
consultations'' in protest over the attempts to evict them from
their homes.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said in Moscow on
Saturday that Russia has no immediate plans to recall its
ambassador because of the dispute.
	   ``Our Belarusian friends are not acting via diplomatic means,''
Primakov told the Zerkalo television program. He said he hoped
``this misunderstanding will all be sorted out somehow, but not at
the expense of recalling all the ambassadors.''
	   On Friday, the Belarusian government cut water and power
supplies to the compound to force the ambassadors out.
	   Workers also dug a ditch immediately inside the compound's
gates, preventing ambassadors' cars from entering. Diplomats were
given temporary IDs valid until the end of the year to enter their
residences.
	   The ambassadors have protested that the order for them to leave
their residences violates the Vienna Convention which designates
ambassadors' homes as territory of their countries.
	   President Alexander Lukashenko claims the diplomatic residences
are his own property. He has a residence adjacent to the compound.
	   The government has offered the ambassadors new apartments in
downtown Minsk, cottages 30 kilometers (20 miles) outside Minsk or
plots on which to build new residences.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The opposition center-left Social
Democrats were leading early elections with 32 percent, according
to an early exit poll released Saturday by Czech television _ still
far short of winning a parliamentary majority.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus was second with 26 percent of the vote, according to the poll
conducted by the Austrian IFES institute.
	   Five other parties were shown as clearing the 5 percent
threshold needed for parliamentary representation, but trailed the
leaders by a large margin.
	   The poll confirmed earlier indications Social Democrats could
have a chance to form a center-left coalition government for the
first time since the anti-Communist revolution in 1989.
	   Voting for all 200 seats in the lower house of parliament, which
will form a new government, began Friday and continued Saturday.
The country has 8.09 million eligible voters.
	   The elections come two years early, following the collapse of
Klaus' center-right coalition last winter. A caretaker government
under banker Josef Tosovsky has been running the country.
	   IFES polled 15,000 voters in over 240 election precincts with a
2 percent margin of error, officials said. First official results
were expected around 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).
	   Despite the expected victory, Zeman lacks a clear majority and
will have to go through painful negotiations to form a government
coalition.
	   His potential partners are the small Christian Democrats, the
Freedom Union _ a new party favored by President Vaclav Havel _ and
the populist Pensioners for Secure Living, if they clear the 5
percent threshold.
	   But if the Freedom Union refuses to cooperate, the Social
Democrats could be forced to try and make a coalition with the
Pensioners and tacit support from the Communists.
	   Coalition negotiations are expected to follow the vote, with
Havel playing a key role.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czechs backed the center-left
Social Democrats in early parliamentary elections, according to an
early exit poll released Saturday.
	   The poll showed the center-left Social Democrats, led by Milos
Zeman, leading the race with 32 percent, but far short of winning a
parliamentary majority, Czech television said.
	   ``I'm glad we cleared the 30 percent threshold,'' Zeman said.
``I am skeptical when it comes to forecasting, but we can still do
well.''
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus was second with 26 percent of the vote, according to the poll
conducted by the Austrian IFES institute. Klaus was not available
to comment on results.
	   Four other parties were shown as clearing the 5 percent
threshold needed for parliamentary representation, but trailed the
leaders by a large margin.
	   The poll confirmed earlier indications that the Social Democrats
could have a chance to form a center-left coalition government for
the first time since the anti-Communist revolution in 1989.
	   Despite the Social Democrat lead, Jacques Rupnik, a Czech-born
political analyst, told Czech television that the exit poll
indicated voting patterns haven't changed drastically since the
last parliamentary election in 1996.
	   That election ended with Klaus, who won big in 1992, falling
just short of a majority, and forming a quarrelsome three-party
center-right coalition that lacked the unity and parliamentary
strength to undertake major reform. It fell apart last winter over
a party financing scandal.
	   Voting for all 200 seats in the lower house of parliament, which
will form a new government, began Friday and continued Saturday
with polls closing at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT). The country has 8.09
million eligible voters.
	   The elections came two years early. A caretaker government under
banker Josef Tosovsky has been running the country since Klaus'
ouster last December.
	   IFES polled 15,000 voters in over 240 election precincts with a
2 percent margin of error, officials said. First official results
were expected around 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).
	   Despite the expected victory, Zeman lacks a clear majority and
will have to go through painful negotiations to form a government
coalition.
	   His potential partners are the small Christian Democrats, the
Freedom Union _ a new party favored by President Vaclav Havel _ and
the populist Pensioners for Secure Living, if they clear the 5
percent threshold.
	   The exit poll suggested the populist pensioners' party had not
made the cut. The Communists, Christian Democrats, Freedom Union
and extremist Republicans did, according to the IFES poll.
	   The Social Democrats say ideally, they would form a coalition
with the centrist Christian Democrats who, in turn, suggest taking
on the Freedom Union.
	   Coalition negotiations are expected to follow the vote, with
Havel playing a key role. Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek told
state radio talks might begin as early as Monday.
	   TV showed Havel, like many Czechs, tuning in for the first exit
poll, but he made no immediate comment.

World financial officials urge Japan to revive economy 
</HEADLINE>

By MARTIN FACKLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ World finance officials urged Japan on Saturday to
take bold measures to fix its economy and halt turbulence in
currency markets threatening to throw Asia's economies back into a
tailspin.
	   The officials also praised China's role in containing the
region's financial turmoil by refusing to devaluate its currency,
and they commended economic and politicial reforms by Indonesia and
other Asian countries.
	   In a statement after the meeting, finance officials from the
Group of Seven industrialized countries, 11 Asian nations and
international lending institutions called on Japan to restore the
health of its banking system, achieve domestic-led growth and throw
open its markets to greater competition.
	   These steps are ``of vital importance to Japan, to the recovery
of Asia, particularly those countries affected by financial market
turbulence, and to the entire world economy,'' the statement said.
	   The meeting in Tokyo is one of the broadest since Asia's
financial crisis began almost one year ago and comes just days
after dramatic intervention by the United States and Japan to stop
the yen's recent freefall against the dollar.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto also has political
reasons taking bold action. With his nation in its deepest
recession since World War II, opinion polls show his government
going into July 12 upper house elections with its popularity at an
all-time low. He needs to show he's capable of handling his
country's economic problems.
	   The yen's declines in recent weeks had roiled other Asian
financial markets by stirring concerns about a new wave of currency
devaluations like those that triggered the region's economic crisis
last year.
	   The focus of the talks in Tokyo was Japan's efforts to revive
its recession-bound economy, which caused the yen's plummet in the
first place.
	   Speaking after the meeting, officials said they welcomed recent
promises by Japanese lawmakers to take more aggressive steps in
dealing with the banking industry's bad loans problem and reviving
growth with cuts in corporate and income taxes.
	   ``We think that all these measures are important to get the
Japanese economy back on the right track,'' said China's assistant
minister of finance, Jin Liqun.
	   Earlier this week, the United States and Japan made a sudden
joint foray into world currency markets after the yen fell
Wednesday to its lowest level against the dollar in eight years.
The yen-buying action pushed the dollar down 10 yen in a mere two
days.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who was
dispatched Thursday on an emergency mission to hold talks on
Japan's economic woes and the yen's weakness, said Japanese leaders
recognized the urgency to act quickly before the effect of the
intervention fade.
	   ``They recognize that the window of opportunity is here now and
may not always be here,'' Summers said after the meeting.
	   The officials praised China for not devaluing its currency, the
yuan, also known as the renminbi, even as declines by the Japanese
yen and other Asian currencies made its exports less competitive.
	   ``China's commitment to maintain the stability of the renminbi
was welcome,'' Summers said.
	   The officials also cited Thailand and South Korea for taking
bold, painful steps to fix their financial problems, and they
welcomed Indonesia's ``renewed commitment'' to economic and
political reform.
	   The officials ``agreed that in countries most affected by the
crisis, it is important to restore confidence and growth, achieve
stability of exchange rates and contain inflation,'' the statement
said.
	   Deputy finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized
countries, finance officials from Asian nations and representatives
of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank attended Saturday's hastily called meeting.
	   The meeting was being watched closely for signs of just how
serious Japan will be in its efforts to clean up 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 563 billion) in failed loans left on the books of its banks
from the collapse of the property market after 1992.
	   Before the meeting, Japanese lawmakers said they wanted to
create a public company to take over bad loans from failed banks,
the same approach the United States used to clean up its savings
and loan debacle in the early 1990s.

Draft communique calls for immediate cease-fire 
</HEADLINE>
By SUKHDEV CHHATBAR
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ After five days of closed-door meetings,
participants in the first all-party peace talks on Burundi Saturday
recommended an immediate cease-fire between the Tutsi-led army and
Hutu rebels as a first step to ending the conflict that has taken
the lives of at least 200,000 people.
	   A five-point draft communique to be presented later Saturday for
approval by a plenary session also calls for a cessation of
hostilities during negotiations to be conducted by an unnamed peace
facilitator and mediator Julius Nyerere, a former Tanzanian
president.
	   Among other proposals are:
	   _ a month's break in the talks and a second round to begin July
20;
	   _ adoption of a negotiating program;
	   _ formation of five committees to deal with different aspects of
implementing an eventual peace agreement.
	   On Friday, one of the three rebel groups opposing the government
of Maj. Pierre Buyoya said the National Council for the Defense of
Democracy (CNDD) would ``continue the war'' if the talks failed.
	   ``If the talks fail through the fault of the military junta in
Bujumbura (the Burundian capital), the CNDD will continue the
war,'' said the group's leader Leonard Nyamgoma.
	   He had earlier rejected Nyerere's request for a cease-fire
before the talks, a Nairobi weekly newspaper, The East African,
reported Monday.
	   After a 10-month stalemate, Nyerere, who has a mandate from the
Organization of African Unity to mediate the conflict, managed to
get all the parties together.
	   The talks are attended by Burundi's five main political groups,
three rebel groups and civic and religious organizations.
	   Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said the talks represented
``a historic chance'' for Burundi to end violence that has
periodically erupted in the tiny central African country since
Burundi's independence from Belgium in 1962.
	   At least 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed
since the latest round of bloodletting began in October 1993 when
Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu and the
country's first democratically elected president.
	   Buyoya, a Tutsi and former army major who ousted a civilian
president in a second coup in July 1996, said he is determined to
enact reforms aimed at ending the violence.
	   The reforms he initiated after ousting Bagaza led to the
country's first democratic elections in 1993.
	   Last week Buyoya named a 22-member cabinet, which includes 12
Hutus. He also named two vice-presidents, one of them a Hutu.
	   Although they make only 14 percent of Burundi's population of 6
million, the Tutsi dominate the government, economy, academia and
the military. Hutus make up all but 1 percent of the remainder.
	   Buyoya hopes the new political arrangement will this time
convince regional leaders to lift sanctions they imposed after he
staged the coup.
	   The draft communique made no mention of the sanctions.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The opposition center-left Social
Democrats were leading early elections with 32 percent, according
to an early exit poll released Saturday by Czech television _ still
far short of winning a parliamentary majority.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus was second with 26 percent of the vote, according to the poll
conducted by the Austrian IFES institute.
	   ``I'm glad we cleared the 30 percent threshold,'' Social
Democrats leader Milos Zeman said. ``I am skeptical when it comes
to forecasting, but we can still do well.''
	   Four other parties were shown as clearing the 5 percent
threshold needed for parliamentary representation, but trailed the
leaders by a large margin.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt will cut its oil production by 20,000
barrels a day to help bolster sagging international oil prices, Oil
Minister Hamdi el-Banbi said Saturday.
	   The cutback, meant to supplement similar efforts by members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, will become
effective on July 1, el-Banbi said.
	   ``This is an Egyptian participation to achieve price stability
in the international market,'' he was quoted as saying by the
official Middle East News Agency.
	   Egypt, which is not in OPEC, produces 850,000 barrels a day.
	   Prices have plunged in the last few months because of
overproduction by the world's major exporting nations, leaving
ample supplies in the market and forcing prices down.
	   Oil prices fell to dlrs 10 dollars per barrel last week, the
lowest since 1986.
	   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, two OPEC heavyweights, are promising
a new round of production cutbacks _ after an earlier emergency
deal failed to rescue the market. Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates pledged more cuts Tuesday night.
	   ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt will sell off two of its main
government-owned trading companies as part of its wide-reaching
privatization program, a government minister said Saturday.
	   Atef Obeid told the official Middle East News Agency that shares
in both the Arab Company for Foreign Trade and Misr for Foreign
Trade will be sold to Egyptian investors.
	   Egypt's powerful state sector ran several trading enterprises,
some of which had chains of retail outlets. Obeid said the
government will also sell some of these chains gradually.
	   The move is the latest in the government's effort to speed up
its privatization program. Earlier this month, parliament approved
the sale of shares in state-owned banks and insurance companies.
	   Banking and other sectors were nationalized after Egypt's
government was taken over by Gamal Abdel Nasser in a 1952 army
coup. The state began to loosen controls in 1991 when President
Hosni Mubarak started economic reforms.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Foreign investments in the Amman Stock
Market increased by 41.8 percent over January to May, Michael
Marto, chairman of Jordan's Security Commission, said Saturday.
	   Non-Jordanian investments during that period reached 22.4
million dinars (dlrs 31.5 million), compared with 15.8 million
dinars (dlrs 22.2 million) in the same period last year, he said.
	   The amount traded this year in the stock market recorded
	   About 13.7 million dinars (dlrs 19.3 million) were traded this
year in the stock market by non-Arab investors, and 8.7 million
dinars (dlrs 12.2 million) by Arab investors, Marto said.
	   He added that 77 percent of investments by non-Jordanian
investors were traded in commercial banks shares, and the rest in
industrial firms, insurance and services sectors.

Mahathir denies nepotism and cronyism 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister on
Saturday denied allegations of nepotism, releasing a list of people
awarded government contracts to prove they had been given out
fairly.
	   ``There are literally hundreds of them and quite obviously they
are not cronies of us,'' Mahathir Mohamad told the general assembly
of the United Malays National Organization.
	   Mahathir said the list was distributed because the party was
accused of corruption. Outspoken UMNO youth leader Ahmad Zahid
Hamidi had claimed that nepotism and cronyism was practiced in the
awarding of some privatized projects.
	   The opposition had also accused the government of such practices
during Mahathir's 17 years in office.
	   ``We will see from the list who benefited, whether they are
cronies or the sons and daughters of the leaders,'' Mahathir said.
	   Mahathir acknowledged however that the list contained names of
people related or connected to senior UMNO leaders, the national
news agency Bernama said.
	   ``Yes, there are. But they are not exclusive. Like anybody who
do business, they are entitled, but it is not given by UMNO
leaders,'' he explained.
	   He said the party's practice was that if any of the leaders'
relatives were involved, the leaders will not be allowed to take
part in deciding who gets the privatized projects.
	   ``It is not as if certain people are given everything. Everybody
has a fair share,'' said Mahathir.
	   He said UMNO would release another list consisting of those who
received allocation of shares, approved permits to import vehicles
and licenses.

European Commission weighs merger of MCI and Worldcom 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS (AP) _ The European Commission is considering a
proposal from MCI Communications Corp. and Worldcom Inc. for a
merger of the two U.S. telecommunications giants, a European Union
source said.
	   The Commission is ``moderately optimistic'' the planned dlrs 37
billion merger will be approved, the source told Dow Jones News
Service late Friday on condition of anonymity.
	   The source warned, however, that it would be ``premature to say
any deal has been reached.''
	   MCI and Worldcom are the second- and fourth-largest
long-distance telephone companies in the United States. European
regulators are reviewing the merger, proposed in November 1997,
because the two companies also have significant sales in Europe.
	   MCI said it was optimistic the merger would be approved. ``We
hope to reach an agreement soon. These negotiations are ongoing,''
spokesman Frank Walter said.
	   The Commission's merger task force, made up of competition
regulators from the 15 member states of the European Union, met
Friday in the Belgian capital to discuss the proposed merger.
	   European and U.S. regulators are reviewing the merger plans and
have been examining closely into whether the combined company would
crimp competition and possibly raise prices in the Internet
``backbone'' business.
	   Internet backbones are high-capacity networks that carry
Internet and other data traffic for third parties.
	   MCI's proposed sale of its Internet facilities may not allay
European authorities' antitrust concerns about the company's
planned merger with WorldCom Inc., Europe's top antitrust official
said earlier this month.
	   ``I'm not sure that what has been offered will be good enough. I
even have some doubts,'' said Karel Van Miert, the EU's Competition
Commissioner.
	   Van Miert has previously said elimination of any overlap in
WorldCom and MCI's Internet holdings could be necessary to win
approval for the merger from European regulators. The EU has a July
15 deadline for deciding.
	   The merger also is subject to approval in Washington by the
Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.
	   The source said the 20 European commissioners will probably
debate the proposed merger on July 8, at their weekly scheduled
meeting.

<SLUG> World Cup: Spanish press rips players, coach Clemente </SLUG>
<HEADLINE>

</HEADLINE>
By MAR ROMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The headline in Spain's sports daily El
Mundo Deportivo said it all.
	   ``Let Us Pray,'' it read Saturday after Spain _ among the
favorties in this year's World Cup _ teetered on the brink of
elimination after a scoreless draw Friday with Paraguay.
	   The object of much of the wrath was coach Javier Clemente, who
made five changes to his starting lineup for the Paraguay match
after a shock 3-2 loss to Nigeria last weekend.
	   ``What an embarassment, Javi'' read the front page of the sports
daily Marca. The paper said the side ``was disorganized, attacked
poorly, played without invention and must now rely on pure luck''
to advance to the next round.
	   ``It is a failure of strategy, Javi is lost,'' commented the
sports daily AS.
	   ``What have we done to deserve this,'' AS said in a banner
headline on its front page.
	   Spain, one of Europe's strongest soccer-playing countries, is
one of the great enigmas of international soccer and has
traditionally disappointed in the World Cup. This year seems no
different with some fans resigned to it.
	   ``Spain fails again'' read the banner front-page headline in El
Pais, which suggested this could ``be the end of an epoch,'' a
clear reference to Clemente's future.
	   Rival daily El Mundo called it an ``embarassing defeat''
	   Spain must now beat Bulgaria in Wednesday's final group match
and hope Nigeria _ which has already qualified for the final 16 _
beats Paraguay.
	   ``Wednesday will be like the final,'' Clemente said after the
Friday loss. `` But if we beat Bulgaria and Nigeria do what they
did to us against Paraguay, we can still make it.''
	   With prayer.

Military delegation due in Tanzania 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A nine-man delegation from the
Chinese army is expected in Tanzania on a seven-day visit, a
Defense Ministry statement said Saturday.
	   The purpose of the visit to the East Africa nation, led by Maj.
Gen. Suni Qi X'ing, is to strengthen defense relations between the
two nations. The Chinese arrive Sunday.
	   China has been a major donor to Tanazania, particularly during
its time as a one-party state that ended in the late 1980s.
	   Members of Tanzania's Peoples Defense Forces _ modeled on the
Chinese army _ are currently taking part in Kenya in a June 3-27
joint military exercise with neighbors Kenya and Uganda under the
auspices of the U.S. Army's Central Command.

Floods swell across Romania, one man dies as shelter collapses details from flooding, weather forecast 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with appeal from the Red Cross for donations, more
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Red Cross appealed Saturday on
national radio for urgent donations of money and clothes to help
tens of thousands of victims of floods which have already claimed
one life.
	   Heavy floods across northern Romania have claimed a first
victim, a man crushed by a load of sand after he took shelter from
torrential rain, the news agency Mediafax said Saturday.
	   Heavy rain has fallen for a week in some parts of Transylvania,
where soldiers waded deep into floodwaters to rescue inhabitants,
build dikes and hand out food, Mediafax said.
	   Dozens of villages were flooded in the northern counties of
Suceava and Bistrita, causing billions of lei (hundreds of
thousands of dollars) damage in ruined crops and homes.
	   After eight days of heavy rain, the skies cleared for the first
time Saturday. Weather forecasts said the good weather would likely
stay.
	   Mures county in northwestern Romania was declared an emergency
zone, with 6,000 hectares (14,800 acres) of arable land and more
than 2,000 farms under water. More than 1,000 people have been
evacuated.
	   The first victim, a 47-year-old man, died Friday in a village in
northeast Romania, when a load of sand crushed his shelter,
Mediafax said. Four friends with him were treated for minor
injuries.
	   In Romania's northeast, a pood isolated region, thousands of
hectares (acres) of crops, farms, bridges, railway lines and roads
were cut off by flooding, news agencies reported.

Donald leaves the England innings in tatters 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A double-wicket spell by fast-bowler Allan Donald
has left the England first innings in tatters in the second cricket
test at Lord Saturday.
	   England, resuming the day on 40 for three, was teetering on 94
for seven at lunch and facing the ignominy of following on.
	   The home side needs to score 161 to make South Africa bat again.
The visitors, after being sent into bat, recovered from 46 for four
to be bowled out for 360.
	   Donald fired out the overnight pair of Nasser Hussain (15) and
Dean Headley (2) in the space of four balls and maintained a speed
of 87-90 mph (139-144 kph) throughout his six-over spell conceding
just six runs.
	   England's third morning demise was further compounded when
medium paceman Jacques Kallis removed Graham Thorpe and Mark Ealham
was needlessly run out responding to a Mark Ramprakash call.
	   South Africa kept a tight rein on the England innings despite
two let offs.
	   Australian umpire Darrell Hair turned down an appeal for an
obvious gloved deflection by Thorpe off Donald. In the next over
Ramprakash was dropped by skipper Hansie Cronje at third slip off
Shaun Pollock.
	   The score was 61 on both occasions.
	   Ramprakash, who deflected Donald for two for his first runs
after 41 minutes, took another 37 minutes to add to it, a single to
fine leg. He was unbeaten on 11 at the break with Dominic Cork on
four not out.
	   An overcast morning encouraged lavish side way movement for the
South African four-pronged pace attack as the batsmen got beaten
through the air and off the pitch.
	   Hussain perished to a shot unbecoming of a test batsman, driving
without any footwork, while Headley was beaten for pace as he
pushed forward.
	   Thorpe pushed Kallis off his hip only to find Adam Bacher at
short leg hold onto a brilliant one-handed reflex catch.
	   Donald has taken 3-21 in 13 overs while Pollock has 2-37 and
Kallis' one wicket cost him eight runs.

Huge march held in Rome by unions to push for more work 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Union leaders led a huge march through the streets
of Rome Saturday, hinting at strikes after the summer if Premier
Romano Prodi's government doesn't do more to create jobs.
	   A crowd estimated at 300,000 by organizers and 80,000-100,000 by
police converged on St. John Lateran Square to hear leaders of the
three main labor confederations challenge the center-left
government to more agressively tackle unemployment, especially in
the south where joblessness in some cities is almost double the
national average of 12.2 percent.
	   Pietro Larizza, head of the UIL confederation, reminded the
crowd that there was a similar march through Rome in spring 1997.
``There won't be a third,'' Larizza said, indicating that a general
strike might possibly be the next step if ``concrete, verifiable
results'' on the job front don't come soon.
	   Last month, union leaders decided to hold the march Saturday
instead of a general strike.
	   But at Saturday's rally, they raised the prospect of a ``hot
autumn,'' code words for a season peppered by strikes in all
sectors.
	   ``For us, time has run out. We will keep the pressure high
because we want results,'' said CISL confederation leader Sergio
D'Antoni.
	   Unionists chartered two ferries from Sardinia, a plane from
Sicily, a half-dozen trains and thousands of buses to help bring
workers and job-seekers from all over Italy to Rome for the rally.
	   Prodi made job creation a platform of his government. But while
organizers told the crowd the unemployment picture has brightened
in the more prosperous north, they said much more must be done to
stimulate investment to create jobs in the poorer south.
	   Labor Minister Tiziano Treu was quoted by the Italian news
agency ANSA Saturday as saying the government will establish an
agency for the south to help streamline bureaucracy for those
wanting to create jobs.

Former chancellor predicts British public will push for single currency membership 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Treasury chief Kenneth Clarke predicted
Saturday that the British public will push for membership in a
European single currency, once they see it is a success.
	   ``It is my view that EMU (European Monetary Union) is likely to
be a success, it is my view we cannot possibly join at the moment
because our economic conditions are so out of synch with those on
the Continent, but that may not last very long,'' Clarke said in a
speech to the Tory Reform Group's annual meeting.
	   ``But it seems quite obvious, if as I believe, the single
currency is a success, then the British will be looking to enter
and participate in it sooner rather than later,'' said Clarke, who
was Chancellor of the Exchequer in John Major's Conservative
government until it lost power in 1997.
	   Clarke's views were not surprising, and are in accord with the
position of Prime Minister Tony Blair's government, which favors
joining the single currency when it is in Britain's interest to do
so.
	   However, Clarke's pronouncements did highlight the continuing
debate within the Conservative party, which was sharply divided
over the single currency and other European issue. William Hague,
Major's successor as Conservative leader, opposes joining a single
currency during the life of the next Parliament _ a period which
could run until 2007.
	   Clarke said the issue may well go away well before then _
perhaps before the next likely election date in 2002.
	   ``It is the one issue where we will be lifted off the rocks by
events,'' he said. ``By the time we get to the next election, the
scenery on the single currency will look far, far different to what
it is now.
	   ``And then we will see who's right, and in my opinion if it has
succeeded, you will find immense pressure from British business
supported by the overwhelming majority of the British public that
the duty of government is to make sure is that British enter in a
satisfactory fashion.''
	   Clarke denied that he had any interested in challenging Hague's
position as leader.
	   ``I don't think there will be any dispute over the leadership at
least before the next election, if not beyond, and I think the
party needs a leadership crisis like it needs a hole in the head,''
Clarke said.

World Cup: Poor accuracy leaves Croatia with 0-0 halftime draw 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Davor Suker had three shots at goal in the
first 13 minutes but poor accuracy plagued Croatia on Saturday and
was forced to settle for a 0-0 halftime draw with Japan as it tried
to lock up its place in the second round of the World Cup.
	   Suker sent a header a one meter wide of the post from the top of
the penalty area in the eight minute; volleyed a cross high from 11
meters in the 11th; and then curled a free kick less than a half
meter wide of the post in the 13th.
	   Mario Stanic had Croatia's best chances in the first half,
breaking in alone on Japanese keeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi in the
19th, but putting a right-footed shot from 10 meters that bounced
several times before missing wide left.
	   Kawaguchi stuffed Suker again with 10 minutes remaining on the
half when the Real Madrid forward got the ball by himself inside
the Japanese goal box.
	   But the big play of the half came when Croatian keeper Drazen
Ladic was able to get his half of left hand to a shot by Japanese
forward Masashi Nakayama.
	   Nakayama had broken inside on a feed from Hidetoshi Nakata
against the run of play.
	   Croatia, which beat Jamaica 3-1 in its opener, was looking to
secure its place in the round of 16 while Japan needed at least a
draw to keep its hopes alive.
	   Japan, which lost 1-0 to Argentina in its World Cup debut on
June 14, extended its scoreless streak to 4 1-2 games, having gone
without a goal since Naoki Somo scored in the 86th minute of a 1-1
draw with Paraguay on May 17.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Red Cross appealed to Romanians on
Saturday for urgent donations of money and clothes to help tens of
thousands of victims of floods.
	   The first person to be killed in the floods was a man crushed

shelter from the torrential rain, the news agency Mediafax said

Syrian businessman, linked to the Achille Lauro case, killed in Madrid

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A gunman on Saturday killed a Syrian
businessman who had been a witness against a compatriot charged
with supplying the guns used to hijack the cruise ship Achille
Lauro in 1985.
	   The gunman shot Mustafa Nasinni, 49, in the head when he was
about to leave his home in east Madrid, said police spokeswoman
Maria Gomez. He died hours later at a nearby hospital.
	   Police suspect Nassini, who had served prison time for drug
trafficking in Spain, was killed in a settling of accounts, Gomez
said.
	   Nasinni testified in 1995 against Syrian arms dealer Monzer Al
Kassar, charged with arming the hijackers of the Achille Lauro. Al
Kassar was acquitted.
	   The Palestinian hijackers killed a wheelchair-bound U.S. Jew
during the hijack, tossing him overboard. They escaped aboard a
plane from Egypt but U.S. fighter planes forced them to land in
Italy, where they were captured.
	   Months after Nasinni testified, two of his teenaged were
abducted by armed men and released 48 hours later in a police
operation.

Vietnam to host second Tiger Cup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam is likely to host the second
Southeast Asian Tiger Cup soccer tournament since Malaysia says it
will be too busy with the Commonwealth Games, Vietnam's top soccer
official said Saturday.
	   Eight countries will send teams to take part in the games, to be
held in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City from Aug. 25 to Sept. 9, said
Pham Ngoc Vien, secretary general of the Vietnam Football
Federation.
	   Paul Mony Samuel, secretary general of the Southeast Asian
Football Confederation, offered to have Vietnam host the tournament
in a fax sent to the federation on Friday.
	   ``It was good news for Vietnam,'' Vien said.
	   Vien said the federation has asked the Vietnamese government for
permission to organize the regional soccer cup.
	   ``We have had a positive response so far from the government and
a decision can be made in the next few days.'' Vien said.
	   The second Tiger Cup was originally set to be held in Indonesia
but the plans were cancelled because of the economic and political
turmoil there.
	   Vietnam had offered to replace Indonesia as a site for the
competition, but the Southeast Asian Football Confederation first
offered the privilege to Johore, Malaysia.
	   Vietnam won the bronze medal at the first Tiger Cup held in
Singapore in 1996.
	   Soccer is hugely popular in Vietnam, and thousands of fans
converge at airports to welcome back their players from regional
competitions.
	   Vietnam's soccer performance in regional competition has
improved greatly since it hired a foreign coach in 1994.
	   It won the silver medal for soccer at the Southeast Asian Games
in 1995, its most significant win in regional play since it
rejoined regional sports competitions in late 1980s.
	   Vietnam has had four foreign coaches over the past four years,
with the latest, Alfred Riedl, coming from Austria.
	   The sport has been tarnished by a match-fixing scandal involving
last year's national tournament. Three players were given lifetime
playing bans for their involvement. Two of them have been arrested
for further investigation.

Police fire in air as protests in Yemen continue 
</HEADLINE>
By AHMED AL-HAJ
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Hundreds of riot police and soldiers fired
into the air Saturday in clashes with thousands of Yemenis
protesting a 40 percent IMF-required hike in fuel prices.
	   The demonstrators took to the streets for the second day,
throwing rocks at police cars, smashing billboards and shouting
chants against the government, a security official said.
	   The hikes were in line with requirements of the International
Monetary Fund to remove subsidies on petroleum products and other
commodities like flour and sugar by the end of 1998.
	   Most shops remained closed in the capital San`a. Protesters
burned tires in the city's main streets and used rocks to close
vital roads, the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Baton-wielding police chased demonstrators in streets and fired
tear gas, but there were no reports of casualties.
	   The protesters chanted against Prime Minister Abdul Karim
al-Iryani, who came to power last month.
	   ``Iryani you fool, you raised the price of fuel,'' shouted a
crowd gathered in front of the parliament building.
	   The demonstrators called on the government to reverse its
decision, announced Thursday and implemented Friday, to raise the
prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas by about 40 percent.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.
	   To help Yemen recover from the effects of the 1994 civil war,
the World Bank has approved a dlrs 80 million credit to support its
economic reform program.

Pakistan warns it could retaliate to India's alleged deployment of missiles on border 
</HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Accusing India of deploying
medium-range missiles on its border, Pakistan warned Saturday that
it could retaliate by deploying missiles of its own, raising the
stakes in the region's nuclear crisis.
	   During a debate in Pakistan's Parliament, Defense Secretary
Khursheed Zaman urged the United Nations to press New Delhi to
withdraw its missiles or ``Pakistan will be justified to take
action for our self-defense.''
	   ``The world is fully aware of the efficiency of our missile
technology,'' the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan quoted
Zaman as saying.
	   Since last month's nuclear tests by both India and Pakistan, the
industrialized world has urged a reduction in tension, an end to
belligerent statements and bilateral talks between the uneasy
neighbors.
	   Combatants in three previous wars, Pakistan and India have
declared themselves nuclear powers, triggering fears of a nuclear
arms race on the Asian Subcontinent. Both countries possess
missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
	   Pakistan says India's medium-range Prithvi missiles, capable of
delivering a nuclear warhead, have been deployed at two different
locations along its border with Pakistan.
	   In April Pakistan tested its long-range Ghauri missile, able to
carry a payload of 700 kilograms (1,500 pounds) and travel 1,500
kilometers (900 miles). With that range a Ghauri missile could hit
most population centers in India.
	   Zaman was quoted as telling Parliament that Pakistan has
``brought the gravity of the situation to the notice of the world
powers and in case of a delay in action by them . . . Pakistan will
be justified to take action for our self-defense.''
	   Pakistan made similar statements following India's nuclear tests
on May 11 and 13, warning that it would be forced to conduct tests
of its own unless the industrialized world hit New Delhi hard and
quick.
	   Two weeks later Pakistan conducted six nuclear tests, calling
the international response lackluster; the U.S. and Japan had
reacted with immediate sanctions, but most European nations
resisted.
	   The tit-for-tat nuclear testing by the subcontinent's longtime
enemies has resulted in economic sanctions and a renewed
international interest in the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir
-- a flash point of two previous wars between India and Pakistan.

Unclear if Krajicek will be ready for Wimbledon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ It's unclear if 1996 Wimbledon
champion Richard Krajicek will play this year after he withdrew
Friday from the Heineken Trophy grass-court tournament with an
injured left knee.
	   After winning a lengthy match against Czech Slava Dosedel, 7-6
(7-3), 6-7 (7-4), 6-3, Krajicek pulled out of his quarterfinal
against compatriot Dennis van Scheppingen.
	   Dutch television said Krajicek, seeded No. 9 at Wimbledon, had
met with his doctor and could face surgery later this year _ but
did not say if he would be ready when Wimbledon opens Monday.
	   He had surgery on his right knee more than a year ago.

Rivalry claims 9 people, bringing week-long death toll to 55 
</HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Rival militants on a rampage through
the southern port city of Karachi killed nine people Saturday,
bringing the week's death toll to 55, police and hospital officials
said.
	   Nine bodies were found in different parts of the city. All of
them had been tortured, police said. Three were found in an
abandoned car in the central Gulberg neighborhood, two more bodies
were found nearby in Nazimabad area and four others were discovered
elsewhere in the city.
	   Police officials blamed rival militants belonging to the Mohajir
Qami Movement, which split into two factions several years ago.
	   In recent weeks, police said, a third faction has surfaced and
they are believed to be responsible for some of the recent violence
terrorizing entire neighborhoods of Karachi, a bustling city of 14
million people.
	   The government has stepped up its patrols in some of the worst
hit neighborhoods, but so far no arrests have been made.
	   In much of the affected area of the city, shops were shuttered
Saturday and residents stayed indoors. Late on Friday two young
boys and a 65-year-old woman were caught in the crossfire and died,
hospital officials said.
	   Khanwar Khalid Yunus, a legislator representing the MQM, blamed
the week-long bloodshed on the newest faction of the movement to
emerge _ which he said was a front for government intelligence
agencies.
	   ``This is part of the conspiracy by the intelligence
organizations to prop up this new group to crush the MQM,'' Yunus
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
	   He suggested that the violence was a prelude to
government-imposed governor's rule in southern Sindh province.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who currently is in Karachi, held
meetings Friday with provincial law enforcement agencies urging a
quick end to the violence.
	   The movement, which represents Indian Muslims who settled here
after independence in 1947, is largely restricted to the urban
centers of Pakistan's southern Sindh province, of which Karachi is
the capital.

Police kill seven maoist rebels in southern India 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Maoist rebels in a southern state
ambushed a police patrol party Saturday, and seven guerrillas were
killed in the ensuing gun battle, Indian police said.
	   No policeman was killed in the encounter with the outlawed
Peoples' War Group in Medak district, 75 kilometers (40 miles) west
of Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh state, police officer
M.A. Basit said.
	   The PWG, a Maoist-Leninist organisation, is waging an armed
struggle against the administration to create a communist state
comprising tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh and parts of three
neighboring states.
	   It mostly targets rich land owners, accusing them of exploiting
landless farm hands. It often seizes the land and redistributes it
among the peasants. The rebels also frequently attack police and
administration officials, accusing them of colluding with the land
owners to deny agricultural workers their rights.
	   In the last 15 years, more than 5,500 people have died in the
violence between the rebels, called naxalites, and the police. In
Andhra Pradesh alone, 180 people, including 20 policemen, have been
killed in violence this year.
	   Saturday's encounter took place just two days after the PWG
killed two local political leaders who were leading an agitation
against its violent activities.
	   Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, the state's highest elected
official, told journalists Friday he would crack down on the rebels
and enact a new law to treat naxalite violence as a law and order
problem instead of a socio-economic problem.

Louise Woodward has 'lots of answers,' mother says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Louise Woodward will give a BBC
interviewer ``lots of answers'' about the death of the baby in her
care, her mother said Saturday.
	   ``She's anxious to speak. You'll get lots of answers,'' Susan
Woodward said as her daughter met with an interviewer from the
British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Ms. Woodward returned to her home in Elton in northeast England
after the Supreme Court of Justice in Massachusetts affirmed her
conviction and sentence for the death of baby Matthew Eappen. The
trial jury found Ms. Woodward guilty of second-degree murder, but
the judge reduced that to manslaughter and her sentence to time
served.
	   The family says she received no money for the BBC interview. The
interviewer, Martin Bashir, is best known for his one-on-one
interview with Princess Diana in 1995.
	   ``She feels anxious to be able to speak. She wants people to be
able to listen to what she's got to say. She wants people to see
her as a person.
	   ``You saw how she conducted herself at the airport with
confidence, but you only got snippets of what she had to say,''
Mrs. Woodward told Press Association, the British news agency.

Italian centrists rethinking `yes' vote on NATO 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian centrists were waffling Saturday on next
week's vote on NATO enlargement, leaving it unclear if r Premier
Romano Prodi's coalition would muster a majority in the crucial
balloting in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   However, government officials held out hope, despite the
waffling by the centrists headed by former President Francesco
Cossiga and the adamant opposition by hardline Communists, that the
vote scheduled for Tuesday would pass, thus avoiding the need for a
confidence vote on the coalition.
	   ``I hope that between now and Tuesday there will be a sense of
responsibility on all sides, because I continue to think that
opening up a phase of political instability would be very heavy for
the country and for our international image,'' said Deputy Premier
Walter Veltroni.
	   ``I don't think that on the horizon there's a collapse of the
government,'' Veltroni added.
	   Carlo Scognamiglio, a member of Cossiga's centrists, raised the
possibility of a no-vote on NATO's eastward expansion.
	   The centrists were irked by criticism, from an official of the
main leftist party in Prodi's coalition, of Cossiga's ringing
defense a few days earlier of former Premier Giulio Andreotti at
the latter's trial in Palermo on charges of helping the Mafia.
	   On Friday, Communist leader Fausto Bertinotti stuck to his
anti-NATO position.
	   There are fears that if the government loses its majority on
such a fundamental foreign policy issue, it could face a vote of
confidence. But Bertinotti has indicated that his forces would
continue to give Prodi the edge the coalition needs in the lower
chamber should the government's survival come to a confidence vote.
	   Prodi has a majority in the Senate but usually counts on
Bertinotti's Communists for a majority in the Chamber.
	   Opposition leader and former premier Silvio Berlusconi has
expressed support for the expansion, but has asked Prodi to step
down in exchange for his votes.
	   Prodi's government nearly collapsed last year when Bertinotti
voted against plans to send Italian troops to quell unrest in
Albania, but the opposition bailed him out.

	   ROME (AP) _ Italian centrists were waffling Saturday on next
week's vote on NATO enlargement, leaving it unclear if Premier
Romano Prodi's coalition would muster a majority in the crucial
balloting in the Chamber of Deputies.

Pope urges Europeans to reconcile with Jews 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with quotes, details of pope's address.
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Europeans must seek reconciliation with
the Jews for the ``unspeakable suffering'' inflicted on them, Pope
John Paul II said Saturday as he set down a tough agenda for the
old continent.
	   Addressing Austrian officials and diplomats in the former
Imperial Palace, the pope listed duties and sacrifices required of
Europeans to overcome injustices and economic disparity.
	   ``Don't forget the history of Europe is clsoely intertwined with
the history of that people from which the Lord Jesus came,'' John
Paul said. ``The Jewish people have been inflicted with unspeakable
suffering in Europe, and we can't affirm that all the roots of
these injustices have been cut.''
	   ``Reconciliation with the Jews is one of the fundamental duties
of Christians in Europe,'' John Paul said.
	   Sitting among the dignitaries was former Austrian President Kurt
Waldheim, who drew the ire of Jewish groups because of his alleged
complicity in war crimes by the German army in World War II.
	   Waldheim denied the accusations, but remains on the U.S. ``Watch
List'' of people barred entry to the United States, despite
previously living there for years as an Austrian diplomat and then
as Secretary General of the United Nations in New York.
	   Waldheim, invited to Saturday's ceremony as a former Austrian
head of state, shook John Paul's hand and chatted briefly with him
during the encounter in the Hofburg palace, now used for ceremonies
and as the official seat of Austria's president.
	   The pope received Waldheim in the Vatican in 1987, and Waldheim
welcomed the pope on his last trip to Austria in 1988, leading to
protests by Jews.
	   John Paul, who was 19 years old when the Nazis occupied his
native Poland, has spoken out often against anti-Semitism and the
horrors of the Holocaust, when an estimated six million Jews
perished at the hands of the Nazis.
	   But Saturday was believed to be the first time he put the burden
specifically on Europeans to make amends.

Black business consortium buys alleged AIDS remedy rights 
</HEADLINE>
By PAT REBER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The rights to an alleged AIDS
remedy that sparked political and scientific controversy last year
have been sold to a black business consortium that is determined to
get it to the market, the company said Saturday.
	   The consortium, called Virodene Pharmaceutical Holdings, bought
the majority interest in Cryopreservation Technologies that
developed Virodene P058, a spokesman for VPH told The Associated
Press.
	   Larry Heidebrecht declined to name the purchase price, but media
reports on Friday said VPH paid 20 million rand (dlrs 3.7 million)
for a 70 percent share.
	   ``The new investors have assured the previous owners that they
have the money to take the drug all the way to the market,''
Heidebrecht said. ``They are in it for the long haul.''
	   The new company has begun patenting the drug world wide to meet
an end-of-June deadline for patent rights, Heidebrecht said.
	   The company is also nearly finished preparing a protocol for
clinical testing of the drug that must be approved by the Medicines
Control Council.
	   MCC chairwoman Helen Rees told the Afrikaans daily newspaper,
Beeld, on Friday that the council could take three months to decide
after the protocol was submitted.
	   ``We still need scientific evidence to suggest that the drug
actually works,'' Rees was quoted in the weekly Mail and Guardian
as saying.
	   The lack of approved trials raised red flags last year when
Virodene's developers, Olga Visser and two other researchers, tried
to bypass the MCC and other control boards for human drugs.
	   The scientists had gone directly to South Africa's Cabinet,
claiming Virodene P058 killed the HIV virus and in some cases
reversed the effects of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in
tests on 12 patients.
	   Other scientists criticized the researchers for going public
with their findings without first subjecting them to peer review, a
standard practice in publishing research.
	   They also expressed concern that the drug was tested on humans
without first going through laboratory and animal trials.
	   The control board suspended further research on Virodene P058
because one of the ingredients is a toxic industrial solvent _
dimethylformamide _ that could cause liver damage and cancer.
	   Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma argued in favor of continued
research, and replaced the MCC chairman that had questioned the
drug, and President Nelson Mandela's likely successor, Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki, also tried to garner support for Virodene.
	   The ruling African National Congress was also considering buying
shares in the firm, and Zuma, Mbeki and other top ANC officials are
now being investigated by the government ombudsman for possible
conflict of interest.
	   The researchers claimed Virodene dramatically reduced the level
of HIV virus in patients' blood and boosted their
infection-fighting CD4 cell counts after just weeks of taking the
drug.
	   The white blood cells, or lymphocytes, collectively make up the
body's immune system because they fight invading virus and
bacteria. Any improvement in the CD4 count indicates a heightened
ability to fight disease.

Iraq accepts spare parts resolution, reversing earlier opposition 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Saturday it accepts the U.N.
Security Council resolution on buying spare parts for its oil
industry, reversing its earlier opposition to the motion.
	   ``Iraq will deal with the Security Council resolution No. 1175
of 1998,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman told the official Iraqi
News Agency.
	   By the resolution that the Security Council passed unanimously
Friday, Iraq is permitted to spend dlrs 300 million of revenues
from the oil-for-food program to buy spare parts to repair and
upgrade its oil industry.
	   Only on Monday, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said his
government ``is not going to accept this resolution.''
	   He warned it could trigger the ``collapse of the whole
(oil-for-food) program,'' by which Iraq is entitled to sell limited
amounts of oil to finance purchases of food, medicine and
humanitarian goods. The program, currently renewed every six
months, enables Iraq to bypass the sanctions imposed after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Later this week, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
sent a letter to the Security Council saying the resolution
``contradicts the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding'' signed
between Iraq and the United Nations in 1996 ``because it ignores
the fact that this (oil-for-food) program is an exceptional
arrangement and a temporary one.''
	   ``Iraq totally rejects the transfer of the oil-for-food program
from a temporary measure to a permanent and ongoing formula,''
al-Sahhaf wrote.
	   On Saturday the Foreign Ministry spokesman said Iraq believes
the resolution contains nothing that would transform the
oil-for-food program into an indefinite measure to be applied until
U.N. sanctions on Iraq are lifted.
	   The spokesman said Iraq would have rejected the resolution if it
had contained ``any interpretation contradicting the temporary and
exceptional nature of this program.''
	   However, the resolution reduces Baghdad's ability to delay
aspects of the program as part of its campaign against the
sanctions.
	   Since the program began in December 1996, Iraq has been
submitting to the United Nations every six months a plan for the
distribution of the food and medicine purchased with oil revenues.
	   Iraq had often delayed its submission of the plan, and suspended
its oil sales, in an attempt to whittle away support for the
sanctions.
	   With Friday's resolution, if Iraq submits no plan, the previous
one remains in force. U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said the
resolution ensures no further gaps in Iraqi oil sales.

MELUN-SENART: his sacking. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Saudi Arabia has lost its two matches so far, 1-0 to Denmark 0-1
and 4-0 to host France. The team has one more match Wednesday
against South Africa, and will coached by Mohammed al-Kharashi.
	   Parreira, who led Brazil to its record fourth World Cup title in
1994, was the eighth coach to be sacked by the Saudis in less than
four years.
	   The decision was taken by the Saudi soccer federation, which met
in an extraordinary session in Paris late Friday, the Saudi Press
Agency said from Riyadh.
	   ``As of now we are no longer with the Saudi team,'' Parreira
told reporters at the team hotel outside Paris.
	   ``I don't feel happy and I don't feel comfortable with the
decision taken by the Saudi officials. At least they should have
let us continue until the end of the World Cup.''
	   Parreira said Saudi officials ``should at least give more time
for the coach and players to get used to each other.''
	   The Brazilian said the reason given for his dismissal their
``very high expectations _ at least to repeat what they had done in
the last World Cup, to reach the second round.''
	   Since the team failed to achieve the goal, he said, ``they have
taken the decision to cancel my contract and not to coach the saudi
team any further.''
	   Parreira said he planned to stay in Paris until the end of the
World Cup on July 12.
	   The Saudi federation, headed by Prince Faisal bin Fahd, Saudi
King Fahd's son, discussed the performance of the national team and
its early exit from the finals, the agency said.
	   In its six-hour meeting, the federation decided to call up Saudi
coach Mohammed al-Khuraishi to take charge of the team in its last
match against South Africa on Wednesday, it said.
	   A committee was also formed to investigate the poor showing of
the players, the agency said.
	   On the eve of the match against France, Prince Faisal
confidently told reporters that his country would win and move on
to the second round to match its performance in 1994.
	   ``The federation expresses its apology and sorrow for the
loving, loyal sports fans in the kingdom and the Arab and Muslim
world for failing to meet their hopes and expectations,'' the
agency quoted the federation as saying.
	   In 1994, Saudi Arabia became the only Gulf team to reach the
second round of the World Cup.
	   Parreira, one of the most accomplished coaches in the world,
signed a one-year contract with the Saudi federation in December
for a reported dlrs 3 million.
	   Parreira led Kuwait in 1982 and the United Arab Emirates in 1990
to the World Cup finals. Saudi Arabia won the Asian Cup in 1988
under him.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A gunman on Saturday killed a Syrian
businessman who had been a witness against a compatriot charged
with supplying the guns used to hijack the cruise ship Achille
Lauro in 1985.
	   The gunman shot Mustafa Nasinni, 49, in the head when he was
about to leave his home in east Madrid, said police spokeswoman
Maria Gomez. He died hours later at a nearby hospital.
	   Police suspect Nassini, who had served prison time for drug
trafficking in Spain, was killed in a settling of accounts, Gomez
said.
	   Nasinni testified in 1995 against Syrian arms dealer Monzer Al
Kassar, charged with arming the hijackers of the Achille Lauro. Al
Kassar was acquitted.
	   The Palestinian hijackers killed a wheelchair-bound U.S. Jew
during the hijack, tossing him overboard. They escaped aboard a
plane from Egypt but U.S. fighter planes forced them to land in
Italy, where they were captured.
	   Months after Nasinni testified, two of his teenaged sons were
abducted by armed men and released 48 hours later in a police
operation.

World Cup: FIFA acknowledges refereeing errors in some matches 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVID MINTHORN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Referees erred at some World Cup matches by failing
to show cards for violent fouls, but the standard of officiating at
France 98 has been generally good and referees aren't facing undue
pressure to be tougher, FIFA asserted Saturday.
	   Each referee's performance is judged on a 10-point scale after
each World Cup match. The average score for the 24 matches was 8.1,
with the lowest 6.4 and the highest 9, officials of the world
soccer body said.
	   FIFA stressed that the high number of red cards flashed on
Thursday _ three in the Denmark-South Africa match and two in the
France-Saudi Arabia game __ was not a response to presure from
World Cup organizers for a crackdown on rough play.
	   The five expulsions were ordered a day after new FIFA president
Sepp Blatter complained that referees weren't doing their job
properly, after showing only four red cards in the first 20 games.
This prompted a chorus of complaints from players, coaches and
soccer analysts.
	   But Michel Zen Ruffinen, acting general secretary of FIFA, said
Thursday's flurry was ``not a reaction'' to Blatter's statement.
	   ``It means that referees are becoming more consistent ... more
careful about application (of rules) in the World Cup finals.''
	   ``We're happy so far with refereeing,'' Michel Zen Ruffinen
said.
	   He called the ``technical'' aspect of referring _ recognizing
and calling fouls_ generally ``good and even very good'' through
the first third of the 64 matches.
	   But Zen Ruffinen acknowledged that some referees had problems
with ``disciplinary actions'' after calling a free kick _ ``whether
to show a red card, or a yellow card or no card,'' he said.
	   The 34 referees and 33 assistants chosen from the 32 nations at
the World Cup and other countries in FIFA attended special seminars
on applying consistent standards in their game officiating _
specifically, abiding by FIFA's Rule 12 forbidding violent tackles
from behind.
	   A red card ``is a must when there is a tackle from behind and
there is danger to the opposing player,'' said Gen. Farouk Bouzo of
Syria, of the FIFA refereeing committee.
	   FIFA studies have shown that 66 percent of severe injuries
throughout the sport resulted from tackles from behind.
	   Bouzo said World Cup referees were also obliged to send off
players for violent tackles from the front or side, as well, if the
action could endanger the opposing player.
	   But he also acknowledged that referees overlooked some obvious
cases of flagrant fouls, particularly when Brazil defeated Morocco
3-0 on Tuesday.
	   In the 18th minute, Morocco's Said Chiba slid in with cleats
high, ripping Ronaldo's shorts and leaving a gash on his left
thigh. But Russian referee Nikolai Levnikov didn't show even a
yellow card.
	   ``The game (of soccer) is a game of mistakes ... human errors by
coaches, players, referees,'' Bouzo said. ``This mistake was
analyzed by the commission and we gave advice to the referee
involved.''
	   Asked what could be done if a referee's poor judgement in a
World Cup match resulted in a team being unfairly eliminated, Bouzo
said, ``There is no compensation for losing a football game.'' But
he added that the referee would face FIFA discipline if he was at
fault, including being sent home from the tournament.
	   In the first 24 matches of France 98, referees issued 101 cards,
including nine red-card expulsions. The average number of cards per
match is 4.2. In the first round of the 1994 World Cup, the average
was 3.5 cards per initial match.
	   The record number of red cards was 18 at the 1990 World Cup in
Italy. Twelve were issued at the 1994 World Cup in the United
States.

Exit polls have socalists leading in Czech early elections 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czechs backed the center-left
Social Democrats in early parliamentary elections, according to an
exit poll released Saturday.
	   The poll showed the center-left Social Democrats, led by Milos
Zeman, leading the race with 32 percent, but far short of winning a
parliamentary majority, Czech television said.
	   It was the first time since Communist rule fell in 1989 that the
Czechs voted left.
	   ``People wanted change and it is the task of the Social
Democrats to bring about that change,'' Vladimir Spidla, Social
Democrat vice-chairman, told Nova private television.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus was second with 26 percent of the vote, according to the poll
conducted by the Austrian IFES institute. Klaus, who was ousted
last December when his center-right minority coalition government
fell apart over a party finance scandal, had no immediate comment.
	   Four other parties were shown as clearing the 5 percent
threshold needed for parliamentary representation, but trailed the
leaders by a large margin.
	   The exit poll suggested the populist Pensioners for Secure
Living, which headed into the polls as a strong smaller party, had
not made the cut. The Communists, Christian Democrats, Freedom
Union and extremist Republicans did, according to the IFES.
	   The poll confirmed earlier indications that the Social Democrats
could have a chance to form a center-left coalition government for
the first time since 1989.
	   Despite the Social Democrats' expected victory, Zeman lacks a
clear majority and will have to go through painful negotiations to
form a government coalition.
	   ``The results of the election is what was expected, i.e. a
stalemate,'' Jiri Pehe, political advisor to President Vaclav Havel
told Nova private television. ``It will be very difficult to form a
government.''
	   Zeman's potential partners are the small Christian Democrats and
the Freedom Union _ a new party favored by Havel.
	   Voting for all 200 seats in the lower house of parliament, which
will form a new government, began Friday and continued Saturday
with polls closing at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT). The country has 8.09
million eligible voters.
	   The elections came two years early. A caretaker government under
banker Josef Tosovsky has been running the country since Klaus'
ouster
	   IFES polled 15,000 voters in over 240 election precincts with a
2 percent margin of error, officials said. First official results
were expected around 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).
	   Coalition negotiations are expected to follow the vote, with
Havel playing a key role. Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek told
state radio talks might begin as early as Monday.
	   TV showed Havel, like many Czechs, tuning in for the first exit
poll, but he made no immediate comment.

Homosexual march attracts tens of thousands to Paris streets

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people marched through Paris
Saturday in an annual homosexual rally, dancing atop colorful
floats and displaying banners supporting a bill that would give
homosexuals new legal recognition.
	   The march, on a very hot afternoon, started mid-afternoon in the
Latin Quarter on the city's Left Bank and was to finish later
Saturday at Place de la Nation in east Paris.
	   But a chief organizer of the march, the 17th in the French
capital, lamented that the day's events had been undermined by the
World Cup.
	   ``We had to scrap loads of things because of the World Cup: not
just for security, but also because of a lack of sponsors,'' the
left-wing daily Liberation quoted Charles Myara as saying.
	   Last year, an estimated 300,000 took part in the rally.
	   Liberation said many sponsors who are also pouring money into
the World Cup have stayed away this year, fearing a conflict of
interests between the two events.
	   Security concerns over the World Cup have also affected the
march, Liberation said, with police denying authorization for gay
bars to remain open beyond usual closing time _ 2:00 a.m. _ as is
normally the case on the march day.
	   The slogan for the rally was ``Gays and lesbians have rights _
human rights.''
	   Several banners made reference to a bill, to be debated later
this year in parliament, which would give new legal recognition to
homosexual couples and unwed heterosexuals.
	   The bill _ known as the Civil Solidarity Pact _ has been
criticized by President Jacques Chirac.
	   In response to the bill, some 12,000 mayors _ mainly from the
French right _ signed a petition in May opposing marriage between
homosexuals.
	   Also participating in the march were several left-wing politcal
figures, including Jack Lang, the former culture minister.

VIENNA: make amends. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Later, the pope celebrated an open-air Mass at St. Poelten, some
60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Vienna, where the local bishop has
become the center of a storm that epitomizes the divisions rocking
Austria's Roman Catholic church.
	   Many of the participants carried tiny flags in the Vatican's
yellow and white colors expressing loyalty to the pope and
Monsignor Kurt Krenn, the conservative bishop of St. Poelten who
has vocally defended an Austrian cardinal forced out by the Vatican
following accusations of pedophilia.
	   Catholics seeking such major church reforms as abolition of
priestly celibacy and admission of women to the priesthood have
seized on the case as an example of how conservative clergy has
disillusioned Austrian Catholics.
	   Opponents of Krenn handed out leaflets and held up black
balloons as protest symbols.
	   In his morning address, John Paul noted the aspirations of the
former communist countries in Europe as the 15-nation European
Union considers taking them in. The pope insisted that Western
Europe cannot remain an ``island of Western well-being on the
continent.''
	   ``The richer countries, inevitably, will have to make concrete
sacrifices'' to overcome the ``inhuman'' economic differences, the
pope said.
	   John Paul also said these countries should remain open to
accepting immigrants from other countries.
	   He used his international audience to renew his attack on what
he called an expanding ``culture of death'' in the world, referring
to abortion and euthanasia.
	   He said Austria's law allowing abortions in the first three
months of preganancy ``remains a bleeding wound in my heart.''

World Cup: Nigeria riding high after two wins 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ Taribo West went into the big city.
Jay-Jay Okocha refereed a spirited game of two-on-two
soccer-tennis. Bora Milutinovic could not stop laughing.
	   Its place in the World Cup's round of 16 assured after two
victories in as many games, Nigeria held a practice session
Saturday that reflected a team appreciating its sudden status as
serious contender.
	   Heading into France '98, Group D was thought to be the toughest
bracket, or Group of Death, with Nigeria, perennially tough Spain,
1994 semifinalist Bulgaria and wild card Paraguay.
	   Two weeks into the tournament, however, that ``D'' seems to
stand for Dominate, which is what Nigeria has done.
	   ``It's always good to clinch a spot (in the next round) before
your last group game,'' winger Finidi George said. ``Now we have to
keep that winning mentality. It's the World Cup, and we have to
keep building our reputation.''
	   Nigeria has six points to two for Paraguay, its opponent
Wednesday in Toulouse. Bulgaria and Spain are tied with one. That
means Nigeria not only has clinched a second-round berth, it also
has already sown up first place in the group and thus is guaranteed
to a second-place team in the next round regardless of what happens
against Paraguay.
	   While Milutinovic ran reserves through a short half-field
scrimmage at the training site 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of
Paris, the bulk of the starters from Friday's 1-0 win over Bulgaria
were given a respite. Only goalkeeper Peter Rufai worked seriously.
	   West, the hulking center back who holds the defense together,
was the one player not present. ``He's enjoying fame in Paris,''
joked Milutinovic, who's now brought four different countries to
the second round.
	   The witty wanderer led Mexico to the quarterfinals in 1986,
Costa Rica to the second round in 1990 and the United States to the
second round four years ago.
	   Victor Ikpeba sat in the shade Saturday, resting a sore foot.
The AS Monaco striker closed off a slick, three-man action to score
the goal in the 27th minute to beat Bulgaria.
	   The offense had suffered a series of injuries heading into World
Cup play, but the roster is fully stocked now. ``The best medicine
is to win two games here,'' Milutinovic said. ``This is the best
feeling.''
	   Against Paraguay, he said he will likely sit out the players who
have received a yellow card, so as not to risk a suspension for the
second-round game.
	   Those players are Ikpeba, Okocha and Mutiu Adepoju. In addition,
captain Uche Ukechukwu is already out of the Paraguay match because
he received his second booking of the tournament in the Bulgaria
match.

Report: 39 sickened by food poisoning after party 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with report on discovery of bacteria in salmon roe.
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Contaminated food sickened 39 people who at a hotel
reception sponsored by a medical supplies sales company, putting
three of the victims in the hospital, a news report said Saturday.
	   The victims, among 955 people at a party Wednesday in Nagashima,
325 kilometers (200 miles) southwest of Tokyo, began complaining of
vomiting and diarrhea the next day, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The report quoted local health officials. Prefectural officials
were not immediately available for comment Saturday.
	   Kyodo said it was unclear what bacterial caused the sickness or
which food was contaminated. Smoked salmon and vegetable salads
were among the dishes served at the reception.
	   Salmon roe from Japan's northern island of Hokkaido _ suspected
of sickening several people recently with the deadly O-157 strain
of E. coli bacteria _ was not served, the report said.
	   Those who were hospitalized had been discharged by Saturday,
Kyodo said.
	   In a major outbreak of the O-157 strain of E. coli in Japan two
years ago, 12 people, mostly small children and elderly people,
died and 10,000 others were sickened.
	   Also Saturday, Kyodo reported health officials had discovered
O-157 in soy sauce-dipped salmon roe made by a company in Hokkaido.
	   The Hokkaido prefectural government ordered the producer,
Marusannotsuke Bussan, to recall its products, the report said. The
company ships salmon roe to 21 prefectures nationwide.
	   A total of 25 people in Tokyo, neighboring Chiba and Toyama in
northern Japan have suffered salmon roe-linked food poisoning since
May. Major retailers have suspended sales of salmon roe at their
outlets nationwide.

World Cup: Brazilian confirms he's out as Saudi coach players not commenting 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Parreira weighing offers from other teams; Saudi
By ADNAN MALIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MELUN-SENART, France (AP) _ Carlos Alberto Parreira said
Saturday he was sacked as coach of the Saudi Arabia soccer team
because of its poor showing at the World Cup.
	   ``The Saudis were expecting a better result,'' Parreira told
reporters at the team hotel, after a meeting in Paris with Saudi
sports officials who gave him news of his sacking.
	   ``As of now we are no longer with the Saudi team,'' he said.
	   Saudi Arabia lost its first two matches, 1-0 to Denmark and 4-0
to host France. The team has one more game Wednesday against South
Africa. Mohammed al-Khuraishi, a Saudi coach, will direct the team
at that match.
	   Parreira, who led Brazil to its record fourth World Cup title in
1994, was the eighth coach to be sacked by the Saudis in less than
four years. He signed a one-year contract with the Saudi federation
in December for a reported dlrs 3 million.
	   The decision to fire him was taken by the Saudi soccer
federation, which met in an extraordinary session in Paris late
Friday, the Saudi Press Agency said from Riyadh.
	   ``I don't feel happy and I don't feel comfortable with the
decision taken by the Saudi officials. At least they should have
let us continue until the end of the World Cup,'' Parreira said.
	   Saudi officials ``should at least give more time for the coach
and players to get used to each other,'' he added.
	   Parreira said he had ``very good relations with the Saudi
players.'' Several were seen hugging him just before was driven to
a Paris hotel to get the word on his sacking. But none was
available to comment after he returned to the team hotel.
	   Parreira said he planned to stay in Paris until the end of the
World Cup on July 12, and then would be on vacation through
December.
	   He said he would weigh offers from three national teams and
several clubs, but he didn't name any.
	   The Brazilian said the reason given for his dismissal their
``very high expectations _ at least to repeat what they had done in
the last World Cup, to reach the second round.''
	   Since the team failed to achieve the goal, he said, ``they have
taken the decision to cancel my contract and not to coach the Saudi
team any further.''
	   The Saudi federation, headed by Prince Faisal bin Fahd, Saudi
King Fahd's son, discussed the performance of the national team and
its early exit from the finals, the Saudi Press Agency said.
	   In its six-hour meeting, the federation decided to call up
al-Khuraishi to take charge of the team in its last match against
South Africa on Wednesday, it said.
	   A committee was also formed to investigate the poor showing of
the players, the agency said.
	   On the eve of the match against France, Prince Faisal
confidently told reporters that his country would win and move on
to the second round to match its performance in 1994.
	   ``The federation expresses its apology and sorrow for the
loving, loyal sports fans in the kingdom and the Arab and Muslim
world for failing to meet their hopes and expectations,'' the
agency quoted the federation as saying.
	   In 1994, Saudi Arabia became the only Gulf team to reach the
second round of the World Cup.
	   Parreira led Kuwait in 1982 and the United Arab Emirates in 1990
to the World Cup finals. Saudi Arabia won the Asian Cup in 1988
under him.

<TEXT>
	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Richard Krajicek says he will play
Wimbledon despite an knee injury Friday that forced him withdraw
from the Heineken Trophy grass-court tournament.
	   After winning a lengthy match against Czech Slava Dosedel, 7-6
(7-3), 6-7, the 1996 Wimbledon champion pulled out of his
quarterfinal against compatriot Dennis van Scheppingen.
	   Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad quoted Krajicek Saturday as
saying he was having trouble with his forehand because of the
left-knee injury but would play Wimbledon, which begins Monday.
	   ``But well, I will go to Wimbledon,'' he said. ``I'm not an
invalid yet. I can walk and still go to the backhand.''
	   Dutch television said Krajicek, seeded No. 9 at Wimbledon, had
met with his doctor and could face surgery later this year. He had
surgery on his right knee more than a year ago.

Turkish students march to protest head scarf ban 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: UPDATES with arrest warrant on Islamic deputy
<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Some 100 pro-Islamic students began
Saturday a 450-kilometer (280 mile) march to protest a government
ban on head scarves, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   The students left Istanbul's main train station and were
expected to reach Ankara, Turkey's capital, on Tuesday.
	   The government says head scarves have become a political symbol
of a too-fervent Islam threatening Turkey's secular system. It has
called for stricter enforcement of the scarf ban in schools and
public offices.
	   A deputy of the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, Abdullatif Sener, told
the marchers that the struggle for the lifting of the ban would
continue, Anatolia reported.
	   Meanwhile, the daily Hurriyet said Saturday that a court had
ordered the arrest of a former deputy of the now-banned Welfare
Party, Ibrahim Halil Celik for criticizing the founder of modern
Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in a speech in 1993.
	   It is illegal in Turkey to publicly criticize Ataturk.
	   The Welfare Party, which was forced out of power last June, was
banned earlier this year when a court ruled that it had attempted
to hinder the state's secular basis.

World Cup: South Africa eyes possible clash with Nigeria 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Talk around the South African camp Saturday
focused on referees and a possible encounter with rival Nigeria _
just about everything but the must-win match against Saudi Arabia
next week.
	   Several players mentioned defeating Saudi Arabia as almost an
afterthought when talking about South Africa's chances of advancing
to face the Nigerians.
	   A second-round appearance in South Africa's first World Cup
would be a significant accomplishment for Bafana Bafana, who were
thumped 3-0 by France in their inaugural match before tying Denmark
1-1 on Thursday.
	   To make it, South Africa must beat the Saudis and France must
beat Denmark in the final Group C matches on Wednesday, and South
Africa must overcome Denmark's four-goal advantage in scoring
differential.
	   It is unlikely, but not impossible, and players said Saturday
they believed they had a realistic chance.
	   A second-place finish in Group C means playing Nigeria, the
winner of Group D, in the next round. That is a tantalizing
prospect for South Africans, due to a political wrangle dating back
almost three years.
	   South Africa kicked Nigeria out of a four-team tournament in
late 1995 to protest the hanging of nine Ogoni tribal activists,
including playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa. Nigeria then refused to play in
the 1994 African Nations Cup tournament in South Africa.
	   Bad blood still exists over the imbroglio, which got Nigeria
suspended from this year's African Nations Cup tournament in
Burkina Faso. South Africa won the 1996 tournament and finished
runner-up to Egypt this year, but Nigeria is considered the
continent's top team due to its Olympic gold medal in 1996.
	   ``Maybe we can meet the Nigerians,'' defender Mark Fish said
Saturday. ``It will be the match the whole of Africa has been
waiting for.''
	   Fish noted South Africa needs luck to advance, but he and other
players sounded like they expect to beat the Saudis and only need
France to provide the necessary help.
	   ``We certainly believe that we'll go through and we want to,''
said Fish, who plays for Bolton Wanderers. If South Africa wins but
misses the second round due to goal differential, ``we'll be
disappointed but I think we'll look back with pride on our first
World Cup,'' he said.
	   Midfielder Quinton Fortune of Atletico Madrid said the South
Africans were confident, but not over-confident, about the Saudi
match.
	   ``I think everyone has got respect for Saudi Arabia,'' he said.
``At the moment, everyone is very positive. That's a good thing. We
believe if we play the same kind of game as we did against Denmark,
we'll have a good result.''

Louise Woodward has 'lots of answers,' mother says 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Adds four grafs from Daily Mail story
<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Louise Woodward will give a BBC
interviewer ``lots of answers'' about the death of the baby in her
care, her mother said Saturday.
	   ``She's anxious to speak. You'll get lots of answers,'' Susan
Woodward said as her daughter met with an interviewer from the
British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Ms. Woodward returned to her home in Elton in northeast England
after the Supreme Court of Justice in Massachusetts affirmed her
conviction and sentence for the death of baby Matthew Eappen. The
trial jury found Ms. Woodward guilty of second-degree murder, but
the judge reduced that to manslaughter and her sentence to time
served.
	   The family says she received no money for the BBC interview. The
interviewer, Martin Bashir, is best known for his one-on-one
interview with Princess Diana in 1995.
	   ``She feels anxious to be able to speak. She wants people to be
able to listen to what she's got to say. She wants people to see
her as a person.
	   ``You saw how she conducted herself at the airport with
confidence, but you only got snippets of what she had to say,''
Mrs. Woodward told Press Association, the British news agency.
	   The Daily Mail, which has confirmed that it paid 40,000 pounds (
dlrs 66,000) to Ms. Woodward's parents in November, published a
long article on which it said was based on contacts with the girl
and her parents over several months.
	   The Daily Mail said Ms. Woodward had a recurring dream about
walking in Elton, wearing nothing by a sweater, and feeling the
stares of villagers.
	   ``I keep walking trying to get away from the stares,'' the Daily
Mail quoted her as saying.
	   ``There isn't actually a canal in Elton but in my dream there
is. There are all these babies floating in the water. The mothers
walk calmly along the side of the canal and I can't do anything to
save the babies.''
	   The Daily Mail's article did not say when that conversation with
Ms. Woodward took place.

World Cup: Even yellow cards are falling Brazil's way 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ When a team is on a roll, even
a yellow card can be a blessing. Just ask Brazil.
	   The one-game suspension of Cesar Sampaio and the yellow cards
hanging over other players will oblige coach Mario Zagallo to
change his team to face Norway on Tuesday.
	   It couldn't happen at a better time. With victories over
Scotland and Morocco, Brazil already has qualified in first place
in Group A. The game against Norway is as close to a breather as it
gets in the World Cup.
	   ``Any result for us is OK,'' said Zagallo. ``It's a game in
which I can take any risk without a risk, understand?''
	   Tinkering with the lineup now wasn't in his plans. Zagallo had
said he wanted the starting team to ``gain consistency'' against
Norway. Now, he suddenly has a chance to try out new formations he
wouldn't dare to otherwise.
	   One certain change is in the midfield, where Sampaio picked up
his second yellow card against Morocco and must sit out a game. His
logical substitute is Emerson, summoned as Sampaio's backup when
Romario was dropped from the squad with a calf injury.
	   But Zagallo contemplates a more radical move, with midfielder
Leonardo dropping back to Sampaio's spot and Denilson coming in as
a virtual third striker alongside Ronaldo and Bebeto.
	   The change would give Brazil more firepower and possibly a
tactical option if it gets behind in a game. That team trained with
that formation on Friday.
	   ``Denilson is important because he can change our movement,''
Zagallo said. ``It's something I might try.''
	   The downside is that it tinkers with several positions at once.
And with three midfield changes in as many games _ Leonardo
replaced Giovanni in the starting lineup against Morocco _ the
sector has not achieved the ``consistency'' Zagallo seeks.
	   Still, Zagallo is an enthusiastic fan of Denilson's agile,
sinuous style. Even if he doesn't start against Norway, he almost
surely will see playing time.
	   ``I'm ready, wherever the Professor wants to put me,'' said
Denilson, using the players' respectful nickname for Zagallo.
``Just playing in a Cup at 20 makes me happy.''
	   A different problem awaits Zagallo in the defensive line,
precisely the area that gave him the most headaches against
Scotland.
	   Both starting fullbacks, Junior Baiano and Aldair, have one
yellow card. Under Cup rules, pending yellow cards are erased after
the first round. But if either gets a second yellow against Norway,
he must sit out the first game of the next round _ when a loss
means elimination.
	   ``If I put them both in, I could lose one or both for the next
game, which is the one that will count,'' said Zagallo. ``But I
won't put in two (reserve) backs who lack game rhythm against a
team that plays only high balls.''
	   His likely compromise is to pull one starter and risk the other.
Although Zagallo wouldn't name names, on Friday Goncalves started
on the ``A'' squad alongside Junior Baiano.
	   If it's up to the starters, the subs won't get a chance.
	   ``I want to play, the more the better,'' said Junior Baiano, a
6-foot-4 (1.92 meter) back who doesn't back off from contact. ``You
can't think of getting a yellow card because if you do, you'll get
one. But in a World Cup you can't spare yourself because of a card.
And staying idle for 10 days is bad, you lose rhythm.''
	   Aldair, a starter on Brazil's 1994 World Cup champions, took a
longer view.
	   ``I want to play, sure, but we have to think of the future,'' he
said. ``And the future isn't Norway. It's the next round.''
	   Meanwhile, team captain Dunga warned against taking the Norway
game too lightly. For Brazil, there's no such thing as a
meaningless game.
	   ``We have a duty to win,'' he said. ``Just wait and see what
happens if we lose.''

Ukrainian newspapers allege persecution by authorities

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A handful of bored journalists stand in the
corridor of the newspaper office, chatting and smoking. In the
newsroom, computers are idle, screens blank.
	   Editor Volodymyr Ruban sits in his spacious office fuming.
	   A purely political decision, he says of a court ruling that
forced his highly successful daily newspaper, Vseukrainskiye
Vedomosti, to suspend publication in March.
	   A growing number of Ukrainian editors and journalists complain
that the government is using civil suits and tax inspections to
silence critics in the dozens of opposition publications that began
after the Soviet Union broke up and Ukraine became independent.
	   Government officials say newspapers are crying persecution to
cover up mistakes and a lack of professionalism.
	   President Leonid Kuchma's opponents say the situation started to
deteriorate just before March parliamentary elections in which the
opposition scored significant gains.
	   ``The goal is to eliminate the newspapers they dislike, which
also serves as a lesson to others,'' Ruban said in an interview.
	   ``Even if this goal is not achieved ... a journalist would think
five times before writing anything critical about a minister, the
president or the mayor of Kiev,'' he said.
	   Some opposition newspapers have been closed, others have lost
libel suits and been unable to pay fines of more than a million
dollars.
	   Earlier this year, the Pravda Ukrainy newspaper, affiliated with
a centrist Hromada movement, suspended publication because of
errors in its government registration papers. Attempts to
reregister have failed. Tax officials also recently froze the
Politika newspaper's bank accounts.
	   Deputy Information Minister Oleh Bai says claims of persecution
are a smokescreen and that newspapers have only themselves to blame
for what he called ``pathological inaccuracy.''
	   ``We have cases in which some print media play beyond the legal
field, I'd say beyond the boundaries of decency, and therefore
provoke court cases,'' Bai told The Associated Press.
	   Ruban's newspaper, Vedomosti, suspended publication after being
fined dlrs 1.75 million in a libel suit.
	   Vedomosti reported the newspaper was fined for suggesting that
Grigory Surkis, chairman of the popular Dinamo Kiev soccer club,
planned to sell a top player to an Italian team in a deal in which
he would benefit personally. The newspaper claims the government
pushed through the case and made appeal almost impossible.
	   In another recent case, the pro-opposition Kievskiye Vedomosti
lost a libel case against Ukraine's interior minister and was
ordered to pay dlrs 2.5 million for falsely accusing him of
corruption.
	   The case involved claims the minister brought a luxury car using
money from a fund to help the families of dead police officers.
	   Newspaper officials said they would appeal the verdict.
	   Occasionally, newspapers and the opposition do win in court.
	   A Kiev court ordered tax authorities to return about dlrs
600,000 seized from Pravda Ukrainy, after a top official from the
affiliated Hromada party, Julia Timoshenko, won a libel suit
against a local newspaper.
	   According to Ruban, authorities pay less attention to broadcast
media because major TV and radio networks all are controlled to
some extent by the Kuchma administration or its allies.
	   Ruban and some fellow journalists expect the press to remain
under intense pressure during the run up to 1999 presidential
elections.
	   ``The authorities will do everything possible so that the
current president remains in power,'' Ruban said. ``There are well
worked-out methods of eliminating critical media and they will be
used.''

Iranian POW negotiator holds talks with Iraqi ministers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The head of Iran's prisoner of war
commission held talks with two Iraqi Cabinet ministers Saturday, in
a bid to glean information about thousands of Iranian POWs
allegedly in Iraq, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf and Defense Minister
Sultan Hashim Ahmed discussed the POW issue with Abdullah al-Najai,
the chairman of Iran's POWs commission, INA reported.
	   Al-Najafi is pressing the Iraqi authorities for information on
thousands of Iranian POWs that the Tehran government believes are
still held in Iraq, an Iranian diplomat said Friday. He arrived in
Baghdad on Tuesday.
	   Iraq has long maintained that it has released all Iranian
prisoners captured in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, but Iran does not
accept this. The countries accuse each other of hiding POWs and
preventing visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross
to prisoner camps.
	   The issue of POWs and missing persons remains a stumbling block
to normalizing relations between the two neighbors.
	   Al-Sahhaf told al-Najafi that the two states needed to ``speed
up the closure of what remains from the POW and Missing-In-Action
file,'' INA said.
	   The ICRC representative in Baghdad, Manuel Bessler, told The
Associated Press that his organization has had difficulty visiting
POWs on both sides on a regular basis.
	   In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three
POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law detainees in the
largest exchange since 1990.
	   More than 1 million people were killed or wounded in the
Iran-Iraq War.

Exit polls have socialists leading in Czech early elections apparently not in parliament.

Eds: LEADS with preliminary official results; extremist Republicans
By NADIA RYBAROVA

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ For the first time since Communist
rule ended in 1989, Czechs backed the center-left Social Democrats
in early parliamentary elections, preliminary official results
suggested Saturday.
	   The results showed the center-left Social Democrats, led by
Milos Zeman, leading the race with 32.74 percent, but far short of
winning a parliamentary majority.
	   ``People wanted change and it is the task of the Social
Democrats to bring about that change,'' Vladimir Spidla, Social
Democrat vice-chairman, told Nova private television.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus was second with 23.06 percent of the vote, according to the
preliminary results released by the Central Election Committee.
	   The preliminary results represented only about 5 percent of the
more than 14,000 voting precincts.
	   Klaus, who was ousted last December when his center-right
minority coalition government fell apart over a party finance
scandal, had no immediate comment.
	   Three other parties were shown as clearing the 5 percent
threshold needed for parliamentary representation, according to the
committee _ the Communists, Christian Democrats and center-right
Freedom Union, formed mostly of rebels against Klaus.
	   In contrast to an exit poll by the normally reliable Austrian
agency IFES, the preliminary results indicated the extremist
Republican Party had not made it into parliament.
	   Both the exit poll and preliminary results suggested the
populist Pensioners for Secure Living, which headed into the polls
as a strong smaller party, had not made the cut.

	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The main organization of former Soviet
states needs to do more to integrate the regional economy, its
executive director, Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky, said Saturday.
	   Berezovsky, who is trying to invigorate the Commonwealth of
Independent States, spoke to reporters after meeting with Armenian
president Robert Kocharyan and prime-minister Armen Darbinyan.
	   ``We came to an agreement that during the summer we will form
the main mechanisms of financial and economical cooperation of
Armenia with other CIS countries,'' Berezovsky said of his talks
with Darbinyan.
	   He said they also discussed the financial crisis in Russia and
the efforts other former Soviet republics are taking toward
financial integration.

	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Richard Krajicek, who pulled out of
the Heineken Trophy grass-court tournament Friday with a knee
injury, was practicing Saturday at the All England Club to prepare
for Wimbledon.
	   After winning a lengthy match against Czech Slava Dosedel, 7-6
(7-3), 6-7, the 1996 Wimbledon champion pulled out of his
quarterfinal against compatriot Dennis van Scheppingen.
	   Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad quoted Krajicek Saturday as
saying he was having trouble with his forehand because of the
left-knee injury but would play Wimbledon, which begins Monday.
	   ``But well, I will go to Wimbledon,'' he said. ``I'm not an
invalid yet. I can walk and still go to the backhand.''
	   Dutch television said Krajicek, seeded No. 9 at Wimbledon, had
met with his doctor and could face surgery later this year. He had
surgery on his right knee more than a year ago.

World Cup: Two times lucky, Austria hopes for win against Italy 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARGAUX, France (AP) _ Two times lucky. But if the third match
goes the same way, it may not be enough.
	   In its first two World Cup games, Austria has been outplayed
only to end up with a tie both times because of second-half injury
time goals. The mathematics of Group B means that another 1-1 score
Tuesday against group favorite Italy probably won't get the
Austrians into the second round.
	   ``We have to go out on the field with a winners' mentality,''
said forward Toni Polster, who is set to break the Austrian record
of 93 international caps against Italy. He's currently tied with
1950s great Gerhard Hanappi.
	   Midfielder Ivica Vastic, the substitute who kept Austria in the
tournament with an injury-time goal against Chile on Wednesday, has
apparently earned a starting berth against Italy because of his
feat. He was put on the likely starters' team for Saturday's
practice.
	   ``We have 90 minutes _ or more,'' he said, alluding to his goal
and that of Polster, which netted the equalizer in the opening game
against Cameroon.
	   Still, with Chile tipped to win against Cameroon, the Austrians
must win against group-leader Italy on Tuesday at St. Denis if they
realistically hope to advance.
	   Austrian spirit was high despite that daunting prospect, with
some on the squad jokingly proposing unorthodox strategy.
	   ``We've already considered letting the first one go in against
us,'' forward Roman Maehlich said. ``Then we can open up.''
	   The Austrians know their shortcomings _ adequate-to-good defense
but spotty offense, plus the psychological drawback of not winning
against Italy since 1960.
	   ``We've shown that we are physically fit,'' Polster said. ``Our
shortcomings are more in the technical aspects of soccer.''
	   Polster, who played for AC Turin between 1987-88, said he
expected the Italians to try to break the Austrians' rhythm with
fouls they hope will go undetected.
	   Coach Herbert Prohaska said the team planned to watch a video on
Sunday of Italy's 3-0 defeat of Cameroon. Despite their favored
status, the Italians are taking Tuesday's game seriously, he said.
	   ``They are putting as much emphasis on the match as if they were
playing against Brazil,'' he said.
	   But goalkeeper Michael Konsel disagreed.
	   ``They are taking us a little lightly, and that's a big
advantage for us,'' he said.
	   Much of training Saturday was focused on speed, with the players
leapfrogging each other, running the slalom and doing wind sprints
before playing on a reduced field.

Pope urges Europeans to reconcile with Jews 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS detail of leaflets in 14th graf.
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Europeans must seek reconciliation with
the Jews for the ``unspeakable suffering'' inflicted on them, Pope
John Paul II said Saturday as he set down a tough agenda for the
old continent.
	   Addressing Austrian officials and diplomats in the former
Imperial Palace, the pope listed duties and sacrifices required of
Europeans to overcome injustices and economic disparity.
	   ``Don't forget the history of Europe is clsoely intertwined with
the history of that people from which the Lord Jesus came,'' John
Paul said. ``The Jewish people have been inflicted with unspeakable
suffering in Europe, and we can't affirm that all the roots of
these injustices have been cut.''
	   ``Reconciliation with the Jews is one of the fundamental duties
of Christians in Europe,'' John Paul said.
	   Sitting among the dignitaries was former Austrian President Kurt
Waldheim, who drew the ire of Jewish groups because of his alleged
complicity in war crimes by the German army in World War II.
	   Waldheim denied the accusations, but remains on the U.S. ``Watch
List'' of people barred entry to the United States, despite
previously living there for years as an Austrian diplomat and then
as Secretary General of the United Nations in New York.
	   Waldheim, invited to Saturday's ceremony as a former Austrian
head of state, shook John Paul's hand and chatted briefly with him
during the encounter in the Hofburg palace, now used for ceremonies
and as the official seat of Austria's president.
	   The pope received Waldheim in the Vatican in 1987, and Waldheim
welcomed the pope on his last trip to Austria in 1988, leading to
protests by Jews.
	   John Paul, who was 19 years old when the Nazis occupied his
native Poland, has spoken out often against anti-Semitism and the
horrors of the Holocaust, when an estimated six million Jews
perished at the hands of the Nazis.
	   But Saturday was believed to be the first time he put the burden
specifically on Europeans to make amends.
	   Later, the pope celebrated an open-air Mass at St. Poelten, some
60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Vienna, where the local bishop has
become the center of a storm that epitomizes the divisions rocking
Austria's Roman Catholic church.
	   Many of the participants carried tiny flags in the Vatican's
yellow and white colors expressing loyalty to the pope and
Monsignor Kurt Krenn, the conservative bishop of St. Poelten who
has vocally defended an Austrian cardinal forced out by the Vatican
following accusations of pedophilia.
	   Catholics seeking such major church reforms as abolition of
priestly celibacy and admission of women to the priesthood have
seized on the case as an example of how conservative clergy has
disillusioned Austrian Catholics.
	   Opponents of Krenn handed out leaflets and held up black
balloons as protest symbols. Among other things, the leaflets
noticed that 54,000 people in the diocese had asked for Krenn's
recall years ago and his continued work ``makes a mockery of the
office of bishop.''
	   In his morning address, John Paul noted the aspirations of the
former communist countries in Europe as the 15-nation European
Union considers taking them in. The pope insisted that Western
Europe cannot remain an ``island of Western well-being on the
continent.''
	   ``The richer countries, inevitably, will have to make concrete
sacrifices'' to overcome the ``inhuman'' economic differences, the
pope said.
	   John Paul also said these countries should remain open to
accepting immigrants from other countries.
	   He used his international audience to renew his attack on what
he called an expanding ``culture of death'' in the world, referring
to abortion and euthanasia.
	   He said Austria's law allowing abortions in the first three
months of preganancy ``remains a bleeding wound in my heart.''

Saudis fire Parreira, Croatia beats Japan to advance referees; changes byline, will be updated after Saturday's later games AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW with Parreira fired; Croatia qualifies; FIFA speaks on
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Four years after leading Brazil to a record fourth
World Cup title, Carlos Alberto Parreira was fired by Saudi Arabia
on Saturday.
	   The Brazilian coach was shown the door two days after the Saudis
became the first of the 32 teams to be eliminated from the World
Cup, beaten 4-0 by host France following a 1-0 defeat by Denmark.
	   ``As of now we are no longer with the Saudi team,'' Parreira
told reporters at the team hotel outside Paris.
	   ``I don't feel happy and I don't feel comfortable with the
decision taken by the Saudi officials. At least they should have
let us continue until the end of the World Cup.''
	   His firing came on the day Croatia virtually assured itself of a
place in the second round at its first attempt.
	   Real Madrid striker Davor Suker fired the only goal in a 1-0
victory over Japan in the 77th minute. Japan, another World Cup
first timer, will drop out Sunday if two-time titlist Argentina
avoids defeat to the third debutant in the group, Jamaica, at Parc
des Princes.
	   The result at Nantes was Croatia's second victory and Japan's
second loss. The Croatians began their first World Cup campaign
with a 3-1 victory over the Jamaicans and Japan lost 1-0 to
Argentina.
	   Saturday's other games were in Group E, with the Netherlands
facing South Korea in Marseille and Belgium meeting Mexico in
Bordeaux.
	   While it was all going well for Croatia and its coach Miroslav
Blazevic, the World Cup was ending for Parreira, who is the eighth
coach to be sacked by the Saudis in less than four years.
	   He had signed a one-year contract with the Saudi federation in
December, abandoning his two-year deal with the New York-New Jersey
MetroStars of the United States' Major League Soccer after one
season, for a reported dlrs 3 million and his second spell with the
team.
	   Parreira led Kuwait in 1982 and the United Arab Emirates in 1990
to the World Cup finals and the Saudis won the Asian Cup in under
him in 1988.
	   He and Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic are the only two men to
coach four different national teams in the World Cup finals.
	   The Brazilian said the reason given for his dismissal their
``very high expectations _ at least to repeat what they had done in
the last World Cup, to reach the second round.''
	   Since the team failed to achieve the goal, he said, ``they have
taken the decision to cancel my contract and not to coach the Saudi
team any further.''
	   While the Saudi federation was unhappy about their team's
results under Parreira, FIFA said it was satisfied with the
performances of the referees.
	   ``We're happy so far with refereeing,'' said Michel Zen
Ruffinen, acting general secretary of soccer's world governing body
in reaction to widespread criticism of the wildly fluctuating
frequency of red cards.
	   The day after FIFA president Sepp Blatter had accused the
referees of leniency, five players were expelled in two games.
	   Zen Ruffinen said Thursday's flurry at the Denmark-South Africa
and France-Saudi games was ``not a reaction'' to Blatter's
statement.
	   He called the ``technical'' aspect of referring _ recognizing
and calling fouls _ generally ``good and even very good'' through
the first third of the 64 matches.

Some of expanded Uffizi in Florence to open in December 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ The first of new gallery rooms in the
Uffizi museum's expansion will open to the public on Dec. 16,
Italy's culture minister said Saturday.
	   Minister Veltroni, visiting the musuem, did not say which rooms
or which works of art would be able to be seen on that day.
	   Last summer, Veltroni announced that by 2000 the museum will
quadruple its visiting space and double the number of art works on
display.
	   To create space, the state archives and offices for fine arts
officials are being transferred from the gallery. The rooms will be
filled with works now in the Uffizi storehouse and with
contributions from other museums.
	   The Uffizi gallery suffered damage from a 1993 Mafia bombing
that killed five people. Thiry-four paintings damaged in the blast
are undergoing restoration.

Iraq accepts spare parts resolution, reversing earlier opposition 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to fix slug
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Saturday it accepts the U.N.
Security Council resolution on buying spare parts for its oil
industry, reversing its earlier opposition to the motion.
	   ``Iraq will deal with the Security Council resolution No. 1175
of 1998,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman told the official Iraqi
News Agency.
	   By the resolution that the Security Council passed unanimously
Friday, Iraq is permitted to spend dlrs 300 million of revenues
from the oil-for-food program to buy spare parts to repair and
upgrade its oil industry.
	   Only on Monday, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said his
government ``is not going to accept this resolution.''
	   He warned it could trigger the ``collapse of the whole
(oil-for-food) program,'' by which Iraq is entitled to sell limited
amounts of oil to finance purchases of food, medicine and
humanitarian goods. The program, currently renewed every six
months, enables Iraq to bypass the sanctions imposed after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Later this week, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
sent a letter to the Security Council saying the resolution
``contradicts the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding'' signed
between Iraq and the United Nations in 1996 ``because it ignores
the fact that this (oil-for-food) program is an exceptional
arrangement and a temporary one.''
	   ``Iraq totally rejects the transfer of the oil-for-food program
from a temporary measure to a permanent and ongoing formula,''
al-Sahhaf wrote.
	   On Saturday the Foreign Ministry spokesman said Iraq believes
the resolution contains nothing that would transform the
oil-for-food program into an indefinite measure to be applied until
U.N. sanctions on Iraq are lifted.
	   The spokesman said Iraq would have rejected the resolution if it
had contained ``any interpretation contradicting the temporary and
exceptional nature of this program.''
	   However, the resolution reduces Baghdad's ability to delay
aspects of the program as part of its campaign against the
sanctions.
	   Since the program began in December 1996, Iraq has been
submitting to the United Nations every six months a plan for the
distribution of the food and medicine purchased with oil revenues.
	   Iraq had often delayed its submission of the plan, and suspended
its oil sales, in an attempt to whittle away support for the
sanctions.
	   With Friday's resolution, if Iraq submits no plan, the previous
one remains in force. U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said the
resolution ensures no further gaps in Iraqi oil sales.

European Union ambassadors to leave Belarus EDITS to trim.

Eds: UPDATES with Germany asking Belarusian ambassador to leave,
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Ambassadors from five European Union
nations are returning home Monday for consultations with their
governments on the Belarusian government's attempt to evict them
from a diplomatic compound.
	   Germany went a step further, asking the Belarusian ambassador in
Bonn to return home to Minsk.
	   The ambassadors of Britain, France, Greece, Italy and Germany
went to the Foreign Ministry on Saturday to deliver a note to the
head of protocol saying they were leaving Belarus on Monday.
	   The Belarusian government has been trying to force ambassadors
out of their homes in a diplomatic compound on the outskirts of the
capital, Minsk, claiming the residences are badly in need of sewer
and plumbing repairs.
	   British ambassador Jessica Mary Pearce said the EU ambassadors
were returning home ``for consultations'' to protest the attempts
to evict them from their homes.
	   Germany's foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, requested Saturday
that Belarusian ambassador Pjotr Beljajew return home from Bonn.
	   He said Beljajew's departure would make clear Europe's
disapproval with the Belarusian government. He said the other EU
nations supported his suggestion that the ambassador leave Germany.
	   ``The actions of the Belarusian government are completely
incomprehensible,'' Kinkel said in a written statement. ``President
Lukashenko is maneuvering his country ever deeper into isolation.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said in Moscow that
Russia has no immediate plans to recall its ambassador because of
the dispute.
	   ``Our Belarusian friends are not acting via diplomatic means,''
Primakov told the Zerkalo television program. He said he hoped
``this misunderstanding will all be sorted out somehow, but not at
the expense of recalling all the ambassadors.''
	   On Friday, the Belarusian government cut water and power
supplies to the compound to force the ambassadors out.
	   Workers also dug a ditch immediately inside the compound's
gates, preventing ambassadors' cars from entering. Diplomats were
given temporary IDs valid until the end of the year to enter their
residences.
	   The ambassadors have protested that the order for them to leave
their residences violates the Vienna Convention which designates
ambassadors' homes as territory of their countries.
	   President Alexander Lukashenko claims the diplomatic residences
are his own property. He has a residence adjacent to the compound.
	   The government has offered the ambassadors new apartments in
downtown Minsk, cottages 30 kilometers (20 miles) outside Minsk or
plots on which to build new residences.

World Cup: Moroccan coach getting sick of same questions 
</HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ With days left until the
all-deciding Morocco-Scotland match, Atlas Lions coach Henri
Michel's patience is wearing thin _ with journalists.
	   ``Pppaah, I just answered that question,'' Michel grumbled when
a Scottish reporter asked if he was confident about a Moroccan win
on June 23.
	   ``Yes, confident yes,'' he said, with a dismissive wave of the
hand.
	   Michel's small outburst Saturday comes after reporters asked the
same questions he had just answered during an extensive 40 minute
press conference.
	   Fair enough to get irritated at repeating oneself.
	   The problem, however, is that the Moroccan team's press
conferences are in French leaving English-only speaking reporters
with baffled looks on their faces, and Michel often fuming when the
same questions get asked again.
	   ``It's my fault,'' he said after apologizing for his short
reply.
	   ``I keep holding these press conferences every day. And every
day I get the same questions.''
	   Interpretation is sometimes available through the Moroccan
Football Federation's press officer, Bouleid Boumeid.
	   But Boumeid is more comfortable speaking Arabic than English,
meaning that Michel's comments are sometimes relayed to
Arabic-speaking reporters who then translate them to English.
	   Michel's irritation is not only a result of having to repeat
himself. In charged comments Saturday, the Moroccan coach blasted
the media for focusing on the team's negative aspects.
	   ``You (the media) don't mention that only a few players like
(Noureddine) Naybet and (Moustafa) Hadji have previous World Cup
experience,'' Michel said in comments translated by a Moroccan
journalist.
	   ``You forget that and only focus on the small mistakes the team
makes,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Reporters, themselves, are getting irritated at the language
barrier, often missing out on announcements such as today's
statement that Michel would be changing the starting lineup for the
next match.
	   While he did not offer details, he said that goalie Driss
Benzekri, who is believed to be suffering from tendinitis, and
defender Abdelkrim el-Hadrioui, believed to have a pinched nerve in
his leg, are waiting for x-ray results. It is likely that they will
be replaced by veteran goalie Abdelkader el-Brazi and defender
Lahcen Abrami.
	   Given the language barrier, a crash course in French would have
been advisable, especially since only one player, midfielder Rachid
Azzouzi, speaks English. The rest speak French and Arabic.
	   Still, the players are more-than-willing to answer questions _
when they can understand them.
	   ``Moustafa, Moustafa, what are your expectations in the match
against Scotland?'' one reporter yelled, waving frantically at
Deportivo la Coruna midfielder Moustafa Hadji.
	   ``Sorry, I don't speak English,'' Hadji said, smiling
apologetically as he was led away for an interview by a
French-speaking Moroccan.
	   The reporter went off in search of Azzouzi.

Unions vow to fight bank sale 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Striking bank workers said Saturday they
would challenge in court the decision to sell the country's
fourth-largest bank, while the government vowed to press on with
its privatization program.
	   The privatization of the state-owned Ionian Bank was approved
under heavy security at a shareholders meeting late Friday, nearly
12 hours after strikers stormed a meeting to vote on the sale.
	   ``No small group armed with violence is going to sway the
country from its course toward modernization,'' Premier Costas
Simitis told reporters Saturday.
	   In what was seen as a key test of the government's debt-cutting
resolve, management pushed through the sale of a 51.4 stake despite
violent worker opposition.
	   ``This decision was illegal,'' said Ioannis Markakis, president
of Ionian's union. ``It shows once again that the government is
panicking.''
	   Strikers overturned tables, dismantled microphones and assaulted
Ionian Bank management before the first vote was called off.
	   At a general meeting scheduled for late Saturday, Ionian workers
will decide whether to continue striking or take other measures to
fight the bank's sale. They are demanding job and pension
guarantees.
	   Markakis said the union would file a lawsuit asking that the
shareholders meeting be ruled illegal.

Louise Woodward has 'lots of answers,' mother says 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: restores dropped word ``Saturday'' in graf 7
<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Louise Woodward will give a BBC
interviewer ``lots of answers'' about the death of the baby in her
care, her mother said Saturday.
	   ``She's anxious to speak. You'll get lots of answers,'' Susan
Woodward said as her daughter met with an interviewer from the
British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Ms. Woodward returned to her home in Elton in northeast England
after the Supreme Court of Justice in Massachusetts affirmed her
conviction and sentence for the death of baby Matthew Eappen. The
trial jury found Ms. Woodward guilty of second-degree murder, but
the judge reduced that to manslaughter and her sentence to time
served.
	   The family says she received no money for the BBC interview. The
interviewer, Martin Bashir, is best known for his one-on-one
interview with Princess Diana in 1995.
	   ``She feels anxious to be able to speak. She wants people to be
able to listen to what she's got to say. She wants people to see
her as a person.
	   ``You saw how she conducted herself at the airport with
confidence, but you only got snippets of what she had to say,''
Mrs. Woodward told Press Association, the British news agency.
	   The Daily Mail, which has confirmed that it paid 40,000 pounds (
dlrs 66,000) to Ms. Woodward's parents in November, published a
long article on Saturday which it said was based on contacts with
the girl and her parents over several months.
	   The Daily Mail said Ms. Woodward had a recurring dream about
walking in Elton, wearing nothing by a sweater, and feeling the
stares of villagers.
	   ``I keep walking trying to get away from the stares,'' the Daily
Mail quoted her as saying.
	   ``There isn't actually a canal in Elton but in my dream there
is. There are all these babies floating in the water. The mothers
walk calmly along the side of the canal and I can't do anything to
save the babies.''
	   The Daily Mail's article did not say when that conversation with
Ms. Woodward took place.

World Cup: Too much golf for some Norwegians? AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ With a do-or-die game coming up against
defending World Cup champion Brazil, you'd expect the Norwegians to
really concentrate on what they call ``fotball''.
	   Yet some of them have spent nearly as much time on the golf
course adjacent to their hotel as on the training field. The Flo
brothers, Tore Andre and Jostein, and their cousin Havard, are
regulars at the La Baule Golf Club.
	   ``They come here virtually every day,'' said caddie master
Jean-Marie Cavelle. ``They're good football players, but not very
good golfers. Tore Andre's swing was not very good at first, but
it's getting better and better.''
	   Tore Andre Flo, the tall Chelsea striker, said he had played
only five or six rounds when he arrived at the Norwegians training
camp at Saint-Andre-des-Eaux almost three weeks ago.
	   ``I have no handicap yet, but it's a fun game,'' he said.
	   Coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen decided to give the players more
free time in France compared the the United States four years ago,
when the team failed to reach the second round.
	   Olsen decided not to ban golf in France, but he said ``it
wouldn't be very good to be there for hours a day.''
	   La Baule, one of top-rated courses in France, hosted one French
Open and stars like Jack Nicklaus, Nick Faldo, Seve Ballesteros,
Johnny Miller and Ian Woosnam have all played the parklands layout
designed by Peter Alliss.
	   After drawing Morocco 2-2 and Scotland 1-1, the Norwegians
probably need to beat Brazil in Tuesday's Group A finale in
Marseille to qualify for the second round for the first time ever.
	   Since his debut as coach in 1990 against Cameroon, Olsen has
never used the same team in two straight games and he's expected to
make several changes against Brazil.
	   ``My biggest problem is midfield,'' he said. ``We must be more
aggressive. There are 11, 12 alternatives,'' Olsen said.
	   Norway's midfield features five men in a 4-5-1 system with a
lone striker, Tore Andre Flo. If Norway needs a goal toward the end
of the Brazil game, Olsen might send on another striker.
	   Flo, nicknamed ``Flonaldo'' after scoring twice in a 4-2
exhibition win against Ronaldo's Brazil in Oslo a year ago, did not
impress in the first two games. But he is expected to start against
Brazil.
	   Tuesday's game marks the second straight World Cup in which
Brazil faces a Scandinavian side in the last match of the first
round. In the '94 Cup, Brazil drew eventual bronze medalist Sweden
1-1 in Pontiac, Mich. Sweden, Norway's neighbour, lost 1-0 to
Brazil in the semfinals.
	   All Norwegian players are healthy and Jostein Flo, who limped
off the field 24 hours earlier with a banged-up thigh, was back in
training Saturday although he spent most of the time jogging around
the pitch.

Pope urges Europeans to reconcile with Jews 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with new quotes throughout
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Europeans must seek reconciliation with
the Jews for the ``unspeakable suffering'' inflicted on them, Pope
John Paul II said Saturday as he set down a tough agenda for the
old continent.
	   Addressing Austrian officials and diplomats in the former
Imperial Palace, the pope listed duties and sacrifices required of
Europeans to overcome injustices and economic disparity.
	   ``Don't forget the history of Europe is clsoely intertwined with
the history of that people from which the Lord Jesus came,'' John
Paul said. ``The Jewish people have been inflicted with unspeakable
suffering in Europe, and we can't affirm that all the roots of
these injustices have been cut.
	   ``Reconciliation with the Jews is one of the fundamental duties
of Christians in Europe,'' he said.
	   Sitting among the dignitaries was former Austrian President Kurt
Waldheim, who drew the ire of Jewish groups because of his alleged
complicity in war crimes by the German army in World War II, and
because he concealed his past as an officer in the German army.
	   Waldheim denied the accusations, but remains on the U.S. ``Watch
List'' of people barred entry to the United States, despite
previously living there for years as an Austrian diplomat and then
as Secretary General of the United Nations in New York.
	   The pope received Waldheim in the Vatican in 1987, and Waldheim
welcomed the pope on his last trip to Austria in 1988, leading to
protests by Jews.
	   John Paul, who was 19 years old when the Nazis occupied his
native Poland, has spoken out often against anti-Semitism and the
horrors of the Holocaust, when an estimated six million Jews
perished at the hands of the Nazis.
	   But Saturday was believed to be the first time he put the burden
specifically on Europeans to make amends.
	   Later, the pope celebrated an open-air Mass at St. Poelten, some
60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Vienna, where the local bishop has
become the center of a storm that epitomizes the divisions rocking
Austria's Roman Catholic church.
	   Many of the participants carried tiny flags in the Vatican's
yellow and white colors expressing loyalty to the pope and
Monsignor Kurt Krenn, the conservative bishop of St. Poelten who
has vocally defended an Austrian cardinal forced out by the Vatican
following accusations of pedophilia.
	   Catholics seeking such major church reforms as abolition of
priestly celibacy and admission of women to the priesthood have
seized on the case as an example of how conservative clergy has
disillusioned Austrian Catholics.
	   Opponents of Krenn handed out leaflets and held up black
balloons as protest symbols. Among other things, the leaflets
noticed that 54,000 people in the diocese had asked for Krenn's
recall years ago and his continued work ``makes a mockery of the
office of bishop.''
	   In his morning address, John Paul noted the aspirations of the
former communist countries in Europe as the 15-nation European
Union considers taking them in. The pope insisted that Western
Europe cannot remain an ``island of Western well-being on the
continent.''
	   ``The richer countries, inevitably, will have to make concrete
sacrifices'' to overcome the ``inhuman'' economic differences, the
pope said.
	   John Paul also said these countries should remain open to
accepting immigrants from other countries.
	   He used his international audience to renew his attack on what
he called an expanding ``culture of death'' in the world, referring
to abortion and euthanasia.
	   He said Austria's law allowing abortions in the first three
months of preganancy ``remains a bleeding wound in my heart.''

World Cup: Argentina, on a roll, can advance by beating Boyz 
</HEADLINE>
By VICENTE LEONARDO PANETTA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The way storied Argentina has been on a roll, World
Cup newcomer Jamaica should not present much of a roadblock on the
way to the second round.
	   A win Sunday at the Parc des Princes against the Reggae Boyz
would clinch no worse than second place in Group H for Argentina,
putting the two-time titlists in the round of 16.
	   Although his team is undefeated in its last six matches,
including France '98 warmups, and has not conceded a goal in that
span, Argentina coach Daniel Passarella has preached caution this
week. ``Beware of Jamaica,'' has been his mantra.
	   Argentina won its first game here 1-0 against Japan, another
first-time participant, while Jamaica lost its Cup debut 3-1
against Croatia.
	   Passarella was not fully satisfied with his side's opening
performance. Argentina was saved from what would have been a
disastrous draw by an opportunistic goal by veteran striker Gabriel
Batistuta, who plays for Fiorentina in Italy's Serie A.
	   Jamaica, by contrast, was overwhelmed by the Croats throughout.
	   Passarella is likely to field mostly the same players he used
against Japan. But Jose Chamot, who has recovered from a leg
injury, seems certain to take Nelson Vivas' spot on defense.
	   With its 11 starters coming from the tough Italian or Spanish
leagues, Argentina is vastly more experienced than Jamaica, which
is expected to field only five starters who play in Europe.
	   And should Batistuta and Co. falter, Passarella has a wealth of
talent to call off the bench, including Abel Balbo, Marcelo
Gallardo and Hernan Crespo.
	   But Passarella has said nothing about his lineup so as to ``not
give anything away'' to Jamaica, which he termed a ``bothersome and
difficult team.''
	   His players also were tight-lipped this week, refusing to make
comments about their next opponent.
	   The Jamaicans, meanwhile, refuse to give anything away.
	   ``Jamaica will qualify, that's for sure,'' said coach Rene
Simoes, a Brazilian. He tempered his comment after a second's
thought. ``Well, if Argentina plays us as it played Brazil, we
haven't got a chance. But if it plays as it did against Japan, then
I have hopes.''
	   Argentina beat defending World Cup champion Brazil 1-0 in a
friendly match in April at Rio de Janeiro, its first win in that
country in 41 years.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Clear to partly cloudy skies prevailed across the local area
overnight. Isolated showers were seen moving west-northwest through
the local coastal waters, but had begun to increase across the
southwest waters after 3 a.m. Moderate southeast trade winds kept
coastal temperatures warm overnight, near 80 degrees at many
coastal locations.
	   A tropical wave has moved westward across the local area
overnight but had produced little in the way of weather for our
islands by 5 a.m. This wave has lost much of the shower and
thunderstorm activity that accompanied it into the Lesser Antilles
24 hours ago and suggests a drier and more stable local atmosphere.
In fact, the upper-level trough across our region for the past week
has finally moved east into the Atlantic and has been replaced by
weak high pressure. This will maintain more stable conditions in
the middle and upper levels of the atmosphere through Sunday to
produce much less thunderstorm activity than during recent days.
The trade winds are also forecast to increase across the region
over the weekend as high pressure builds southwest into the
Caribbean behind the exiting tropical wave.
	   Look for mostly sunny to partly cloudy skies through noon time
today with conditions becoming breezy along the coasts and higher
elevations. An increase in cloudiness during the afternoon across
interior, western and northwestern Puerto Rico is expected to lead
to widely scattered to scattered showers and thunderstorms with
showers more isolated across the rest of the area. Drier weather
and few showers are forecast for tonight and Sunday as dry high
pressure dominates the eastern Caribbean. The next tropical wave
will move into the eastern Caribbean Monday.

Iranian POW negotiator holds talks with Iraqi ministers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The head of Iran's prisoner of war
commission met with two Iraqi Cabinet ministers Saturday in a bid
to glean information about thousands of Iranian POWs allegedly in
Iraq, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf told Abdullah
al-Najafi that the two states needed to ``speed up the closure of
what remains from the POW and Missing-In-Action file,'' INA said.
	   The issue of POWs and missing persons remains a stumbling block
to normalizing relations between the two neighbors.
	   Iraq has long maintained that it has released all Iranian
prisoners captured in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War. The countries
accuse each other of hiding POWs and preventing visits by the
International Committee of the Red Cross to prisoner camps.
	   The ICRC representative in Baghdad, Manuel Bessler, told The
Associated Press that his organization has had difficulty visiting
POWs on both sides on a regular basis.
	   In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three
POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law detainees in the
largest exchange since 1990.
	   More than 1 million people were killed or wounded in the
Iran-Iraq War.

World Cup: Suker finally converts, leads Croatia to 1-0 victory 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with quotes.
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Davor Suker finally converted in the 77th
minute after several near misses, giving Croatia a 1-0 victory over
Japan on Saturday and putting it on the edge of the second round in
its first appearance at the World Cup.
	   Suker had several chances that went wide or high in the first
half and put another off the top of the crossbar in the 72nd. His
frustration seemed to be at capacity when he settled a cross from
Aljosa Asanovic, and, with Eisuke Nakanishi unable to mark him,
drove a ball from 10 meters off keeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi's left
hand inside the post.
	   The victory virtually assured Croatia's place among the final 16
and all but ended Japan's chances in its first World Cup.
	   ``We have achieved our fist goal,'' Croatia coach Miroslav
Blazevic said. ``We're all very proud and we're a very small
country and already we're in the elite.''
	   Japan showed some spark at the start of the second half,
especially when Shoji Jo sent a scissors kick wide of the post in
the 58th minute.
	   But most of the game, which was played in 30-degree-plus Celsius
(mid-to-high 80s Fahrenheit), was Croatia's.
	   Suker put his chip off the top of the crossbar, the closest of
several near misses before the goal.
	   Suker ran on to a ball he had touched past a defender and caught
Kawaguchi off his line. As he neared the edge of the penalty area,
Suker lofted a ball over the keeper but it had too much and bounded
off the top side of the bar as Kawaguchi fell back into the goal.
	   Suker had three shots at goal in the first 13 minutes but poor
accuracy plagued Croatia early.
	   Suker sent a header a one meter wide of the post from the top of
the penalty area in the eight minute; volleyed a cross high from 11
meters in the 11th; and then curled a free kick less than a half
meter wide of the post in the 13th.
	   Mario Stanic had Croatia's best chances in the first half,
breaking in alone on Kawaguchi in the 19th, but he hit a
right-footed shot from 10 meters that bounced several times before
missing wide left.
	   ``Our team suffered enormously and this was a very difficult
game for us,'' Blazevic said referring to the heat and noting that
Suker lost 3.8 kilograms (eight pounds) during the match. ``I don't
think I am being partial if I say we deserved to win.''
	   Japan's best chance was thwarted when Croatian keeper Drazen
Ladic was able to get his half of left hand to a shot by Japanese
forward Masashi Nakayama.
	   Nakayama had broken inside on a feed from Hidetoshi Nakata
against the run of play, but the shot hit Ladic's hand as he was
falling away from it.
	   ``We tried to deal with a player of international class like
Suker by playing a collective game,'' Japanese coach Takeshi Okada
said. ``We tried to gather our forces for this match, but
unfortunately that was not enough.
	   ``Our approach was to have two players on each one of the other
side. For Japanese football it's not over. We have good chances in
2002 and 2006.''
	   Croatia still must play Argentina in its final first-round
match, a game that likely will decide the Group H winner.
	   Japan, which lost 1-0 to Argentina in its World Cup debut on
June 14, extended its scoreless streak to five full internationals,
having gone without a goal since Naoki Somo scored in the 86th
minute of a 1-1 draw with Paraguay on May 17.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Japan: Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi; Akira Narahashi (Hiroaki Morishima,
79th minute), Yutaka Akita, Masami Ihara, Naoki Soma, Eisuke

Soccer brings together Iranians from all sides of the political divide 
</HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) - For once, Iranians on all sides of the
political divide will be rooting for the same team at the big World
Cup match between Iran and the United States Sunday.
	   With 20 years of hostility between Iran and the United States,
the game in Lyon will be the most politically charged match of this
World Cup.
	   Iran's first World Cup appearance in 20 years has stirred
passions among Iranians who care nothing about soccer. Some have
never even lived in Iran, or left so long ago that they have even
forgotten their language.
	   Tens of thousands of Iranians left Iran after the 1979 Islamic
revolution overthrew the U.S.-supported shah and installed a strict
religious government. Many, who are still opposed to the
government, have never returned even for a visit.
	   But, when the whistle blows, they'll be rooting for the home
team alongside the thousands of Iranians who have come from Iran to
watch the World Cup.
	   ``I'm going to paint 'Iran' on my forehead and take the Iranian
flag to the game,'' said Jeilan Tehrani, a 31-year old Iranian
woman who has lived in France since she was 19.
	   ``My cousin, who's half English and never cared about Iran, is
also really excited about the Iranian team. He even wants a jersey
from the Iranian team,'' said Tehrani, who lives in the city of
Montpellier in southern France.
	   At Iran's last match, which it lost 1-0 to Yugoslavia, about
28,000 Iranians were at the game, cheering their team in a chorus.
There is no estimate for the number of Iranians in France for the
games.
	   Outside the Iranian team's living quarters in the town of
Yssingeaux in the French heartland, 6-year-old Nader Ansari stood
in the rain with his father for hours, only to get a signature from
his favorite Iranian player, striker Ali Daei.
	   ``He loves soccer, and I brought him here from our home in
Germany to see something of a country he's never seen, and perhaps
will never see,'' said Nader's father, Ali Ansari, who's married to
a German.
	   ``I think the passions stirred by the games go beyond soccer,''
said Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, who's making a film about Iranians
alienated from their country but still longing to return to their
roots.
	   ``Many live outside Iran and are totally against the Islamic
government back home. For them, soccer is just an excuse, a way of
attaching themselves to something Iranian, something that reminds
them of a home they left long ago or a country they know only from
the tales of their parents,'' said Asgharzadeh, an independent
film-maker.
	   ``That's why all of them have come here,'' he said.
	   Even hard-line opponents of the Islamic government who are bent
on overthrowing it, want Iran to win the game with the United
States.
	   ``What we and all other Iranians want is for Iran to win
Sunday's game. But support for the players does not mean support
for the barbaric regime ruling in Iran,'' said Farzin Hashemi, a
member of the Mujahedeen Khalq.
	   The Mujahedeen, the largest Iranian opposition, is outlawed in
Iran. The Iraq-based group also has offices in Europe and the
United States.
	   Across Tehran and other Iranian cities, cafes and restaurants
have installed TV sets to attract customers, and security has been
increased to control crowds _ jubilant or otherwise.
	   Some universities even postponed exams scheduled to be held
during the month-long tournament, while shops have reported
skyrocketing sales of nuts and crackers, apparently to be served as
snacks during the matches.

World Cup: History speaks for Germany, but no white flag from Yugoslavia 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ History speaks for Germany. Usually at World
Cup tournaments, Germany beats Yugoslavia. This time, the Yugoslavs
think they can reverse the trend.
	   ``Every tradition must come to an end,'' said Yugoslav coach
Slobodan Santrac. ``I think this is our chance as we have a lot to
gain, but nothing to lose in the match against Germany.''
	   Sunday's game in Lens is likely to determine the winner of Group
F. Germany beat the United States 2-0, while Yugoslavia edged Iran
1-0.
	   Germany, the European champion which is seeking to match
Brazil's record of four World Cup titles, has a 14-7 winning record
against Yugoslavia, with three draws. Of five World Cup matches,
Germany has won four.
	   Each time Germany won the World Cup _ in 1954, 1974 and 1990 _
it played and beat Yugoslavia in early rounds. Yugoslavia's only
victory was 1-0 in 1962 in the quarterfinals in Chile.
	   The last time they played, Germany routed Yugoslavia 4-1 to
launch its victorious campaign in Italy.
	   Five Germans from that lineup are still around, while only two
Yugoslavs are still on the team _ captain Dragan Stojkovic and
Dejan Savicevic, the mercurial midfielder who is unlikely to play,
however, because of a tender knee.
	   While both teams are praising each other and stressing their own
strengths, both coaches are making moves that point to cautious
tactics.
	   German coach Berti Vogts has spent the week since the game with
the United States talking about having to ``close the space'' and
is likely to use only one offensive midfielder, Andy Moeller.
	   Santrac looks likely to use only one striker, but he is world
class: Predrag Mijatovic, whose goal gave Real Madrid the Champions
Cup this season.
	   ``This will be a real battle. We have a tremendous desire to
beat the Germans, but we'll be satisfied with a draw as well,''
Mijatovic said.
	   The midfield is likely to be bolstered with Dejan Stankovic, the
19-year-old talent, to replace striker Savo Milosevic.
	   Vogts also will make some changes, but he's not saying which.
	   There is growing speculation in the German camp that Lothar
Matthaeus, the 37-year-old veteran, may be a starter as libero. In
that case, Olaf Thon would move into midfield.
	   ``The Yugoslavs have very fast forwards and Lothar is a bit
faster than Olaf. But Olaf is tactician who can play really well in
midfield,'' Vogts said Friday at the team's training ground in
Nice.
	   Matthaeus scored two goals in that victory in 1990, but now he
is only a substitute on the team. Any playing time would give him a
World Cup record _ 22 contested World Cup matches. Matthaeus is in
his fifth World Cup.
	   ``I don't want any gifts. But every player wants to play and
that's what I am trying to show in training. I am ready to play,
but I'll accept any decision by the coach,'' Matthaeus said.

Police fire in air as protests in Yemen continue pickup

Eds: CORRECTS spelling of prime minister's name grafs 5, 14; no

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Hundreds of riot police and soldiers fired
into the air Saturday in clashes with thousands of Yemenis
protesting a 40 percent hike in fuel prices.
	   The demonstrators took to the streets for the second day,
throwing rocks at police cars, smashing billboards and shouting
chants against the government, a security official said.
	   Most shops remained closed in the capital San`a. Protesters
burned tires in the city's main streets and used rocks to close
vital roads, the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Baton-wielding police chased demonstrators in streets and fired
tear gas, but there were no reports of casualties.
	   The protesters chanted against Prime Minister Abdul-Karim
al-Iryani, who came to power last month.
	   ``Iryani you fool, you raised the price of fuel,'' shouted a
crowd gathered in front of the parliament building.
	   The demonstrators called on the government to reverse its
decision, announced Thursday and implemented Friday, to raise the
prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas by about 40 percent.
	   The hikes were in line with requirements of the International
Monetary Fund to remove subsidies on petroleum products and other
commodities like flour and sugar by the end of 1998.
	   On Thursday, the state-run Yemen Oil Company said 1 gallon (3.8
liters) of gasoline would cost 133 riyals (dlrs 1), up from 95
riyals (69 cents) and 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of kerosene would sell
for 57 riyals (41.8 cents), up from 42 riyals (30 cents).
	   Cooking gas bottles would cost 200 riyals (dlrs 1.5), up from
150 riyals (dlrs 1.1), the company said.
	   The new hikes follow a decision by the government to raise the
price of petroleum products by 25 percent in July 1997.
	   The monthly salaries of civil servants range between 1,880
riyals (dlrs 142) and 26,500 riyals (dlrs 200).
	   The increase in oil prices was scheduled for January, but was
never carried out because of conflicts over political and economic
policies between former Prime Minister Faraj Bin Ghanem and
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the real power in this poor country.
	   Bin Ghanem, who spent less than a year in office, was replaced
by Abdul-Karim al-Iryani in May.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.
	   To help Yemen recover from the effects of the 1994 civil war,
the World Bank has approved a dlrs 80 million credit to support its
economic reform program.
	   Yemen produces 380,000 barrels of oil a day, earning 31 billion
riyals (dlrs 235 million) a year from exports.

Four Serbian policemen held by militants 
</HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Four Serbian policemen have been
kidnapped by militants of Kosovo Albanians' separatist army, a
senior police officer said Saturday, declining to release details.
	   Col. Bozidar Filic had no comment on whether Serbian police and
soldiers _ estimated at a total 45,000 to 50,000 men _ would
withdraw from the secessionist Serbian province, as demanded by the
West, despite 24 hours with no report of any attack by the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   He admitted that certain roads are controlled by the KLA, but
declined to comment on its claims of controlling 40 percent of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one. He also
declined to give details of how four policemen were seized, but did
confirm their kidnapping for the first time.
	   The shadowy militants have said they would negotiate with the
Serbs if security forces first withdraw. That echoes a demand by
the West, and by the Kosovo Albanians' political leader, Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   Asked about reports that Serbian forces are high in the
mountains on the border with Albania, sealing it and shooting
indiscriminately at refugees trying to flee, Filic told The
Associated Press he did not speak for the army, but ``there have
been no murders or killings of ordinary civilian population.''
	   ``But of course, we act according to the law when it comes to
terrorists,'' he added.
	   More than 300 people have died in fighting since March, when
Serbian police began a crackdown on the militants they call
``terrorists,'' who are fighting for the independence sought by
most of Kosovo Albanians.
	   The president of Albania, Rexhep Meidani, was meanwhile quoted
as telling the independent Serbian daily Danas (Today) that there
is ``no time to lose'' to stop fighting in Kosovo. He praised last
Monday's NATO air maneuvers near Kosovo borders and called for NATO
air strikes against Yugoslav military installations.
	   ``The Alliance's air show was very important and it's even more
important to maintain the momentum,'' Meidani said.
	   ``There is no time to lose, and if bloodshed and ethnic
cleansing continue, military attacks on Serbian military
instalations would increase possibility for a realistic solution,''
Meidani said. ``An international presence is needed in Kosovo...
that would prevent spreading of conflict to the entire region.''
	   Rugova reiterated to the German news magazine Der Spiegel his
own appeal for NATO air strikes ``for the protection of our
population.''
	   Rugova said Kosovo could not remain within Yugoslavia, even as a
third republic alongside Serbia and Montenegro. But he said a
protectorate could be an interim solution.
	   ``We have now the historic chance to liberate ourselves, and
that must be seized upon,'' he said.

Louise Woodward has 'lots of answers,' mother says 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: SUBS graf 8 to CORRECT 'by' to 'but'
<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Louise Woodward will give a BBC
interviewer ``lots of answers'' about the death of the baby in her
care, her mother said Saturday.
	   ``She's anxious to speak. You'll get lots of answers,'' Susan
Woodward said as her daughter met with an interviewer from the
British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Ms. Woodward returned to her home in Elton in northeast England
after the Supreme Court of Justice in Massachusetts affirmed her
conviction and sentence for the death of baby Matthew Eappen. The
trial jury found Ms. Woodward guilty of second-degree murder, but
the judge reduced that to manslaughter and her sentence to time
served.
	   The family says she received no money for the BBC interview. The
interviewer, Martin Bashir, is best known for his one-on-one
interview with Princess Diana in 1995.
	   ``She feels anxious to be able to speak. She wants people to be
able to listen to what she's got to say. She wants people to see
her as a person.
	   ``You saw how she conducted herself at the airport with
confidence, but you only got snippets of what she had to say,''
Mrs. Woodward told Press Association, the British news agency.
	   The Daily Mail, which has confirmed that it paid 40,000 pounds (
dlrs 66,000) to Ms. Woodward's parents in November, published a
long article on Saturday which it said was based on contacts with
the girl and her parents over several months.
	   The Daily Mail said Ms. Woodward had a recurring dream about
walking in Elton, wearing nothing but a sweater, and feeling the
stares of villagers.
	   ``I keep walking trying to get away from the stares,'' the Daily
Mail quoted her as saying.
	   ``There isn't actually a canal in Elton but in my dream there
is. There are all these babies floating in the water. The mothers
walk calmly along the side of the canal and I can't do anything to
save the babies.''
	   The Daily Mail's article did not say when that conversation with
Ms. Woodward took place.

World Cup: Defender pledges to be honest about fitness 
</HEADLINE>
By MORLEY MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ Injured Gareth Southgate doesn't want to
lose his World Cup place.
	   But he's not going to kid coach Glenn Hoddle that he's fit when
he isn't.
	   ``Although the boss said I had a 60-40 chance, it's difficult to
put a percentage on it,'' Southgate said Saturday two days ahead of
England's second game against Romania in Toulouse.
	   ``If I'm fit, I'm fit and if I'm not I want to let the manager
know as early as possible in order that he can make arrangements
regards the rest of the team.
	   ``It's not fair to keep him waiting any longer than he has to.
He hasn't given me a deadline, but I appreciate he needs to know as
early as possible.
	   ``I am not going to go out there if I am not fit to play and
jeapardize the chances of the team,'' the 27-year-old Aston Villa
defender said. ``The selfish thing to do would be to say I'm going
to play regardless because it's the World Cup, but I have got to be
honest enough to make the right decision.''
	   Southgate, whose penalty miss against Germany in a semifinal
shootout at Wembley cost England a place in the final of the 1996
European Championship, said he felt optimistic about his chances
after testing his right ankle in an hour-long training session with
the rest of the squad.
	   Southgate helped England beat Tunisia 2-0 last Monday but
twisted his ankle in training the following day.
	   But all that was forgotten Saturday as he joined his colleagues
for training in 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) temperatures
before taking time out for some exercises.
	   ``I have managed to do a fair bit of training today. It's really
a case of seeing how it reacts, get back to the physios and seeing
the reaction on the ankle,'' said Southgate, who likely will be
replaced by Arsenal's Martin Keown or Manchester United's Gary
Neville. ``But the way it has been progressing, it's very
hopeful.''
	   When Southgate missed training Friday, Hoddle said he was too
early to make a prognosis, although the signs were positive.
	   Southgate says he knows the importance of his own decision
abouyt his fitness.
	   ``It may be one of the most difficult decisions I have had to
make,'' the defender said. ``It is very difficult to declare
yourself unfit. But I am hopeful I won't have to make that
decision.
	   ``I have got to put the team first, I suppose maybe three or
four years ago I would have taken a selfish view, but I have got
enough experience now to know that isn't the right way to do
things.''

East Timor Rebel leader to be freed in return for recognition: report 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with separatist reaction; ADDS byline
By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president offered Saturday
to free an imprisoned East Timor rebel leader in return for
international recognition that the former Portuguese colony ``is an
integral part of Indonesia.''
	   The plan was flatly rejected by one prominent East Timor
activist as diplomatic ``blackmail.''
	   In an interview with Australian journalists in Jakarta,
President B.J. Habibie said he could release rebel commander Jose
Xanana Gusmao, who was arrested in 1992, and withdraw thousands of
Indonesian troops from the half-island territory.
	   Special status and development funding could be granted to the
half island territory, he said.
	   Habibie outlined his three-point peace proposal to the reporters
as Gusmao celebrated his 52th birthday in Jakarta's Cipinang
prison, where he is serving a 20-year sentence for fighting
Indonesian forces.
	   ``But then the former colonial masters (Portugal) and the whole
world should stop making problems about East Timor and they should
accept East Timor as an integral part of Indonesia, '' he was
quoted as saying by Australian Associated Press. ``This is what I
am going to do to end everything.''
	   Details of the offer were presented privately to U.N. officials
by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in New York earlier this week. U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said Friday it marked ``an important
development'' in negotiations over East Timor's future.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year
later.
	   Jose Ramos-Horta, an international spokesman for East Timorese
independence and co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace prize, accused
Habibie of blackmailing the United Nations and Portugal, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   ``It is totally unacceptable,'' Horta told Lusa. ``We demand
unconditional freedom for Xanana Gusmao and a referendum on East
Timor's self-determination.''
	   The offer is the latest reform promise made since Habibie came
to power a month ago after longtime autocrat Suharto quit.
	   He has announced a wide range of political changes and released
about dozen East Timor rebels from prison along with other
dissidents.
	   Suharto ordered the 1975 invasion and during his presidency
refused to make concessions to calls for independence or greater
autonomy by East Timorese.
	   The conflict in East Timor, made worse by accusations of
widespread human rights abuses by the military, has proved to be a
millstone for Indonesia's foreign relations.
	   Visiting foreign dignitaries had routinely called on Suharto to
find a solution. Protests over Indonesia's rule were often raised
at international forums, particularly by Portugal.
	   Emboldened by Habibie's promises to introduce more democracy in
Indonesia, students and others in East Timor have staged large
rallies demanding self-determination.
	   Protests have also been held in the national capital, Jakarta.
	   Habibie said he could reduce Gusmao's sentence to the time the
rebel commander has already served since his capture six years ago.
	   Until now, Indonesia officials ruled out the possibility of an
earlier release for Gusmao, who they claim is a violent criminal.
	   Habibie said he hoped to hold talks with East Timorese leaders,
including Bishop Carlos Belo, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in
conjunction with Horta.
	   Apart from Gusmao, Belo is arguably East Timor's most
influential personality and is the spiritual leader of the
overwhelming Catholic in largely Muslim Indonesia.

World Cup: Much more than a game: Politics, second round at stake AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Politics and soccer. Patriotism and pride.
	   For months, players on both sides have been questioned about the
huge and perhaps historic implications of Sunday's World Cup
between the United States and Iran.
	   It took American defender Alexi Lalas' sarcastic wit to put it
all in perspective.
	   ``This is a game that will determine the future of our planet,''
he said Saturday, ``and possibly the most important single sporting
event that's ever been played in the history of the world. So we're
dealing with that.''
	   Lalas then cut out the deadpan and resumed his normal tone of
voice.
	   ``It's just a soccer game,'' he said. ``There's a lot of crap
around here.''
	   Sunday's game has huge ramifications for both teams. With a
victory, Iran would set off wild demonstrations back home, where
Islamic clerics routinely denounce the United States as ``The Great
Satan'' and whip crowds into frenzied chants of ``Death to
America!''
	   An Iranian victory would raise hopes in the Gulf although Iran
would still need to beat Germany to advance. Additionally, it
clearly would mean the death of the United States' hopes to advance
to the second round.
	   Only a combination of crazy results combined with a win over
Yugoslavia could then avoid first-round elimination.
	   But an American victory, especially following the 2-0 loss to
Germany in the dull opener, would give the United States a chance
to avoid going home this week and maybe wipe out the view that this
team is one giant yawn.
	   ``It's a must-win situation for us,'' midfielder Frankie Hejduk
said. ``We're coming out with the attitude we have to win. There's
no excuses. We've going to have to leave everything on the field.''
	   Even the White House is talking about the game, with President
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline Albright using the occasion
to discuss the possible resumption of diplomatic relations with
Iran, cut off since the 1979-81 American hostage crisis.
	   Just last month, the U.S. State Department called Iran the
world's ``most active'' sponsor of terrorism, so it's clear both
nations have raw nerves. Iran's delegation considered withdrawing
from the tournament last week when a French television station
broadcast ``Not Without My Daughter,'' a 1991 film based on the
true story of an American woman who escaped Iran with her daughter
against the wishes of her Iranian husband. The Iranians claimed the
broadcast was a purposeful insult.
	   ``It is imperative that we win against the USA,'' Iran forward
Khodadad Azizi said. ``For historical reasons, our country is a lot
more sensitive to this meeting. Iran has been disappointed by
Americans politics in recent years. This is the most important
match of my life.''
	   Because of the emotions, French organizers have increased
security and FIFA has banned banners from the stadium.
	   With all that going on, U.S. players kept trying to play down
the implications of the politics. To them, a victory is necessary
merely to validate they're better than the post-college all-star
team that got swept at the 1990 tournament.
	   ``We're trying to keep the politics out of it completely,'' U.S.
coach Steve Sampson said after Saturday's practice at Stade
Gerland. ``But it is hard to ignore the fact that there is so much
emphasis being put on this game.''
	   Iran's players also were saying all the right things.
	   ``I think that the media coverage is making this a sensitive
fixture,'' goalkeeper Nima Nakisa said. ``The most important thing
is to have a friendly spirit on the pitch (field).''
	   That might be hard. The U.S. team has promised to come out
hitting hard, and Iran had 30 fouls in its opening 1-0 loss to
Yugoslavia.
	   ``I think they will bring an emotional wave at the beginning of
the game,'' American goalkeeper Kasey Keller said. ``We have to
handle that wave and worry about playing our game.''
	   Sampson appeared set to shake up his lineup, inserting a trio of
offensive players _ Tab Ramos, Hejduk and Roy Wegerle _ in place of
Chad Deering, Mike Burns and probably Ernie Stewart.
	   Sampson, always secretive about his personnel decisions and
tactics, wouldn't confirm the moves, but did promise more action.
Iran's primary goal-scoring threats _ Azizi, Ali Daei and Karim
Bagheri _ are not nearly as imposing as Germany's forwards, so the
Americans feel more freedom to take risks.
	   ``We can't afford to start slow. We can't afford to play
conservative,'' Sampson said. ``We must attack and we must play for
the three points.''

	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Gunfire rattled through the northern
outskirts of Guinea-Bissau's capital on Saturday as the country's
breakaway army leaders held off advancing Senegalese troops near
the city's airport, rebel radio and military officials said.
	   Although the renegade soldiers have been cut off from the city
and their main supply of ammunition, they continued to hold the
airport, a Senegalese military commander said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Senegal has sent at least 1,300 troops to reinforce soldiers
loyal to the government of President Joao Bernardo Vieira in
Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip.
	   The rebels, led by former army chief of staff Ansumane Mane,
were forced from their stronghold military garrison where the
revolt began on June 7 in Bissau last week, but have reinforced
their position at the nearby airport.
	   Rebel Radio Bombolon said Mane's forces were dug in at the
Bissalanca airport.
	   ``This is a well organized military action by a professional
military junta,'' said the radio broadcast, monitored in the
Senegalese border town of Mpak.
	   A communique from Senegal's military command in Dakar said last
week the rebel forces had been driven from the Bra military
garrison and had abandoned stores of ammunition.
	   Mane earlier this month staged an attack on Vieira in a bid to
oust the longstanding leader of Guinea-Bissau. Mane, fuming over
accusations of smuggling guns to Senegalese separatist guerrillas,
was fired shortly before staging his coup attempt.
	   Almost two weeks of artillery and ground battles have left
downtown blocks in the capital charred and battered. An exodus of
almost the entire city of 300,000 people has threatened to create a
humanitarian crisis of internally displaced refugees.
	   Food and water shortages have been reported in Bissau and
elsewhere. All telephone communication with the West African
country had been cut by Saturday, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
reported.
	   Shelling at the Senegalese border has cut off land access to
Guinea-Bissau.
	   The United Nations relief agency World Food Program said
Guinea-Bissau's government ``requisitioned'' two storage complexes
containing 2,700 metric tons (2,970 tons) of U.N. food, much of it
intended for hungry refugees.
	   ``The World Food Program wants the government to give back the
two stores of food,'' spokesman Wagdi Othman said in Abidjan, Ivory
Coast. The U.N. agency was worried the food would be used to feed
fighters, Othman said.
	   The government, however, told Portuguese media the food will be
used to feed the people and not the military.
	   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, meanwhile,
deployed a delegation to Senegal to investigate the extent of a
growing refugee crisis in Guinea-Bissau.
	   Attempted peace talks failed just as they started to get under
way. Gambian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sedat Jobe returned to his
country after failing to meet with Mane.
	   A Russian-made plane was seen taking off from the rebel-held
airport Saturday, and was reported to be carrying Mane on a
diplomatic mission to Gambia, a Senegalese private radio station
said. The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The rebels earlier had said they would only negotiate with their
chosen mediator, Senegalese opposition legislator Landing Sauane.

EDS: UPDATES with no incidents in Toulouse, police stopping cars
By FRANCK DEMAY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Under tight surveillance, English soccer
fans trickled into this south western city Saturday. But in
contrast to last week's violence, they mingled peacefully in bars
with locals.
	   All eyes are on England's match Monday against Romania, after
dozens of hooligans were arrested last week in three days of
violence between English and Tunisian fans in Marseille.
	   On Saturday, French and British police officers checked vehicles
entering the city in a bid to spot known troublemakers.
	   But on two camp sites around the city where a few hundred
English fans were already installed, no trouble was reported. About
600 others were in town, frequenting bars and touring the city.
	   The temperature in the city on Saturday soared to 36 degrees
Celsius (97 degrees Fahrenheit.)
	   On Friday, British police preparing for Monday's game said not
even the best security plan would deter hardcore hooligans.
	   ``Nobody, British or French, has said we could guarantee a
trouble-free event,'' Tim Hollis, the top British police officer
advising the French, told a news conference.
	   In Toulouse, cafes and bars were forced to close at 11 p.m.
until Monday, instead of the usual 2 a.m. closing time. A local
music festival has been postponed.
	   Two giant World Cup screens for ticketless fans also are being
eliminated. A screen on Marseille's Prado beach was the scene of
violence during Monday's England-Tunisia game.
	   Police strength is being increased, with 1,300 police to be
backed by two or three 80-member units of riot police or motorized
gendarmes, police said.
	   Hollis said that 200 hooligans who rampaged in Marseille have
been identified and so-called British ``spotter'' police would be
on the lookout for them in Toulouse.
	   One of them, Carlton Maddock, was sentenced late Friday to two
months in jail. He also was banned from returning to France for a
year. Police spotted the 34-year-old from Cheshire in a bar in the
southern city of Montpellier.
	   He pleaded guilty to charges of throwing chairs and beer cans at
Marseille police.
	   As for security inside the stadium, the prefect of Toulouse's
Haute-Garonne region, Alain Bidou, said Friday night that a
decision had been made not to install fences to control hooligans.
	   British officials had argued against the French proposal, saying
they could prove dangerous should a commotion arise.
	   Marseille authorities also boosted police presence ahead of
Saturday's match between the Netherlands and South Korea.
	   But regional Prefect Jean-Paul Proust relented on a strict
alcohol ban announced earlier, under pressure from cafe and
restaurant owners. Proust agreed to allow alcohol to be sold an
hour later, until midnight, and said cafes and restaurants could
remain open until 4 a.m.
	   Stricter measures were also put in place in the French capital,
including banning alcohol consumption on the streets around Parc
des Princes stadium on match days.
	   Area bars will be ``asked to close'' on those days, police said.
Alcohol is also banned around giant screens outside City Hall, near
the Eiffel Tower and three other locations.

Strikers let employees leave Telephone Company buildings

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Stikers and protesters allowed 400
Puerto Rico Telephone Company employees who had already spent one
night in the company's buildings to leave in the early morning
hours Saturday.
	   The agreement by the unions to let the employees go home ended a
tense standoff late Friday that stretched into Saturday morning. A
crowd of demonstrators chanted and celebrated outside the PRTC's
headquarters while employees waited inside, some tearfully, to be
allowed to leave safely.
	   Unions began the third day of their strike Saturday to protest
the government's plans to sell a controlling interest in the
company to a consortium led by GTE.
	   The dlrs 1.9 billion sale is the largest and most controversial
of several privatization efforts by the administration of Gov.
Pedro Rossello.
	   Several people were injured and others were arrested in clashes
between demonstrators and police on the picket lines in the first
two days of the strike, but no serious incidents were reported
Saturday morning.
	   Gov. Rossello's comments blaming the clashes on the strikers,
and absolving police of responsibility, further infuriated the
protesters.
	   ``The people are going to pass sentence on him, whether now or
in the future elections,'' union leader Annie Cruz said of the
governor.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Hundreds of riot police and soldiers fired
into the air Saturday in clashes with thousands of Yemenis
protesting a 40 percent hike in fuel prices.
	   The demonstrators took to the streets for the second day,
throwing rocks at police cars, smashing billboards and shouting
chants against the government, a security official said.
	   Most shops remained closed in the capital San`a. Protesters
burned tires in the city's main streets and used rocks to close
vital roads, the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Baton-wielding police chased demonstrators in streets and fired
tear gas, but there were no reports of casualties.
	   The protesters chanted against Prime Minister Abdul-Karim
al-Iryani, who came to power last month.
	   ``Iryani you fool, you raised the price of fuel,'' shouted a
crowd gathered in front of the parliament building.
	   The demonstrators called on the government to reverse its
decision, announced Thursday and implemented Friday, to raise the
prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas by about 40 percent.
	   The hikes were in line with requirements of the International
Monetary Fund to remove subsidies on petroleum products and other
commodities like flour and sugar by the end of 1998.
	   On Thursday, the state-run Yemen Oil Company said 1 gallon (3.8
liters) of gasoline would cost 133 riyals (dlrs 1), up from 95
riyals (69 cents) and 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of kerosene would sell
for 57 riyals (41.8 cents), up from 42 riyals (30 cents).
	   Cooking gas bottles would cost 200 riyals (dlrs 1.5), up from
150 riyals (dlrs 1.1), the company said.
	   The new hikes follow a decision by the government to raise the
price of petroleum products by 25 percent in July 1997.
	   The monthly salaries of civil servants range between 18,800
riyals (dlrs 142) and 26,500 riyals (dlrs 200).

alcohol ban announced earlier, under pressure from cafe and
restaurant owners. Proust agreed to allow alcohol to be sold an
hour later, until midnight, and said cafes and restaurants could
remain open until 4 a.m.
	   Stricter measures were also put in place in the French capital,
including banning alcohol consumption on the streets around Parc
des Princes stadium on match days.
	   Area bars will be ``asked to close'' on those days, police said.
Alcohol is also banned around giant screens outside City Hall, near
the Eiffel Tower and three other locations.

<TEXT>
	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Australian No. 1 seed Patrick
Rafter comfortably defeated Dutchman Dennis van Scheppingen 6-3,
6-4, in the semifinals of the Heineken Trophy grass court tennis
tournament Saturday.
	   In the other semifinal, unseeded Czech Martin Damm ousted Dutch
seventh-seed Jan Siemerink 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 to set up Sunday's final.
	   Also on Saturday, Julie Halard of France won the women's final,
easing past Miriam Oremans of the Neterlands in straight sets 6-3,
6-4.
	   Seeded No. 6 at Wimbledon when plays opens there Monday, Rafter
breezed through the match against the unseeded Dutchman who reached
the semifinal after compatriot Richard Krajicek pulled out
yesterday due to a knee injury.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, practiced Saturday at the
All England Club and indicated he would play the grass-court
classic, where he is seeded No. 9.
	   Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, was simply too much for Van
Scheppingen.
	   There was some hope for the Dutchman during the latter part of
the second set, but he failed to win a crucial breakpoint when
trailing 4-5.

World Cup: Chilean striker hopes to take advantage of ``disorganized'' Cameroon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MARIGNAC, France (AP) _ Chilean striker Marcelo Salas hopes to
takes sole possession of the World Cup's scoring lead by taking
advantage of Cameroon's ``disorganized'' defense in Tuesday's
match.
	   ``Cameroon is very tough and fast, but also disorganized at
defense,'' Salas said after Saturday's practice.
	   ``We'll try to take full advantage of that situation,'' said
Salas, who after two matches shares the Cup's scoring lead with
Italy's Christian Vieri and France's Thierry Henry with three
goals.
	   Chile plays Cameroon in Nantes and Italy plays Austria in
Saint-Denis, outside Paris, in matches that will decide the
second-round qualifiers for Group B.
	   Italy leads with four points, followed by Chile and Austria with
two each. Cameroon has one point.
	   With his three tallies, Salas has moved into a share of the
all-time Chilean scoring honors with Carlos Caszely with 29 goals.
But now he says he is more interested in advancing to the second
round.
	   ``My main objective is to reach the next stage. If we do so,
then anything can happen. Of course, I wouldn't mind scoring a few
more goals,'' said Salas, who will play this year for Lazio of the
Italian Serie A.

With Sports-Soccer-Germany-Yugoslavia World Cup: Vogts makes clear what he means by free time 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Just before the potentially crucial match
against Yugoslavia, there were first signs of tension in the German
camp Saturday.
	   An angry Berti Vogts called German players in to explain once
again what he means by free time and days off. Free time in their
headquarters definitely doesn't mean going off to see their wives.
	   Vogts got angry Friday when he discovered that some players had
left the team headquarters in the four-star Mas d'Artigny in the
hills above Nice to visit their wives in a hotel in Juan-les-Pins,
not far away on the French Riviera.
	   Two players were supposed to get treatment for various injuries
but missed it because of the trip.
	   Vogts then called the team in to explain that time off in the
camp doesn't mean leaving the compound. When they are given days
off, the players may leave and see their wives or do as they
pleased.
	   ``We've been together now for four weeks. It's quite good that
we are reminded of the rules, so we know when we can go out and
when not,'' forward Oliver Bierhoff said Saturday, before the team
flew north to Lens where it plays Yugoslavia Sunday.
	   The game could decide the winner of Group F and the first team
to advance to the second round from the group.
	   Vogts told the players that time off meant resting and
recuperating. Four players had left the compound, but team
officials declined to give their names.
	   Bierhoff said Vogts had made it very clear that players have to
stick to his rules.
	   ``If you start with small things, bigger things could develop.
We have to keep certain discipline. We have enough freedom as it
is,'' Bierhoff said.

World Cup: Belgium leads 10-man Mexico 1-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Marc Wilmots scored off a corner kick in
the 43rd minute to give Belgium a 1-0 halftime lead over 10-man
Mexico on Saturday, a half that included the World Cup's sixth red
card in three days.
	   Mexican defender Pavel Pardo became the latest victim of the red
card syndrome, getting expelled by Scottish referee Hugh Dallas for
clipping the ankle of Vital Borkelmans on a late tackle from behind
in the 29th minute. Borkelmans was taken off the field on a
stretcher, but returned to the game after a few minutes.
	   The rash of expulsions follows new FIFA president Sepp Blatter's
complaint that referees weren't following a new dictate that foul
tackles from behind be punished with a red card. There were only
only four red cards issued in the tournament's first eight days
before Blatter's comments.
	   Pardo's ejection made life especially difficult for the Mexicans
as they had to chase the Belgiums with a man down on a hot, humid
afternoon at Stade Lescure.
	   Before Pardo left, Mexico had proved the greater offensive
threat, with Joe Sanchez and Jaime Ordiales both hitting the
crossbar in the first 20 minutes. The rebound from Sanchez' shot
went to Luis Hernandez, but his header was cleared off the goal
line by defender Danny Boffin.
	   Wilmots' goal was simply a matter of standing in the right spot
at the right time. He put his body in front of Luis Oliveira's
corner kick, letting it bank off his chest and left thigh directly
in front of goalkeeper Jorge Campos, who couldn't stop the ball
from going between his legs.

Eds: contains new items on jersey exchanges, A.S. Monaco's
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA is asking players to keep their shirts on
while on the pitch.
	   FIFA clarified its position on players' swapping of jerseys
after World Cup matches. The world football federation would like
the exchanges carried out with decorum.
	   ``We've asked, but not demanded, that players change shirts not
on the field of play but in the locker room after the match,'' FIFA
spokesman Keith Cooper said Saturday.
	   Still, FIFA won't punish players for shedding their tops on the
field.
	   ``If they want to do so, we're certainly not going to run onto
the pitch and stop it,'' Cooper said.
	   FIFA has a regulation stating that shirts worn here must carry
an inscription saying ``France 98 FIFA World Cup.''
	   This way the players will have a special souvenir of the the
World Cup, Cooper said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Unqualified Monaco scores big in the World Cup.
Well, their first division team that is.
	   The French first division team A.S. Monaco is the football club
with the most players to have scored in the World Cup as of Friday.
The team's players scored a total of six goals. Half of that total,
three goals, came from Thierry Henry who plays for the French team.
Henry's teammate in Monaco as well as in the French team, David
Trezeguet scored one goal in Thursday's France-Saudi Arabia game.
	   Other Monargask player to have score one goal were John Collins
for the Scottish team and Victor Ikpeba from Nigeria.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ What do clothes tell about your national team?
Quite a lot if you believe the analysis of a painter and a
semiology specialist.
	   At the request of the French sports daily L'Equipe, the
unidentified specialists in colors and symbols looked at the
uniforms of Japan and Croatia, playing each other Sunday, and the
Netherlands and Mexico, which meet next Thursday.
	   Holland's traditional orange uniform got the best marks. The
specialists agreed that orange is a good color for confrontation.
	   Mexico's Aztec design in green shades didn't go over as well
with the jury.
	   The Japanese blue uniform was deemed okay, but it was said to
lack some fighting spirit in spite of the red flame design on the
sleeves and socks.
	   Croatia's white jersey with red-checkered pattern got the lowest
marks from experts, mainly because it didn't seen very distinctive,
L'Equipe said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ George Cohen, a member of England's
1966 World Cup champions, still has his winning medal after an
auction Saturday failed to bring him as much money as he expected
	   Cohen received a bid of 55,000 pounds (dlrs 92,000), short of an
undisclosed price at which he was willing to let the medal go.
	   It had been expected to bring 80,000 pounds (dlrs 130,000), a
Christie's spokesman said.
	   However, Cohen's World Cup international cap from the same
tournament was sold for 11,500 pounds (dlrs 19,200).
	   ``Mr. Cohen decided to sell the medal to get some security for
his family's future,'' said his spokesman David Davies. ``I have
instructed him about the outcome of the sale but I do not know what
he will do. He will have to take the next couple of days to
decide.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Dozens of rowdy Scottish soccer fans _
branded as troublemakers by French and Spainish police _ returned
home Saturday to jeers at this international airport.
	   Acting on a tip, French police stopped a bus at the Spanish
border carrying the Scots as it headed for Bordeaux _ where
Scotland played Norway earlier this week.
	   The Scottish fans were sent back to Salou in northeastern Spain,
where disturbances later broke out. Three Scots were arrested
outside a nightclub.
	   The Scottish fans, wearing sunglasses and scarves to hide their
faces, hurried from the airport in cars and taxis. Several gave
Nazi salutes.
	   There were no problems reported at the airport.
	   The fans returned on a charter plane carrying many vacationing
families back home.
	   Kenneth Miller, 27, a social worker from Glasgow, said the the
Spanish airport was tense as the flight waited to be boarded.
	   ``The atmosphere in the airport was frankly ugly,'' he said.
``These guys were drinking heavily and making a lot of noise and
there were lots of families on holiday there.''

New Zealand's Stephen Scahill clings to Madeira Open lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MACHICO, Madeira (AP) _ Stephen Scahill of New Zealand failed to
repeat his stunning form of the previous day, when he shattered the
Santo da Serra course record, but still carded a 3-under-par 69 in
the third round Saturday to stay two shots ahead of the chasing
field in the Madeira Island Open.
	   Scahill, 28, who last year lost his European Tour card, vaulted
into the lead Friday with a devastating 11-under-par 61.
	   ``I couldn't reproduce yesterday's form but was in a good frame
of mind today,'' he said. ``I was expecting to play a few poor
shots after a 61 but fortunately there weren't too many.''
	   Swede Mats Lanner, who won here in 1994, was level with Scahill
with two holes to play but the New Zealander, having dropped shots
at both the 15th and 16th, birdied the last two holes to regain his
two-stroke advantage.
	   Lanner finished on 68, placing him two strokes ahead of
England's Andrew Beal of England who fired a third round of 67 to
move into third place.
	   Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson carded 65, the day's best score, to
move into fourth place ahead of Sunday's final round.
	   Most of the leading European players are competing in the US
Open this week, giving lower-ranked players an improved chance of
winning the Madeira Island Open which is being staged at the same
time.

Some 100 North Africans caught near tiny Sicilian island

<TEXT>
	   PANTELLERIA, Sicily (AP) _ About 100 North Africans were stopped
by the Italian coast guard Saturday near this tiny vacation island
as they tried to illegally enter Italian territory.
	   The Italian news agency AGI said the would-be immigrants,
Tunisians and Moroccans, were aboard a boat.
	   Last summer, a fishing boat trying to disembark illegal
immigrants struck a reef near the island and two Tunisians drowned.
	   Pantelleria, located 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Tunisia,
is closer to that North African country than it is to Sicily.
	   Many North Africans try to reach the rocky island, where it is
hard to escape detection, knowing authorities will then send them
to Sicily, 110 kilometers (70 miles) to the north). There the
immigrant-hopefuls try to slip away while their expulsion orders
are being processed.

Iraq accepts spare parts resolution, reversing earlier opposition 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Saturday reversed its opposition to
a U.N. Security Council resolution allowing it to buy spare parts
for its oil industry.
	   A Foreign Ministry spokesman quoted by the Iraqi News Agency
said Iraq now believes the resolution contains nothing that would
transform the oil-for-food program into an indefinite measure to be
applied until U.N. sanctions on Iraq are lifted.
	   The Security Council passed resolution No. 1175 unanimously
Friday, permitting Iraq to spend dlrs 300 million of revenues from
the oil-for-food program to buy spare parts to repair and upgrade
its oil industry.
	   The program enables Iraq to bypass the sanctions imposed after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and sell limited amounts of oil to
finance purchases of food, medicine and humanitarian goods.
	   The resolution also ended a provision that required Iraq to
submit a food and medicine disbursement plan when the program is
renewed every six months. Now, previous arrangements will stand
should Iraq delay submitting a plan.
	   Iraq's delays helped whittle away international support for the
sanctions.
	   Iraq had objected to the resolution out of concern that it would
enshrine the program as permanent.
	   Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf sent a letter
this week to the Security Council saying the resolution
``contradicts the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding'' signed
between Iraq and the United Nations in 1996 ``because it ignores
the fact that this (oil-for-food) program is an exceptional
arrangement and a temporary one.''
	   ``Iraq totally rejects the transfer of the oil-for-food program
from a temporary measure to a permanent and ongoing formula,''
al-Sahhaf wrote.
	   On Monday, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, warned the
resolution could trigger the ``collapse of the whole (oil-for-food)
program.''
	   The spokesman said Iraq would have rejected the resolution if it
had contained ``any interpretation contradicting the temporary and
exceptional nature of this program.''

East Timor Rebel leader to be freed in return for recognition: report 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Portuguese reaction
By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president offered Saturday
to free an imprisoned East Timor rebel leader in return for
international recognition that the former Portuguese colony ``is an
integral part of Indonesia.''
	   The plan was flatly rejected by one prominent East Timor
activist as diplomatic ``blackmail,'' and Portugal said it ignored
the legitimate aspirations of the East Timorese.
	   In an interview with Australian journalists in Jakarta,
President B.J. Habibie said he could release rebel commander Jose
Xanana Gusmao, who was arrested in 1992, and withdraw thousands of
Indonesian troops from the half-island territory.
	   Special status and development funding could be granted to the
half island territory, he said.
	   Habibie outlined his three-point peace proposal to the reporters
as Gusmao celebrated his 52th birthday in Jakarta's Cipinang
prison, where he is serving a 20-year sentence for fighting
Indonesian forces.
	   ``But then the former colonial masters (Portugal) and the whole
world should stop making problems about East Timor and they should
accept East Timor as an integral part of Indonesia, '' he was
quoted as saying by Australian Associated Press. ``This is what I
am going to do to end everything.''
	   Details of the offer were presented privately to U.N. officials
by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in New York earlier this week. U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said Friday it marked ``an important
development'' in negotiations over East Timor's future.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year
later.
	   Jose Ramos-Horta, an international spokesman for East Timorese
independence and co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace prize, accused
Habibie of blackmailing the United Nations and Portugal, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   ``It is totally unacceptable,'' Horta told Lusa. ``We demand
unconditional freedom for Xanana Gusmao and a referendum on East
Timor's self-determination.''
	   Portugal said East Timor needed representation at any talks.
	   ``If Indonesia is aiming for a democracy, it is their duty to
guarantee the East Timorese people the right to choose how they
want to live,'' said a spokesman for the Portuguese Foreign
Ministry.
	   ``The population must be heard through an internationally
monitored referendum,'' said the spokesman, speaking with customary
anonymity. ``It is not up to Indonesia nor Portugal to decide on
East Timor's statute.''

European Union ambassadors to leave Belarus 5 EU countries represented in Belarus; EDITS to trim

Eds: UPDATES with U.S. ambassador's statement, CLARIFIES that only
By MARINA BABKINA

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Ambassadors from five European Union
nations are returning home Monday for consultations with their
governments on the Belarusian government's attempt to evict them
from a diplomatic compound.
	   Germany went a step further, asking the Belarusian ambassador in
Bonn to return home to Minsk.
	   The ambassadors of Britain, France, Greece, Italy and Germany
went to the Foreign Ministry on Saturday to deliver a note to the
head of protocol saying they were leaving Belarus on Monday.
	   The Belarusian government has been trying to force ambassadors
out of their homes in a diplomatic compound on the outskirts of the
capital, Minsk, claiming the residences are badly in need of sewer
and plumbing repairs.
	   British ambassador Jessica Mary Pearce said the EU ambassadors
were returning home ``for consultations'' to protest the attempts
to evict them from their homes. Only five EU countries have
embassies in Minsk.
	   U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard declined to answer when he was
asked if he would be recalled to Washington. He said he was
continuing to discuss the matter with the State Department.
	   ``I will be talking to them again today and tomorrow, and we
will have some announcement on Monday,'' he said.
	   Germany's foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, requested Saturday
that Belarusian ambassador Pjotr Beljajew return home from Bonn.
	   He said Beljajew's departure would make clear Europe's
disapproval with the Belarusian government. He said the other EU
nations supported his suggestion that the ambassador leave Germany.
	   ``The actions of the Belarusian government are completely
incomprehensible,'' Kinkel said in a written statement. ``President
Lukashenko is maneuvering his country ever deeper into isolation.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said in Moscow that
Russia has no immediate plans to recall its ambassador.
	   ``Our Belarusian friends are not acting via diplomatic means,''
Primakov told the Zerkalo television program. He said he hoped
``this misunderstanding will all be sorted out somehow, but not at
the expense of recalling all the ambassadors.''
	   On Friday, the Belarusian government cut water and power
supplies to the compound to force the ambassadors out. Workers also
dug a ditch immediately inside the compound's gates, preventing
ambassadors' cars from entering.
	   The ambassadors have protested that the order for them to leave
their residences violates the Vienna Convention, which designates
ambassadors' homes as territory of their countries.
	   President Alexander Lukashenko claims the diplomatic residences
are his own property. He has a residence adjacent to the compound.
	   The government has offered the ambassadors new apartments in
downtown Minsk, cottages 30 kilometers (20 miles) outside Minsk or
plots on which to build new residences.

Exit polls have socialists leading in Czech early elections Republicans apparently not in parliament; fresh quotes, edits throughout 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with preliminary official results; extremist
By NADIA RYBAROVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ For the first time since Communist
rule ended in 1989, Czechs backed the center-left Social Democrats
in early parliamentary elections, preliminary official results
suggested Saturday.
	   The results showed the center-left Social Democrats, led by
Milos Zeman, leading the race with 32.74 percent, but far short of
winning a parliamentary majority.
	   ``People wanted change and it is the task of the Social
Democrats to bring about that change,'' Vladimir Spidla, Social
Democrat vice-chairman, told Nova private television.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus was second with 23.06 percent of the vote, according to the
preliminary results released by the Central Election Committee.
	   The preliminary results represented only about 5 percent of the
more than 14,000 voting precincts.
	   Klaus, who was ousted last December when his center-right
minority coalition government fell apart over a party finance
scandal, had no immediate comment.
	   Three other parties were shown as clearing the 5 percent
threshold needed for parliamentary representation, according to the
committee _ the Communists, Christian Democrats and center-right
Freedom Union, formed mostly of rebels against Klaus.
	   The preliminary results indicated the extremist Republican Party
and the populist Pensioners for Secure Living, which headed into
the polls as a strong smaller party, had not made it into
parliament.
	   Despite the Social Democrats' expected victory, Zeman lacks a
clear majority and will have to go through painful negotiations to
form a government coalition.
	   ``The results of the election is what was expected, i.e. a
stalemate,'' Jiri Pehe, political advisor to President Vaclav Havel
told Nova private television. ``It will be very difficult to form a
government.''
	   Zeman's potential partners are the small Christian Democrats and
the Freedom Union _ a new party favored by Havel.
	   Voting for all 200 seats in the lower house of parliament, which
will form a new government, began Friday and continued Saturday.
The country has 8.09 million eligible voters.
	   The elections came two years early. A caretaker government under
banker Josef Tosovsky has been running the country since Klaus'
ouster
	   Coalition negotiations are expected to follow the vote, with
Havel playing a key role.

World Cup: Iran-U.S. match brings together fans from both sides AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos WCLY101-106
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ If Sunday's big game with the Great Satan is
about politics, you couldn't prove it by Feri Eftekhari, a London
surgeon in a white truck full of Iran T-shirts he handed out to
anyone, Americans included, who wanted to join the party.
	   ``Nothing but sports could do this,'' he said, looking at a
Rhone River bridge where U.S. and Iranian flags snapped
side-by-side in the wind. ``Governments want to make something
political of this match, but it is only about people getting
along.''
	   That was the mood in Lyon among Americans and Iranians who came
for a game that might take the winner past the first World Cup
round.
	   Saied Nili, a telecommunications consultant with U.S. West in
England, unloaded the car that brought him and three other Iranians
to town. He laughed at the suggestion of disturbances.
	   ``If you want trouble, you'll have to go see the English, or the
Dutch, one of those civilized European countries,'' he said.
``We'll give you carnival.''
	   His friend, who preferred to be named only as Feridoon, added,
``It'll be very friendly. What the two governments couldn't do in
10 years, the two nations will fix.'' He also chuckled at the idea
of violence.
	   The police were not laughing. Discreet reinforcements were ready
in case of demonstrations. About a half million Iranians live in
Europe within easy driving distance of Lyon. Other organizations
might also seize the occasion.
	   On Saturday, 50 members of the Association for Women's Rights
Against Fundamentalism marched through downtown. They paused every
few minutes to lie in the street and cover themselves with black
chadors to protest what they said was tyranny in Iran.
	   Heavy security precautions are planned for the match. Before the
World Cup began, French people said they had information that
extremist groups might attempt some terrorist acts during the
games. At least 90 people were detained around Europe.
	   But on a sunny, warm summer day in this elegant and ancient
city, nothing suggested problems.
	   Douglas Logan, a New Yorker who is commissioner of Major League
Soccer, alighted from a special train with 350 Americans in subdued
dress. Except for the odd Old Glory hat, they might have coming to
sample Lyon's fabled restaurants.
	   ``I think too much has been made of the political aspects,''
Logan said. ``There is enough pressure already on these kids. This
is an athletic event.''
	   James Appleby, a 33-year-old Washington, D.C., pharmacist and
self-confessed soccer addict, echoed that thought.
	   ``It's unfair to the team to put such pressure on them,'' he
said. ``Their careers are at stake. If they do well, they'll get
contracts with European clubs. We should keep politics out of it.''
	   For 13-year-old Nathan Thomas from Cincinnati, kicking his
soccer ball around the Ibis Hotel lobby at 1:30 in the morning,
Iran was just the other team. His parents, like most Americans,
seemed to agree.
	   For most Iranians, the important thing was less the opponent
than the fact that they were there at all. They were the last to
qualify, squeaking past Australia, for their first World Cup
competition since 1978.
	   ``This gives the world a chance to see another side of Iran, and
it gives us a chance to get together,'' Dr. Eftekhari said, before
exchanging his suit for a bright red and green jersey. Iranians
were coming from as far away as Australia.
	   ``We're scattered around the world,'' he said. ``This is when we
can get together, sing a song, and have some love for each other.''
	   Farzin Hashemi, president of an umbrella group called the
International Council of Resistance of Iran, took the occasion to
condemn the Islamic leadership in Iran.
	   ``The huge crowds of people waving flags will be supporting the
players and the team and their culture, not the government,''
Hashemi said. ``It is important to make that distinction.''
	   Leaders in Tehran wanted badly to win, he added, but in the end
it is only a soccer game. ``The concept that this is like ping-pong
diplomacy with China is just an illusion. Change can only come from
within Iran.''
	   The Lyonnais, an easy-going sort of Frenchmen who inhabit
France's second city, were not rattled. ``Things should be fine,''
shrugged Andre Rannaud, a waiter at Le Regent Cafe, with large
glass windows overlooking the Place Bellecour, where fans will
party. ``It's a sporting event.''

Pope urges Europeans to reconcile with Jews controversial bishop, newspaper comment. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. UPDATES with attendance figure, pope praise for
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Europeans must seek reconciliation with
the Jews for the ``unspeakable suffering'' inflicted on them, Pope
John Paul II said Saturday as he set down a tough agenda for the
old continent.
	   Addressing Austrian officials and diplomats in the former
Imperial Palace, the pope also listed duties and sacrifices
required of Europeans to overcome injustices and economic
disparity.
	   ``Don't forget the history of Europe is closely intertwined with
the history of that people from which the Lord Jesus came,'' John
Paul said. ``The Jewish people have been inflicted with unspeakable
suffering in Europe, and we can't affirm that all the roots of
these injustices have been cut.''
	   ``Reconciliation with the Jews is one of the fundamental duties
of Christians in Europe,'' John Paul said.
	   Sitting among the dignitaries was former Austrian President Kurt
Waldheim, who drew the ire of Jewish groups because of his alleged
complicity in war crimes by the German army in World War II.
	   Waldheim denied the accusations, but remains on the U.S. ``Watch
List'' of people barred entry to the United States, despite
previously living there for years as an Austrian diplomat and then
as Secretary General of the United Nations in New York.
	   Waldheim, invited to Saturday's ceremony as a former Austrian
head of state, shook John Paul's hand and chatted briefly with him
during the encounter in the Hofburg palace, now used for ceremonies
and as the official seat of Austria's president.
	   The pope received Waldheim in the Vatican in 1987, and Waldheim
welcomed the pope on his last trip to Austria in 1988, leading to
protests by Jews.
	   John Paul, who was 19 years old when the Nazis occupied his
native Poland, has spoken out often against anti-Semitism and the
horrors of the Holocaust, when an estimated six million Jews
perished at the hands of the Nazis.
	   But Saturday was believed to be the first time he put the burden
specifically on Europeans to make amends.
	   Later, the pope celebrated an open-air Mass at St. Poelten, some
60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Vienna, where the local bishop has
become the center of a storm that epitomizes the divisions rocking
Austria's Roman Catholic church.
	   Only some 25,000 people attended the service, including hundreds
from the pope's native Poland and other east European countries.
The crowd was well below expectations.
	   Many of the participants carried tiny flags in the Vatican's
yellow and white colors expressing loyalty to the pope and
Monsignor Kurt Krenn, the conservative bishop of St. Poelten who
has vocally defended an Austrian cardinal forced out by the Vatican
following accusations of pedophilia.
	   Catholics seeking such major church reforms as abolition of
priestly celibacy and admission of women to the priesthood have
seized on the case as an example of how conservative clergy has
disillusioned Austrian Catholics.
	   The pope praised Krenn for his attempts to fill parish vacancies
with priests but he ignored the controversy surrounding the bishop
who greeted the pontiff with genuflexion.
	   In a front page editorial Saturday, the main daily in the city
where the pope started his three-day visit, Salzburg, told him
Austrians were waiting for ``that redeeming little phrase ...`I'm
sorry that I sent you many a bishop without listening to your
wishes and requirements. I'm sorry that I caused divisions in your
church.'''
	   Opponents of Krenn handed out leaflets and held up black
balloons as protest symbols. Among other things, the leaflets noted
that 54,000 people in the diocese had asked for Krenn's recall
years ago and his continued work ``makes a mockery of the office of
bishop.''
	   The head of Austria's church, Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, and
Krenn's predecessor in St. Poelten got much more applause than
Krenn when the pope mentioned their names.
	   In his morning address, John Paul noted the aspirations of the
former communist countries in Europe as the 15-nation European
Union considers taking them in. The pope insisted that Western
Europe cannot remain an ``island of Western well-being on the
continent.''
	   ``The richer countries, inevitably, will have to make concrete
sacrifices'' to overcome the ``inhuman'' economic differences, the
pope said.
	   John Paul also said these countries should remain open to
accepting immigrants from other countries.
	   He used his international audience to renew his attack on what
he called an expanding ``culture of death'' in the world, referring
to abortion and euthanasia.
	   He said Austria's law allowing abortions in the first three
months of preganancy ``remains a bleeding wound in my heart.''

Iran-U.S. match brings together fans from both sides AP Special Correspondent

	   LYON, France (AP) _ If Sunday's big game with the Great Satan is
about politics, you couldn't prove it by Feri Eftekhari, a London
surgeon in a white truck full of Iran T-shirts he handed out to
anyone, Americans included, who wanted to join the party.
	   ``Nothing but sports could do this,'' he said, looking at a
Rhone River bridge where U.S. and Iranian flags snapped
side-by-side in the wind. ``Governments want to make something
political of this match, but it is only about people getting
along.''
	   That was the mood in Lyon among Americans and Iranians who came
for a game that might take the winner past the first World Cup
round.
	   Saied Nili, a telecommunications consultant with U.S. West in
England, unloaded the car that brought him and three other Iranians
to town. He laughed at the suggestion of disturbances.
	   ``If you want trouble, you'll have to go see the English, or the
Dutch, one of those civilized European countries,'' he said.
``We'll give you carnival.''
	   His friend, who preferred to be named only as Feridoon, added,
``It'll be very friendly. What the two governments couldn't do in
10 years, the two nations will fix.'' He also chuckled at the idea
of violence.
	   The police were not laughing. Discreet reinforcements were ready
in case of demonstrations. About a half million Iranians live in
Europe within easy driving distance of Lyon. Other organizations
might also seize the occasion.
	   On Saturday, 50 members of the Association for Women's Rights
Against Fundamentalism marched through downtown. They paused every
few minutes to lie in the street and cover themselves with black
chadors to protest what they said was tyranny in Iran.
	   Heavy security precautions are planned for the match. Before the
World Cup began, French people said they had information that
extremist groups might attempt some terrorist acts during the
games. At least 90 people were detained around Europe.
	   But on a sunny, warm summer day in this elegant and ancient
city, nothing suggested problems.
	   Douglas Logan, a New Yorker who is commissioner of Major League
Soccer, alighted from a special train with 350 Americans in subdued
dress. Except for the odd Old Glory hat, they might have coming to
sample Lyon's fabled restaurants.
	   ``I think too much has been made of the political aspects,''
Logan said. ``There is enough pressure already on these kids. This
is an athletic event.''
	   James Appleby, a 33-year-old Washington, D.C., pharmacist and
self-confessed soccer addict, echoed that thought.
	   ``It's unfair to the team to put such pressure on them,'' he
said. ``Their careers are at stake. If they do well, they'll get
contracts with European clubs. We should keep politics out of it.''
	   For 13-year-old Nathan Thomas from Cincinnati, kicking his
soccer ball around the Ibis Hotel lobby at 1:30 in the morning,
Iran was just the other team. His parents, like most Americans,
seemed to agree.
	   For most Iranians, the important thing was less the opponent
than the fact that they were there at all. They were the last to
qualify, squeaking past Australia, for their first World Cup
competition since 1978.
	   ``This gives the world a chance to see another side of Iran, and
it gives us a chance to get together,'' Dr. Eftekhari said, before
exchanging his suit for a bright red and green jersey. Iranians
were coming from as far away as Australia.
	   ``We're scattered around the world,'' he said. ``This is when we
can get together, sing a song, and have some love for each other.''
	   Farzin Hashemi, president of an umbrella group called the
International Council of Resistance of Iran, took the occasion to
condemn the Islamic leadership in Iran.
	   ``The huge crowds of people waving flags will be supporting the
players and the team and their culture, not the government,''
Hashemi said. ``It is important to make that distinction.''
	   Leaders in Tehran wanted badly to win, he added, but in the end
it is only a soccer game. ``The concept that this is like ping-pong
diplomacy with China is just an illusion. Change can only come from
within Iran.''
	   The Lyonnais, an easy-going sort of Frenchmen who inhabit
France's second city, were not rattled. ``Things should be fine,''
shrugged Andre Rannaud, a waiter at Le Regent Cafe, with large
glass windows overlooking the Place Bellecour, where fans will
party. ``It's a sporting event.''

	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Top seed Patrick Rafter easily
defeated Dutchman Dennis van Scheppingen 6-3, 6-4, in the
semifinals of the Heineken Trophy grass court tennis tournament
Saturday.
	   Rafter will play unseeded Czech Martin Damm in Sunday's final.
Damm beat seventh-seed Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands 7-6 (7-5),
6-3.
	   Also on Saturday, Julie Halard of France won the women's final,
easing past Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands in straight sets 6-3,

	   Rafter, the sixth seed at Wimbledon beginning Monday, breezed
through the match against van Scheppingen, who reached the
semifinal after compatriot Richard Krajicek pulled out Friday
because of a knee injury.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, practiced Saturday at the
All England Club and indicated he would play the grass-court
classic, where he is seeded No. 9.

World Cup: Croatia's Suker downs Japan 1-0 with long-awaited goal 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Optional
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Perserverance, rather than skill, was more
valuable to Davor Suker on this day.
	   Denied repeatedly by off-target shots and wasted opportunities,
the Real Madrid striker finally came through in the blazing
mid-afternoon heat Saturday to score his second goal at the World
Cup and put Croatia on the verge of the second round with a 1-0
victory over Japan.
	   With playmaker Zvonimir Boban benched because of a pulled leg
muscle, the favored Croatians struggled mightily throughout to
impose their trademark midfield passing game, which the Japanese
disrupted with a tactical mix of speed, grit and dogged marking.
	   ``The heat hurt the quality of our game, and Japan was tougher
than we expected,'' said veteran midfielder Robert Prosinecki, who
was replaced midway through the second half. ``But the most
important thing is that we won.''
	   Newcomer Japan remained winless and scoreless after two Group H
games, in effect ending its quest to reach the second round in its
World Cup debut.
	   Croatia, which beat Jamaica 3-1 in its debut game, now has six
points, virtually ensuring a second-round berth in its first trip
to the World Cup finals.
	   ``We have achieved our fist goal,'' Croatia coach Miroslav
Blazevic said. ``We're all very proud and we're a very small
country and already we're in the elite.''
	   The Japanese came within easy range of Drazen Ladic's goal
numerous times, but as on many previous occasions the final touch
in front of the goal was lacking.
	   ``There were so many chances,'' striker Masayuki Okano said.
``They were tired and we were tired, and we couldn't take advantage
of them. I'm really upset.''
	   From the outset, the Croatians drew jeers and whistles from some
10,000 Japanese fans as they tried to keep control by holding the
ball and slowing down play.
	   Suker first threatened after eight minutes, his powerful header
from the edge of the penalty area going just wide. He also volleyed
a cross high from 11 meters in the 11th and then curled a free kick
less than a half meter wide of the post in the 13th.
	   But Prosinecki's free kicks were blocked, AC Parma striker Mario
Stanic remained toothless and Aljosa Asanovic wasted a chance with
a hasty shot after a solo run down the left side.
	   Croatia was at its most stunned in the 21st minute when Japanese
star Hidetoshi Nakata gently lifted a rolling free kick over a wall
of defenders into the area, where a surging Shoji Jo was barely
headed off by goalkeeper Drazen Ladic.
	   Japan's best scoring chance of the game came in the 34th when
Nakata stole the ball from Prosinecki in midfield and lobbed it
into the area, but Ladic deflected Masashi Nakayma's right-footed
blast from the open goal with his oustretched arm.
	   More than once, Croatian players were pointing fingers at each
other or shaking their heads after missed chances.
	   They got closer when Suker hit the bar in the 72nd minute with a
lob over goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi.
	   Deliverance came in the 77th when he netted a left-footed drive
from inside the area after settling a cross from Asanovic.
	   ``This was a very difficult game,'' Blazevic said. ``But I think
it would not be partial to say we deserved the win.''
	   Japanese coach Takeshi Okada was only left with a dour look.
	   ``We tried to deal with a player of international class like
Suker by playing a collective game,'' Okada said. ``We tried to
gather our forces for this match, but unfortunately that was not
enough.
	   ``Our approach was to have two players on each one of the other
side. For Japanese football it's not over. We have good chances in
2002 and 2006.''

Undermining of Kosovo's pacifist leader causes headaches for West 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ If Ibrahim Rugova, longtime pacifist
leader of Kosovo's Albanians, is known as the man with the scarf
for his ever-present silken neckwear, then steely-eyed Jakup
Krasniqi, the new voice of the militant Kosovo Liberation Army, is
the man with the guns.
	   The two men profess the same goal _ independence for Kosovo _
but have opposite means of achieving it. Rugova has the West's
backing, but the fighters are winning the hearts of villagers in
this southern Yugoslavian province who have borne the brunt of Serb
repression.
	   ``People don't believe in (Rugova) anymore. They just believe in
Kalashnikovs,'' Albanian journalist Flamur Shkaba said, referring
to the assault rifle. Shkaba spoke from Malisevo, a town in the
third or so of Kosovo controlled by the guerrillas.
	   The KLA's undermining of Rugova's position complicates efforts
to solve the crisis over secessionist Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
	   Talks agreed to at Rugova's unprecedented meeting with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic were suspended after one session when
Serb forces cracked down in western Kosovo, forcing tens of
thousands of ethnic Albanians to flee.
	   Rugova's team refuses to resume negotiations until Serbian
forces withdraw _ a demand backed by the West, which sent NATO
planes into Balkan skies on Monday to press the point home.
	   But Serbian forces are not pulling out, citing continued attacks
from KLA ``terrorists'' hiding out in villages.
	   Only serious negotiations will enable Rugova to win his people
back into the moderate fold. The longer violence continues, the
more impossible that looks. More than 300 people have been killed
this year.
	   Washington, which has condemned violence on both sides, on
Thursday urged the KLA against a promised offensive.
	   ``That is a sure-fire way to give President Milosevic another
pretext to kill innocent Albanians,'' State Department spokesman
James Rubin said.
	   After months of declining to even confirm the separatists'
existence, Rugova admitted Friday he has no control over them.
	   No clear picture has yet emerged about who leads the shadowy
group. Encounters with the KLA give the impression of a wholly
disorganized force with no _ or many competing _ chiefs.
	   Small opposition parties that have offered to serve as the KLA's
political wing have yet to hear back.
	   Krasniqi stepped forward this month as KLA spokesman. He has
echoed KLA statements faxed from abroad, calling on Rugova to step
aside and let the fighters call the shots.
	   He also has demanded a Serb withdrawal and foreign mediation as
conditions for Serb-KLA peace talks.
	   In another statement Friday, the KLA again lambasted Rugova and
his government in exile as ``fictive institutions'' and said Kosovo
Albanians should ``distance themselves from deceiving policies.''
	   Ethnic Albanians re-elected Rugova, running unopposed, as their
president in March. His picture still adorns many homes. But people
seem embarrassed when his name is raised.
	   ``He's our president,'' says Sabit Pacarizi with a shrug.
Pointing to armed men in camouflage uniforms roaming Malisevo, he
adds: ``We have to start to deal with the KLA.''
	   Local chiefs of Rugova's party have defected to the KLA _
Krasniqi himself used to run the party's office in Glogovac.
	   In an attempt to regain control, the government in exile,
meeting in Albania, decided this week to stray from its advocacy of
nonviolence and organize its own self-defense in villages.
	   ``We have to try to put the KLA under political control ... to
be more effective,'' Bujar Bukoshi, the head of the government,
told The Associated Press.
	   The government still seeks a political solution, he said. But as
long as the Serbs attack and kill civilians, ``we have to take some
measures for survival and self-defense.''
	   Veton Surroi, a close Rugova adviser, called the step long
overdue. He sees no end to violence without stronger foreign
pressure on Milosevic.
	   ``I see greater trouble ahead,'' he said. ``Summer is always the
fighting season.''

Floods swell across Romania, one man dies as shelter collapses

Eds: UPDATES with government statement, more details damage
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Red Cross appealed Saturday on
national radio for urgent donations of money and clothes to help
tens of thousands of victims of floods which have already claimed
one life.
	   Heavy floods across northern Romania claimed their first life
Friday, when a 47-year-old man was crushed by a load of sand in the
shelter he took from torrential rain, the Mediafax news agency
said. Four friends with him were treated for light injuries, it
added.
	   The government said that more than one third of the country was
affected by the floods. Main roads in the northwest region of
Transylvania were closed Saturday.
	   Officials from 16 of Romania's 41 counties asked the government
for funds, medicines and clothing, private television PRO TV
reported.
	   Heavy rain has fallen for a week in some parts of Transylvania,
where soldiers waded deep into floodwaters to rescue inhabitants,
build dikes and hand out food, Mediafax said.
	   Dozens of villages were flooded in the northern counties of
Suceava and Bistrita, causing billions of lei (hundreds of
thousands of dollars) damage in ruined crops and homes.
	   After eight days of heavy rain, the skies cleared for the first
time Saturday. Weather forecasts said the good weather would likely
stay.
	   Mures county in northwestern Romania was declared an emergency
zone, with 6,000 hectares (14,800 acres) of arable land and more
tha000 farms under water. More than 1,000 people have been
evacuated.
	   The floods have mainly affected rural regions. Farmers, many in
tears, described on television how they had moved their livestock
into the upper floors of their homes. House insurance is virtually

German foreign minister praises Kosovo-Albanian leader 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Saturday
invited Kosovo Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova to visit
Bonn, praising him for his peaceful efforts to end violence in
Kosovo province.
	   Kinkel urged Rugova to ``use all his influence'' to overcome
fighting between Serb forces and the militant Kosovo Liberation
Army, which seeks independence from the Serb Republic that makes up
most of Yugoslavia.
	   Rugova also wants secession, but his longtime pacifism has put
him at odds with the KLA.
	   More than 300 people have died in fighting since March, when
Serbian police began a crackdown on the militants they call
``terrorists.'' Most Kosovo Albanians, who outnumber Serbs nine to
one in the province, want independence.
	   Kinkel, who called for an end to the violence, emphasized that
the international community has not only condemned the Serbs but
also urged the KLA to cease its attacks.
	   He said the German government was committed to a solution which
``secures the legitimate interests of the Kosovo Albanians without
calling into question the territorial interests of Yugoslavia.''
	   He warned Rugovo that ``only he who is prepared to carry out
dialogue on this basis can receive our support.''

Initial results show socialists leading in Czech early elections President Vaclav Havel to start talks on new government Monday. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with results from 55 percent of voting precints,
By NADIA RYBAROVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ For the first time since Communist
rule ended in 1989, Czechs backed the center-left Social Democrats
in early parliamentary elections, preliminary official results
showed Saturday.
	   According to the results, the Social Democrats, led by Milos
Zeman, were ahead with 32.43 percent, but far short of winning a
parliamentary majority.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus was second with 26.56 percent, according to preliminary
results, with 55 percent of the vote counted and released by the
Central Election Committee. Final results were expected Sunday.
	   President Vaclav Havel invited Zeman, Klaus and the leaders of
the Christian Democratic Party and the Freedom Union for talks on
the future government at the Prague Castle on Monday, his spokesman
Ladislav Spacek said.
	   The Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union were among the
three other parties that cleared the five percent threshold needed
to get to the parliament, with 9.64 and 8.27 percent respectively.
Another party to win parliamentary seats were the Communists with
11.47 percent, according to the preliminary results.
	   Zeman said he expects to be picked by the president to form the
new government.
	   Klaus, who was ousted last December when his center-right
minority coalition government fell apart over a party finance
scandal, had no immediate comment.
	   In contrast to an exit poll by the normally reliable Austrian
agency IFES, the preliminary results indicated the extremist
Republican Party had not made it into parliament.
	   Both the exit poll and preliminary results suggested the
populist Pensioners for Secure Living, which headed into the polls
as a strong smaller party, had not made the cut.
	   Despite the Social Democrats' expected victory, Zeman lacks a
clear majority and will have to go through painful negotiations to
form a government coalition.
	   ``The results of the election is what was expected, i.e. a
stalemate,'' Jiri Pehe, political advisor to President Vaclav Havel
told Nova private television. ``It will be very difficult to form a
government.''
	   Zeman's potential partners are the small Christian Democrats and
the Freedom Union _ a new party favored by Havel.
	   Voting for all 200 seats in the lower house of parliament, which
will form a new government, began Friday and continued Saturday
with polls closing at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT). The country has 8.09
million eligible voters.
	   The elections came two years early. A caretaker government under
banker Josef Tosovsky has been running the country since Klaus'
ouster.

Bobby Gimby, wrote Canadian Centennial song, dead at 79 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NORTH BAY, Ontario (AP) _ Bobby Gimby, whose 1967 song Ca-na-da
became an anthem for Canadian unity, died Saturday morning at a
retirement home in North Bay. He was 79.
	   An official at Cassellholme Home for the Aged in this northern
Ontario town gave no specific cause of death, but said he died
peacefully in his sleep.
	   A friend of Gimby's told The Canadian Press that the entertainer
came down with pneumonia a few weeks ago and spent a couple of days
in hospital, but had recovered.
	   Gimby (pronounced JIM-bee), a Saskatchewan native, originally
wrote Ca-na-da for a 30-minute film documentary on Canada's
Centennial. But public demand was so great the song was released as
a record.
	   It became a staple for school choirs and at summer camps.
	   Gimby said in a 1992 interview with The Canadian Press that the
song was ``sung by four kids, and was then over-dubbed to make it
sound like 44 kids.''
	   For a time, the whole country seemed to be humming, singing or
whistling the jingly, up-beat bilingual tune that promised unity
among both English and French Canadians. It topped the Canadian hit
parade for most of the 1967 Centennial Year.
	   It embodied the era's optimism _ Canada was entering its second
century with a strong economy, an increasing voice in international
affairs and a hugely successful expo in Montreal.
	   In later years, after economic downturns and separatist turmoil
in Quebec, it became a nostalgic reference point.
	   Gimby was born into a musical family Oct. 15, 1918, in the tiny
Saskatchewan town of Cabri.
	   Later, in Vancouver, he joined a touring orchestra playing
coronet and was featured on Canadian afternoon radio. In his
heyday, Gimby was one of Canada's top-paid composers of pop songs
and advertising jingles.
	   Gimby later signed over his share of the profits in ``Ca-na-da''
to the Boy Scouts of Canada.
	   Gimby continued to play in the band at a previous retirement
home. He is survived by a daughter, Lynn, who lives in France.

World Cup: Croatian nationalism flares at news conference 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Croatia will file a protest with FIFA
because a Serb interpreter was brought out to translate for the
team's coach at a news conference after Saturday's World Cup game
against Japan, a team spokesman said.
	   A Croatian diplomat climbed onto the podium during the
post-match event asking he be allowed to translate coach Miroslav
Blazevic's remarks in French for Croatian reporters, but the FIFA
press officer in charge refused.
	   The interpreter continued as scheduled.
	   ``This is a FIFA press conference,'' FIFA's Markus Siegler said.
``Even if the lady speaks with a Serb accent, I'm not going to
allow any politics in here.''
	   Blazevic tried to calm the situation, inviting reporters to
carry on with the news conference.
	   The translator, a young volunteer with local World Cup
organizers, said she was from Belgrade, the Yugoslavian capital.
She refused to give her name, saying she did not want to get
involved in the incident.
	   Croatia won independence from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia after a
1991 war fueled by fierce Balkan nationalism. Despite regional
differences, Serbs and Croats officially shared a language in
former Yugoslavia and can easily understand each other's tongue.
	   But Croatian team spokesman Darko Tironi was incensed.
	   ``They are two different languages,'' he said. ``We will make a
complaint to FIFA.''
	   Siegler said he would advise Croatia's next World Cup venues to
make sure Croatian translators are on hand.
	   ``It was never the intention of FIFA to offend them,'' he said.

Polish train engineers suspend strike 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with strike suspended
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish train drivers agreed to suspend
their four-day-old strike on Saturday after railroad officials
promised not to punish them for their walkout.
	   Train engineers started returning to work Saturday afternoon,
but railroad officials said train traffic would not be fully
restored until Monday.
	   Jan Zaborowski, the head of the Union of Train Engineers, vowed
to keep pressure on the government-run railway for pay raises and
earlier retirement.
	   During negotiations, which broke off Friday, the government
refused to discuss early retirement in deference to a federal
parliament reform plan.
	   Lawmakers are working on a pension reform package that is
expected to set strict, uniform retirement limits _ 65 years for
men and 60 for women _ and to curtail earlier retirement.
	   Train drivers want workers with more than 20 years of service to
be able to retire at 55. They also demanded raises of 300 zlotys
(dlrs 88) in their current pay of 1,600 zlotys (dlrs 470) a month.
	   The leftist Union of Train Engineers represents 14,000 of
Poland's 22,000 train drivers. The right-wing Solidarity trade
union, which represents more than 60,000 of all railway workers,
did not join the strike, which it said was politically motivated.

Italian centrists rethinking `yes' vote on NATO to UPDATE with Fini inviting centrists to ask Prodi to resign, Berlusconi confirming position 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: SUBS penultimate graf, Opposition leader etc, with two grafs
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian centrists were waffling Saturday on next
week's vote on NATO enlargement, leaving it unclear if Premier
Romano Prodi's coalition would muster a majority in the crucial
balloting in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   However, government officials held out hope, despite the
reconsideration of their ``yes'' position by centrists headed by
former President Francesco Cossiga, and the adamant opposition by
hardline Communists, that the vote scheduled for Tuesday would
pass, thus avoiding the need for a confidence vote on the
coalition.
	   ``I hope that between now and Tuesday there will be a sense of
responsibility on all sides, because I continue to think that
opening up a phase of political instability would be very heavy for
the country and for our international image,'' said Deputy Premier
Walter Veltroni.
	   ``I don't think that on the horizon there's a collapse of the
government,'' Veltroni added.
	   Carlo Scognamiglio, a member of Cossiga's centrists, raised the
possibility of a no-vote on NATO's eastward expansion.
	   The centrists were irked by criticism, from an official of the
main leftist party in Prodi's coalition, of Cossiga's ringing
defense a few days earlier of former Premier Giulio Andreotti at
the latter's trial in Palermo on charges of helping the Mafia.
	   On Friday, Communist leader Fausto Bertinotti stuck to his
anti-NATO position.
	   There are fears that if the government loses its majority on
such a fundamental foreign policy issue, it could face a vote of
confidence. But Bertinotti has indicated that his forces would
continue to give Prodi the edge the coalition needs in the lower
chamber should the government's survival come to a confidence vote.
	   Prodi has a majority in the Senate but usually counts on
Bertinotti's Communists for a majority in the Chamber.
	   Opposition leader and former premier Silvio Berlusconi on
Saturday confirmed his support for the expansion, support which he
links to a demand that Prodi then step down.
	   On Saturday, Berlusconi's right-wing ally, Gianfranco Fini,
invited the indecisive centrists to follow Berlusconi's lead by
backing NATO enlargement and then pushing for Prodi's resignation.
	   Prodi's government nearly collapsed last year when Bertinotti
voted against plans to send Italian troops to quell unrest in
Albania, but the opposition bailed him out.

World Cup: Belgium 2, Mexico 2, Red cards 2 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ In a game that turned on a red-card
penalty, 10-man Mexico rallied from 2-0 down in second half to draw
2-2 with Belgium on Saturday.
	   Trailing by two goals, both scored by Marc Wilmots, Mexico got
the break it needed when Belgian substitute Gert Verheyen brought
down Ramon Ramirez after the Mexican midfielder took a pass from
Cuauhtemoc Blanco in the 55th minute.
	   Alberto Garcia Aspe converted the spot kick to make the score
2-1, and, of equal importance, the number of players on the field
was once again even at 10-10.
	   Ramirez and Blanco teamed again for Mexico's tying goal in the
63rd minute, with Blanco putting in Ramirez' left-wing cross with a
magnificent flying left-footed volley.
	   The two red cards, including one given to Mexican defender Pavel
Pardo in the 29th minute, ran the total to seven expulsions in six
World Cup games since new FIFA president Sepp Blatter complained
that referees weren't being strict enough.
	   The draw left Mexico with 4 points and Belgium with 2 in Group
E. Mexico would have clinched a second-round berth with a victory.
	   Belgium, with a man advantage, seemed in control after Wilmots
scored two goals in five minutes, one by standing still and another
by running a slalom course.
	   On the first, in the 43rd minute, Wilmots simply put his body in
front of Luis Oliveira's corner kick, letting it bank off his chest
and left thigh directly in front of goalkeeper Jorge Campos, who
couldn't stop the ball from going between his legs.
	   Wilmots' second, a fine individual effort, came three minutes
after halftime. He beat Duilio Davino to the right, then literally
pushed away Claudio Suarez to the left and was falling to the pitch
as he put his 10-meter shot inside the right post.
	   Pardo was expelled by Scottish referee Hugh Dallas for clipping
the ankle of Vital Borkelmans on a late tackle from behind in the
29th minute. Borkelmans was taken off the field on a stretcher, but
returned to the game after a few minutes.
	   After Mexico rallied to tie, the game slowed to a crawl on a hot
afternoon at Stade Lescure. Mexico's Jesus Arellano made a good run
in the 89th, but goalkeeper Filip De Wilde came away from the net
to thwart the challenge.

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Hundreds of riot police and soldiers fired
into the air Saturday in clashes with thousands of Yemenis
protesting a 40 percent IMF-required hike in fuel prices.
	   The demonstrators took to the streets for the second day,
throwing rocks at police cars, smashing billboards and shouting
chants against the government, a security official said.
	   The hikes were in line with requirements of the International
Monetary Fund to remove subsidies on petroleum products and other
commodities like flour and sugar by the end of 1998.
	   Most shops remained closed in the capital San`a. Protesters
burned tires in the city's main streets and used rocks to close
vital roads, the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Baton-wielding police chased demonstrators in streets and fired
tear gas, but there were no reports of casualties.
	   The protesters chanted against Prime Minister Abdul-Karim
al-Iryani, who came to power last month.

Four Serbian policemen held by militants 
</HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Four Serbian policemen have been
kidnapped by militants of Kosovo Albanians' separatist army, a
senior police officer said Saturday, declining to release details.
	   Col. Bozidar Filic would not say whether Serbian police and
soldiers _ estimated at a total 45,000 to 50,000 men _ would
withdraw from the secessionist Serbian province, as demanded by the
West, despite 24 hours with no report of any attack by the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   The shadowy militants have said they would negotiate with the
Serbs if security forces first withdraw. That echoes a demand by
the West, and by the Kosovo Albanians' political leader, Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   Filic admitted that certain roads are controlled by the KLA, but
declined to comment on its claims of controlling 40 percent of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one. He also
declined to give details of how the four policemen were seized.
	   More than 300 people have died in fighting since March, when
Serbian police began a crackdown on the militants they call
``terrorists,'' who are fighting for the independence sought by
most of Kosovo Albanians.
	   The president of Albania, Rexhep Meidani, was meanwhile quoted
as telling the independent Serbian daily Danas (Today) that there
is ``no time to lose'' to stop fighting in Kosovo. He praised last
Monday's NATO air maneuvers near Kosovo borders and called for NATO
air strikes against Yugoslav military installations.
	   ``There is no time to lose, and if bloodshed and ethnic
cleansing continue, military attacks on Serbian military
instalations would increase possibility for a realistic solution,''
Meidani said. ``An international presence is needed in Kosovo...
that would prevent spreading of conflict to the entire region.''
	   Rugova said Kosovo could not remain within Yugoslavia, even as a
third republic alongside Serbia and Montenegro. But he said a
protectorate could be an interim solution.
	   ``We have now the historic chance to liberate ourselves, and
that must be seized upon,'' he said.

Four injured in small plane crash 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Four people were injured, two of
them seriously, when a small plane was forced to make a
crash-landing in east Bohemia Saturday, the news agency CTK
reported.
	   The agency said the five-seat L 200 Morava plane crash landed in
a field near Racice nad Trotinou, some 100 kilometers (62 miles)
east of Prague. Problems with the engine were cited as the likely
cause for the landing.
	   The pilot and all three passengers on board were hospitalized,
the report said. It did not give their nationality, saying only
that the plane is privately owned in Prague.

Saudis fire Parreira, Croatia beats Japan, Belgium-Mexico tie 2-2 Saturday's final game AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Belgium-Mexico tie, will be updated after
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Four years after leading Brazil to a record fourth
World Cup title, Carlos Alberto Parreira was fired by Saudi Arabia
on Saturday.
	   The Brazilian coach was shown the door two days after the Saudis
became the first of the 32 teams to be eliminated from the World
Cup, beaten 4-0 by host France following a 1-0 defeat by Denmark.
	   ``As of now we are no longer with the Saudi team,'' Parreira
told reporters at the team hotel outside Paris.
	   ``I don't feel happy and I don't feel comfortable with the
decision taken by the Saudi officials. At least they should have
let us continue until the end of the World Cup.''
	   His firing came on the day Croatia virtually assured itself of a
place in the second round at its first attempt and both Mexico and
Belgium stayed in contention with a 2-2 tie.
	   Real Madrid striker Davor Suker fired the only goal in Croatia's
1-0 Group H victory over Japan in the 77th minute. Japan, another
World Cup first timer, will drop out Sunday if two-time titlist
Argentina avoids defeat to the third debutant in the group,
Jamaica, at Parc des Princes.
	   The result at Nantes was Croatia's second victory and Japan's
second loss. The Croatians began their first World Cup campaign
with a 3-1 victory over the Jamaicans and Japan lost 1-0 to
Argentina.
	   After Mexico's Pavel Pardo had been expelled by Scottish referee
Hugh Dallas, Belgium's Marc Wilmote fired his team into a 2-0 lead
at Bordeaux. After Belgium's Gert Verheyen was sent off for
tripping Jesus Ramirez, Mexican captain Alberto Garcia Aspe fired
home a penalty and then Cuauhtemoc Blanco brilliantly volleyed the
equalizer.
	   Saturday's other game also was in Group E, with the Netherlands
facing South Korea in Marseille.
	   While it was all going well for Croatia and its coach Miroslav
Blazevic, the World Cup was ending for Parreira, who is the eighth
coach to be sacked by the Saudis in less than four years.
	   He had signed a one-year contract with the Saudi federation in
December, abandoning his two-year deal with the New York-New Jersey
MetroStars of the United States' Major League Soccer after one
season, for a reported dlrs 3 million and his second spell with the
team.
	   Parreira led Kuwait in 1982 and the United Arab Emirates in 1990
to the World Cup finals and the Saudis won the Asian Cup in under
him in 1988.
	   He and Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic are the only two men to
coach four different national teams in the World Cup finals.
	   The Brazilian said the reason given for his dismissal their
``very high expectations _ at least to repeat what they had done in
the last World Cup, to reach the second round.''
	   Since the team failed to achieve the goal, he said, ``they have
taken the decision to cancel my contract and not to coach the Saudi
team any further.''
	   While the Saudi federation was unhappy about their team's
results under Parreira, FIFA said it was satisfied with the
performances of the referees.
	   ``We're happy so far with refereeing,'' said Michel Zen
Ruffinen, acting general secretary of soccer's world governing body
in reaction to widespread criticism of the wildly fluctuating
frequency of red cards.
	   The day after FIFA president Sepp Blatter had accused the
referees of leniency, five players were expelled in two games.
	   Zen Ruffinen said Thursday's flurry at the Denmark-South Africa
and France-Saudi games was ``not a reaction'' to Blatter's
statement.
	   He called the ``technical'' aspect of referring _ recognizing
and calling fouls _ generally ``good and even very good'' through
the first third of the 64 matches.

England faces defeat in the second test at Lord's 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fast-bowler Allan Donald bowled South Africa to a
stranglehold on the second cricket test after England was
embarrassingly shot out for 110 in its first innings at Lord's
Saturday.
	   Donald demolished England on both sides of the lunch break to
finish with 5-32 as skipper Hansie Cronje forced the follow on.
	   England, 250 runs behind South Africa's 360, lost opener Steve
James, but Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain defied the visitors
until six overs before stumps.
	   Atherton, on 44, swept left-arm wrist spinner Paul Adams to
Jacques Kallis at mid-wicket to end the stubborn second wicket
stand that lasted three minutes over three hours.
	   England was 105 for two at stumps on the third day with Hussain
unbeaten on 52 and night watchman Dean Headley surviving 20 minutes
for his one not out.
	   The 94-run second wicket standoff 278 balls gave a capacity
30,000 crowd something to cheer about after a ignominious batting
display earlier.
	   Atherton and Hussain have only delayed the inevitable as England
still needs another 145 runs to avoid an innings defeat.
	   Atherton and Hussain came together after Donald's understudy
Shaun Pollock had removed James in the fourth over of the innings.
	   Hussain has batted for 205 minutes and hit nine boundaries off
157 balls.
	   The home side innings lasted just 26 minutes after the lunch
break as England lost its last seven wickets for 70 runs.
	   It was the second time in a row England has been shot out
cheaply in a Lord's test. In 1997, Australian fast bowler Glenn
McGrath took eight wickets as the home side was shot out for 77.
	   Donald removed Mark Ramprakash and finished the innings with No.
11 Angus Fraser for 96 minutes and 64 balls for 12 runs before he
was given out by Australian umpire Darrell Hair. Ramprakash walked
off disapproving Hair's decision as the television replays
indicated the ball clipping his elbow en route to Boucher.
	   England, resuming the day on 40 for three, slumped to 94 for
seven at lunch after Donald fired out Hussain and Headley in the
space of four balls.
	   Extras top scored with 20 in the England innings followed by
Hussain 15 and Alec Stewart's 14.
	   In fact it was the fourth time extras have top scored for
England and the first since Manchester 1976 when extras were 25 in
England's 126 against the West Indies.
	   Pollock, who began England's slide on the second evening with
two wickets, finished with 3-42.

Garzelli wins fifth stage of Tour de Suisse in Italian sweep 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LENZERHEIDE, Switzerland (AP) _ Stefano Garzelli won the
225.8-kilometer (140.3-mile) fifth stage of the Tour de Suisse on
Saturday after an ascent attack 10 kilometers before the finish.
	   David Rebellin, who trailed his fellow Italian by 21 seconds,
remained on top of the overall standings. Vladimir Belli completed
an Italian sweep of the top three places Saturday, the first major
stage in the Alps.
	   Garzelli moved to second place in the standings, 10 seconds
back, displacing Laurent Jalabert of France.
	   Bjarne Riis of Denmark, winner of the 1996 Tour de France,
finished fourth. Last year's Tour de France winner, Jan Ullrich of
Germany, was 13th.
	   The stage, which began in Malpensa, Italy, featured a
2,500-meter (8,200-foot) difference in altitude over the last 95
kilometers (59.0 miles), including a 31-kilometer ascent to the
Spluegen, one of the most difficult passes in the Alps.

Eritreans remember war dead; vow, if need be, to fight Ethiopia again

	   WAKE DUBA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritreans, bearing flags that snapped
in hot blasts of wind, Saturday remembered those killed in a
30-year war for independence from Ethiopia as they again faced the
same enemy in a border conflict.
	   Diplomatic efforts have failed to resolve the 6-week dispute
that has spread to three fronts and jeopardizes the stability of
the Horn of Africa.
	   Fighting, which broke out May 6 and has claimed hundreds of
lives, has ebbed since June 11.
	   In an emotional display of solidarity on Martyrs' Day, more than
100,000 Eritreans welcomed home 720 of their countrymen who had
been expelled from Ethiopia.
	   ``People are angry, they feel hurt, but at the same time there
is a sense of pride and unity,'' said Yemane Gebreab, presidential
adviser.
	   At dawn, thousands of people carrying wilting flowers walked 6
kilometers (4 miles) from the capital Asmara north to Wake Duba to
remember 130 civilians slaughtered 23 years ago by Ethiopian
troops.
	   Crouched on a rocky, thorn-covered hill, they listened to
patriotic speeches and songs paying tribute to the dead and vowed
to send even children to the front to protect their hard-won
freedom.
	   ``We have learned from experience that we must fight for our
freedom,'' said Paulos Menghistu, 53, whose parents were killed in
Wake Duba.
	   ``Even the children are ready to fight against the Ethiopians,
because they remember their family members who sacrified their
lives for independence.''
	   At a candlelight memorial service Friday night, Regional
Administrator Weldemicael Gebremariam told a crowd of thousands,
``This year's Martyrs' Day is special because Eritrea is in
conflict again with the same enemy and will ask for your lives.''
	   It is the horrors of three decades of war, little noticed by the
outside world, that have hardened Eritreans' resolve.
	   About 65,000 Eritreans died in the fight for independence. It
ended in 1991 after Eritrean rebels helped Ethiopian rebels oust
the Marxist dictatorship of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam.
	   Eritreans voted overwhelmingly for independence in a 1993
referendum backed by Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
	   On Friday, Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, a comrade-in-arms
of Meles in the struggle, urged the two nations to ``put our
alliance back in place so that we contribute to each other's
stability and to the stability of the region.''
	   Recalling the slaughter in Waka Duba, priest Mathew Eyasu said
Ethiopian troops surrounded the village where three weddings were
being celebrated on Feb. 1, 1975.
	   While enemy soldiers killed 30 people in their homes, others
sought refuge in St. Mary's Debre Kuscum Church, he said. But the
Ethiopians came and ordered the Eritreans outside, stripped them
naked, then shot or knifed them one-by-one until the death toll
reached 100 men, women and children.
	   Paulos' parents were among those killed.
	   ``On this day, I am really happy we found peace and freedom.
When everyone died in our village we were in tears, even
fightened,'' he said.

Huge march held in Rome by unions to push for more work Naples 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with trash bins set afire in separate protest in
With AP Photos
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Union leaders led a huge march through the streets
of Rome Saturday, hinting at strikes after the summer if Premier
Romano Prodi's government doesn't do more to create jobs.
	   A crowd estimated at 300,000 by organizers and 80,000-100,000 by
police converged on St. John Lateran Square to hear leaders of the
three main labor federations challenge the center-left government
to more agressively tackle unemployment, especially in the south
where joblessness in some cities is almost double the national
average of 12.2 percent.
	   Pietro Larizza, head of one of the federations, reminded the
crowd that there was a similar march through Rome in spring 1997.
``There won't be a third,'' Larizza said, indicating that a general
strike might possibly be the next step if ``concrete, verifiable
results'' on the job front don't come soon.
	   Last month, union leaders decided to hold the march Saturday
instead of a general strike.
	   But at Saturday's rally, they raised the prospect of a ``hot
autumn,'' code words for a season peppered by strikes in all
sectors.
	   ``For us, time has run out. We will keep the pressure high
because we want results,'' said another labor federation leader,
Sergio D'Antoni.
	   Rome's rally was peaceful, but in Naples, a separate protest of
a few thousand people turned tense when some of the jobless set
trash bins afire during a march from that southern city's train
station to its main square.

kilometers (59.0 miles), including a 31-kilometer (19-mile) ascent
to the Spluegen, one of the most difficult passes in the Alps.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Thousands of Spaniards rallied in downtown
Madrid on Saturday, demanding a 35-hour work week with no reduction
in pay, .
	   Supported by Spanish trade unions as well as the United Left
political coalition, and inspired by massive demonstrations in
France in recent months, demonstrators marched through the main
streets of Madrid's center.
	   Protesters from all over Spain rallied to the claim that the
reduction of work hours would help create hundreds of thousands of
jobs.
	   Spain's unemployment rate, over 20 percent, is the highest in
European Union, although there is a relatively large hidden
economy.
	   Organizers estimated 40,000 demonstrators, while police said
20,000 people attended the march.
	   Labor minister Javier Arenas said Saturday that his government
does not favor a mandatory 35-hour week.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ About 50,000 people marched through Paris Saturday
in an annual homosexual rally, dancing atop colorful floats and
displaying banners supporting a bill that would give homosexuals
new legal recognition.
	   The march, on a very hot afternoon, started mid-afternoon in the
Latin Quarter on the city's Left Bank and finished at Place de la
Nation in east Paris.
	   Revelers draped in rainbow-colored flags danced to techno music,
showered passers-by with confetti and released hundreds of
multi-colored balloons.
	   But a chief organizer of the march, the 17th in the French
capital, lamented that the day's events had been undermined by the
World Cup.
	   ``We had to scrap loads of things because of the World Cup: not
just for security, but also because of a lack of sponsors,'' the
left-wing daily Liberation quoted Charles Myara as saying.
	   Last year, an estimated 300,000 took part in the rally.
	   Liberation said many sponsors who are also pouring money into
the World Cup have stayed away this year, fearing a conflict of
interests between the two events.
	   Security concerns over the World Cup have also affected the
march, Liberation said, with police denying authorization for gay
bars to remain open beyond usual closing time _ 2:00 a.m. _ as is
normally the case on the march day.
	   The slogan for the rally was ``Gays and lesbians have rights _
human rights.''
	   Several banners made reference to a bill, to be debated later
this year in parliament, which would give new legal recognition to
homosexual couples and unwed heterosexuals.
	   ``The bill is one of the final rights we have yet to acquire,''
said a 40-year-old marcher, identifying himself only as Mariel.
	   ``And this demonstration is very useful. A few years ago there
were only 400 of us and people insulted us. Now there are tens of
thousands of us _ a true show of force due to our perseverance.''
	   The bill _ known as the Civil Solidarity Pact _ has been
criticized by President Jacques Chirac.
	   In response to the bill, some 12,000 mayors _ mainly from the
French right _ signed a petition in May opposing marriage between
homosexuals.
	   Also participating in the march were several left-wing politcal
figures, including Jack Lang, the former culture minister.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Red Cross appealed to Romanians on
Saturday for urgent donations of money and clothes to help tens of
thousands of victims of floods.
	   The floods across northern Romania claimed their first life
Friday, when a 47-year-old man was crushed by a load of sand in the
shelter he took from torrential rain, the Mediafax news agency
said. Four friends with him were treated for light injuries, it
added.
	   The government said that more than one third of the country was
affected by the floods. Main roads in the northwest region of
Transylvania were closed Saturday.
	   Officials from 16 of Romania's 41 counties asked the government
for funds, medicines and clothing, private television PRO TV
reported.

Mexico comes back for 2-2 draw against Belgium 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: optional, quotes upcoming
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Mexico came back from two goals and one
man down to force a 2-2 draw with Belgium on Saturday, undoing the
double-goal performance of Marc Wilmots with flashes of technical
brilliance.
	   In a seesaw game that saw two more red cards for illegal
tackles, Belgium relied on sheer brawn to build a big lead, yet
pace and cunning almost gave Mexico the win in the end.
	   With one minute to go and both sides level, substitute Jesus
Arellano ran through the exhausted Belgian defense, and it took a
daring save from Filip De Wilde to block the shot and then the
rebound of Ramon Ramirez to deny Mexico an incredible comeback win.
	   The draw left Mexico with 4 points and Belgium with 2 in Group
E. Mexico would have clinched a second-round berth with a victory.
	   Belgium went ahead in the 43rd minute when the Mexican defense
refused to react to a corner, letting the ball from Luis Oliveira
fly over and allowing an onrushing Wilmots to body slam it in
between the legs of Jorge Campos.
	   Three minutes into the second half, Wilmots added a second,
lumbering through the Mexican defense in his trademark style,
breaking two tackles and falling over as he unleashed a
right-footed shot past Campos.
	   It seemed to seal the fate of Mexico, which had been playing
with 10 men since the 29th minute when Pavel Pardo was sent off for
a textbook example of an illegal tackle from behind on Vital
Borkelmans.
	   Yet Mexico got a glimmer of hope again in the 55th minute when
Ramirez took a pass from Cuauhtemoc Blanco in the penalty area and
was brought down by Gert Verheyen. Alberto Garcia Aspe converted
the spot kick and Verheyen was sent off.
	   Eight minutes later, Mexico completed its recovery when the same
duo combined on a fast break. Ramirez broke free on the left and
crossed into the penalty area, where Blanco literally came flying
in to stab the cross home with a left-footed volley.
	   The game was played in a stifling heat that peaked at 37 degrees
Celsius (97F), with a rare, fresh breeze off the Gironde river
bringing some relief to the players on the sun-baked Parc Lescure.
	   The red card for Pardo was the first turning point for Mexico
after it had been the most dangerous team early on, twice hitting
the bar in the opening 20 minutes.
	   But even with a man up, Belgium could not put on a show,
sweating its way through the searing heat and rarely getting a
glimpse of Campos until Wilmots struck.
	   At the other end, Mexico was stopped by the woodwork. In the
10th minute, Joel Sanchez soared above the tall Belgian defense and
crashed a header onto the underside of the bar. It bounced just in
front of the line and Luis Hernandez' follow-up header was cleared
away by defender Danny Boffin.
	   In the 20th minute, a miscued cross from Jaime Oriales skimmed
off the bar and back into play.
	   The Mexican sombreros were prominent and very useful among the
36,000-sellout crowd, while many Belgians preempted sunburn by
painting their faces crimson to cheer on the Red Devils.

Hiroshima survivor takes message of peace to Pakistan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A survivor of the atomic explosion in
Hiroshima is taking a message of peace to Pakistan along with
horrifying descriptions of those who did not survive.
	   ``You cannot bring about security with nuclear weapons and if we
continue testing of nuclear weapons, we will not live much
longer,'' Yasuhiko Taketa told reporters in Bombay on Saturday at
the end of a weeklong visit to India. He will fly to Pakistan on
Sunday.
	   Taketa and two other members of Gensuikin (Japan Congress
Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs) earlier visited Pokaran, where
India detonated five underground nuclear devices last month.
	   Gensuikin works with bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
known as Hibakusha.
	   During his visit, Taketa urged both India and Pakistan not to
test any more nuclear devices and urged all atomic powers to get
rid of their nuclear arsenal.
	   Fears of an escalation of a nuclear arms race were raised when
India and Pakistan recently detonated nuclear weapons.
	   Taketa fought to control tears as he recalled the devastation
wrought by the 1945 atomic bomb and the nightmares that have
haunted him since he was 13 years old.
	   Although Taketa believes that the United States has the primary
responsibility of destroying its nuclear arsenal, he said ``the
people of India and Pakistan must realize how terrifying nuclear
weapons really are. It will be difficult to make governments accept
this, but we cannot just sit around. Time is too short.''

	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Fighting raged through the northern suburbs
of Guinea-Bissau's capital on Saturday as rebel soldiers held off
advancing Senegalese troops near the city's airport and reportedly
sealed roads into the seaside city.
	   The breakaway army led by former chief of staff Ansumane Mane
were positioned on roads into Bissau from the towns of Safim,
Nhacra and Cumere on the city's outskirts, Portugese radio
RDP-Africa reported.
	   Since the uprising began on June 7, loyalist soldiers have
controlled the port and city center.
	   Gunfire rattled through the city's northern fringe where the
renegade troops held the airport despite being cut off from their
main supply of ammunition, clandestine rebel radio and Senegalese
military officials said.
	   Senegal has sent at least 1,300 troops to reinforce soldiers
loyal to the government of President Joao Bernardo Vieira in
Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip.
	   The rebels were forced from their stronghold military garrison
where the revolt began in Bissau last week, but were dug in at the
nearby Bissalanca airport.
	   ``This is a well organized military action by a professional
military junta,'' said the radio broadcast, monitored in the
Senegalese border town of Mpak.
	   Mane earlier this month staged an attack on Vieira in a bid to
oust the longstanding leader of Guinea-Bissau. Mane, fuming over
accusations of smuggling guns to Senegalese separatist guerrillas,
was fired shortly before staging his coup attempt.
	   Almost two weeks of artillery and ground battles have left
downtown blocks in the capital charred and battered. An exodus of
almost the entire city of 300,000 people has threatened to create a
humanitarian crisis of internally displaced refugees.
	   Food and water shortages have been reported in Bissau and
elsewhere. All telephone communication with the West African
country had been cut by Saturday, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
reported.
	   Shelling at the Senegalese border has sealed the border with
Guinea-Bissau.
	   The United Nations relief agency World Food Program said
Guinea-Bissau's government ``requisitioned'' two storage complexes
containing 2,700 metric tons (2,970 tons) of U.N. food, much of it
intended for hungry refugees.
	   ``The World Food Program wants the government to give back the
two stores of food,'' spokesman Wagdi Othman said in Abidjan, Ivory
Coast. The U.N. agency was worried the food would be used to feed
fighters, Othman said.
	   The government, however, told Portuguese media the food will be
used to feed the people and not the military.
	   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, meanwhile,
deployed a delegation to Senegal to investigate the extent of a
growing refugee crisis in Guinea-Bissau.
	   Attempted peace talks failed just as they started to get under
way. Gambian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sedat Jobe returned to his
country after failing to meet with Mane.
	   A Russian-made plane was seen taking off from the rebel-held
airport Saturday, and was reported to be carrying Mane on a
diplomatic mission to Gambia, a Senegalese private radio station
said. The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The rebels earlier had said they would only negotiate with their
chosen mediator, Senegalese opposition legislator Landing Savane.

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman, who defeated
Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-3, 6-2 Saturday to win the Nottingham
Open grass-court tournament, is now pointing toward Wimbledon.
	   ``For this year, my biggest goal has been Wimbledon,'' said the
winning Swede, seeded No. 11 when Wimbledon opens Monday.
	   ``I'm feeling very strong at the mogment,'' he added. ``I feel
like I'm getting back my self-confidence, so it will be a different
Jonas Bjorkman at Wimbldon.''
	   Bjorkman, ranked No. 9 on the ATP Tour, has struggled on grass
at the All England Club, losing in the first rounds the last two
year _ and going out in the second in 1995.
	   Bjorkman broke Black to go up 2-1 in the first set, held 3-1,
and then broke Black again in the ninth game to win 6-3.
	   In the second set, it was 2-2 before Bjorkman won four straight
games _ two breaks included _ to prevail 6-2.
	   ``The last time I beat him (Black) was in Australia this year. I
was really serving well there and that's what I did today.''
	   In the semifinals, which were forced indoors by showers in
central England, second-seeded Bjorkman defeated Jerome Golmard of
France 6-3, 2-6, 6-3.
	   Black, the No. 7 seed, defeated Sargis Sargsian of Armenia 6-4,
6-2.

Pope urges Europeans to reconcile with Jews 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with St. Poelten bishop making special mention of
controversial cardinalin 13th graf; edits to trim.
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Europeans must seek reconciliation with
the Jews for the ``unspeakable suffering'' inflicted on them, Pope
John Paul II said Saturday as he set down a tough agenda for the
old continent.
	   Addressing Austrian officials and diplomats in the former
Imperial Palace, the pope also listed duties and sacrifices
required of Europeans to overcome injustices and economic
disparity.
	   ``Don't forget the history of Europe is closely intertwined with
the history of that people from which the Lord Jesus came,'' John
Paul said. ``The Jewish people have been inflicted with unspeakable
suffering in Europe, and we can't affirm that all the roots of
these injustices have been cut.''
	   ``Reconciliation with the Jews is one of the fundamental duties
of Christians in Europe,'' John Paul said.
	   Sitting among the dignitaries was former Austrian President Kurt
Waldheim, who drew the ire of Jewish groups because of his alleged
complicity in war crimes by the German army in World War II.
	   Waldheim, invited to Saturday's ceremony as a former Austrian
head of state, shook John Paul's hand and chatted briefly with him
during the encounter in the Hofburg palace.
	   The pope received Waldheim in the Vatican in 1987, and Waldheim
welcomed the pope on his last trip to Austria in 1988, leading to
protests by Jews.
	   John Paul has spoken out often against anti-Semitism and the
horrors of the Holocaust, when an estimated six million Jews
perished at the hands of the Nazis.
	   But Saturday was believed to be the first time he put the burden
specifically on Europeans to make amends.
	   Later, the pope celebrated an open-air Mass at St. Poelten, some
60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Vienna, where the local bishop has
become the center of a storm that epitomizes the divisions rocking
Austria's Roman Catholic church.
	   Only some 25,000 people attended the service, including hundreds
from the pope's native Poland and other east European countries.
The crowd was well below expectations.
	   Many of the participants carried tiny flags in the Vatican's
yellow and white colors expressing loyalty to the pope and
Monsignor Kurt Krenn, the conservative bishop of St. Poelten who
has vocally defended Austrian cardinal Hans Hermann Groer. Groer
was forced out by the Vatican following accusations of pedophilia.
	   In his welcome address, Krenn even asked the faithful to pray
for Groer and infirm former St. Poelten bishop Franz Zak.
	   Catholics seeking such major church reforms as abolition of
priestly celibacy and admission of women to the priesthood have
seized on the case as an example of how conservative clergy has
disillusioned Austrian Catholics.
	   The pope praised Krenn for his attempts to fill parish vacancies
with priests but he ignored the controversy surrounding the bishop
who greeted the pontiff with genuflexion.
	   In a front page editorial Saturday, the main daily in the city
where the pope started his three-day visit, Salzburg, told him
Austrians were waiting for ``that redeeming little phrase ...`I'm
sorry that I sent you many a bishop without listening to your
wishes and requirements. I'm sorry that I caused divisions in your
church.'''
	   Opponents of Krenn handed out leaflets and held up black
balloons as protest symbols.
	   In his morning address, John Paul noted the aspirations of the
former communist countries in Europe as the 15-nation European
Union considers taking them in. The pope insisted that Western
Europe cannot remain an ``island of Western well-being on the
continent.''
	   ``The richer countries, inevitably, will have to make concrete
sacrifices'' to overcome the ``inhuman'' economic differences, the
pope said.
	   John Paul used his international audience to renew his attack on
what he called an expanding ``culture of death'' in the world,
referring to abortion and euthanasia.
	   He said Austria's law allowing abortions in the first three
months of preganancy ``remains a bleeding wound in my heart.''

Georgia and North Ossetia report progress in talks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leaders of Georgia and its breakaway province
of South Ossetia said Saturday that they were closer to a
settlement of their 8-year-old conflict, a Russian news agency
said.
	   ``The present and future of the Georgian and Ossetian peoples
are contingent on peace,'' presidents Eduard Shevardnadze of
Georgia and Lyudvig Chibirov of South Ossetia said in a joint
statement after three hours of talks in Borjhomi, Georgia, Interfax
said.
	   South Ossetia broke away from Georgia in 1990, when it was still
part of the Soviet Union. The region's mostly ethnic Ossetian
populace has been calling for unity with ethnic brethren in
Russia's North Ossetia.
	   In the talks, which included representatives of Russia and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Chibirov said
he agreed to help in the return of refugees from the conflict and
Shevardnadze agreed to provide aid to South Ossetia.
	   However, the two sides apparently did not reach agreement on the
future status of the breakaway province.
	   ``The two sides have intentionally left out any formulation on
the political status of South Ossetia so as not to jeopardize what
they have achieved,'' Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Boris
Pastukhov said, according to Interfax.

Mexico comes back for 2-2 draw against Belgium 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quotes
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Mexico came back from two goals and one
man down to force a 2-2 draw with Belgium on Saturday, undoing the
double-goal performance of Marc Wilmots with flashes of technical
brilliance.
	   In a seesaw game that saw two more red cards for illegal
tackles, Belgium relied on sheer brawn to build a big lead, yet
pace and cunning almost gave Mexico the win in the end.
	   With one minute to go and both sides level, substitute Jesus
Arellano ran through the exhausted Belgian defense, and it took a
daring save from Filip De Wilde to block the shot and then the
rebound of Ramon Ramirez to deny Mexico an incredible comeback win.
	   ``We would have loved that third goal,'' Mexican coach Manuel
Lapuente said. ``But it already was a good comeback.''
	   The draw left Mexico with 4 points and Belgium with 2 in Group
E. The Netherlands played South Korea in Marseille later Saturday,
with Belgium facing the Koreans in its final first-round game
Thursday.
	   ``After being 2-0 and one man up we had to go for a third, so I
cannot be happy with this result,'' said Belgian coach Georges
Leekens. ``Now, we have to win against South Korea.''
	   Belgium went ahead in the 43rd minute when the Mexican defense
refused to react to a corner, letting the ball from Luis Oliveira
fly over and allowing an onrushing Wilmots to body slam it in
between the legs of Jorge Campos.
	   Three minutes into the second half, Wilmots added a second,
lumbering through the Mexican defense in his trademark style,
breaking two tackles and falling over as he unleashed a
right-footed shot past Campos.
	   It seemed to seal the fate of Mexico, which had been playing
with 10 men since the 29th minute when Pavel Pardo was sent off for
a textbook example of an illegal tackle from behind on Vital
Borkelmans.
	   Yet Mexico got a glimmer of hope again in the 55th minute when
Ramirez took a pass from Cuauhtemoc Blanco in the penalty area and
was brought down by Gert Verheyen. Alberto Garcia Aspe converted
the spot kick and Verheyen was sent off.
	   Eight minutes later, Mexico completed its recovery when the same
duo combined on a fast break. Ramirez broke free on the left and
crossed into the penalty area, where Blanco literally came flying
in to stab the cross home with a left-footed volley.
	   The game was played in a stifling heat that peaked at 37 degrees
Celsius (97F), with a rare, fresh breeze off the Gironde river
bringing some relief to the players on the sun-baked Parc Lescure.
	   With the Belgians exhausted at the end, they were lucky to hang
on to the draw.
	   ``We were running on empty for the last quarter hour,'' Leekens
said.
	   The red card for Pardo was the first turning point for Mexico
after it had been the most dangerous team early on, twice hitting
the bar in the opening 20 minutes.
	   But even with a man up, Belgium could not put on a show,
sweating its way through the searing heat and rarely getting a
glimpse of Campos until Wilmots struck.
	   At the other end, Mexico was stopped by the woodwork. In the
10th minute, Joel Sanchez soared above the tall Belgian defense and
crashed a header onto the underside of the bar. It bounced just in
front of the line and Luis Hernandez' follow-up header was cleared
away by defender Danny Boffin.
	   In the 20th minute, a miscued cross from Jaime Oriales skimmed
off the bar and back into play.
	   The Mexican sombreros were prominent and very useful among the
36,000-sellout crowd, while many Belgians preempted sunburn by
painting their faces crimson to cheer on the Red Devils.

South Africa beats Ireland 33-0, in match marred by shoving

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa disposed of Ireland
33-0 on Saturday in a match marked by shoving and kicking.
	   The match also saw the first non-white Springbok player _ McNeil
Hendricks _ enter a Test in three years.
	   The World Champion team has come under censure at home over the
past year for its failure to promote black and mixed-race players.
	   The Springboks took five tries, with stand-in flyhalf Franco
Smith pulling the strings behind a rampant pack and Pieter Muller
on his outside and blindside flanker Andre Venter playing well.
	   Ireland were never allowed up front as they managed last week in
Bloemfontein.
	   A break out of defense by Smith saw Venter outstripping the
Irish cover, but referee Joel Dume called the players back and
penalized South African prop Adrian Garvey for an-off-the-ball
foul.
	   The ill-feeling from last week's punch by Keith Wood on
Springbok captain Gary Teichmann continued on Saturday.
	   After Ireland skipper Paddy Johns hit Teichmann at an early
lineout, Joost van der Westhuizen kicked Malcolm O'Kelly in the
back as the Irish lock lay trapped on the wrong side of a ruck _
and got a yellow card.
	   Van der Westhuizen responded by an opportunist try in the 16th
minute.
	   But tempers boiled over again when Ireland's Victor Costello was
cautioned for a fracas with James Dalton.
	   Fullback Percy Montgomery had a score disallowed for a forward
pass. But the team's Rassie Erasmus scored again, with Smith adding
goal point.
	   With five minutes of the half left, Dalton crossed in the right
corner for the Boks' third try after Smith and Stefan Terblanche
did the spadework.
	   Within minutes after half time, Teichmann was penalized for
reacting to Irish scrumhalf Conor McGuinness' pulling on his
jersey.
	   Amid the tumult, Hendricks slipped in to replace last week's
four-try hero Terblanche.
	   South African lock Krynauw Otto also was cautioned when he
traded blows with Johns, who escaped censure.
	   Teichmann crashed over from a loose ball close to the line in
the 63rd minute for his side's fourth try.
	   The last store came from Pieter Rossouw racing in from 40 meters
to round off another win.

Stewart's lead precarious on dangerous Olympic course holes; ROUND should end about 0000 GMT. AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Will UPDATED when about 2200 GMT when leaders finish nine
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The U.S. Golf Association didn't have to
take high-tech drivers away from players at the U.S. Open. The
Olympic Club did it for them. At times it seemed like even the
putter was useless.
	   By the time Payne Stewart walked off the 18th green with a
one-stroke lead over Jeff Maggert and Bob Tway going into
Saturday's third round, it was clear that the winner of this U.S.
Open would need even more patience than usual.
	   A clear indication of that was Stewart's 8-foot (2.44-meter)
birdie putt on No. 18. The ball was barely moving when it crept
past the hole and then rolled 20 feet (6.10 meters) away.
	   It was also clear that the grueling nature of the Lake Course
was such that no one would sprint from the pack and that virtually
any one of the 60 players who made the cut for the weekend rounds
was still in the hunt.
	   ``People seven over have a chance,'' Tiger Woods said after he
finished 36 holes at 6-over-par 146, nine strokes behind Stewart.
	   Lee Janzen, Lee Porter and 19-year-old amateur Matt Kuchar were
two strokes behind Stewart's 3-under-par 137, and a bunch of other
big names had a chance to jump into contention with a good third
round.
	   Nick Price started the day at 141, four strokes back. Tom
Lehman, David Duval and Frank Nobilo were among those at 143, while
John Daly and Colin Montgomerie were at 144 and defending champion
Ernie Els was at 145.
	   ``Absolutely,'' Duval said when asked if he was still in
contention.
	   ``I'll be six or seven off the lead and that's not too much in
this event,'' he said. ``I still maintain it won't be much better
than par'' that wins after 72 holes.
	   The playing is so difficult that a 66 or 67 on Saturday would
gain a lot of ground and put someone firmly into contention heading
into Sunday.
	   ``It will help the guys further back,'' Woods said about the
fact that the firm and fast course would only get firmer and
faster.
	   ``If I can somehow shoot two or three under and post that number
well in advance of the leaders, then they got to look at these
numbers coming down the stretch,'' he said.
	   And if there is one thing the players don't need in this U.S.
Open it is something else to think about.
	   The USGA came into this tournament saying it was concerned that
space-age technology in golf clubs was going to make a lot of
courses obsolete. They had it backward. The courses are making the
clubs obsolete.
	   Because of fairways as narrow as a hotel hallway, rough so deep
that players are happy merely to advance the ball and a lot of
dogleg holes where position is more important that distance, the
driver is virtually useless here.
	   Daly and Montgomerie don't even bother carrying one in their bag
and Woods hits it only two times a round, taking his strength away
from him and bringing him back to the field.
	   ``The U.S. Open to me is a complete examination,'' Jack Nicklaus
said after he shot 147 and made the cut for the 35th time in 42
tries.
	   ``Power and accuracy combined with touch is what this game is
all about,'' Nicklaus said. ``Keeping the ball in play and playing
the game with discipline. I love disciplined golf.''
	   But at times this week the players felt more like it was about
punishment rather than discipline. Especially when it came to some
pin positions on the extremely fast and severely contoured greens.
	   ``There are some pins out there that are really unfair,'' Woods
said. ``They're borderline illegal because they're on some slopes
that are actually tilted. Like on 17 and 18 _ those two pins _ you
can probably hit the ball past the hole and have it go in.''
	   In fact, on No. 18 Casey Martin, who was at 145, hit a shot
about 10 feet (3.05 meters) past the hole that ended about 35 feet
(10.67 meters) below it.
	   ``It was the worst pin position I've seen in a major
championship,'' said Nobilo, who has played in 23 majors.
	   ``I don't know what the USGA is trying to prove,'' Daly said
about the second round pin on No. 18. ``It's not golf. If they want
to make this a putt-putt game, then let's go to Disney World and
let's go putt-putt.''
	   The Olympic Club is known as The Graveyard of Champions because
Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson _ who have a combined 24
major titles _ never won another one after finishing second on an
Open here.

World Cup: Del Piero scores three against local amateurs 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero passed the test to
prove he can still score; it was his fitness that worried Italian
coach Cesare Maldini.
	   The 23-year-old forward tallied three goals in Italy's 7-1
victory Saturday against a local amateur team in a warmup mostly
intended to test his form for Tuesday's crucial Group B match
against Austria.
	   Maldini said he got mixed indications from the game at Italy's
training camp.
	   ``Del Piero did well in the first half ... but he conserved his
energies in the second part, also because of the heat,'' he said.
	   After two weeks of frequent rain and cool temperatures,
Saturday's weather saw burning sun and the thermometer rise to 32
degrees Celsius (90 Fahrenheit) during the warmup in which Maldini
fielded mostly reserve players.
	   Maldini's remarks immediately sparked speculation that veteran
striker Roberto Baggio may start against Austria _ as he against
Chile and Cameroon _ with Del Piero replacing him during the match.
	   ``I have an idea (about that) which could become a certainty
within 48 hours. I still have time for deciding the best team,''
Maldini said.
	   Del Piero's form is questionable following a thigh strain which
hampered his preparation for the World Cup.
	   The Juventus forward, recovered from the injury but not yet at
100 percent, played only 25 minutes against Cameroon, which Italy
won 3-0.
	   Maldini said he was looking forward to an extremely tough match
with Austria, since both teams are still in the hunt for the second
round. Italy leads the group with four points, while Chile and
Austria have two each and Cameroon has one.
	   ``It's a decisive match for them, and for us as well. I expect a
victory of Chile against Cameroon,'' Maldini said.
	   The group winner avoids a unenviable clash with Group A winner
Brazil in the second round, a chore left to the runner-up.
	   Maldini said all 22 Italian players will be available against
Austria, including Baggio and Luigi Di Biagio, who were nursing
bruises from the match with Cameroon.
	   ``This is the best news to me,'' Maldini said.
	   Asked about a potential meeting agains France in the
quarterfinals, Maldini said he was only thinking of Austria.
	   ``This has been my long lasting policy, to take it step by step.
I'll make no exception here,'' he said.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Europeans must seek reconciliation with
the Jews for the ``unspeakable suffering'' inflicted on them, Pope
John Paul II said Saturday as he set down a tough agenda for the
old continent.
	   Addressing Austrian officials and diplomats in the former
Imperial Palace, the pope also listed duties and sacrifices
required of Europeans to overcome injustices and economic
disparity.
	   ``Don't forget the history of Europe is closely intertwined with
the history of that people from which the Lord Jesus came,'' John
Paul said. ``The Jewish people have been inflicted with unspeakable
suffering in Europe, and we can't affirm that all the roots of
these injustices have been cut.
	   ``Reconciliation with the Jews is one of the fundamental duties
of Christians in Europe,'' John Paul said.
	   Sitting among the dignitaries was former Austrian President Kurt
Waldheim, who drew the ire of Jewish groups because of his alleged
complicity in war crimes by the German army in World War II and his
efforts to conceal his past as a junior officer in the army.
	   The pope received Waldheim in the Vatican in 1987, and Waldheim
welcomed the pope on his last trip to Austria in 1988, leading to
protests by Jews.
	   John Paul has spoken out often against anti-Semitism and the
horrors of the Holocaust, when an estimated six million Jews
perished at the hands of the Nazis.
	   But Saturday was believed to be the first time he put the burden
specifically on Europeans to make amends.
	   Later, the pope celebrated an open-air Mass at St. Poelten, some
60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Vienna, where the local bishop has
become the center of a storm that epitomizes the divisions rocking
Austria's Roman Catholic church.
	   Some 25,000 people attended the service _ well below
expectations _ including hundreds from the pope's native Poland and
other east European countries.
	   Many of the participants carried tiny flags in the Vatican's
yellow and white colors expressing loyalty to the pope and
Monsignor Kurt Krenn, the conservative bishop of St. Poelten who
has vocally defended Austrian cardinal Hans Hermann Groer. Groer
was forced out by the Vatican following accusations of pedophilia.
	   In his welcome address, Krenn asked the faithful to pray for
Groer.
	   Catholics seeking such major church reforms as abolition of
priestly celibacy and admission of women to the priesthood have
seized on the case as an example of how conservative clergy has
disillusioned Austrian Catholics.
	   The pope praised Krenn for his attempts to fill parish vacancies
with priests, but he ignored the controversy surrounding the
bishop, who greeted the pontiff with genuflexion.
	   Opponents of Krenn handed out leaflets and held up black
balloons as protest symbols.
	   In his morning address, John Paul noted the aspirations of the
former communist countries in Europe as the 15-nation European
Union considers taking them in. The pope insisted that Western
Europe cannot remain an ``island of Western well-being on the
continent.''
	   ``The richer countries, inevitably, will have to make concrete
sacrifices'' to overcome the ``inhuman'' economic differences, the
pope said.
	   John Paul used his international audience to renew his attack on
what he called an expanding ``culture of death'' in the world,
referring to abortion and euthanasia.
	   He said Austria's law allowing abortions in the first three
months of preganancy ``remains a bleeding wound in my heart.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA is asking players to keep their shirts on
while on the pitch.
	   FIFA clarified its position on players' swapping of jerseys
after World Cup matches. The world football federation would like
the exchanges carried out with decorum.
	   ``We've asked, but not demanded, that players change shirts not
on the field of play but in the locker room after the match,'' FIFA
spokesman Keith Cooper said Saturday.
	   Still, FIFA won't punish players for shedding their tops on the
field.
	   ``If they want to do so, we're certainly not going to run onto
the pitch and stop it,'' Cooper said.
	   FIFA has a regulation stating that shirts worn here must carry
an inscription saying ``France 98 FIFA World Cup.''
	   This way the players will have a special souvenir of the the
World Cup, Cooper said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Monaco, which doesn't even field a team, is scoring
big in the World Cup. Well, their first-division club is at least.
	   Players from AS Monaco have scored six goals in the World Cup as
of Friday, the most by players on any club.
	   Half of that total belongs to French forward Thierry Henry,
while teammate _ at AS Monaco as well as the French national team _
David Trezeguet scored one goal in Thursday's game against Saudi
Arabia.
	   Other Monargask players who have scored are John Collins for
Scotland and Victor Ikpeba of Nigeria.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ What do clothes tell about your national team?
Quite a lot if you believe the analysis of a painter and a
semiology specialist.
	   At the request of the French sports daily L'Equipe, the
unidentified specialists in colors and symbols looked at the
uniforms of Japan and Croatia, playing each other Sunday, and the
Netherlands and Mexico, which meet Thursday.
	   The Dutch's traditional orange uniform got the best marks. The
specialists agreed that orange is a good color for confrontation.
	   Mexico's Aztec design in green shades didn't go over as well
with the jury.
	   The Japanese blue jerseys were deemed OK, but it was said to
lack some fighting spirit despite the red flame on the sleeves and
socks.
	   Croatia's white jersey with red-checkered pattern got the lowest
marks from experts, mainly because it didn't seen very distinctive,
L'Equipe said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ George Cohen, a member of England's
1966 World Cup champions, kept his winning medal after an auction
Saturday failed to bring him the expected price.
	   Cohen received a bid of 55,000 pounds (dlrs 92,000), short of an
undisclosed price at which he was willing to let the medal go.
	   It had been expected to bring 80,000 pounds (dlrs 130,000), a
Christie's spokesman said.
	   However, Cohen's World Cup international cap from the same
tournament was sold for 11,500 pounds (dlrs 19,200).
	   ``Mr. Cohen decided to sell the medal to get some security for
his family's future,'' his spokesman David Davies said. ``I have
instructed him about the outcome of the sale but I do not know what
he will do. He will have to take the next couple of days to
decide.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Dozens of rowdy Scottish soccer fans _
branded as troublemakers by French and Spainish police _ returned
home Saturday to jeers at Glasgow's international airport.
	   Acting on a tip, French police stopped a bus at the Spanish
border carrying the Scots as it headed for Bordeaux _ where
Scotland played Norway earlier this week.
	   The Scottish fans were sent back to Salou in northeastern Spain,
where disturbances later broke out. Three Scots were arrested
outside a nightclub.
	   The Scottish fans, wearing sunglasses and scarves to hide their
faces, hurried from the airport in cars and taxis. Several gave
Nazi salutes.
	   There were no problems reported at the airport.
	   The fans returned on a charter plane carrying many vacationing
families back home.
	   Kenneth Miller, 27, a social worker from Glasgow, said the the
Spanish airport was tense as the flight waited to be boarded.
	   ``The atmosphere in the airport was frankly ugly,'' he said.
``These guys were drinking heavily and making a lot of noise and
there were lots of families on holiday there.''

Tension rises in Cyprus as Greece, Turkey up brinkmanship 
</HEADLINE>

By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Brinkmanship over Cyprus by traditional
rivals Greece and Turkey has heightened tension once again on the
divided island and served as a stark reminder of the potential for
war in the eastern Mediterranean.
	   Greek and Turkish military planes visited the island last week
in a show of force many saw as a prelude to the more dangerous
deployment in October of Russian-made S-300 missiles in Cyprus.
	   The decision by the Greek Cypriot government to buy the
anti-aircraft missiles has contributed considerably to a growing
atmosphere of unease.
	   Turkey, which keeps 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus, has
threatened to take military action to prevent their arrival,
arguing their deployment poses a threat to its security.
	   ``In this missile crisis, no one wants to go to war but no one
wants to back down either,'' said Aristos Aristotelous, a Greek
Cypriot military analyst. ``We are in a situation where everyone is
trapped because of public statements on the missiles.''
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded in 1974 after an
abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. The breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey.
	   The role of Greece and Turkey as guardians of the island's
communities is enshrined in Cyprus' constitution, and their
involvement means any conflict has wider repercussions.
	   Both NATO allies, they last fought a war in the 1920s, but have
come dangerously close several times since then, including more
than once over Cyprus.
	   An outbreak of hostilities could split the U.S.-led Western
alliance and further destabilize the already volatile Balkan
region, where Turkish and Greek interests are often at odds.
	   Their rivalry took a dangerous turn on Tuesday when, in an
unprecedented move, four Greek jets and two cargo planes landed at
an air base recently built near the western town of Paphos for use
by Greek forces in the event of a Turkish attack.
	   Turkey, which called the use of the base provocative, responded
by sending six jets to an airstrip in the north. They roared low
over both the Greek and Turkish sectors of the capital, Nicosia _
so low the Turkish crescent could be seen on the plane's wings.
	   ``It is a big problem for NATO,'' said Huseyin Bagci, a
professor of international relations at Ankara's Middle East
Technical University. He said NATO could not accept two member
states behaving in such a way and speaking of war against each
other.
	   A Turkish strike in October is possible, said Aristotelous, the
military analyst, since Turkey's powerful military could suffer a
blow to its prestige if it does nothing.
	   But Western diplomats believe that military action is not the
only option left to Turkey. It also could try to further integrate
northern Cyprus into the Turkish mainland _ a big fear of the Greek
Cypriot government _ or permanently station Turkish jets in the
north, said the diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   This week's test of wills has worried Greek Cypriots, who opened
membership negotiations with the European Union in March.
	   The tension caused share prices in the island's fledgling stock
market to shed about 2 percent on Thursday and Friday. The decline
brought to nearly 10 percent the market's losses since early May, a
drop traders attributed to the political uncertainty.
	   Several Cabinet ministers repeatedly have warned the local media
that persistent coverage of the missile deal was hurting the
economy, particularly tourism, which accounts for 20 percent of the
gross national product and is the single biggest employer.
	   ``We had absolutely no intention of either causing a crisis or
provoking anyone,'' Foreign Minister Yiannakis Cassoulides said
Friday in a bid to defuse the tension.
	   ``There will be no more exercises with the participation of the
Greek air force, at least in the foreseeable future,'' he said.
	   But the Greek Cypriot government remains adamant about going
ahead with the deployment of the dlrs 380 million missiles. It
argues that it would only cancel the deal if tangible progress was
made in efforts to reunite the island or if its longstanding
proposals for demilitarization were accepted.
	   Both the United States and Britain have opposed the missile deal
as unhelpful. Thomas Miller, the U.S. State Department special
coordinator for Cyprus, recently cast doubt on the missiles'
military value.
	   ``Two batteries of missiles are not going to even things up at
all,'' he said in Nicosia. The missiles, he added, would serve as a
lightning rod for a Turkish attack rather than a deterrent.

Netanyahu responds to U.S. criticism of new Jerusalem plan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended a
new Jerusalem development program against U.S. criticism that it
would jeopardize the peace process, Israel radio reported Saturday.
	   The program, which was submitted to Netanyahu Thursday, seeks to
boost investment and keep the Jewish population of Jerusalem at 70
percent. It also proposes to expand the authority of the city
westward to include several Jewish suburbs. The program is expected
to be passed by the Israeli Cabinet Sunday.
	   The Clinton administration has assailed Netanyahu for
considering the plan, and in a phone conversation with Netanyahu
over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
expressed anger that Israel would take such a ``provocative step,''
Israel radio reported.
	   Netanyahu, in response, said the program was not intended as a
political maneuver, but rather was a municipal plan decided upon
for economic reasons, Israel radio reported.
	   Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said on Israel Channel 1 TV that
Israel had every right to strengthen and develop Jerusalem.
	   ``We are talking about development of infrastructure in
Jerusalem... This program is in no way contradictory to any
agreements with the Palestinians,'' said Naveh.
	   The future of Jerusalem is to be negotiated in talks on a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that have not yet
begun, but are to conclude by May 1999.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a capital in east Jerusalem,
but Israel says it will never relinquish sovereignty over all of
the city.

<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ He has been in power for 31 years, until the
last five as a military dictator. Hoping to extend his rule in
Sunday's elections, President Gnassigbe Eyadema's campaign flooded
state-run airwaves.
	   His opposition, split between five candidates, were relegated to
occasional slices of airtime.
	   Few people doubt whether Eyadema will make it past Sunday's
first round of voting in presidential elections in this sliver of a
West African country wedged between Benin and Ghana.
	   But there are questions as to who his opponent will be in the
July 5 second round.
	   Five candidates, including former exiled opposition leader
Gilchrist Olympio, are standing against Eyadema.
	   While Olympio is the best-known contender, he fears for his life
and lives in neighboring Ghana. He is not expected to win the
lion's share of opposition votes.
	   Leopold Gnininvi, a university professor with wide support among
Togo's intellectual class and Yaovi Agboyibo, a lawyer with support
in the country's south, are considered the two candidates with the
best chance to face off against Eyadema in a head-to-head second
round.
	   Martin Aduayom, an official with Gnininvi's party, the
Democratic Convention of African Peoples, criticized election
conditions in a Friday press conference, nevertheless urging
Togolese to participate.
	   ``The voting conditions are bad,'' he said, calling on voters
``to turn out massively.''
	   The campaign has been criticized by foreign observers, though it
is seen as an improvement over the 1993 presidential election,
which was boycotted by the opposition and condemned by observers.
	   ``Sufficient conditions do not yet exist to ensure a transparent
and fair democratic election on June 21,'' the Washington-based
National Democratic Institute said in a statement last week after
looking into the election situation.
	   The group, in a statement released last week, called for such
changes as strict control over voter cards and maintaining a
balance of polling station officials with different political
allegiances. None of their recommendations are believed to have
been followed.
	   The government has defended its preparations.
	   Theoretically, there may not even be a second round. If a
candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote he automatically
becomes president. If no candidate gets 50 percent, then the two
with the most votes pass onto the second round.
	   Eyadema was elected president in Togo's first presidential poll
in 1993, after ruling the country for 26 years as a military
dictator. His government has been accused of widespread human
rights abuses.
	   Olympio, the son of Togo's first president Sylvanus Olympio who
was killed in 1963 by a military junta led by Eyadema, fled to
Ghana last year after several attempts on his life including a 1992
attack that seriously wounded him.
	   Eyadema condemned the assassination bid, but rights groups say
the president's own commando forces were responsible.
	   Campaigning ended Friday.

RETRANSMITTING TO FIX GRAF MARKINGS

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ After eight years of liberal rule
following the 1989 collapse of Communism, Czechs gave opposition
Social Democrats a solid lead in early parliamentary elections
Saturday.
	   The expected victory gives the center-left party led by Milos
Zeman some 75 seats in the 200-seat legislature, far short of a
majority needed to form the Czech Republic's first left-wing
government.
	   Nonetheless, Zeman said he should be asked to try and form the
Cabinet when he and the leaders of three other mainstream parties
meet President Vaclav Havel Monday for the first round of what many
expect to be difficult coalition talks.
	   With nearly three-quarters of the vote counted, the Social
Democratic Party led with 32.4 percent. Final results were expected
by Sunday.
	   Since 1992, Zeman and the Social Democrats have been in
opposition to the center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier
Vaclav Klaus.
	   But a party finance scandal last winter caused Klaus' ruling
coalition to collapse, forcing him to step down and elections to be
held two years ahead of schedule.
	   After falling to an all-time low following the scandal, Klaus's
center-right Civic Democratic Party rebounded, earning 27.6 percent
of the vote, according to the preliminary results released by the
Central Election Committee.
	   Three other parties had also cleared the 5 percent threshold
needed for parliamentary representation, _ the Communists, the
center-right Christian Democrats and center-right Freedom Union,
formed mostly of rebels against Klaus.
	   Klaus expressed satisfaction with his party's showing and said
the main goal would now be to support a solid coalition. ``It must
be the aim of all the non-leftist parties to prevent a center-left
government coalition,'' he told private Prima television.
	   The most likely candidate to join with the Social Democrats is
the small Christian Democratic Party. The Freedom Union _ a new
party favored by Havel _ could also be asked, but so far refuses.
	   Joining with the Communists has been ruled out by all other
parities.
	   Few analysts saw the outcome as one which could end the
political stalemate that has plagued Czech politics since Klaus
narrowly lost 1996 elections, forming a minority, three-party
coalition government that was unable to resolve key outstanding
questions such as privatizing state banks.
	   ``The results of the election is what was expected, i.e. a
stalemate,'' Jiri Pehe, political adviser to Havel, told Nova
private television. ``It will be very difficult to form a
government.''
	   More than 76 percent of the country's 8.09 million Czech voters
cast ballots in the elections Friday and Saturday for the 200
deputies in parliament's lower house.
	   In contrast to an exit poll by the normally reliable Austrian
agency IFES, the preliminary results indicated the extremist
Republican Party had not made it into parliament.
	   Both the exit poll and preliminary results suggested the
populist Pensioners for Secure Living, which headed into the polls
as a strong smaller party, also failed to make the cut.

Iran says one of its senior cleric has been killed in Iraq 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A senior Iranian cleric has been killed in
Iraq, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday,
in the second such killing in two months.
	   Gunmen shot dead Ayatollah Hajj Sheikh Mirza Ali Gharavi Tabrizi
together with his son, son-in-law and chauffeur as they were
driving back to Najaf from Karbala, the agency said.
	   It was not known who was behind the attack, but Iranian
state-run television accused ``agents of the global arrogance,''
the standard term for the United States.

Canadian planes, troops head for Italy to back NATO Kosovo moves 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Canada is sending six CF-18 fighter jets and about
130 troops to Italy to beef up NATO's attempt to curb violence in
Kosovo.
	   Defence Minister Art Eggleton and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy said Saturday that the Canadian deployment could last for
up to three months.
	   ``We are hopeful for a diplomatic solution but we must be
prepared to back up diplomatic efforts,'' Eggleton said in the
statement.
	   NATO increased its pressence in the region last week in an
attempt to push Yugoslavia to stop raids on ethnic Albanians in the
Serbian province.
	   More than 300 people have died in fighting since March, when
Serbian police began a crackdown on the militants they call
``terrorists,'' who are fighting for the independence sought by
most of Kosovo Albanians.
	   Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians have been driven from
their homes.
	   The troops were to leave Bagotville for Aviano, Italy, on
Saturday to prepare for the planes, which are scheduled to depart
next week for the Aviano base.
	   Pending further NATO decisions on demonstration exercises
related to Kosovo, the Canadian planes will be integrated with
those of other NATO countries in the region, the news release said.
	   The CF-18s will also help enforce the no-fly zone over Bosnia.

Netanyahu responds to U.S. criticism of new Jerusalem plan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended a
new Jerusalem development program against U.S. criticism that it
would jeopardize the peace process, Israel radio reported Saturday.
	   The program, submitted to Netanyahu Thursday, seeks to boost
investment and maintain the Jewish population of Jerusalem at 70
percent.
	   It also proposes to expand the authority of the city westward to
include several Jewish suburbs. It is expected to be passed by the
Israeli Cabinet Sunday.
	   The Clinton administration has assailed Netanyahu for
considering the plan, and in a phone conversation with Netanyahu
over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
expressed anger that Israel would take such a ``provocative step,''
Israel radio reported.
	   Netanyahu, in response, said the program was not intended as a
political maneuver, but was designed to address economic needs,
Israel radio reported.
	   Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said on Israel Television that
Israel had every right to strengthen and develop Jerusalem.
	   ``We are talking about development of infrastructure in
Jerusalem... This program is in no way contradictory to any
agreements with the Palestinians,'' said Naveh.
	   The future of Jerusalem is to be negotiated in talks on a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that have not yet
begun, but are to conclude by May 1999.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a capital in east Jerusalem,
but Israel says it will never relinquish sovereignty over all of
the city.

Jamaica Bar Association says no to Caribbean Supreme Court 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The Jamaica Bar Association urged the
Jamaican government not to abolish appeals to the British Privy
Council, currently the island's final court of appeals, and replace
it with a regional court.
	   Jamaica and other countries in the region are considering the
establishment of a Caribbean Supreme Court. Attorneys general in
countries such as Jamaica, Trinidad and Guyana say they are being
pressed by European countries to eliminate executions.
	   Some countries have withdrawn from treaties allowing appeals by
convicts to international groups such as the United Nations and the
Organization of American States.
	   The Bar Association said that Jamaica should not join a regional
court unless it met several conditions:
	   -- The court should not require unanmous decisions, ``a rule
that results in unhealthy political compromises.''
	   -- Countries should not be able to withdraw from the regional
court merely by giving notice.
	   -- Judges should be paid independently to ensure their job
security and independence.
	   -- Legal aid should be provided and lawyers should be allowed to
move and work freely among the countries participating in the
court.
	   Caribbean officials say a regional court is needed because
appeals to international organizations or to the Privy Council drag
out too long and the processes are abused by convicts to delay
executions.

World Cup: Mexico comes back for 2-2 draw against Belgium 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: wrapup optional; ADDS more quotes
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ The red card helped give Belgium the
lead. Another red card took it away.
	   Up 2-0 and with a man advantage, Belgium seemed on the way to
its first victory of France '98 until substitute Gert Verheyen
brought down Mexico's Ramon Ramirez in the penalty area in the 55th
minute.
	   Verheyen was expelled, and Alberto Garcia Aspe converted the
spot kick to start a comeback that gave the Mexicans a 2-2 draw
Saturday.
	   ``If we lead 2-0, we should never give that away,'' midfielder
Franky Van der Elst said.
	   With a double-goal performance from Marc Wilmots, Belgium choked
Mexico's skills with sheer brawn for the better part of the match,
especially after defender Pavel Pardo was given the red card for a
tackle from behind in the 29th minute.
	   But Mexico's talent persevered, with Ramirez and Cuauhtemoc
Blanco teaming to produce both goals, and substitute Jesus Arellano
nearly sealing an incredible comeback victory when ran through the
exhausted Belgian defense with one minute to play. Only goalkeeper
Filip De Wilde's daring save on both Arellano's shot and Ramirez'
attempt off the rebound kept it a draw.
	   ``We just didn't give up hope,'' Ramirez said. ``We showed that
we know how to come back.''
	   ``We would have loved that third goal,'' added Mexican coach
Manuel Lapuente. ``But it already was a good comeback.''
	   Belgium went ahead in the 43rd minute when the Mexican defense
failed to react to a corner, letting the ball from Luis Oliveira
fly over and allowing an onrushing Wilmots to body slam it between
the legs of Jorge Campos.
	   Three minutes into the second half, Wilmots added a second,
lumbering through the Mexican defense in his trademark style,
breaking two tackles and falling over as he unleashed a
right-footed shot past Campos.
	   ``Especially on the second goal, I showed I could do it all on
willpower,'' Wilmots said.
	   It seemed to seal the fate of Mexico, which had been playing
with 10 men since Pardo slid in late on a tackle from behind and
clipped Vital Borkelmans' ankle.
	   Yet Mexico gained a glimmer of hope when Ramirez took a pass
from Blanco in the penalty area and was brought down by Verheyen.
Scottish referee Hugh Dallas showed the red card, the seventh in
six World Cup games since new FIFA president Sepp Blatter
complained that referees weren't being strict enough.
	   Eight minutes later, Mexico completed its recovery when the same
duo combined on a fast break. Ramirez broke free on the left and
crossed into the penalty area, where Blanco literally came flying
in to stab the ball home with a left-footed volley.
	   The game was played in a stifling heat that peaked at 37 degrees
Celsius (97F), with a rare, fresh breeze off the Gironde river
bringing only mild relief to the players on the sun-baked Parc
Lescure.
	   ``I've never suffered like this in my life,'' Wilmots said. ``I
think I've lost 5 kilos.''
	   ``We were running on empty for the last quarter hour,'' Leekens
said.
	   Early on, Mexico had the better chances, with Joel Sanchez and
Jaime Oriales both hitting the bar in the opening 20 minutes.
Sanchez' effort bounced just in front of the line, and Luis
Hernandez' follow-up header was cleared away by defender Danny
Boffin.
	   Pardo's red card turned the tide.
	   ``It felt like we should have won,'' midfielder Alberto Garcia
Aspe said. ``But the expulsion changed it all,''
	   But second red card had Belgian coach Georges Leekens feeling
the same way.
	   ``After being 2-0 and one man up ... I cannot be happy with this
result,'' Leekens said.

Iran says one of its senior cleric has been killed in Iraq ADDS killing date, details, Iraqi dissident quote; no pickup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A senior Iranian cleric has been killed in
Iraq, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday,
in the second such killing in two months.
	   Gunmen shot dead Ayatollah Hajj Sheikh Mirza Ali Gharavi Tabrizi
together with his son, son-in-law and chauffeur as they were
driving back to Najaf from Karbala on Thursday, the agency said.
	   It was not known who was behind the attack, but Iranian
state-run television accused ``agents of the global arrogance,''
the standard term for the United States.
	   In Damascus, Jawad al-Maliki, a spokesman for the Iraqi
opposition group, Islamic Dawa Party, blamed the killing on the
Baghdad government, saying it resented Shiite Muslim clerics for
their refusal to issue statements supporting President Saddam
Hussein.
	   ``All the indications point to a liquidation operation, and this
is a dangerous phenomenon that will hit many other scholars in
Iraq,'' al-Maliki said.
	   Iraqi officials could not be reached for comment late Saturday.
	   The ayatollah was returning to Najaf, where he lived, after
performing a pilgrimage at the shrine of Imam Hussein, the grandson
of Islam's Prophet Mohammed, the agency said.
	   On April 21, another Iranian cleric based in Najaf, Ayatollah
Murtadha Ali Mohammed Ibrahim Borujerdi, was shot dead in the city,
which is 180 kilometers (112 miles) south of Baghdad.
	   Both Gharavi Tabrizi and Borujerdi worked as prayer leaders at
Najaf's Imam Ali Mosque. Hundreds of Iranian clerics study and
teach in the holy Shiite cities of Najaf and Karbala in Iraq.
	   The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned Iraq's charge d'affaires
in Tehran and protested Borujerdi's killing.
	   Two Iraqi opposition groups accused the Baghdad government of
assassinating Borujerdi for refusing to obey its orders to stop
preaching.
	   Several Shiite clergymen have been killed in mysterious ways in
Iraq in recent years. The government has blamed the murders on
foreign countries.

World Cup: Spanish coach says he's no plans to resign news; CHANGES byline 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: PRECEDE Madrid; UPDATES with Clemente reaction; ADDS team
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ Despite team morale being in shreds and
the squad on the verge of first-round elimination, Spanish coach
Javier Clemente assured all Saturday he had no thoughts of
resigning.
	   ``If you had to step down just for not getting certain results
then this World Cup would see at least 10 resigning,'' Clemente
told reporters a day after Spain struggled to a 0-0 draw against
Paraguay.
	   ``But then one thing is resigning and another is that they
remove you,'' said Clemente in response to the storm of criticism
that Spain's performances have solicited back home.
	   ``Let Us Pray'' read the headline in Spain's El Mundo Deportivo
sports paper while its competitor asked: ``What have we done to
deserve this?''
	   Friday's result, on top of the 3-2 come-from-behind victory by
Nigeria in its opening game, left Spain with one point and totally
dependent on the final Group D games Wednesday when the Spanish
play Bulgaria and Paraguay faces Nigeria.
	   Spain, among Europe's perennial powers, is one of the great
enigmas of international soccer and has traditionally disappointed
in the World Cup, having never advanced past the quarterfinals.
This year seems no different.
	   ``Spain fails again'' read the banner front-page headline in El
Pais, which suggested this could ``be the end of an epoch,'' a
clear reference to Clemente's future.
	   ``We're still not dead,'' Clemente argued. ``It doesn't just
depend on us, but given that we still have a chance, we will fight
to the bitter end.''
	   Back at the team's training headquarters just north of Paris on
Saturday, Clemente held a 30-minute chat with those who played
against Paraguay while the rest of the squad trained lightly. The
team was then given a 24-hour break and will resume preparations
Sunday evening.
	   The loss to Nigeria and draw with Paraguay surprised many
considering that since Clemente took over the team in 1992, Spain
has only lost five times in 60 games.
	   Although a known underachiever, Spain nonetheless came to France
among the favorites and was picked by many to at least reach the
quarterfinals.
	   The 48-year-old coach admitted that the players' spirits had
plummeted but was adamant that press condemnation would not erase
their ambition to continue fighting.
	   He reiterated his now standard response that Spain's dismal
situation stemmed purely from misfortune and rejected suggestions
that the team was totally lacking in strategy and coordination, and
that many of its players were exhausted from domestic league play.

Conservative lawmaker joins Labor Party 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A lawmaker ejected from the main opposition
Conservative Party last year for disagreeing with the party's
European policy said Saturday he had joined the governing Labor
Party.
	   Peter Temple Morris, 60, said he will support Tony Blair's
government in the House of Commons because the Conservatives, who
governed for 18 years until a heavy defeat in national elections in
May last year, had ``changed for the worse in the past few years.''
	   On November 19, Conservative leader William Hague said that
Temple-Morris was being expelled from the party caucus because of
his reluctance to support the Conservative policy on the European
single currency. The Conservatives have pledged not to join the
currency for at least a decade.
	   Europe's planned single currency, and even Britain's membership
of the European Union, have been divisive issues for the
Conservatives, who trail Labor badly in opinion polls.

Hamas offshoot refuses Arafat's offer to join Cabinet 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An offshoot of the radical Islamic
group Hamas announced Saturday it would refuse Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's invitation to join the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   Ahmed Bahar, a leader of the Islamic Salvation Party, said that
following consultations, the party had decided not to join the
Cabinet. An official message was to be sent to the Palestinian
leader later Saturday.
	   In the past weeks, Arafat has been meeting with representatives
of all the Palestinian political factions _ including those who
oppose the peace process _ in an attempt to bring them into his
Cabinet.
	   Hamas, which bitterly opposes the Oslo peace accords and has
killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombing attacks, has never
sought any official position in Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
They have yet to respond to Arafat's invitation.
	   The Islamic Salvation Party, made up mainly of former Hamas
leaders, split from the militant Islamic group after the advent of
the Palestinian Authority in 1994.
	   Last month, the 88-member legislature gave Arafat an ultimatum
to respond to complaints about widespread corruption and inaction
and to reshuffle his Cabinet or face his first no-confidence
motion. He has till the end of the week to present his new
government.
	   Arafat was expected to present a list of new Cabinet members to
the PLO Executive Committee Friday night, but instead he asked for
more time.
	   ``The President has not announced anything yet because his
consultations continue. No announcements are expected before the
end of the week,'' said Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh.
	   Of the 24 Cabinet slots, seven need to be filled. Two ministers
passed away this year, four resigned, and the appointment of one
current minister was never approved by the legislature.

Turkish man stabbed in Armenia-related clashes in Paris 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A Turkish man was stabbed and 17 others slightly
injured Saturday when a group wielding iron bars attacked a rally
protesting moves by France to recognize the 1915 genocide of
Armenians in Turkey, police said.
	   A group of between 60 and 80 people charged a crowd of about 50
Turks who had gathered to stage the rally at a square in central
Paris.
	   It was not immediately clear who launched the attack, but police
said they suspected it was the work of Turkish opposition groups.
	   About 35 people were questioned by police, among them,
apparently, witnesses and suspects.
	   The man who was stabbed was hospitalized in serious condition,
police said.
	   Later Saturday, about 1,500 people joined the rally, which
proceeded without further incident.
	   In May, French lawmakers voted unanimously to formally recognize
the 1915 killings of ethnic Armenians in Turkey as a genocide _ a
move that drew sharp protests from Turkey.
	   The motion now goes from the National Assembly to the Senate. If
it passes there, France would become the first major European
country to use the term ``genocide'' to describe the deaths of an
estimated 1.5 million Armenians in Ottoman Turkey between 1915 and
1923.
	   Genocide is the systematic annihilation of a racial, political
or cultural group. Turkey denies that the deaths constituted
genocide, insisting instead that they were the result of a civil
war.

Four Serbian policemen held by militants, fighting goes on Kosovo Albanians. Trims. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with clashes and harassment reported by
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three Serbian policemen were killed
in new fighting Saturday and four policemen are being held by
militants of Kosovo Albanians' separatist army, Serbian and
Albanian sources said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanians'
political leaders, said the three policemen were killed in fighting
in the Decani area of western Kosovo bordering Albania.
	   Serbian forces launched an offensive there three weeks ago that
apparently aimed to clear out Albanian villages they believe harbor
militants of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Tens of thousands of
Albanians have fled their homes.
	   The Information Center also reported tightened police controls
around the southwestern city of Djakovica, also close to Albania,
and in areas near the border with Macedonia.
	   Its reports could not be independently verified. There was no
immediate word from Serbian authorities of policemen being killed
or of clashes on Saturday.
	   More than 300 people have been killed since March, when Serbian
police launched a crackdown on the militants they call
``terrorists,'' who are fighting for the independence most Kosovo
Albanians want.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1 in the province
treasured by Serbs as the birthplace of their Orthodox Church.
	   Earlier Saturday, police Col. Bozidar Filic confirmed to
reporters that four policemen had been kidnapped by the KLA in
three separate incidents in the past three weeks in western Kosovo.
He gave no details.
	   Col. Bozidar Filic had no comment on whether Serbian police and
soldiers _ estimated at a total 45,000 to 50,000 men _ would
withdraw from the secessionist Serbian province, as demanded by the
West and the Kosovo Albanians.
	   He admitted that certain roads are controlled by the KLA, but
declined to comment on its claims of controlling 40 percent of
Kosovo.
	   Asked about reports that Serbian forces are high in the
mountains on the border with Albania, sealing it and shooting
indiscriminately at refugees trying to flee, Filic told The
Associated Press he did not speak for the army, but ``there have
been no murders or killings of ordinary civilian population.''
	   ``But of course, we act according to the law when it comes to
terrorists,'' he added.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova reiterated to
the German news magazine Der Spiegel his own appeal for NATO air
strikes ``for the protection of our population.''
	   Rugova said Kosovo could not remain within Yugoslavia, even as a
third republic alongside Serbia and Montenegro. But he said a
protectorate could be an interim solution.
	   ``We have now the historic chance to liberate ourselves, and
that must be seized upon,'' he said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One Russian and five Tajik border guards were
killed Saturday in a clash on the border of Afghanistan and
Tajikistan, apparently over drugs, a Russian news agency reported.
	   ITAR-Tass, citing an unidentified military source, said the
clash occurred after border guards had seized more than 140
kilograms (300 pounds) of unspecified narcotics from drug dealers
over the previous few days.
	   About 25,000 Russian troops are deployed alongside Tajik troops
in an effort to stem the flow of drugs and weapons from neighboring
Afghanistan and bolster the Tajik government.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A distraught Russian mother splashed sulfuric acid
into the faces of two men being sentenced Saturday for the rape and
murder of her daughter and niece, a news agency reported.
	   The incident occurred in the central Russian city of Yaroslavl
as the men were being led into a courtroom to face sentencing for
the deaths of the girls, aged 14 and 18, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The men apparently weren't seriously injured by the acid. After
first aid was administered, the judge went ahead with sentencing.
Dmitry Morozov was sentenced to death, and Sergei Golovanov to 15
years of prison and labor camp.
	   The woman was arrested on assault charges.

World Cup: Cocu, Overmars give Dutch 2-0 halftime lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Phillip Cocu and Mark Overmars fired
the Netherlands into a 2-0 halftime lead over South Korea Saturday
to put the Dutch closer to the second round of the World Cup and
the Koreans on the brink of elimination.
	   After the Dutch had created plenty of chances, Cocu shot home in
the 37th minute with a 20-meter shot and Overmars ended a slick
breakaway from their own half with the second four minutes later.
	   South Koreans, who lost 3-1 to Mexico in their first Group E
game, almost went ahead in the ninth when Kim Do-hoon collected a
back-heeled pass from Choi Yong-soo to race clear of the Dutch
defense. The Korean hit his shot with plenty of power but he fired
wide of the near post with 'keeper Edwin van der Sar at full
stretch.
	   Dennis Bergkamp, starting a game for the first time since
mid-April, set up a chance for the Dutch with a dazzling run past
two Korean defenders on the right in the 16th minute. The Arsenal
star pulled the ball back to Wim Jonk, whose first time shot was
brilliantly palmed away by 'keeper Kim.
	   Korea's Choi Yong-soo was shown the yellow card for taking too
long to take a 40-meter free kick in the 27th minute and the
long-range shot slid harmlessly wide.
	   The Dutch went ahead after a spell of pressure.
	   Bergkamp slipped a short pass to Cocu just outside the Korean
area and looked for the return pass. With the defense watching
Bergkamp's run, Cocu moved into space on the edge of the box and
fired a low, left-footed shot past Kim from 20 meters.
	   Five minutes later it was 2-0 when the Dutch broke out of their
own area to add the second.
	   Bergkamp ran from deep and lost possession only for Wim Jonk to
win the ball back. The Dutch had a three vs. two advantage as they
broke over the halfway line and Jonk fed Overmars on the left.
	   The Arsenal winger beat defender Choi Sung-jong and fired a low,
right footed shot home from 15 meters.
	   Lineups:
	   Netherlands _ Edwin van der Sar; Aron Winter, Jaap Stam, Frank
de Boer, Arthur Numan; Ronald de Boer, Wim Jonk, Edgar Davids, Marc
Overmars; Phillip Cocu, Dennis Bergkamp.
	   South Korea _ Kim Byung-ji; Lee Min-sung, Hong Myung-bo, Choi
Young-il; Choi Sung-yong, Lee Sang-yoon, Kim Do-keun, Yoo
Sang-chul; Choi Yong-soo, Kim Do-hoon, Seo Jung-won.
	   Referee _ Ryszard Wojcik, Poland.

World Cup: Iranians focused for U.S. match With Sports-Soccer-US-Iran 
</HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Coach Jalal Talebi, speaking after a final
practice Saturday, said Iran was primed and ready for its World Cup
encounter with the United States.
	   ``It's like the night before a big exam,'' Talebi said. ``Of
course you're nervous. But once the whistle blows and the game
starts, everything becomes normal.''
	   Hired to coach Iran only a month ago, Talebi expressed
confidence that the team would give a good account of itself in the
highly anticipated match with the United States _ a meeting with
strong political overtones because of hostilities between the two
governments.
	   ``The team's morale is high, and the closer we get to the game
we feel more ready. There was and is a lot of pressure on the
players, but hope that they will be fine by the time the game
starts,'' Talebi said after the evening workout.
	   ``We are playing tomorrow to win to qualify for the second
round. We know how to play the Germans,'' he said, referring to
Iran's last first-round opponent Thursday.
	   Midfielder Ali Reza Mansourian was optimistic about Iran's
chances of defeating the United States.
	   ``It's like any other game for us. We hope that, God willing, we
will beat the United States and get our three points.''
	   Talebi was asked whether the expects the U.S. team to start with
its strongest attackers.
	   ``The Americans want to win just like we do. Of course they will
focus on their attack. We will do the same. It's nothing strange or
unusual.''
	   As to whether he expects the Americans to attack from the
opening whistle, Talebi said, ``I hope so, because that's what we
will do. We hope we will have a good match, regardless of the
result.
	   Talebi, once Iran's best soccer player, has been a U.S. resident
since the early 1980s. His wife and two sons live in Mountainview,
California.
	   Asked the status of captain and goalkeeper Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh
and midfielder Reza Shahroudi, who stayed out of last match with
leg injuries, Talebi said:
	   ``Abedzadeh has more than the doctor's permission to play. I
hope he will be able to play this game. We will decide tomorrow
around 4 or 5:30 p.m.
	   ``I hope that if Shahroudi doesn't play this game, he will be
able to play the next one.''

Eds: ADDS government pledges no reversal, warns against more
By AHMED AL-HAJ
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Hundreds of riot police and soldiers fired
into the air Saturday in clashes with thousands of Yemenis
protesting a 40 percent hike in fuel prices.
	   The demonstrators took to the streets for the second day,
throwing rocks at police cars, smashing billboards and shouting
chants against the government, a security official said.
	   Most shops remained closed in the capital San`a. Protesters
burned tires in the city's main streets and used rocks to close
vital roads, the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Baton-wielding police chased demonstrators in streets and fired
tear gas, but there were no reports of casualties.
	   The protesters chanted against Prime Minister Abdul-Karim
al-Iryani, who came to power last month.
	   ``Iryani you fool, you raised the price of fuel,'' shouted a
crowd gathered in front of the parliament building.
	   The demonstrators called on the government to reverse its
decision, announced Thursday and implemented Friday, to raise the
prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas by about 40 percent.
	   But late Saturday the government issued a statement after a
Cabinet meeting saying it would continue with its reform program,
meaning there would no reversal on the price rises.
	   The reform measures will save 22 billion riyals (dlrs 168
million) a year from state funds, which will be used to develop
drinking water supplies, roads, schools and electricity, the
statement said.
	   The Interior Ministry warned late Saturday that it would not
allow further demonstrations.
	   But a meeting of opposition parties in the capital, among them
the Socialist Party, issued a statement urging people to continue a
``peaceful struggle'' against what they called ``the government
policy of impoverishment.''
	   The hikes were in line with requirements of the International
Monetary Fund to remove subsidies on petroleum products and other
commodities like flour and sugar by the end of 1998.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.
	   To help Yemen recover from the effects of the 1994 civil war,
the World Bank has approved a dlrs 80 million credit to support its
economic reform program.

RETRANSMITS TO FIX CODING
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A lawmaker ejected from the main opposition
Conservative Party last year for disagreeing with the party's
European policy said Saturday he had joined the governing Labor
Party.
	   Peter Temple Morris, 60, said he will support Tony Blair's
government in the House of Commons because the Conservatives, who
governed for 18 years until a heavy defeat in national elections in
May last year, had ``changed for the worse in the past few years.''
	   On November 19, Conservative leader William Hague said that
Temple-Morris was being expelled from the party caucus because of
his reluctance to support the Conservative policy on the European
single currency. The Conservatives have pledged not to join the
currency for at least a decade.
	   Europe's planned single currency, and even Britain's membership
of the European Union, have been divisive issues for the
Conservatives, who trail Labor badly in opinion polls.

President says protests will not force her to step down 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Scattered groups of protesters pelted
police with stones in a third day of clashes in this capital city
Saturday while President Janet Jagan vowed not to step down because
of the violence.
	   The clashes began Thursday when talks broke down between Jagan's
People's Progressive Party and the opposition People's National
Congress, which claimed that Jagan's victory in the December
general election was marred by voter fraud.
	   Two independent audits by international organizations have found
the election was fair, and Jagan said her opponents are trying to
use violence to unseat her after failing to beat her in a fair
election.
	   ``I have a mandate from 53.3 percent of the voters in Guyana to
govern,'' Jagan said Saturday in her regular radio and television
address to the nation.
	   ``The street activity will not unseat me. I do not demand that
they like me, but they will have to respect law and order,'' said
Jagan, the U.S.-born widow of popular former president Cheddi
Jagan.
	   Businesses in the city center have been closed since the
disturbances started, most of them with protective metal plates
covering their doors and windows. Some owners said they were
beginning to suffer from the lack of business.
	   On Friday, the People's National Congress, which had not
officially been involved in the sporadic disturbances, said it
would begin organizing protests.
	   The dispute has racial, as well as political overtones, because
PNC supporters are mostly of African descent while most of the
Progressive Party's members are East Indian. The population in this
former British colony in South America is almost equally divided
between the two ethnic groups.
	   Government officials said Saturday that 12 people were arrested
for participating in Friday's disturbances. A baby was injured when
police used tear gas to disperse protesters and the policeman
blamed for the incident was beaten by the crowd, police said.
	   Police said more arrests were made Saturday but could not
immediately provide an exact number.

Police fire in air as protests in Yemen continue against more protests, opposition urges further protest.

Eds: UPDATES throughout with government pledging no reversal, warns
By AHMED AL-HAJ
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Hundreds of riot police and soldiers fired
into the air Saturday in clashes with thousands of Yemenis
protesting a 40 percent hike in fuel prices.
	   The demonstrators took to the streets for the second day,
throwing rocks at police cars, smashing billboards and shouting
chants against the government, a security official said.
	   Most shops remained closed in the capital, San`a. Protesters
burned tires in the city's main streets and used rocks to close
vital roads, the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Baton-wielding police chased demonstrators and fired tear gas,
but no casualties were reported.
	   The protesters chanted against Prime Minister Abdul-Karim
al-Iryani, who came to power last month.
	   ``Iryani you fool, you raised the price of fuel,'' shouted a
crowd gathered in front of the parliament building.
	   The demonstrators called on the government to reverse its
decision, announced Thursday and implemented Friday, to raise the
prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas by about 40 percent.
	   The government issued a statement after a Cabinet meeting late
Saturday saying it would continue with its reform program,
indicating the price rises would not be reversed.
	   The reform measures will save 22 billion riyals (dlrs 168
million) a year from state funds, which will be used to develop
drinking water supplies, roads, schools and electricity, according
to the statement.
	   The Interior Ministry warned late Saturday that it would not
allow further demonstrations.
	   But a meeting of opposition parties in the capital, among them
the Socialist Party, issued a statement urging people to continue a
``peaceful struggle'' against what they called ``the government
policy of impoverishment.''
	   The hikes were in line with requirements of the International
Monetary Fund to remove subsidies on petroleum products and other
commodities like flour and sugar by the end of 1998.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.
	   To help Yemen recover from the effects of the 1994 civil war,
the World Bank has approved a dlrs 80 million credit to support its
economic reform program.

Hamas offshoot refuses Arafat's offer to join Cabinet 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An offshoot of the radical Islamic
group Hamas announced Saturday it would refuse Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's invitation to join the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   Ahmed Bahar, a leader of the Islamic Salvation Party, said that
the party had decided not to join the Cabinet. An official message
was to be sent to the Palestinian leader later Saturday.
	   In the past weeks, Arafat has been meeting with representatives
of all the Palestinian political factions _ including those who
oppose the peace process _ in an attempt to bring them into his
Cabinet.
	   Last month, the 88-member legislature gave Arafat an ultimatum
to respond to complaints about widespread corruption and inaction
and to reshuffle his Cabinet or face his first no-confidence
motion. He has until the end of the week to present his new
government.
	   Arafat was expected to present a list of new Cabinet members to
the PLO Executive Committee Friday night, but instead he asked for
more time.
	   Hamas, which bitterly opposes the Oslo peace accords and has
killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombing attacks, has never
sought any official position in Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
They have yet to respond to Arafat's invitation.
	   The Islamic Salvation Party, made up mainly of former Hamas
leaders, split from the militant Islamic group after the advent of
the Palestinian Authority in 1994.
	   Of the 24 Cabinet slots, seven need to be filled. Two ministers
died this year, four resigned, and the appointment of one current
minister was never approved.

World Cup: Dutch win 5-0 to eliminate Koreans 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ The Netherlands powered to the top of
its World Cup group with a one-sided 5-0 beating of South Korean
Saturday to put the Koreans out of the championship.
	   Phillip Cocu and Mark Overmars fired the Netherlands into a 2-0
halftime lead before Dennis Bergkamp, Pierre van Hooydonk and
Ronald de Boer added three more in the last 18 minutes as Guus
Hiddink's team posted the biggest score of this World Cup.
	   Now the Dutch need only a tie with Mexico on Thursday to gain a
place in the last 16 while the Koreans, who co-host the 2002 World
Cup with Japan, became the second team to go out along with Saudi
Arabia. They still haven't won a game in five appearances.
	   Bergkamp, starting a game for the first time since mid-April,
set up a chance for the Dutch with a dazzling run past two Korean
defenders on the right in the 16th minute. The Arsenal star pulled
the ball back to Wim Jonk, whose first time shot was brilliantly
palmed away by 'keeper Kim.
	   Bergkamp was creating plenty of danger and lobbed a shot just
too high in the 22nd minute after exchanging passes with Cocu. With
the Dutch in command, Edgar Davids then had a 25-meter shot tipped
over the top by Kim.
	   Korea's Choi Yong-soo was shown the yellow card for taking too
long to take a 40-meter free kick in the 27th minute and the
long-range shot slid harmlessly wide.
	   Davids rescued the Dutch defense when Seo Jung-wan neatly turned
Aron Winter on the halfway line and raced for goal. The Juventus
midfielder dashed back to tackle the Korean forward before he could
shoot.
	   A minute later the Dutch went ahead.
	   Bergkamp slipped a short pass to Cocu just outside the Korean
area and looked for the return pass. With the defense watching
Bergkamp's run, Cocu moved into space on the edge of the box and
fired a low, left-footed shot past Kim from 20 meters.
	   Five minutes later it was 2-0 when the Dutch broke out of their
own area to add the second.
	   Bergkamp ran from deep and lost possession only for Wim Jonk to
win the ball back. The Dutch had a three vs. two advantage as they
broke over the halfway line and Jonk fed Overmars on the left.
	   The Arsenal winger beat defender Choi Sung-jong and fired a low,
right footed shot home from 15 meters.
	   Bergkamp should have added a third six minutes into the second
half when a smart Dutch move left him with only the Korean 'keeper
to beat. Kim raced almost to the edge of his area to block his
first shot and the Dutch forward lobbed his second over the top
with the 'keeper still well off his line.
	   Kim made another good save three minutes later to keep out an
18-meter shot from Davids after the Dutch again carved open the
Korean defense.
	   But the Koreans almost pulled a goal back in the 59th minute
when Choi Yong-soo wrestled his way past Frank de Boer but his
close range prod was blocked by 'keeper Edwin Van der Sar.
	   The Dutch needed a third goal to go top of the group and fired
shot after shot at the Korean goal.
	   Cocu and Ronald de Boer both shot wide and Bergkamp drove the
ball straight at the 'keeper before the goal finally came with 18
minutes remaining.
	   After Seo had shots wide for the Koreans, Winter pushed a pass
through to Bergkamp just outside the area. He shrugged off a
challenge from Lee Min-sung and turned past Kim Tae-young before
shooting past the 'keeper with the outside of his right foot.
	   Bergkamp went off in the 78th minute and Van Hooydonk netted the
fourth within 60 seconds of replacing him. Overmars crossed from
the left and the tall striker was unchallenged as he ran in to head
home from close range.
	   The fifth arrived in the 83rd minute when Jonk ended a five-man
move with a pass to Ronald de Boer, who side-stepped a defender
before firing home from 16 meters.
	   Lineups:
	   Netherlands _ Edwin van der Sar; Aron Winter, Jaap Stam, Frank
de Boer, Arthur Numan (Winston Bogarde, 80th), Ronald de Boer
(Boudewijn Zenden, 84th) Wim Jonk, Edgar Davids, Marc Overmars;

Suspected Scottish hooligans fly back to Glasgow 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Shouting insults and covering their
faces from the media, a group of suspected Scottish soccer
hooligans returned to Glasgow on Saturday after they were turned
back from France by police before Scotland's World Cup game earlier
this week.
	   French police Tuesday stopped a coach-load of about 50
supporters heading for Bordeaux, where Scotland played Norway, when
the fans tried to cross into France from Spain. The fans were sent
back to Salou in northeast Spain, where Spanish police arrested
three Scots Friday after a night of disturbances involving rowdy
supporters.
	   A crowd of people meeting other passengers jeered and shouted at
the hooligans as they walked through the airport's arrival hall.
	   ``Idiots, '' one woman shouted. Another shouted: ``You are a
disgrace.''
	   In reply several fans gave neo-Nazi salutes. Others swore at
waiting journalists and at families who voiced their disapproval,
and made crude hand gestures.
	   One supporter said that they had been badly treated by French
and Spanish police. ``We have been persecuted by police in France
and Spain. They stopped us watching the game, then they held us in
the airport for 14 hours,'' said one, who refused to give his name.
	   A passenger on the flight said that the atmosphere at Reus
airport had been tense before the return flight, with Spanish
police at one point drawing riot batons.
	   ``The atmosphere in the airport was frankly ugly. These guys
were drinking heavily and making a lot of noise, and there were
lots of families on holiday there,'' said Kenneth Miller, 27, a
social worker from Glasgow. ``The Spanish police at one point had
to draw their batons and I thought there was going to be a bit of
trouble.''
	   France had asked police in neighboring Spain to keep a special
eye on British soccer fans vacationing along the Spanish coast but
crossing the border to watch their teams play in the World Cup.
	   Police kept up highly visible presence at Glasgow airport for
the group's arrival, but made no arrests.

Saudis fire Parreira, Croatia beats Japan, Belgium-Mexico tie 2-2, Dutch crush Koreans 5-0 AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Dutch beating and eliminating Koreans
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Four years after leading Brazil to a record fourth
World Cup title, Carlos Alberto Parreira was fired by Saudi Arabia
on Saturday.
	   The Brazilian coach was shown the door two days after the Saudis
became the first of the 32 teams to be eliminated from the World
Cup, beaten 4-0 by host France following a 1-0 defeat by Denmark.
	   ``As of now we are no longer with the Saudi team,'' Parreira
told reporters at the team hotel outside Paris.
	   ``I don't feel happy and I don't feel comfortable with the
decision taken by the Saudi officials. At least they should have
let us continue until the end of the World Cup.''
	   His firing came on the day Croatia virtually assured itself of a
place in the second round at its first attempt, the Netherlands
eliminated South Korea with the biggest score of the championship,
5-0, and both Mexico and Belgium stayed in contention with a 2-2
tie.
	   Real Madrid striker Davor Suker fired the only goal in Croatia's
1-0 Group H victory over Japan in the 77th minute. Japan, another
World Cup first timer, will drop out Sunday if two-time titlist
Argentina avoids defeat to the third debutant in the group,
Jamaica, at Parc des Princes.
	   The result at Nantes was Croatia's second victory and Japan's
second loss. The Croatians began their first World Cup campaign
with a 3-1 victory over the Jamaicans and Japan lost 1-0 to
Argentina.
	   The Dutch swept to the top of Group E with a one-sided victory
over the Koreans with five players, Phillip Cocu, Mark Overmars,
Dennis Bergkamp, Pierre van Hooydonk and Ronald de Boer all getting
on the scoresheet.
	   The Dutch only need a tie with Mexico on Thursday to clinch a
place in the last 16 while Saturday's thrashing put the Koreans out
and the four Asian teams now have a 0-7 record at this World Cup.
	   After Mexico's Pavel Pardo had been expelled by Scottish referee
Hugh Dallas, Belgium's Marc Wilmote fired his team into a 2-0 lead
at Bordeaux. After Belgium's Gert Verheyen was sent off for
tripping Jesus Ramirez, Mexican captain Alberto Garcia Aspe fired
home a penalty and then Cuauhtemoc Blanco brilliantly volleyed the
equalizer.
	   While it was all going well for Croatia and its coach Miroslav
Blazevic, the World Cup was ending for Parreira, who is the eighth
coach to be sacked by the Saudis in less than four years.
	   He had signed a one-year contract with the Saudi federation in
December, abandoning his two-year deal with the New York-New Jersey
MetroStars of the United States' Major League Soccer after one
season, for a reported dlrs 3 million and his second spell with the
team.
	   Parreira led Kuwait in 1982 and the United Arab Emirates in 1990
to the World Cup finals and the Saudis won the Asian Cup in under
him in 1988.
	   He and Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic are the only two men to
coach four different national teams in the World Cup finals.
	   The Brazilian said the reason given for his dismissal their
``very high expectations _ at least to repeat what they had done in
the last World Cup, to reach the second round.''
	   Since the team failed to achieve the goal, he said, ``they have
taken the decision to cancel my contract and not to coach the Saudi
team any further.''
	   While the Saudi federation was unhappy about their team's
results under Parreira, FIFA said it was satisfied with the
performances of the referees.
	   ``We're happy so far with refereeing,'' said Michel Zen
Ruffinen, acting general secretary of soccer's world governing body
in reaction to widespread criticism of the wildly fluctuating
frequency of red cards.
	   The day after FIFA president Sepp Blatter had accused the
referees of leniency, five players were expelled in two games.
	   Zen Ruffinen said Thursday's flurry at the Denmark-South Africa
and France-Saudi games was ``not a reaction'' to Blatter's
statement.
	   He called the ``technical'' aspect of referring _ recognizing
and calling fouls _ generally ``good and even very good'' through
the first third of the 64 matches.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A senior Iranian cleric has been killed in
Iraq, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday,
in the second killing of Shiite Muslim ayatollah in two months.
	   Two Iraqi opposition groups have blamed the Baghdad government
for the death of Ayatollah Mirza Ali Gharavi who was reportedly
shot dead Thursday together with his son, son-in-law and chauffeur
as they were driving home to Najaf from Karbala.
	   The killing of two Iranian Shiite clerics since April could
strain relations between Iran and Iraq. The Tehran government
protested to Baghdad about the earlier assassination and, on
Saturday night, announced that a mourning ceremony would be held
Sunday in the holy city of Qom.
	   Iran's spiritual leader, spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, will
issue a statement on Gharavi's death, Iranian state-run television
reported.
	   It was not known who was behind the attack. Iraqi officials
could not be reached for comment late Saturday.
	   In Damascus, Jawad al-Maliki, a spokesman for the Iraqi
opposition group, Islamic Dawa Party, blamed the killing on the
Baghdad government, saying it resented Shiite Muslim clerics for
their refusal to issue statements supporting President Saddam
Hussein.
	   ``All the indications point to a liquidation operation, and this
is a dangerous phenomenon that will hit many other scholars in
Iraq,'' al-Maliki told The Associated Press in a phone interview.
	   In Tehran, the Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq
said Iraqi intelligence agents killed Gharavi after ordering his
driver to stop the car.
	   The Iraqi authorities quickly buried the ayatollah in secret to
avoid ``any possible protest demonstration by the people,'' the
council said in a statement carried by the Iranian news agency.
	   Nevertheless, the people of Karbala held a demonstration about
the killing ``which the Iraqi regime's security forces tried to
suppress,'' the council added.
	   The ayatollah was returning to Najaf, where he lived, after
performing a pilgrimage at the shrine of Imam Hussein, the grandson
of Islam's Prophet Mohammed, the news agency said.
	   Thursday was the anniversary of the killing of Imam Hussein and
tens of thousands of Shiite pilgrims would have gone to Karbala to
pay homage at his grave.
	   On April 21, another Iranian cleric based in Najaf, Ayatollah
Murtadha Ali Mohammed Ibrahim Borujerdi, was shot dead in the city,
which is 180 kilometers (112 miles) south of Baghdad.
	   Both Gharavi and Borujerdi worked as prayer leaders at Najaf's
Imam Ali Mosque. Hundreds of Iranian clerics study and teach in the
holy Shiite cities of Najaf and Karbala in Iraq.
	   Two Iraqi opposition groups accused the Baghdad government of
assassinating Borujerdi for refusing to obey its orders to stop
preaching.
	   Several Shiite clergymen have been killed in mysterious ways in
Iraq in recent years. The government has blamed the murders on
foreign countries.

World Cup: Dutch win 5-0 to eliminate Koreans 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quotes from Bergkamp, Cha.
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ The Netherlands powered to the top of
its World Cup group with a one-sided 5-0 beating of South Korean
Saturday to put the Koreans out of the championship.
	   Phillip Cocu and Mark Overmars fired the Netherlands into a 2-0
halftime lead before Dennis Bergkamp, Pierre van Hooydonk and
Ronald de Boer added three more in the last 18 minutes as Guus
Hiddink's team posted the biggest score of this World Cup.
	   Now the Dutch need only a tie with Mexico on Thursday to gain a
place in the last 16 while the Koreans, who co-host the 2002 World
Cup with Japan, became the second team to go out along with Saudi
Arabia. They still haven't won a game in five appearances.
	   Bergkamp, starting a game for the first time since mid-April,
set up a chance for the Dutch with a dazzling run past two Korean
defenders on the right in the 16th minute. The Arsenal star pulled
the ball back to Wim Jonk, whose first time shot was brilliantly
palmed away by 'keeper Kim.
	   ``With the quality players we have, you know you can score a
lot,'' Bergkamp said. ``Once you have scored the first goal, you
know you can get more.''
	   Bergkamp was creating plenty of danger and lobbed a shot just
too high in the 22nd minute after exchanging passes with Cocu. With
the Dutch in command, Edgar Davids then had a 25-meter shot tipped
over the top by Kim.
	   ``They played very effectively and consequently we had a very
tough match,'' Korean coach Cha Bum-kun said.
	   ``They kept the ball in the second half and scored excellent
goals. The Dutch are a very strong team and if they continue
playing like they did tonight, I believe they can win the final.''
	   Korea's Choi Yong-soo was shown the yellow card for taking too
long to take a 40-meter free kick in the 27th minute and the
long-range shot slid harmlessly wide.
	   Davids rescued the Dutch defense when Seo Jung-wan neatly turned
Aron Winter on the halfway line and raced for goal. The Juventus
midfielder dashed back to tackle the Korean forward before he could
shoot.
	   A minute later the Dutch went ahead.
	   Bergkamp slipped a short pass to Cocu just outside the Korean
area and looked for the return pass. With the defense watching
Bergkamp's run, Cocu moved into space on the edge of the box and
fired a low, left-footed shot past Kim from 20 meters.
	   Five minutes later it was 2-0 when the Dutch broke out of their
own area to add the second.
	   Bergkamp ran from deep and lost possession only for Wim Jonk to
win the ball back. The Dutch had a three vs. two advantage as they
broke over the halfway line and Jonk fed Overmars on the left.
	   The Arsenal winger beat defender Choi Sung-jong and fired a low,
right footed shot home from 15 meters.
	   Bergkamp should have added a third six minutes into the second

Freak storm pounds Moscow; trees down, power out 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A violent thunderstorm driven by raging winds
pummeled the Russian capital late Saturday night, knocking down
thousands of trees and causing power outages and late night traffic
jams.
	   The storm struck just before midnight and raged for about 30
minutes, with nearly constant lightning flashes, heavy downpours
and shrieking wind.
	   Downed trees crushed parked cars and some of the many kiosks
that are the fount of grassroots capitalism in Russia. Chunks of
metal kiosks and wooden billboards were littered throughout the
city.
	   There were no early reports of deaths or injuries, and no
immediate estimate of damages.
	   Sporadic power outages were reported. Cable television service
was also affected.
	   Within an hour, the city had mobilized fleets of trucks to begin

	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ A West African enclave of farming plateaus
and mangrove swamps, Guinea-Bissau was showing signs of emerging
from decades of economic malaise when disaster struck this month.
	   The country had shed its post-colonial Marxist system and begun
to attract outside investment and development aid in recent years
to relieve staggering poverty that put it among the world's 10
poorest nations.
	   But a failed coup has degenerated into a military standoff in
the capital and plunged Guinea-Bissau back into darkness. It also
has unleashed fighting elsewhere in a region of complicated
enmities and alliances.
	   Bissau, the capital city of about 300,000 in the nation of about
1 million, is nearly deserted. Downtown blocks are torn by
explosions and scarred by bullet holes after two weeks of artillery
shelling and ground fighting.
	   The population is on the move, fleeing for safety and facing the
prospect of little food and barely any clean drinking water. Relief
workers, unable to reach Bissau or other parts of the country, say
tens of thousands of refugees are in dire need of assistance.
	   ``The people are sick. They have no shelter, and we still can't
help,'' Jerome Da Sylva, the Red Cross delegate in neighboring
Senegal, said Friday.
	   The crisis that began with an attempt to oust President Joao
Bernardo Vieira on June 7 has its roots in the region's failure to
find stability since the colonial powers pulled up stakes.
	   The coup leader, former Brig. Ansumane Mane, is seeking revenge
against Vieira for being removed as Guinea-Bissau's army chief of
staff for alleged involvement in an arms smuggling scheme.
	   Some people felt Vieira offered up Mane as a scapegoat to
appease Senegal's complaints about smugglers running guns from
Guinea-Bissau to rebels in neighboring Casamance, a Senegalese
region that is separated from the rest of the country by Gambia.
	   What Mane hadn't counted on was military intervention by Senegal
and another neighbor, the Republic of Guinea.
	   As a result, he unleashed a chain reaction in the region that
now has Guinea-Bissau locked in a deadly conflict that is being
used as a proxy for wider historic differences.
	   The fighting has rekindled fears on both sides about a murky
intellectual movement that campaigns to restore a pre-colonial
empire covering Guinea-Bissau, Gambia and Casamance, Western
diplomats and a local historian said.
	   The idea, some believe, is for Casamance to win independence
from Senegal, after which the three countries would form a new
confederation, historian Abdoulaye Bathily said.
	   Thus, the Senegalese are taking advantage of Guinea-Bissau's
crisis as a pretext to crush the Casamance rebellion.
	   Coming to aid of Vieira, Senegal's army has led the fight
against Mane, driving him and his troops from their stronghold in
an army garrison on the outskirts of Bissau.
	   But in the northern border region, Senegalese troops also are
pursuing large-scale artillery and rocket attacks on the towns of
Ingore and Bula, where Casamance rebel bases are reportedly
located.
	   ``Guinea-Bissau and Gambia occupy strategic ground for the
separatists in Casamance,'' Bathily said. ``The history of
Casamance's problems are closely tied with Guinea-Bissau.''
	   Unlike most nations in West Africa, Guinea-Bissau won its
independence only after a protracted and bloody uprising led by the
African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde,
which had links with the separatists in Casamance. After 14 years
of fighting, Portugal cut Guinea-Bissau free from colonial rule and
formally granted independence in 1975.
	   Exploited for so long by the Portuguese as little more than a
vast peanut and palm plantation, Guinea-Bissau began as a sovereign
state with little industry and little hope. Its people lived on
average only 35 years and almost half its children died before age
5.
	   Marxist ideology and central planning did little to relieve the
burden, and Vieira began to slowly restructure the economy in 1986.
	   In recent years, foreign investment and infrastructure projects
helped build up a small industrial base and transport network that
attracted foreign business interests.
	   Now Mane's coup and the resulting fighting have sent most
foreigners packing.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ After eight years of rule by a
center-right government, Czechs gave the opposition Social
Democrats a solid lead in preliminary results Saturday from
parliamentary elections.
	   The party, which wants to return more control to the state and
slow down privatization, was likely to win 75 seats in the 200-seat
legislature, far short of a majority needed to form the Czech
Republic's first left-wing government.
	   That also means the results appeared unlikely to end the
stalemate that has plagued Czech politics for two years. A
center-right coalition has held power since the 1989 collapse of
Communism.
	   Party leader Milos Zeman and the leaders of three other
mainstream parties have been invited to meet President Vaclav Havel
on Monday for the first round of what many expect to be difficult
coalition talks.
	   With 98 percent of the vote counted late Saturday, the Social
Democrats had 32.4 percent _ a solid lead, but far short of a
parliamentary majority.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus was second with 27.8 percent, according to the Central
Election Committee. Final results were expected by Sunday.
	   More than 76 percent of the country's 8.1 million Czech voters
cast ballots in the elections Friday and Saturday for 200 deputies
in parliament's lower house.
	   Since 1992, Zeman and the Social Democrats have opposed the
Civic Democratic Party. But a party finance scandal last winter
caused Klaus' ruling coalition to collapse, forcing him to step
down and elections to be held two years ahead of schedule.
	   After falling to an all-time low following the scandal, Klaus's
center-right Civic Democratic Party rebounded with a strong showing
in this weekend's election.
	   Three other parties also cleared the 5 percent threshold needed
for parliamentary representation: the Communists, the center-right
Christian Democrats and center-right Freedom Union, a new party
favored by Havel and formed mostly of rebels against Klaus.
	   Klaus expressed satisfaction with his party's showing and said
his main goal would now be to support a solid coalition.
	   ``It must be the aim of all the non-leftist parties to prevent a
center-left government coalition,'' he told independent Prima
television.
	   The most likely candidate to join the Social Democrats is the
small Christian Democratic Party. The Freedom Union could also be
asked.
	   Joining with the Communists has been ruled out by all parties.
	   Saturday's televised discussions, in which party leaders offered
no solutions, illustrated the extent to which Czech politics
remained plagued by personal animosities and ideological divisions.
	   Few analysts saw the outcome as one that could break the
political deadlock since Klaus narrowly lost 1996 elections,
forming a minority, three-party coalition government that was
unable to resolve key outstanding questions such as privatizing
state banks.
	   ``The results of the election is what was expected ... a
stalemate,'' Jiri Pehe, political adviser to Havel, told Nova
television. ``It will be very difficult to form a government.''

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ After eight years of liberal rule
following the 1989 collapse of Communism, Czechs gave opposition
Social Democrats a solid lead in early parliamentary elections
Saturday.
	   The expected victory gives the center-left party led by Milos
Zeman some 75 seats in the 200-seat legislature, far short of a
majority needed to form the Czech Republic's first left-wing
government.
	   Nonetheless, Zeman said he should be asked to try and form the
Cabinet when he and the leaders of three other mainstream parties

World Cup: Classy Dutch rout South Korea 5-0 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ The Dutch found their famed fluent
passing skills and regained their finishing touch Saturday to
humble South Korea 5-0, sending the Asians tumbling out of the
World Cup.
	   Dennis Bergkamp, starting his first match since April, scored a
brilliant individual goal, marking his return to full fitness by
turning two defenders in the 71st minute and firing past 'keeper
Kim Byung-ji with the outside of his right boot.
	   Five Dutch players got their names on the scoresheet as the
Netherlands tore South Korea apart in the second half after going
into half time 2-0 ahead.
	   ``With the quality players we have, you know you can score a
lot,'' Arsenal's Bergkamp said. ``Once you have scored the first
goal, you know you can get more.''
	   The result lifted the Netherlands to the top of Group E and left
it needing just a draw with Mexico to move into the next round.
	   Makeshift striker Phillip Cocu grabbed a classy goal, and
midfielders Edgar Davids and Wim Jonk constantly worried the South
Koreans as Guus Hiddink's reshuffle of the Dutch pack paid
dividends.
	   ``I am delighted because of the result,'' Hiddink said. ``We
knew playing like this, sooner or later we would score the first
goal.''
	   The speedy South Koreans caused a few first-half problems for
the Dutch defense with slick passing combinations. But the
Netherlands always had the upper hand and deservedly took the lead
in the 37th minute when Cocu took a Bergkamp pass into space and
fired a powerful left-foot drive low past Kim in the Korean goal.
	   Cocu was only promoted to the striker's role because of Patrick
Kluivert's two-match suspension for elbowing Belgium's Lorenzo
Staelens in the Netherlands' 0-0 draw with Belgium.
	   But the PSV midfielder, who is moving to Barcelona next season,
looked a natural as he constantly caused problems for Korea with
darting diagonal runs.
	   ``I was very happy with the first goal by Phillip Cocu,''
Hiddink said. ``I knew he could play on the spot where I put him.''
	   The Netherlands made it 2-0 in the 41st minute when Jonk deftly
controlled a loose ball and turned defense into attack with a
striding run. Jonk fed Marc Overmars who had cut inside from the
left wing and Overmars stepped away from Choi Sung-yong to create
space before firing a right-foot shot past goalkeeper Kim.
	   ``I feel the Netherlands were invincible tonight,'' Korean coach
Cha Bum-kun said.
	   ``They kept the ball in the second half and scored excellent
goals. The Dutch are a very strong team and if they continue
playing like they did tonight, I believe they can win the final.''
	   Davids also came close to scoring in the 23rd minute when he
unleashed a stinging left-foot drive from 25 yards that Kim parried
over the bar.
	   The Koreans almost took an early lead when Kim Do-hoon collected
a neat back-heeled pass from Choi Yong-soo to race clear of the
Dutch defense. The Korean hit his shot with plenty of power but he
fired wide of the near post with 'keeper Edwin van der Sar at full
stretch.
	   In the 59th minute Choi wrestled his way past Frank de Boer but
his close range prod was blocked by 'keeper Edwin Van der Sar.
	   Bergkamp set up an early chance for the Dutch with a dazzling
run past two Korean defenders in the 16th minute. The Arsenal star
pulled the ball back to Jonk, whose first time shot was brilliantly
palmed away by 'keeper Kim.
	   After Bergkamp had scored and then come close with a volley that
shaved the post, Hiddink replaced him in the 78th minute with
Pierre van Hooijdonk who scored within a minute of coming on,
heading in a Marc Overmars cross from close range.
	   Ronald de Boer rounded off the rout in the 83rd minute, latching
onto a Jonk pass, beating two defenders and shooting powerfully
past Kim.
	   ``It is always good not to have to depend on one player who can
make the goal,'' Hiddink said.
	   Lineups:
	   Netherlands _ Edwin van der Sar; Aron Winter, Jaap Stam, Frank
de Boer, Arthur Numan (Winston Bogarde, 80th), Ronald de Boer
(Boudewijn Zenden, 84th) Wim Jonk, Edgar Davids, Marc Overmars;
Phillip Cocu, Dennis Bergkamp (Pierre van Hooydonk, 78th).
	   South Korea _ Kim Byung-ji; Lee Min-sung, Hong Myung-bo, Choi
Young-il; Choi Sung-yong (Kim Tae-young, 53rd) Lee Sang-yoon, Kim
Do-keun, Yoo Sang-chul; Choi Yong-soo, Kim Do-hoon, Seo Jung-won
(Lee Dong-gook, 77th).
	   Referee _ Ryszard Wojcik, Poland.

Mexican homeless kids cheer for Belgium 
</HEADLINE>
By ADOLFO GARZA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) _ As Belgium played Mexico in a crucial
World Cup qualifier Saturday, a dozen kids wearing bright red
shirts and well-worn sneakers watched eagerly, cheering for the Red
Devils.
	   ``I'm rooting for Belgium,'' said 9-year-old Carlos. ``They're
the ones who got together so that this house could be built and
people would look after us.''
	   Carlos is one of 25 boys at the Casa Hogar of Toluca, a homeless
shelter sponsored by the Belgian soccer federation as a result of
their remarkable performance at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico.
	   When the ``Diablos Rojos,'' as they are known in Mexico, came
here 12 years ago, they arrived as virtual unknowns and lost to the
host nation 2-1 in their opening game.
	   But by the time the 1986 World Cup was over, Belgium had managed
a remarkable turnaround, defeating Spain and the Soviet Union
before losing to champion Argentina in the semifinals.
	   The project to build and fund the Casa Hogar of Toluca was born
out of the Belgians' gratitude to residents of this city, the
capital of Mexico State, and their desire to help the needy
children they saw on the streets around them.
	   Every year, the 1986 players hold benefit events to raise some
dlrs 100,000 to keep the center going. In 1989, they came back to
Toluca for a benefit match, collecting funds to build a new center.
	   The new center, which can house 30 children, is a graceful
colonial-style house on grounds complete with playing fields,
basketball courts, a library, some computers and a living room with
a 32-inch (81-centimeter) television hooked up to a digital
satellite system.
	   It was in this living room that about a dozen kids, ages 4 to
15, sat during Saturday's game, wearing red shirts with the Belgian
soccer federation emblem.
	   They smiled and cheered as Belgium scored near the end of the
first half, and again at the beginning of the second half.
	   When Mexico scored its first goal, the kids remained perfectly
still, but they burst in cheers as their home country tied the game
in the 62nd minute.
	   The 2-2 tie drew ambivalent reactions from the young soccer
fans.
	   ``I feel a little bad about it, Belgium had to win,'' said
Andres, 11. ``But both teams played very well.''

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian ayatollah has been killed in Iraq
in the second killing of a Shiite Muslim cleric in two months.
	   Ayatollah Mirza Ali Gharavi, 70, was shot dead Thursday together
with his son, son-in-law and chauffeur as they were driving from
Karbala to their home in Najaf, 180 kilometers (112 miles) south of
Baghdad, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   Two Iraqi opposition groups blamed the Baghdad government for
the killing, which could strain the uneasy relations between Iran
and Iraq. The neighbors have yet to get over their 1980-88 war.
	   The Tehran government protested to Iraq about the April killing
of another Iranian ayatollah. On Saturday night, it announced that
a mourning ceremony would be held Sunday in the holy city of Qom.
	   Iran's spiritual leader, spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, will
issue a statement on Gharavi's death, Iranian state-run television
reported.
	   It was not known who was behind the attack. Iraqi officials
could not be reached for comment late Saturday.
	   In Damascus, Jawad al-Maliki, a spokesman for the Iraqi
opposition group, Islamic Dawa Party, blamed the Baghdad
government, saying it resented Shiite Muslim clerics for their
refusal to issue statements supporting President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``All the indications point to a liquidation operation, and this
is a dangerous phenomenon that will hit many other scholars in
Iraq,'' al-Maliki told The Associated Press in a phone interview.
	   In Tehran, the Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq
said Iraqi intelligence agents killed Gharavi after ordering his
driver to stop the car.
	   The Iraqi authorities quickly buried the ayatollah in secret to
avoid ``any possible protest demonstration by the people,'' the
council said in a statement carried by the Iranian news agency.
	   Nevertheless, the people of Karbala held a demonstration about
the killing ``which the Iraqi regime's security forces tried to
suppress,'' the council added.
	   The ayatollah was returning to Najaf, where he lived, after
performing a pilgrimage at the shrine of Imam Hussein, the grandson
of Islam's Prophet Mohammed, the news agency said.
	   Thursday was the anniversary of the killing of Imam Hussein and
tens of thousands of Shiite pilgrims would have gone to Karbala to
pay homage at his grave.
	   In London, a spokesman for Gharavi's office, Sheik Abu Zahraa
al-Haitham, denied that the ayatollah's son was killed, saying he
was not in the car.
	   Al-Haitham also blamed Baghdad, saying ``he was threatened more
than once by the Iraqi regime, which wanted him to stop leading
prayers at the Imam Ali Mosque.''
	   On April 21, another Iranian cleric based in Najaf, Ayatollah
Murtadha Ali Mohammed Ibrahim Borujerdi, was shot dead in the city.
	   Both Gharavi and Borujerdi worked as prayer leaders at Najaf's
Imam Ali Mosque. Hundreds of Iranian clerics study and teach in the
holy Shiite cities of Najaf and Karbala in Iraq.
	   Several Shiite clergymen have been killed in mysterious ways in
Iraq in recent years. The government has blamed the murders on
foreign countries.

Kournikova injury more serious than first thought 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Anna Kournikova is in danger of
missing Wimbledon with a thumb injury that may be more serious than
first thought.
	   The 17-year-old Russian, who injured her right thumb in a fall
during a quarterfinal win Thursday over Steffi Graf in the
Eastbourne grass-court tournament, was reported to be seeing a
specialist Sunday in England.
	   Kournikova withdrew from the Eastbourne tournament Friday as a
precaution.
	   Kournikova reached the semifinals of Wimbledon last year and is
seeded 12th this time. She is among the outside favorites along
with other top teen-age players like Venus and Serena Williams.
	   Defending champion Martina Hingis _ also 17 _ is seeded No. 1 in
the annual grass-court classic, which begins Monday.

Angry Deal wins sixth national hammer throw title AP Track Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Lance Deal won his sixth national hammer
throw title Saturday, then blasted the way he and his compatriots
are treated by track and field.
	   ``This isn't a track stadium,'' the angry Deal said about City
Park Track, adjacent to Tad Gormley Stadium, site of this weekend's
USA Championships. ``We should be competing in the stadium.''
	   Had he been throwing in the stadium, the small corps of
spectators would have seen Deal uncork the six longest throws in
the competition, with his best at 256 feet, 6 inches (78.18
meters), and a total of three over 250 feet (76.20 meters). Deal's
winning throw came on his second attempt and broke the facility
record of 246-10 (75.24 meters) by 1996 Olympic gold medalist
Balazs Kiss of the University of Southern California at the 1993
collegiate championships.
	   ``It's bad for the sport,'' Deal said about being shut out of
Tad Gormley. ``You have an ex-American record-holder (Jud Logan),
the American record-holder (Deal), who between us have six
Olympics, plus Kevin McMahon, who is an Olympian, throwing at a
practice field.
	   ``Put us in there (the stadium) and let the people see us.
	   ``I've gotten a lot of letters from people who said, `You made
the Olympics for us. We want to see you. It's insulting. They
shouldn't separate or isolate events.''
	   Deal, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist, also bemoaned the fact
that the hammer throw winner at next month's Goodwill Games in New
York will receive only dlrs 6,000, compared to dlrs 20,000 and dlrs
40,000 for many of the other winners.
	   ``You can't tell me I don't work as hard as the other
athletes,'' he said.
	   Deal, who missed last season because of a ruptured disc in his
lower back, admitted being concerned before Saturday's competition.
	   ``I was nervous to start,'' he said. ``I said, `Here I am
again.' But once the initial jitters were gone, then I started to
throw well.
	   ``My No. 1 goal was to win _ as a welcome back. After a while,
realized this is where I belong.''
	   Logan, the runner-up last year following a four-year drug
suspension, again was second, at 233-11 (71.30 meters), and McMahon
finished third at 229-6 (69.96 meters). Logan, a five-time national
champion, gave his silver medal to a 9-year-old girl, Lisa Mascali,
who was watching the competition.
	   ``I've done that since I won my first championship medal years
ago, giving my medal to some kid I don't know,'' he said. ``Maybe
it will mean more to them than to me. It makes me feel good.''
	   The hammer throw was the first of 13 finals to be contested
Saturday.

Coach leaves team following death of father 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ England rugby union coach Clive
Woodward left the team Sunday following the death of his father in
England, team officials said.
	   A spokesman confirmed Woodward would fly to England to attend
his father's funeral but could not say whether the coach would
return to New Zealand for the second international to be played
next Saturday.
	   England travels to South Africa after that game.
	   Assistant coach John Mitchell, a former All Blacks mid-week
skipper, will take control of the team for Tuesday's match against
New Zealand Maoris in Rotorua.
	   It was not known whether Woodward told his players about his
father's death before they took the field in Dunedin for Saturday's
first test, won 64-22 by New Zealand.
	   The England team spokesman said Woodward's father had died after
a long illness. (djp)

France defeats Argentina 37-12 test match 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The French national rugby team
scored five tries and two penalties Saturday to defeat Argentina
37-12 in the second of two test matches.
	   Argentina scored a drop goal and three penalties in the match
played at Velez Sarsfield stadium in the capital before 22,000
spectators.
	   Argentina took the lead in the 5th minute with a 40-yard
(37-meter) drop goal by Lisandro Arbizu.
	   But in spite of even territorial play, France was superior in
speed, handling and attack movement, and made good use of the
wings.
	   By halftime France had scored tries by Christophe Dominici and
Xavier Garmajosa in the 18th and 33rd, plus two penalties by Thomas
Castaignede.
	   Argentina could only reply with a penalty by Arbizu, and the
first half ended 18-6 for France.
	   In the second half, after withstanding early pressure, Argentina
tried to get back into the game with some handling movements near
the French line, but could not break through.
	   All they got was three penalties, two of which Arbizu converted
to reduce the difference to 18-12.
	   But France returned to dominate the latter stages with superior
tactics and speed.
	   Cedric Soulette scored tries in the 69th and 73rd, and Olivier
Brouzet another try in the 79th, for a final score of 37-12.
	   Castaignede, who scored two penalties and two conversions for 12
points, was the best man on the field.
	   France won the first test last Saturday 35-18.

A day that starts with promise for Tiger ends with him well off lead AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Tiger Woods glared at the ball clutched in
his fist as he walked off the fourth green Saturday at The Olympic
Club, seemingly as upset with it as he was with himself.
	   Two straight bogeys had derailed a day that began with such
promise, and any thoughts he had of catching up with the leaders in
the U.S. Open were fading fast.
	   ``Ooh Tiger,'' Woods muttered in disgust, still glaring at the
ball.
	   The crowds lining the fairways five and six deep still yelled
encouragement at Woods, as if he was contending for the lead.
Children called his name as he walked by after hitting a 3-wood off
the fifth tee.
	   Time, though, was already running out for Woods, who started the
day nine shots behind Payne Stewart and was in desperate need of a
string of birdies to get in contention for his first major win
since the 1997 Masters.
	   Instead of birdies, he began making pars _ 14 straight to end
the round. It was good enough for his best round of the tournament,
a 1-over 71, but not good enough to make the kind of move on the
lead Woods needed on moving day in the Open.
	   ``It's just one of those weeks,'' Woods said. ``You can't have
everything click at the right time. I just haven't been able to put
the pieces together at the right time.''
	   Woods, who hasn't contended in a major since winning the
Masters, spent the hour before he teed off Saturday morning on the
putting green with his instructor, Butch Harmon, trying to find the
stroke that eluded him in the first two rounds.
	   Woods four-putted greens on each of the first two days, and his
65 putts in two rounds ranked 126th in the 154-man tournament.
	   This time, though, it wasn't the flat stick that gave Woods the
most trouble. He scattered shots off the tee and, with his swing
off, aimed for the middle of greens instead of for pins tucked
precariously close to the thick rough surrounding Olympic's tiny
greens.
	   ``Basically I salvaged a round,'' Woods said. ``This is a round
that could have been in the high 70s easily. I wasn't hitting the
ball well so I was hitting toward the center of greens.''
	   Woods started the day like he might make a move. With driver in
his hand on the par-5 first hole, he hit a tremendous drive that
landed near playing partner Lee Westwood's ball and bounced down
the hill.
	   The ball traveled 385 yards (351.9 meters), leaving Woods with a
pitching wedge that he hit 15 feet (4.6 meters) from the hole. But
Woods missed the putt, then three-putted the par-3 third for bogey
and made another bogey on the fourth hole from the rough.
	   By then, he was talking to himself and the pendulum had swung
from trying to make birdies to mere damage control.
	   ``It was a struggle out there because I wasn't hitting the ball
well,'' Woods said. ``But I scrambled and got a lot of pars that
could have been bogeys.''
	   Two of those pars came on the final two holes when Woods made
fine up-and-downs to keep his par streak going.
	   On 17, he hooked a 3-wood into the deep rough, advanced it with
a wedge and hit a pitch shot to 15 feet (4.6 meters) from the hole,
where he made the putt. After a perfect iron shot on 18, he found
himself in a sand-filled divot and chunked the ball short of the
green in the deep grass.
	   Woods hit a flop shot about 15 feet (4.6 meters) past the hole,
leaving him with an incredibly fast putt coming back down the
slope. He barely touched the putt, then raised his hands in triumph
as it trickled down into the hole.
	   Woods credited his finish to the experience he has gained
playing in majors, in which he has had only two rounds under 70
since Augusta a year ago.
	   ``I've played so much better this year mentally than at any
major, including my win at the Masters,'' he said. ``I've learned
my lessons and applied them this week. If I hadn't, I wouldn't be
here today.''
	   And, ever the optimist, he still held out a bit of hope for
Sunday.
	   ``If you go out there and shoot a good round and post early, you
never know,'' Woods said.

Nicklaus still grinding away at 58 AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus describes the U.S. Open as 72
holes of bad breaks with an occasional surprise.
	   Here's one of them: At age 58, Nicklaus was still around on the
weekend, still grinding away trying to get into contention, still
believing he could win again if everything fell into place.
	   It didn't on Saturday at The Olympic Club.
	   ``I visualized a 65,'' Nicklaus said. ``I shot a 73. A 65 was on
my mind all day long until I passed it with my 17th tee shot.''
	   Even so, the one decision by the U.S. Golf Association that no
one could complain about was offering a special exemption to
Nicklaus to play in his 42nd consecutive U.S. Open, and 146th
consecutive major.
	   Nicklaus has threatened to end the Cal Ripken-like streak one of
these days, but he continues to show that there's no reason to stop
now.
	   At Augusta National, where Nicklaus has won the Masters six
times, he was in contention Sunday until failing to make birdie on
the 16th hole. He wound up tied for sixth, the oldest player to
finish in the top 10 in the Masters.
	   ``Nothing he would ever do would surprise me,'' said Tom Sipula,
who was paired with Nicklaus on Saturday. At 27, playing in his
second Open, Sipula shot 78.
	   That Nicklaus could move into contention in the U.S. Open was
nearly inconceivable. But then, what were the odds of him even
making the cut?
	   By his own admission, Nicklaus no longer has the strength to
handle the clumpy, gnarly rough that taxes the slightest mistakes.
But he may never lose the flair for drama.
	   He made the cut only by rolling in about a 35-foot (10.7-meter)
birdie putt on the 18th hole on Friday, the ball pausing at the lip
and then taking one more turn almost by command.
	   And Nicklaus looked like he might make the most of it on
Saturday. He saved par with a two-putt from 40 feet (12.2 meters)
off the green on No. 2 and hitting a wedge to four feet (1.2
meters) on No. 5.
	   And the gallery roared when he holed a 15-foot (4.6-meter)
birdie putt on the sixth hole that put him 1-under for the day.
	   ``I thought with two rounds below par, I might be able to have a
shot or to at least be in contention,'' Nicklaus said. ``But I
didn't do it, so I'm not there.''
	   The round began to fall apart with a three-putt from about 30
feet (9.1 meters) on No. 8 and a double bogey on the 10th, when
Nicklaus' drive landed next to a beer can against a vine bush.
	   He goes into the final round at 10-over 220, no chance of
winning but still giving the gallery something to cheer about.
	   Nicklaus gets a ceremonial ovation just for showing up at the
green, even if he is still grinding away. He'll decide in a couple
of weeks whether to extend his streak by playing in the British
Open at Royal Birkdale.
	   ``Am I looking forward to Birkdale?'' Nicklaus asked
incredulously. ``I'm looking forward to tomorrow.''

Walcher ruins weekend for 15 of his peers Daly not using driver AP Sports Writer

Eds: CORRECTS final item in Divots section to remove reference to
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Rocky Walcher had no idea that the fate of
15 golfers, including former U.S. Open champions Hale Irwin, Corey
Pavin and Tom Watson, rested on his shoulders as he approached the
second round's final hole.
	   Walcher was in the second-to-last group on the course Friday
evening at the U.S. Open, and was at 7-over for the tournament as
he came up to the 18th hole. Little did he realize his score would
determine the cut.
	   There were 59 golfers who already had completed two rounds in
7-over or better. If Walcher made par on the 18th, he'd be the 60th
in that group.
	   The cut is made at the low 60 scores, plus any ties, and anyone
within 10 strokes of the lead. If Walcher ended at 7-over, he'd
complete that group _ and the cut would be set at 147, exactly 10
shots behind leader Payne Stewart.
	   If Walcher bogeyed on the 18th, he'd join a group of 15 golfers
at 8-over 148 _ who all would make the cut because they'd be tied
for the 60th-best score.
	   He made par.
	   ``I was oblivious to the whole thing. I thought I needed to get
back to 7 (to make the cut),'' Walcher said.
	   Walcher already was assured of making his first cut at a U.S.
Open, but didn't know until he was leaving the 18th hole that he
had sent players such as Watson home for the weekend.
	   ``When I was walking up the hill, someone yelled, `You could
have missed it. You just knocked out Watson.'''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HECKLING MONTY: &LR;  Scotland's Colin Montgomerie was the target of
hecklers last year at the U.S. Open at Congressional, and he's
getting the same treatment this year at The Olympic Club.
	   Montgomerie, one of the world's top golfers, still is seeking
his first title in a major tournament. He also is outspoken, such
as the strong criticism he aimed at the course after Thursday's
first round here.
	   Both those elements could make him vulnerable to hecklers,
though it's not really clear why the top player on the European
Tour has become such a target.
	   Jim Furyk, who played with Montgomerie in Friday's second round,
said his playing parter was heckled on at least five holes by guys
calling Montgomerie a prima donna and criticizing his putting.
	   ``He didn't do anything to warrant those,'' Furyk said. ``After
a while you just kind of tune it out. But it's a shame. It
shouldn't happen. It's not a football game.''
	   David Duval, who was in Friday's trio with Montgomerie and
Furyk, said he also was bothered by the heckling.
	   ``You get a mixture of sun and drink and sometimes that
happens,'' Duval said. ``But you hate for it to happen to such a
world-class player. It's not an obstacle anyone else has to
overcome, so it's certainly unfair.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; KINDEST CUT: &LR;  Missing the cut at the U.S. Open turned out to be
a blessing in disguise for Ken Peyreferry and his caddie.
	   Peyreferry, the head professional for the last 20 years at
Little Mill Country Club in Marlton, New Jersey, had spent years
trying to make it through qualifying into the U.S. Open. He finally
made it this year and his son, Kenny, joined him as caddie.
	   But Kenny's wedding was set for Saturday. The caddie planned to
fly to the U.S. East Coast on Friday night. Dad faced a dilemma if
he made the cut.
	   There was no conflict. Peyreferry shot 80-79 in the first two
rounds for a 19-over score, and missed the cut by 12 shots.
	   ``He probably won't even invite me now, and I really don't
deserve it,'' the elder Peyreferry said. ``Had I made the cut I
would have stayed. That was the decision all along. That's the way
he wanted it.''
	   Peyreferry said he was disappointed more at the way he played
than at missing the cut, but said he's not going to let that ruin
his weekend.
	   ``We'll still have a good time,'' he said. ``It'll be the
highlight of my year.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  Only the minimum 60 players made the cut, the first
time that has happened at a U.S. Open since 1977 at Southern Hills
in Tulsa, Oklahoma ... Amid all the distractions offered by The
Olympic Club course, Frank Nobilo had an additional annoyance as he
prepared to hit his first shot on the 18th hole in Friday's second
round. ``I heard a baby crying before I was about to hit my tee
shot,'' he said. ``I backed away, but I hit a poor 3-iron in the
heavy rough.'' ... John Daly became the first player in the
tournament to reach the green with his tee shot on the 288-yard 7th
hole. Daly used a 3-wood to reach the green and finished the hole
with a birdie.

Candidates in virtual dead heat a day before vote 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Despite predictions of an opposition
victory, Colombia's scandal-plagued Liberal Party stood a strong
chance to retain its 12-year hold on the presidency in elections to
be held Sunday under strict security and a ban on alcohol sales.
	   Four polls published Saturday placed ruling Liberal Party
candidate Horacio Serpa and Conservative Party challenger Andres
Pastrana in a virtual tie.
	   Public anger with the government of President Ernesto Samper had
led most analysts to predict a Pastrana victory in Sunday's runoff,
but Serpa has surprised many with his strong showing. The two
candidates each received about 35 percent of the vote in first
round voting May 31. Independent candidate Noemi Sanin placed a
close third.
	   In a poll by the National Consulting Center, Serpa had 44
percent of the vote, compared to 43 percent for Pastrana. The
survey was based on interviews between June 15 and June 18 with
5,509 people in 100 cities and towns. It had a margin of error of
1.3 percent.
	   Serpa had 43.9 percent and Pastrana 43.8 percent in a poll by
Yankelovich, Acevedo and Associates, based on interviews with 1,254
people between June 13 and 16 in 49 cities and towns. That poll had
a margin of error of 2.77 percent.
	   Pastrana, 44, is a president's son and former Bogota mayor who
has run as the candidate of change. Serpa, 55, was Interior
Minister under Samper, who came under attack both at home and
abroad for alleged links to drug traffickers.
	   Whoever wins will inherit a guerrilla war that has reached new
depths of violence in recent months, with paramilitary massacres of
civilians, political assassinations and rebels who control huge
swaths of territory.
	   However, in recent days the rebels have staged relatively few
attacks compared to previous elections. They did burn at least 12
buses and kidnap three election officials in rural areas since
Thursday, police said.
	   Police said the rebels also burned ballots in the town of
Planadas, 225 kilometers (140 miles) southwest of the capital
Bogota.
	   The government is dispatching more than 200,000 policemen and
soldiers to ensure peaceful balloting. A ``dry law'' prohibiting
the sale of alcoholic beverages took effect Friday evening.
	   During the first round of elections held May 31, guerrillas
burned electoral materials, detained two journalists and 18
electoral officials and carried out attacks resulting in 10 deaths.

Iran says one of its senior clerics killed in Iraq 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A senior Iranian cleric has been killed in
Iraq, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday,
the second such killing in two months.
	   Gunmen fatally shot Ayatollah Mirza Ali Gharavi, 70, his son,
son-in-law and chauffeur on Thursday as they were driving from
Karbala to Najaf, 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the southeast.
	   It was not known who was behind the attack, but two Iraqi
opposition groups have blamed the Baghdad government. That could
strain the already uneasy relations between Iran and Iraq, who have
yet to get over their 1980-88 war.
	   In London, a spokesman for Gharavi's office denied that his son
was killed, saying he was not in the car. Sheik Abu Zahraa
al-Haitham also he blamed Baghdad for the attack.
	   Gharavi ``was threatened more than once by the Iraqi regime,
which wanted him to stop leading prayers at the Imam Ali Mosque,''
al-Haitham said.
	   In Damascus, Syria, a spokesman for the Islamic Dawa Party, said
the government resented Shiite Muslim clerics for their refusal to
issue statements supporting Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``All the indications point to a liquidation operation,'' Jawad
al-Maliki said.
	   In Tehran, the Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq
said Iraqi intelligence agents killed Gharavi.
	   The council said residents of Karbala, 100 kilometers (60 miles)
southwest of Baghdad, held a demonstration ``which the Iraqi
regime's security forces tried to suppress.''
	   Iraqi officials could not be reached for comment late Saturday.
	   On April 21, another Iranian cleric based in Najaf, Ayatollah
Murtadha Ali Mohammed Ibrahim Borujerdi, was shot dead.
	   Both Gharavi and Borujerdi worked as prayer leaders at Najaf's
Imam Ali Mosque. Hundreds of Iranian clerics study and teach in
Najaf and Karbala, holy Shiite cities.

Sabotage and meetings mark third day of telephone strike

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ After two days of clashes among
strikers, managers and police, the third day of the strike against
the Puerto Rico Telephone Company was quiet except for several acts
of vandalism.
	   Police reported at least four acts of sabotage against PRTC
equipment Saturday, including damage to a fiber optic cable in the
city of Caguas that left a hospital and several medical offices
without telephone service.
	   Brandishing a front-page newspaper picture of a striker shaking
a fist in the face of a police officer, Police Superintendent Pedro
Toledo said picketers who provoke violent incidents would be
arrested.
	   ``We are not afraid of the jails of Puerto Rico,'' responded
Jose Juan Hernandez, president of one of the two unions on strike
to protest the government's plans to sell a controlling interest in
the state-owned telephone company.
	   The dlrs 1.9 billion sale to a consortium led by GTE is the
largest and most controversial of several privatization efforts by
the administration of Gov. Pedro Rossello.
	   Several people were injured and others were arrested in clashes
between demonstrators and police on the picket lines in the first
two days of the strike, but no serious incidents were reported
Saturday.
	   The company is being operated by most of its non-union
employees, the majority of whom have been barricaded inside the
company's buildings since Wednesday night, hours before the strike
began, sleeping on cots in their offices.
	   About 6,400 union members are on strike and more than 1,000
managers have reported to work, PRTC officials said.
	   Early Saturday, a standoff was resolved at two of the company's
offices when managers who had been inside for the duration of the
strike wanted to leave but protesters outside would not allow them
to go.
	   The situation was resolved in the early morning hours when
police and union leaders reached an agreement to let about 400
managers leave the buildings.

A Package of Caribbean News Briefs GUYANA: President Jagan says protests will not force her to step down 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Scattered groups of protesters pelted
police with stones in a third day of clashes in this capital city
Saturday while President Janet Jagan vowed not to step down because
of the violence.
	   The clashes began Thursday when talks broke down between Jagan's
People's Progressive Party and the opposition People's National
Congress, which claimed that Jagan's victory in the December
general election was marred by voter fraud.
	   Two independent audits by international organizations have found
the election was fair, and Jagan said her opponents are trying to
use violence to unseat her after failing to beat her in a fair
election.
	   ``The street activity will not unseat me. I do not demand that
they like me, but they will have to respect law and order,'' said
Jagan, the U.S.-born widow of popular former president Cheddi
Jagan.
	   Businesses in the city center have been closed since the
disturbances started, most of them with protective metal plates
covering their doors and windows. Some owners said they were
beginning to suffer from the lack of business.

 &UR; JAMAICA: Bar Association has doubts about regional appeals court
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The Jamaica Bar Association urged the
Jamaican government not to abolish appeals to the British Privy
Council, currently the island's final court of appeals, and replace
it with a regional court.
	   Jamaica and other countries in the region are considering the
establishment of a Caribbean Supreme Court. Attorneys general in
countries such as Jamaica, Trinidad and Guyana say they are being
pressed by European countries to eliminate executions.
	   Some countries have withdrawn from treaties allowing appeals by
convicts to international groups such as the United Nations and the
Organization of American States.
	   The Bar Association said that Jamaica should not join a regional
court unless it met several conditions, including independence of
judges.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Europeans must seek reconciliation with
the Jews for the ``unspeakable suffering'' inflicted on them, Pope
John Paul II said Saturday as he set down a tough agenda for
Europe. Speaking to Austrian officials in the former Imperial
Palace, rhe pope also insisted sacrifices were required of
Europeans to overcome injustices and economic disparity. Later, the
pope celebrated an open-air Mass at St. Poelten, 40 miles (65
kilometers) west of Vienna. Many of the participants carried tiny
flags in the Vatican's yellow and white colors expressing loyalty
to the pope and conservative Bishop Kurt Krenn. (AUSTRIA-POPE)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three Serbian policemen were killed
in new fighting Saturday and four policemen were being held by
militants of Kosovo Albanians' separatist army, Serbian and
Albanian sources said. The Kosovo Information Center, close to the
ethnic Albanians' political leaders, said the three policemen died
in fighting in the Decani area of western Kosovo bordering Albania.
Serbian forces launched an offensive there three weeks ago that
apparently aimed to clear out Albanian villages the Serbs believe
harbor militants of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Tens of thousands
of Albanians have fled their homes. The Information Center also
reported tightened police controls around the southwestern city of
Djakovica, also close to Albania, and in areas near the border with
Macedonia. Its reports could not be independently verified. There
was no immediate word from Serbian authorities of policemen being
killed or of clashes Saturday. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Fighting raged through the northern suburbs
of Guinea-Bissau's capital on Saturday as rebel soldiers held off
advancing Senegalese troops near the city's airport and reportedly
sealed roads into the seaside city. The breakaway army led by
former chief of staff Ansumane Mane was positioned on roads into
Bissau from three towns on the city's outskirts, Portugese radio
RDP-Africa reported. Since the uprising began on June 7, loyalist
soldiers have controlled the port and city center. Senegal has sent
at least 1,300 troops to reinforce soldiers loyal to the government
of President Joao Bernardo Vieira in Guinea-Bissau, a former
Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip. The rebels were forced
from their stronghold military garrison where the revolt began in
Bissau last week, but were dug in at the nearby Bissalanca airport.
(GUINEA-BISSAU)
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czechs gave the opposition Social
Democrats a solid lead in preliminary results Saturday from
parliamentary elections. The party, which wants to return more
control to the state and slow down privatization, was likely to win
75 seats in the 200-seat legislature, far short of a majority
needed to form the Czech Republic's first left-wing government.
That also means the results appeared unlikely to end the stalemate
that has plagued Czech politics for two years. A center-right
coalition has held power since the 1989 collapse of Communism.
Party leader Milos Zeman and the leaders of three other mainstream
parties have been invited to meet President Vaclav Havel on Monday
for the first round of what many expect to be difficult coalition
talks. (CZECH-ELECTIONS)
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ English soccer fans trickled into this
southwestern city Saturday, facing tight security aimed at
preventing a repeat of violence that followed England's earlier
World Cup match. French and British police officers searched
vehicles entering the city for known troublemakers before England
plays Romania on Monday in soccer's premier tournament. Extra
police and riot units were called in to bolster local forces. No
violence was reported. Dozens of soccer hooligans were arrested
last week in three days of clashes between English and Tunisian
fans in Marseille. (FRANCE-WORLD CUP-VIOLENCE)

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Cameron Diaz went back to school to learn how to
feel like an ugly duckling.
	   The actress returned to her alma mater, Long Beach Polytechnic
High School, to prepare for her upcoming film ``There's Something
About Mary,'' due out next month.
	   ``Younger girls aren't comfortable with their bodies yet,'' Diaz
says in the latest issue of Entertainment Weekly. ``I learned a lot
about walking from them.''
	   The blonde who broke out in ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' says
she relies on mood music as an acting tool in her ``handbag full of
tricks.''
	   ``I use music to bring emotion to the surface,'' she said.
	   The actress with credits including ``Feeling Minnesota'' and
``She's the One'' will be seen in the fall in the comedy ``Very Bad
Things,'' about a bachelor party gone bad. The next film she's
making is Oliver Stone's ``Any Given Sunday.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Summer was never the holiday season for Madonna
when she was growing up.
	   ``When I was a little girl, I had to work in my father's
vegetable garden every summer,'' Madonna says in the latest issue
of Rolling Stone magazine.
	   ``Basically, I was either put to work at my house, weeding and
spraying insecticide, or we had to go to my grandparents' house in
Pennsylvania, where we'd fix up the house and the yard all summer.
I do not associated summer with fun and free time, not as a
child.''
	   Still, she prefers summer over winter.
	   ``For one thing, I like the heat better than the cold _ I still
don't have air conditioning. I hate air conditioning. Because I
don't like to be tricked. I want to know exactly how hot it is, and
I'd rather just adapt to the heat, because that's what we're
supposed to do.''

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Some think former South
African president P.W. Botha should be going to jail, but the
hard-line supporter of apartheid is walking down the aisle instead
_ at age 82.
	   The prospective bride is Botha's second fiancee since his wife
died of a heart attack last year.
	   Botha dumped his previous fiancee because she was seeing another
man, according to media reports. The new woman is a legal
secretary, two newspapers reported Saturday. The wedding is slated
for this week.
	   Botha faces a jail term or heavy fines for ducking subpoenas
from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a panel investigating
crimes under apartheid, South Africa's decades-long official
separation of the races.
	   Nicknamed the ``Great Crocodile'' for his temper and ruthless
enforcement of the discriminatory laws, Botha was president for 11
years through the worst violence by apartheid security police.
	   He was replaced in 1989 after suffering a stroke by F.W. de
Klerk, who began reforms that culminated in 1994's first all-race
elections and the end of white rule.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Rene Remond, a historian who headed a commission to
investigate files on Jews compiled by French police during World
War II, has been elected to the Academie Francaise.
	   Remond, who turns 80 this year, is best known for lively
historical analyses that take into account a wide range of
political, religious, social and cultural factors.
	   The Academie Francaise, or French Academy, gathers the nation's
top intellectuals. Its members are viewed as watchdogs who
safeguard the French language and culture.
	   A graduate of the elite Ecole Normale Superieure, Remond taught
history at the Sorbonne and the prestigious Institut des Sciences
Politiques.
	   He established his reputation with a study of French rightist
political parties.
	   But he is perhaps best known for being named, in 1996, to study
the Jewish files compiled by French police to track, arrest and
deport Jews from the Paris area between 1940-44.

Rangers on three hits over the next 5 1-3 innings as the Angels won
for the 17th time in 20 games to increase their AL West lead over
Texas to 1 1/2 games.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The San Diego Padres came up one short in
their bid to surpass the longest winning streak in the club's
30-year history.
	   Shawn Estes and Robb Nen combined on a six-hitter and Rich
Aurilia doubled and singled to drive in three runs as the San
Francisco Giants stopped the Padres' 11-game winning streak with a
5-2 victory Saturday.
	   Estes (6-5) allowed two runs on five hits in 7 1-3 innings. Nen
got five outs for his NL-leading 22nd save as San Francisco pulled
within 4 1/2 games of the first-place Padres in the NL West. Mark
Langston (1-1) took the loss.
	   San Diego's run equaled the club record of 11 straight from
April 14-27, 1982, and matched San Francisco's 11-game winning
streak from May 29-June 9 for longest in the majors this season.
The last major league club to win 12 straight was Boston in August
of 1995.
 &UR; Marlins 8, Mets 3 &QC; 
	   In New York, Livan Hernandez pitched a complete game and Todd
Zeile hit a two-run homer as Florida beat New York for its first
three-game winning streak of the season.
	   Hernandez (5-4) allowed eight hits, struck out four and walked
two in the fourth complete game of his career. Derrek Lee was
4-for-5 with two RBIs.
	   Mets starter Hideo Nomo (2-8), winless since April 28 with Los
Angeles, lasted five-plus innings, allowing four runs on seven hits
and six walks.
 &UR; Astros 9, Reds 8 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Carl Everett's two-out, bases-loaded double capped a
four-run eighth, and Jeff Bagwell added a three-run homer as
Houston beat Cincinnati for the Reds' seventh straight loss.
	   Astros starter Scott Elarton, making his major league debut,
allowed five hits and three runs in 6 1-3 innings, striking out
nine. C.J. Nitkowski (3-2) pitched 1 2-3 innings for the victory
and Billy Wagner worked the ninth for his 18th save.
	   Barry Larkin homered for the Reds. Rick Krivda (0-1) took the
loss.

	   DULUTH, Minnesota (AP) _ Tanzania's Simon Peter beat 40-year-old
Russian Andrey Kuznetsov by 95 seconds Saturday to win Grandma's
Marathon in Minnesota, and Ukraine's Yelena Plastinina captured the
women's race.
	   Peter, a 30-year-old police officer, finished in 2 hours, 12
minutes, 47 seconds, the best winning time since 1985. Kuznetsov's
time of 2:14.12 established a masters record for the race.
	   ``The weather was perfect for a marathon. When I got up today, I
said `Good, it's not going to be warm. I don't have to take any
water.' I felt good the whole way,'' Peter said.
	   It was 57 degrees Fahrenheit (14 degrees Celsius) for the 7:30
a.m. start just south of Two Harbors and 56 degrees F (13 degrees
C) at the finish in Duluth.
	   Plastinina ran alone in the field of 7,665 for most of the race
to finish in 2:35:46.
	   ``With nine miles (14.5 kilometers) left, I was very weak and
felt I wouldn't finish the race,'' the 34-year-old native Russian,
who lives and trains in Uzhgorod, Ukraine, said through an
interpreter. ``I felt like my legs were hollow. When I started
passing houses and people were waving, then I felt support. three
miles (5 kilometers) before the end I felt better yet and was ready
to win.''
	   Plastinina finished 33 seconds ahead of Danuta Bartoszek, 39, of
Canada.

Kiev finds a new landmark in beggar from old novel 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo NY303
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The capital of Ukraine has found a new
landmark _ a statue of an old beggar.
	   Unveiled this summer, the monument to Mikhail Samuelyevich
Panikovsky became an instant Kiev landmark, something like
Copenhagen's Little Mermaid.
	   A steady stream of admirers leave fresh flowers at the statue,
pose for pictures and occasionally toss coins at its base. These
don't last for long: Kiev has enough real-life beggars.
	   Panikovsky's popularity might seem odd to outsiders, but it is
easily explained in Ukraine, the homeland of his creators _ Soviet
authors Ilya Ilf and Yevgeny Petrov.
	   In the 1920s, the two aspiring writers left Ukraine for Moscow.
They soon got their big break, publishing a highly acclaimed novel,
``The 12 Chairs.''
	   Full of biting satire exposing the funny and sad facets of
Soviet life, it told the story of Ostap Bender, a charming swindler
and trickster who knew 1,000 ways to deprive his fellow human
beings of their money.
	   The 1931 sequel, ``The Golden Calf,'' enjoyed equal fame. In the
novel, Bender emerges as a somewhat tragic figure as he blackmails
an underground Soviet millionaire.
	   Panikovsky, ``the man without a passport,'' is among the
entourage of small-time crooks who assist Bender. A veteran Jewish
cheat who specializes in stealing geese and constantly breaks the
rules of the swindling game, he dies midway into the novel.
	   The novels of Ilf and Petrov were suppressed during Josef
Stalin's terror. Re-published in the 1960s after the Soviet
dictator's death, they became tremendously popular, and millions of
people across the bygone Soviet Union still recall Ilf and Petrov's
punch lines.
	   A 1960s movie brought Panikovsky to the screen _ depicted by
recently departed actor Zinovii Gerdt. In fact, Panikovsky's statue
has Gerdt's face.
	   ``I've gone through many turn of the century fashion magazines
to choose the clothes for Panikovsky,'' says sculptor Volodymyr
Shchur. ``Gerdt's face, too, demanded a lot of labor, and it was
hard to work off the old copies of the film.''
	   But why Kiev, of all places?
	   Well, it's all in the novel. It was in Kiev, before the 1917
Bolshevik revolution, that Panikovsky posed as a blind man and
picked the pockets of those who helped him cross the street.
	   Here, on the corner of Khreshchatik and Proreznaya streets in
downtown, stood a city policeman to whom Panikovsky paid a monthly
fee in a cute deal to help him avoid arrest.
	   Panikovsky's colorful Kiev period prompted a local newspaper to
suggest a monument to him back in 1992. But it took years before
municipal authorities approved the project and a Kiev bank agreed
to pay some 35,000 hryvna (drls 17,500) to finance it.
	   Unveiled on May 31, there he stands now, a defiant old crook in
a small square on the corner of Khreshchatik and Proreznaya.
	   Young lovers, children and vagabonds flock to Panikovsky. Groups
of newly-rich businessmen pose for pictures. The scenery around
could not be better _ a bank, a casino, an Italian restaurant and a
dusty cafe-cum-grocery store that seems to have changed little
since the Soviet days.
	   He is a good joke to some, a cultural monument to others, a
reminder of Kiev's Ukrainian, Russian and Jewish roots to a few.
And in post-Soviet, economically struggling Ukraine, Panikovsky is
even becoming a political symbol.
	   ``For us, this monument symbolizes today's authorities, who have
brought Ukrainian people to begging,'' says socialist leader Vasyl
Arestov of Kiev's union of left-wing forces.

A sentimental return for Warner Bros.' 75th anniversary

	   BURBANK, California (AP) _ The oversized golf cart bounced along
the busy studio streets, past the ambulance bay for the television
show ``ER,'' past the theater marquee where John Dillinger was
shot, past the dark gothic spires of Batman's Gotham City, past the
sylvan paradise of woods and rolling hills where Tony Curtis
courted Natalie Wood as they raced their roadsters around the
world.
	   The cart trundled through other outdoor sets on the 110 acres
(45 hectares) of Warner Bros. studios, including the French
village.
	   ``I used to ride my bicycle to work; we lived nearby,'' actress
Joan Leslie reminisced. ``On breaks from school, I would go through
the French part of the lot on my bicycle. By the time I got to go
to France on a tour, I was very fussy about it. I had already seen
France on the Warner back lot!''
	   To celebrate the studio's 75th anniversary, the actress recently
returned for a guided tour with Dick Mason, chief historian and
head of studio tours.
	   On the tour, Miss Leslie, still as lovely and vivacious as when
she co-starred with James Cagney (``Yankee Doodle Dandy''), Gary
Cooper (``Sergeant York'') and Ronald Reagan (``This Is the
Army''), took a ride down Memory Lane.
	   ``I came here under contract in 1941 when I was 15,'' recalled
Miss Leslie, who retired from films in the mid-1950s. She has been
married to Dr. William Caldwell for 47 years.
	   ``Of course, I was a minor, so I went to the studio schoolhouse.
After two weeks I was tested for 'High Sierra.' Raoul Walsh
directed the test, and Humphrey Bogart played opposite me and
actually cued my lines offstage. The studio did things right _
because it didn't cost too much. Everyone was under contract.''
	   ``Part of 'High Sierra' was shot on this road behind the
television building,'' Mason, the studio historian, interjected.
``Part was shot in what we call the Wooded Area, behind the
building that holds the record company.''
	   The Wooded Area was used for ``Camelot,'' ``The Great Race,''
``Fantasy Island,'' ``The Waltons'' and ``Bonanza,'' Mason said,
not to mention even those beer commercials with frogs and
alligators.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   It's doubtful that even the visionary brothers Warner could have
imagined 75 years ago the sprawling dream factory their enterprise
would become.
	   Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack Warner incorporated in 1923, hitting
instant paydirt with gold diggers and a dog.
	   To get their venture off the ground, the brothers spent dlrs
250,000 to refurbish the old Warner Brothers West Coast Studio, add
dressing rooms, a new stage and an electrical plant. The
improvements made it possible to shoot six films simultaneously.
	   One of the studio's first movies that year, ``The Gold
Diggers,'' became the prototype for the Busby
Berkeley-choreographed musicals that dominated the 1930s.
	   And megastar Rin-Tin-Tin appeared in his first movie, ``Where
the North Begins.'' The German shepherd (or one of 18 stand-ins),
went on to star in 19 feature films that some believe kept the
studio going through the silent movie era of the '20s and saved a
lot of theaters from closure.
	   Today, there are 29 stages on a 110-acre (45 hectares) lot here.
There are five more stages on the studio's nearby ranch.
	   During peak periods, 7,500 employees, from stars to grips, enter
the studio gates each day. They work not only in movies, but also
in the television, music, record, video and theater chain divisions
the business has inspired.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The cart eased its way to the small-town Midwest sets that Mason
labeled ``Doris Day Land.''
	   Miss Leslie spotted a stately building: ``That's where I
graduated from high school in 'The Hard Way' (1942), which starred
Ida Lupino and Dennis Morgan. And over there is where I made 'The
Male Animal' with Henry Fonda and Olivia de Havilland. I was her
younger sister.''
	   The tour continued. A theater marquee and entrance dating back
to Busby Berkeley-directed musical extravaganzas. The New York
street where the 1930s gangster movies were shot, and then later
``The Great Race,'' ``Blade Runner'' and, as Gotham City, the
``Batman'' films.
	   On to the Western set. ``It was used extensively for the TV
series 'The Lawman','' Mason said, ``and it was dressed for a lot
of features: Charlie Bronson, Gary Cooper, Randolph Scott, who used
it over and over again. Now it's being used for a feature,
'Purgatory'.''
	   The cart pulled up in front of a sound stage. Stage 16, formerly
Stage 7, is the tallest on the lot. It got that way because
Berkeley wanted more height for the finale of a Marion Davies
movie. Jack Warner balked at the dlrs 100,000 price of sawing the
stage at the base and raising it with jacks. Miss Davies' mentor,
William Randolph Hearst, agreed to pay for it.

	   At the wardrobe department, housed in a huge warehouse at the
bottom of a parking structure, Miss Leslie was greeted like
visiting royalty. ``One of Warner's most illustrious stars!'' a
woman proclaimed. Hanging on racks that must measure a mile or two
(kilometer) are costumes divided into categories: Sci-fi, 1920s,
1860s, Western, Undergarments, Neckties, etc.
	   The prop department could have occupied an afternoon. It was
jammed with furniture of every kind and era, decorations and
sculptures, including a huge Oscar.
	   The final stop was the Warner Bros. Museum, one large room
filled with famous costumes, mementos of the Warner family,
photographs, posters and significant props, like the Maltese
Falcon.
	   Miss Leslie watched a clip of the ``Grand Old Flag'' number from
``Yankee Doodle Dandy'' playing on a small television screen. She,
Cagney, Walter Huston and Rosemary DeCamp were marching on a
theater stage before a horde of extras carrying flags.
	   ``We were all in costume on treadmills with a cast of thousands
behind us. Michael Curtiz was directing,'' she recalled. ``It got
to be 5 in the afternoon, and my studio teacher said, 'I'm sorry,
Joan has to leave.'
	   ``Curtiz said, 'We only have one more take, and we've got all
these people!' The teacher wouldn't give in. Curtiz could have
killed her.''
	   A display of lobby posters from all of Ronald Reagan's movies
captured her eye, especially the one for ``This Is the Army.''
	   ``That's the only picture in which we appeared together,'' she
said. ``He was very nice, charming, well prepared, easy to rehearse
with. I thought he was a very good actor. If he had been given more
roles like 'King's Row,' I think he could have proven himself. But
Warner Bros. was only interested in turning out pictures to fill
the theaters.
	   ``Ron and I had a great time talking to each other. Not about
politics. Mostly we discussed which directors we liked and which we
didn't like.''
	   The tour was over, and the party filed toward the Hollywood Way
gate, past the huge water tower that has borne the shield of Warner
Bros. for as long as anyone can remember.
	   ``It doesn't hold water anymore; it's just a monument,'' Mason,
the studio guide, said.
	   A water tower with no water? How disillusioning. Ah, but then,
wasn't this tour a journey of make-believe?

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For a decade, Hal Hartley has crafted risky,
deeply intricate movies, admired by critics, worshipped by film
students and fawned over at film festivals.
	   Yet few movie-goers know who he is.
	   He doesn't care.
	   ``I know that my films aren't popular,'' he says. ``Nobody's
more critical of my work than me, but I do think it's some of the
most interesting work being made in America, and the fact that
other people don't know about it is their problem, not mine.
	   ``You've just got to do the work that you want to do the way you
want to do it and understand that you're not a popular
entertainer.''
	   Hartley, whose debut film in 1990, ``The Unbelievable Truth,''
took a stab at senselessness and apathy, has never shied away from
the unconventional.
	   His latest movie, ``Henry Fool,'' which won best screenplay
honors at the Cannes Film Festival, tells the story of an outcast
garbage man who becomes a brilliant poet after a mysterious and
possibly dangerous stranger pushes him to write.
	   Hartley considers this his most accessible film.
	   ``It's more emotional, and the emotions needed to be a bit more
obvious,'' he says.
	   Most of Hartley's previous work has been marked by nearly
dispassionate dialogue and sophisticated, highly stylized camera
shots.
	   His elegantly shot ``Flirt,'' which he compares with a really
expensive art school project, tells the story of a pivotal point in
a relationship three times, in three different cities, with three
different couples, two heterosexual and one homosexual.
	   After that intellectual exercise, Hartley told himself, ``the
only thing I want to do is make a great, big, fat story in my own
language and really have people throwing up and driving cars
fast.''
	   With ``Henry Fool,'' the 38-year-old filmmaker hits the audience
with vomit, sex scenes _ which he avoided in previous films _ and a
funny and disconcerting marriage proposal made by an ill character
on a toilet.
	   Through the grit, he delivers a sometimes tender story of
friendship, art and morality, while taking swipes at conservative
politics and the world of publishing.
	   Hartley grew up in a working-class family in Lindenhurst, New
York, on Long Island, never touching or yearning to touch a camera
until he took a film class at the Massachusetts College of Art,
where he was studying to become a painter. He graduated from the
film school of the State University of New York at Purchase in
1984.
	   Now an unshaven auteur who fancies work boots and faded black
jeans, Hartley sits in the downtown pub he frequented while working
on his movie, ``Simple Men,'' and where he hashed out the story for
``Amateur,'' to talk about his work.
	   He seems comfortable here. But he is soft-spoken and often
difficult to hear over the chatter of the bar crowd as he muses
about his unwillingness to compromise for success.
	   ``My job is to dig and to present it to the audience, and they
can like it or not,'' he says.
	   In the 11 years since Hartley started work on his first feature
film, ``The Unbelievable Truth,'' he has challenged himself with
different dramatic forms, making features, television movies, even
music videos, although not the kind that play on MTV. In July, he
is heading to Salzburg, Austria, to stage his play, ``Soon,'' about
Christians who fervently await the return of Jesus in the year
2000.
	   Hartley immediately perks up when ``Henry Fool'' stars Parker
Posey and Thomas Jay Ryan walk into the pub and join him for a
beer.
	   Egged on by Ryan, Hartley amuses Posey with an elaborate joke
about a sequel to ``Henry Fool,'' opening with the title character
working in a Russian sneaker factory and dating a topless dancer.
Or maybe his next movie will be a monster film starring the petite
Posey as the creature, he says wryly.
	   These ideas are clearly only jokes for Hartley, who reluctantly
characterizes himself as more of an artist than an entertainer.
	   ``Entertainment implies that you try to provide the audience
with what the audience is expecting, and art implies that you're
going to give the audience what you're looking for,'' he says.
	   His unique style of filmmaking has made him so popular in Europe
that French star Isabelle Huppert asked him for a part in a film.
He cast her in ``Amateur'' as a pornography writing ex-nun who
claimed to be a nymphomaniac, though she was still a virgin
because, in her words, ``I'm choosy.''
	   Hartley's films offer a ``personal, quirky and extremely
literate landscape that appeals to Europeans,'' Columbia University
film professor Annette Insdorf says. ``In many ways Hal Hartley is
an English language foreign filmmaker. His concerns, scale and
style have more in common with European directors than with
Hollywood.''
	   And his humor is far from the mainstream.
	   In ``Simple Men,'' one of his characters deadpans this
description of the Virgin Mary: ``Not only is she pretty, but she's
got a nice personality. And she's the mother of God.''
	   Such dialogue is unlikely to bring Hartley the money or fame of
more mainstream filmmakers. But, for the moment, he's happy right
where he is: ``Sitting here, making stories, drinking beer and then
going out to make movies.''

	   BRANSON, Missouri (AP) _ In most ways it was the best of times,
growing up in a family of eight children. In other ways, it could
be the worst of times.
	   But always, the Lennon Sisters say, they were the fun times.
	   They were the days when four kids from the Venice section of Los
Angeles, now the city's bohemian center but then just a blue-collar
neighborhood with an ocean view, went from singing at the Moose
Lodge to singing on television.
	   ``Saturday nights were Lawrence Welk nights,'' Peggy Lennon says
of a simpler, pre-cable country's viewing habits. ``Everybody who
had a television set back then watched the Lawrence Welk Show on
Saturday nights.''
	   For almost every Saturday night for 13 years beginning in 1955,
America watched the singing Lennon Sisters: DeeDee, Janet, Peggy
and Kathy.
	   They were 16, 14, 12 and 9 when they started. They joke now that
they're all the same age, which would put them somewhere on the
north side of 50, though none of them look it.
	   ``We were not gorgeous little girls,'' Peggy Lennon recalls.
``We were everybody's little girls. We were the family down the
street. We were part of everybody's family.''
	   Presiding over that brood was the Lennons' mother, Sis, who,
having recently moved to Branson, recently joined her children at
the Welk Resort Center's Champagne Theater for some reminiscing.
	   There, the Lennon Sisters have been the featured act for five
years. The bubble machine bubbles, the Lawrence Welk Orchestra
swings, the dancers polka and the Lennon Sisters, as well as their
daughters, their sons, their brothers and many of the biggest names
from the TV show, take the stage.
	   A shy woman who is reluctant to talk about herself, Mrs. Lennon
nonetheless retains a wry sense of humor from having watched 11
children, 27 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren come into
the world.
	   Seventeen of those children and grandchildren perform at the
Champagne Theater, and whenever she watches them, she says, the
same thought crosses her mind: ``I put diapers on all of those
bottoms.''
	   ``And those were not disposable diapers either,'' pipes up
Peggy, as the Lennon Sisters, sitting scattered in chairs and on
the floor of their dressing room, recall what it was like to grow
up in a large, hard-working family.
	   They all lived in a two-bedroom house with one bathroom before
moving to a larger house in Venice, one with six bedrooms (``but
still only one bathroom,'' chimes in Kathy). By that time, the
family had grown from eight to 11 siblings.
	   Money was tight, but with every child born in a different month,
there was almost never a time there wasn't a party going on.
	   So the Lennon family grew up singing, and almost everyone still
does. Brothers Dan, Bill, Joe and Bill's wife, Gail, make up the
Lennon Brothers swing group, which performs mornings at the
Champagne Theater. Two other brothers, Kip and Pat, perform in a
band in California. Mimi, who works in the Welk Resort gift shop,
fills in from time to time for one of the sisters. Another sister,
Annie, operates a summer camp in California.
	   The Lennons have been a musical family for generations, and the
siblings recall delightedly how it was their mother's father who
helped them break into the business at a place near their home
called the Zanzibar.
	   ``Grandpa would sit us up on the bar and lament that his
granddaughters needed new shoes or something,'' Janet says. ``Then
he'd play the piano, and we'd get Cokes with these little monkeys
in the glasses. And afterward he would pass the hat. Of course, we
never got those new shoes.
	   ``And once Mom found out about it, that ended that,'' adds
Kathy.
	   Years later, they were performing at the local Moose Lodge when
DeeDee recalls how one of her high school classmates, Lawrence Welk
Jr., dropped by to take her to a Halloween party. He got to hear
her and her sisters sing and was so impressed he told his father he
should put them on the show.
	   The elder Welk disagreed. But stuck at home with a bad cold, he
had nowhere to run when the son invited them over for an audition
anyway. He ended up hiring them on the spot.
	   Forty-three years have followed, and most, though not all, were
wonderful.
	   On the down side, the sisters had a somewhat uncomfortable split
with Welk in the late 1960s, when they left to pursue their own
careers.
	   And tragedy struck when their father, who had helped nurture
their early careers, was murdered by an obsessive fan. Looking back
now, they say their mother helped get them through it all.
	   By the 1990s, with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, an
autobiography in print and their own children growing up, they were
thinking of taking it easy when Lawrence Welk Jr. came calling
again.
	   Branson had become a boom town for live entertainment, and he
wanted the Lennon Sisters to perform at the family resort he was
opening in his late father's memory.
	   ``It's just such a surprise that we've come full circle, thanks
to Larry again,'' Janet says. ``We've got our family with us and
we're performing.''

	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Progressive bluegrass musicians are
offering something missing in mainstream country music _ a sense of
adventure.
	   New albums by Jerry Douglas, Sam Bush and Randy Scruggs take
listeners on wild musical rides that veer from traditional
bluegrass to jazz to Southern rock to country and beyond.
	   The three veterans cover songs written by Johnny Cash, Erroll
Garner, Steve Winwood, Steve Goodman, the Carter Family, Joni
Mitchell and Johnny Winter. Baseball fan and mandolin master Bush
even does a version of ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game.''
	   It's a whole universe of country music that fans may never hear
if they depend solely on country-music radio stations. But, like
the literate folk-country of Nanci Griffith or the passion of young
alternative country bands like Whiskeytown and the Derailers, it's
available for those willing to search beyond the best-sellers rack
in record stores.
	   ``I think people are a lot more open-minded than they were five
or 10 years ago,'' said Douglas, 42, an acclaimed dobro guitarist
and producer whose new album on Sugar Hill is ``Restless on the
Farm.''
	   Hard-core bluegrass is an acquired taste. But for decades,
bluegrass musicians have incorporated rock, reggae and music from
around the world.
	   ``We've always tried to play contemporary music and use
bluegrass-style instruments,'' said Bush, 46, who led progressive
bluegrass band New Grass Revival for nearly two decades. His new
album, also on Sugar Hill, is ``Howlin' at the Moon.''
	   The album is full of Bush's laid-back positive spin (one song is
titled ``Go With the Flow'') and eclectic musical taste. Replace
the acoustic guitars and mandolins with electric guitars on ``Face
Tomorrow'' or ``Hold On,'' and it's Southern rock.
	   Elsewhere, he does traditional bluegrass on the title cut and
jazz improvisation on songs like ``Funk 42'' and ``Harbor Docks.''
	   Less acoustic and therefore more likely to generate radio
interest is Scruggs' ``Crown of Jewels,'' due in stores July 14 on
Reprise.
	   Scruggs, 44, grew up playing bluegrass as the son of banjo
legend Earl Scruggs. He has carved out a career producing country
records by Waylon Jennings, Sawyer Brown, Iris DeMent, The Nitty
Gritty Dirt Band and others.
	   Scruggs co-wrote and performed with friends Mary Chapin
Carpenter and Rosanne Cash on ``Crown of Jewels.'' He also took on
some familiar material like ``City of New Orleans'' and ``Amie,'' a
pop hit for Pure Prairie League.
	   ``This album was part of a search, I think,'' Scruggs said.
``It's very much me reaching inside myself and saying, `What is it
that really inspires me? Why am I inspired every day to want to
pick up a guitar and write songs?'''
	   It's hard to tell what's coming next on ``Crown of Jewels,'' yet
the low-key Scruggs pulls it all together.
	   On ``City of New Orleans'' alone, Scruggs sings the lead with
John Prine, accompanied by Earl Scruggs on banjo, Roger McGuinn of
the Byrds on guitar and John Hiatt, Matraca Berg, Amy Grant, Gary
Chapman and Iris DeMent singing backup.
	   Scruggs, who sings and plays guitar, autoharp, and dobro guitar
on ``Crown of Jewels,'' ends the album performing Mitchell's ``Both
Sides Now'' on solo guitar.
	   Douglas' ``Restless on the Farm'' also is a mixed bag, with a
version of Johnny Cash's classic ``Don't Take Your Guns to Town''
as centerpiece. The album title comes from a line in the song about
a young man who is killed in a gunfight after getting ``restless on
the farm.''
	   ``I was going to ask John Fogerty to sing the song, but then I
thought Steve Earle is like the perfect guy for it, just from
having his own scrapes and struggles,'' Douglas said.
	   Earle, who has spent time in jail on drug offenses, wrote a new
last verse for the song to update it. The album has three other
lead vocalists _ bluegrass singer Tim O'Brien, former New Grass
Revival member John Cowan and Irish diva Maura O'Connell.
	   The album is predominately instrumental. Douglas captures moods
in songs like the epic ``Turkish Taffee,'' inspired by a tour of
Eastern Europe. ``For Those Who've Gone Clear'' is a haunting ode
to friends who've died.
	   ``I don't think we have a chance on mainstream country radio,''
Douglas acknowledged. ``I don't even want to. I don't even care ...
. This kind of music has never had a huge marketing plan. You're
forced to just throw it out there and hope for the best.''

Source, Vibe build magazine success into growing hip-hop franchises AP Business Writer

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ One started as a two-page newsletter written by
an ambitious college DJ. The other is the child of a music legend
and a multibillion-dollar publishing giant.
	   Today, The Source and Vibe are the leading chronicles of
hip-hop, two of the fastest growing magazines in the country and
the centerpieces of burgeoning entertainment businesses.
	   With new spin-off magazines being launched this year alongside
television and music ventures, The Source and Vibe are building on
a reality they helped prove: Hip-hop is more than rap music and
young black audiences; it's a lifestyle embraced by folks of all
kinds, even corporate America.
	   ``It's the most dominant youth culture,'' said David Mays,
founder and publisher of The Source.
	   Take a walk through any suburban shopping mall and it's evident
Mays is right. All types of kids sport Tommy Hilfiger logos, baggy
clothes and swaggers _ all hip-hop trademarks.
	   Proof is also at the newsstand. The Source is the nation's top
music magazine in newsstand sales, 10 years after Mays started it
as a newsletter for his radio listeners while serving double-duty
as a DJ and government major at Harvard.
	   Vibe, launched in September 1993 by Quincy Jones and Time Inc.,
ranks third on newsstands among music titles, behind the
long-established Rolling Stone. While Vibe devotes significant
space to hip-hop, it differs from The Source by featuring broader
coverage of black musicians and entertainers, such as recent cover
stories on singer-actress Brandy and actor Jamie Foxx.
	   Both magazines, however, have proven successful beyond the music
category.
	   During the past three years, The Source and Vibe ranked fourth
and seventh in overall circulation growth, expanding faster than
such titles as PC World, Parenting and Seventeen, according to the
industry publication Capell's Circulation Report.
	   From its original newsletter, The Source has grown to an overall
monthly circulation of about 371,000 and published its 100th issue
in December. Vibe, now solely owned by a private partnership headed
by Jones, has gone from a circulation of 100,000 to nearly 532,000
with strong subscription sales.
	   Along the way, both magazines have attracted a wealth of
corporate advertisers, including Pepsi, Visa, Levi's, Gatorade,
Sony, Nike and Calvin Klein.
	   ``The urban hip-hop lifestyle ... has become a very important
part of the culture,'' said Roberta Garfinkle, director of print
media at ad agency McCann-Erickson Worldwide.
	   Such corporate support is helping the publishers of The Source
and Vibe expand beyond their flagship magazines.
	   The Source Sports, a quarterly magazine with circulation of
350,000, debuted in May with a cover story on boxer Mike Tyson, an
interview with notorious basketball star Latrell Sprewell and the
crowning of the Hip-Hop NBA All-Stars. Mountain Dew and Nintendo
were among the advertisers.
	   The Source had published NBA preview issues for the past two
years and felt that, with athletes such as Shaquille O'Neal
crossing over into entertainment, the time was right for a sports
magazine with a hip-hop flavor. Mays hopes The Source Sports will
go monthly next year.
	   Meanwhile, Vibe is upping the ante in August with Blaze, a
magazine devoted solely to hip-hop. Like Vibe, Blaze will publish
10 times a year.
	   Blaze will cover more up-and-coming hip-hop artists than Vibe
and attract some younger readers, said Keith Clinkscales, president
and chief executive of Vibe Ventures, the partnership that bought
out Time Inc.'s stake two years ago.
	   ``We can widen our hip-hop aperture a little bit. We can deal
with DJs and producers that it would be hard to get into Vibe,''
Clinkscales said, also mentioning young rappers such as DMX,
Canibus and Big Punisher.
	   Vibe's founder, Jones, originally wanted to buy The Source
before starting his magazine, but Mays said he didn't want to go in
the broader direction the music mogul envisioned. While expressing
concern about the competition, Mays said Blaze's emergence can
benefit The Source by further opening advertisers' eyes to the
hip-hop market.
	   For Vibe Ventures, Blaze is the latest of several efforts to
expand its entertainment franchise.
	   The privately held partnership last year added Spin, an
alternative-music monthly magazine founded by Bob Guccione Jr., to
further cultivate its audience of young music fans. With
Columbia-TriStar, it also co-produced a late-night talk show,
``Vibe,'' canceled for low ratings.
	   In addition, Vibe Ventures' first book, a biography of the late
Tupac Shakur, was published last year, and an illustrated history
of hip-hop is set for publication next year. Vibe also has teamed
with Walt Disney Co. since 1996 to promote concerts for Black Music
Month in June, and runs its own concert tours and music industry
seminars.

Stewart takes four-stroke lead in final round of U.S. Open AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with third round over
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Payne Stewart knows what it's like to lead
the U.S. Open from start to finish. He's the last guy to do it.
	   Tom Lehman knows what it's like to get part of the job done. It
seems like that happens every year.
	   On Saturday at The Olympic Club they both displayed their major
championship mettle while nearly everyone else in contention was
pulling back with the relentlessness of the tide rushing out.
	   Stewart, who led the 1991 U.S. Open after every round, played
safely when he needed to and scrambled when he had to. He shot a 70
to be the only player under par after 54 holes on the firm, fast
and frightening Lake Course.
	   His 3-under-par 207 was four strokes ahead of Lehman, who pushed
into contention with a 68 _ tying Jim Furyk for the best round of
the day _ and Bob Tway.
	   The four-stroke lead was the largest after 54 holes in the U.S.
Open since Tony Jacklin did it on his way to winning in 1970.
	   ``It's not over by any means,'' Stewart said. ``I have to play a
nice round of golf.''
	   Lehman is very much in the tournament. And for the fourth
consecutive year, he will be playing in the last group on Sunday at
the Open, hoping this time he can get the job done after finishing
third, second and third.
	   ``I don't think it owes me one,'' Lehman said. ``I think I owe
myself one, though.''
	   This time _ at least _ Lehman avoids the pressure of being the
leader going into the last round.
	   Nick Price and Lee Janzen were five strokes back going to Sunday
at 212 while Steve Stricker, who gained ground with a 69, was at
213 along with Jeff Maggert.
	   Janzen had a chance to be a lot closer to Stewart but made a
double bogey on No. 17 for the second consecutive day as he shot a
73.
	   Stewart started his round with a 25-foot (7.6-meter) eagle putt
and had a short birdie on No. 8 that balanced a bogey on the third
hole and another bogey when he missed a 7-foot (2.1-meter) par putt
on No. 9.
	   But four times _ on Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 14 _ he made a good
two-putt from more than 30 feet (9.1 meters) while negotiating the
Lake Course's steep sloping greens.
	   And he showed soft hands around the greens with consecutive good
chips on Nos. 12 and 13 to save par and another one on the 17th
hole to escape a bogey.
	   It was a solid display of exactly the kind of gritty,
grind-it-out golf needed to win a U.S. Open.
	   Lehman walked away from a roller-coaster round once again with a
chance to win. He opened the round with three consecutive pars,
followed that with three consecutive bogeys then played two under
the rest of the way, finishing with a 6-foot (1.8-meter) birdie
putt on the final hole.
	   Matt Kuchar, the 19-year-old amateur, hung tough for quite a
while but slipped from the scene with four consecutive bogeys
beginning at No. 14. He finished with a 76 to be at 215.
	   Tiger Woods shot a 71 and was at 7-over par 217. Casey Martin
had a 74 and was at 219, while Masters champion Mark O'Meara shot a
78 and was at 224.
	   Defending champion Ernie Els shot a 75 and was at 220.
	   Because of fairways as narrow as a hotel hallway, rough so deep
that players are happy merely to advance the ball and a lot of
dogleg holes where position is more important than distance, the
driver was virtually useless here this week.
	   After shying away from it for two days, Woods and John Daly put
the big stick to use on Saturday.
	   Woods showed what he could do on No. 1, hitting a drive 373
yards (341 meters) and getting to the par-5 green in two with a
wedge from 160 yards (146.3 meters).
	   Daly drove the 288-yard uphill seventh hole while the group in
front of him was still putting. Els, part of that group, turned
around and applauded Daly. Still, Daly shot a 75 and was at 219.
	   The Olympic Club is known as The Graveyard of Champions because
Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson _ who have a combined 24
major titles _ never won another after finishing second at an Open
here.

Actors and athletes help plant Roots in New York

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Teen heartthrob Jason Priestley wore one. So did
actor William Baldwin, comedian Dan Aykroyd and Olympic snowboarder
Ross Rebagliati.
	   We're talking about trendy leather jackets designed by Roots,
the Toronto-based clothier that outfitted the Canadian team for the
1998 Winter Olympics. The company's golfer's cap became an
overnight sensation when Britain's Prince William wore his
backward, rapper-style, which brought a smile to the face of his
father, Prince Charles, and to Roots co-founder Michael Budman.
	   Priestley, Baldwin, Aykroyd and Rebagliati were among hundreds
of guests who attended a party to launch the new Roots store in
Soho. Actress Natasha Henstridge (``Species 2'') and Donna Dixon,
Aykroyd's wife, were also among the party-goers.
	   ``Celebrities have given the brand personality and helped bridge
the brand to the masses,'' said Budman, who brings new meaning to
the word, ``gregarious.'' He's an extrovert who loves to work a
crowd.
	   ``I make it my business to identify with what's happening in
popular culture,'' Budman said.
	   For the opening of the New York flagship store, Budman reverted
to his tried-and-true marketing strategy: He tapped his numerous
show-biz connections to reinforce the star quality that Canadians
already associate with his company, known for its hip, outdoorsy
threads and beaver logo.
	   Like Robin Williams, Spike Lee, Puff Daddy, Robbie Robertson and
scads of other entertainers and athletes who have helped advertise
Roots, Priestley and former rapper/underwear model Mark Wahlberg
are personal acquaintances of Budman, who said he recognized the
power of ``celebrity validation'' in marketing early in his career.
	   Priestley (``Beverly Hills, 90210'') wore a Roots shirt, jacket
and shoes. He extolled the clothing's durability, style and
comfortable fit. Wahlberg, one of the stars of ``Boogie Nights,''
praised the pair of Roots suede boots he'd worn ``every night on
stage for the first four years of my career'' as a rapper.
	   Roots has star quality. But the clothes are surprisingly
affordable. Prices range from dlrs 125 to dlrs 150 for shoes, dlrs
150 to dlrs 200 for watches and dlrs 500 to dlrs 1,000 for leather
jackets. Sweatshirts, with prices ranging from dlrs 40 to dlrs 75,
are the company's biggest across-the-board seller, at 50,000 units
a week.
	   Also available: Roots' fragrances, sunglasses and baby clothes.
	   And let's not forget those golfer's caps. The photograph of
Prince William, taken on a visit to Vancouver earlier this year,
boosted sales from a couple of thousand a week to 400,000
worldwide, Budman said.
	   The idea for Roots took seed from a trend.
	   In 1973, the year Budman and co-founder Don Green opened their
first store in Toronto, the enormously popular Earth Shoe was being
touted in the United States as orthopedically correct footwear,
with the heel lower than the toe.
	   Back then, the partners were happy hippies, college-educated and
somewhat directionless. They decided to buy the Canadian rights to
sell the shoe and market it to like-minded consumers. But the deal
fell apart, so they manufactured their own version, called the
negative-heel shoe.
	   Its success was immediate, and Roots took hold in Canada,
eventually expanding its line of leather goods to include jackets,
handbags, carry-on luggage as well as athletic and casual wear.
	   Budman, 52, and Green, 49, who are natives of Detroit, first met
at a summer camp in Ontario in the late 1950s. Their love of Camp
Tamakwa led them to start Roots in nearby Toronto.
	   Now, they are very wealthy baby boomers with wives and children.
They've evolved into New Age types with a devotion to feng shui.
The ancient Chinese art of object placement is incorporated into
the layout of each store to enhance its ``energy.''
	   It may be working. With 120 stores in five countries and 1,000
employees, Roots has about dlrs 150 million in annual revenues,
Budman said.
	   Despite a laid-back image, he and Green are unabashedly
ambitious. They have set a dlrs 300 million annual goal by the
millennium and expansion into Europe.
	   ``We want it all,'' Budman declared, when asked about target
demographics. ``In Canada, we're getting customers aged 9 to 90.''
	   Their success, in part, is attributable to recognizing the
strengths of their personalities in relation to the business.
Budman is the trend radar, networker and liaison to the outside
world. Green is the inward-looking, nut-and-bolts man, more closely
attuned to spreadsheets, cash flow and sales.
	   At the Soho party, those differences were evident. Budman smiled
and posed for the paparazzi. Green stayed close to a wall just
steps from the store's front door. Surrounded by his wife and
children, he graciously received those who approached.
	   Some analysts say it's hard to gauge Roots' potential in a U.S.
market that is already glutted with similar retailers.
	   ``They are trying to give battle to two titans,'' said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, a retail
forecasting firm in Upper Montclair, New Jersey. He was referring
to The Gap and Banana Republic. ``The possibility is there for all
three to exist. But Roots will have to do something very, very
special to stand out from the rest of the crowd.''
	   Budman remains undaunted.
	   ``We're not a retail chain, we're a brand,'' he sniffed, before
adding, ``Roots is a lifestyle.''
	   A rabid hockey fan, Budman likes to quote Wayne Gretzky whenever
asked about the possibility of failure: ``No excuses coming out of
our dressing room.''

	   In the spotlight: Frances McDormand, you betcha
	   Born: June 23, 1957.
	   Personal stats: Frances McDormand is a preacher's kid, who was
reared in rural Illinois and Pennsylvania. She has been married for
12 years to Joel Coen, her director in the Oscar-winning film,
``Fargo.'' Coen also directed her in ``Blood Simple'' and ``Raising
Arizona.''
	   Training: Yale Drama School.
	   Claim to fame: her Academy Award-winning role as Marge
Gunderson, a small-town, pregnant police chief, in ``Fargo,'' in
which she often uttered the phrases, ``Oh, golly!'' and ``You
betcha!''
	   Pity: her Hollywood agent. He has an Oscar-winning client with
the clout to do just about anything, yet she is happy to appear in
projects that pay almost nothing.
	   ``I have control over when I work and when I don't,'' McDormand
explains. ``I can work for first-time directors, independent
directors, and I'll do little parts that appeal to me. It's better
than being a star.''
	   On winning an Oscar: McDormand says she was delighted to be
recognized for her work in ``Fargo,'' but in terms of her career,
she chooses roles that are based on her instinct for the story and
the character.
	   Pattern of her career: She'll vary her work between well-paying
roles in Hollywood films and work-for-scale stints in alternative
features. The Hollywood movies essentially finance her career in
independent cinema.
	   She played the female leads in ``Blood Simple'' and ``Darkman,''
and won an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a battered
Southern housewife in ``Mississippi Burning.''
	   Brief _ but memorable _ appearances include Robert Altman's
``Short Cuts,'' ``Raising Arizona,'' ``Hidden Agenda,'' ``Paradise
Road'' and ``Primal Fear.'' She played the role of an American
tourist caught up in revolutionary intrigue in ``Beyond Rangoon.''
	   Her role in the recent independent film, ``Palookaville,'' is
typical of her tastes. Her character is a friendly neighborhood
hooker who dispenses sisterly advice to the bumbling young men who
visit her. She's only on the screen for a few minutes.
	   Next up: McDormand will play Miss Clavell, the stern but sweet
headmistress who must keep up with her most spirited charge, in
``Madeline,'' the movie adaptation of the children's classics by
Ludwig Bemelmans.

Five questions with Richard Chamberlain: Is he through with romance? AP Television Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Call him Dr. Kildare. Or Father Ralph. Or
Raoul Wallenberg. Richard Chamberlain is unlikely to issue even a
murmur of protest.
	   That would be impolite, and the actor comes across as candid but
impeccably well-mannered. There's another reason: Chamberlain can
look back fondly on his TV roles because he managed to avoid being
trapped by them.
	   With his blond, chiseled looks, Chamberlain became an instant
heartthrob when he donned a stethoscope in 1961 for the television
series, ``Dr. Kildare.'' When the series ended five years later, he
saw that a career make-over was in order.
	   ``When you're in people's living rooms and create a character,
it creates a kind of black hole of gravity,'' he said. ``People
don't want you to change ... (and) it takes a lot to break away
from that.''
	   For Chamberlain, that meant journeying to England to hone his
skills in theater and display the range that could earn him varied
roles.
	   ``When I came back, people thought of me as that actor who did
'Hamlet,' '' he recalled.
	   Chamberlain earned roles in a number of films including ``The
Music Lovers'' (1971) and ``The Four Musketeers'' (1975), but it
was television that offered him the chance to become king _ of the
miniseries, that is.
	   He set hearts racing, and raised some hackles, with his
portrayal of a Catholic priest who falls in love with a young woman
(Rachel Ward) in the 1983 miniseries, ``The Thorn Birds.'' TV Guide
dubbed it the most romantic show ever.
	   Tribute is being paid to it this month on cable TV's Romance
Classics, which is showing the miniseries and airing interviews
with Chamberlain and fellow cast members (11:30 a.m. EDT Sunday,
June 21, repeating at 9 p.m. EDT).
	   There were other memorable miniseries, including ``Shogun,'' in
which Chamberlain played a sailor-turned-warrior in 17th-century
Japan, the Western epic ``Centennial'' and ``Wallenberg: A Hero's
Story,'' about the aristocrat who rescued Jews from Nazism.
	   His latest role is a departure: In the unreleased independent
film, ``River Made to Drown In,'' Chamberlain is a flamboyant
lawyer, dying of AIDS, who returns to his old Los Angeles haunts to
reconnect with two hustlers he loved.
	   Does the 63-year-old actor feel freer now to appear in edgy
material?
	   ``Oh, sure. It wouldn't have been appropriate 20 years ago. But
now, it's great. I'm too old to care,'' he said. ``I'm a little
long in the tooth for romance, anyway.''
	   His fans are likely to disagree _ politely, of course.
	   1. How do you explain the popularity of ``The Thorn Birds''?
	   Chamberlain: I think sex and love are probably the most
interesting things in our culture, although money is our god and
power is a whole other trip. So love stories have endurance. And
the more obstacles there are between lovers, the more compelling
they become. And I guess you can't have a bigger obstacle than God.
	   2. How much heat did you take for the role of Father Ralph?
	   Chamberlain: There was some controversy about that, both from
the public and the church. I didn't pay that much attention. I
thought the story was really justified, and I'm not a great
believer in mandatory celibacy, anyway. I understand the reason for
celibacy if one chooses it, because all that energy can be
transmogrified into spirituality. That's a wonderful goal, if a
person chooses it. It seems to me that's an aspect of our lives
that our culture just ignores.
	   3. Is Hollywood a community at odds with spirituality?
	   Chamberlain: There's a certain amount of lip service ...
Miracles and things like that acquire a certain audience in L.A.
for brief periods. But mostly it's as materialistic and tough and
greedy a world as you could possibly imagine _ along with a lot of
creativity and a lot of fun. But the business side of the business
is really, really tough. If you're not working in something and hot
as a pistol, you might as well be dead. Nothing else has any value
whatsoever.
	   4. How do you keep it in perspective?
	   Chamberlain: Well, I moved to Hawaii. When I come back here, I
find it extremely seductive. You begin worrying about how you look
and what you are driving and maybe you should have gone to that
party. And you begin to evaluate yourself in terms of what work
you're doing.
	   5. What's an average day for you in Hawaii?
	   Chamberlain: By the time I've gotten up, made breakfast, maybe
gotten some exercise and walked the dog, it's practically noon.
Then I go into my painting studio. I was an art major and I've
started painting again. I'm very excited about it.
	   5 1-2 . What style of painting?
	   Chamberlain: Some of it abstract, some of it fairly realistic,
usually with something wacky going on. I do like beauty. I haven't
gotten into baring the darker parts of my soul. I like a beautiful
painting, pleasant to look at. I had a show last year in Maui,
which funnily enough is one of the biggest art markets in the
world, even though it's mostly whales and dolphins and rainbows _
which is not what I paint. I'm going on the Internet with some
paintings soon, and I'm very curious to see what happens.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Keith Strickland could never have envisioned the
consequences of that night spent drinking Flaming Volcanos two
decades ago.
	   ``The B-52's began as a lark, to entertain ourselves,'' the
guitarist said of the band's inception at a soused-up impromptu
music session in a friend's home.
	   ``We were almost nonmusicians, exploring new ways of creating
rock 'n' roll, pop music or whatever,'' Strickland recalled.
	   The musical misfits-turned-pop icons have just embarked on their
first U.S. tour together in nearly a decade, along with The
Pretenders, to promote a new greatest hits record, ``Time Capsule:
Songs for a Future Generation.''
	   They are scheduled to perform at New York's Radio City Music
Hall on June 24. The tour continues through August, with dates in
Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, Denver and Salt Lake City.
	   In addition to party classics like ``Rock Lobster'' and
``Private Idaho,'' the collection includes two new tracks,
``Hallucinating Pluto'' and ``Debbie.'' The latter was partially
inspired by Blondie singer and contemporary Debbie Harry.
	   To prepare for the two-month outing, Fred Schneider, the group's
witty 46-year-old frontman, endured time on the treadmill as part
of his crash course on getting into the pop star mode. He prefers
``junking'' at flea markets in search of ideas and items for his
new (and pricey) vintage shop in New York's West Village.
	   Strickland favors simple pleasures, like digging in his garden.
	   ``The mundane things become really special when you've had that
sort of rock 'n' roll life for so long,'' the 44-year-old said.
	   Strickland, along with bandmates Schneider, Kate Pierson, Cindy
Wilson and Ricky Wilson arrived in New York in the late '70s with a
do-it-yourself ideal. Unlike punk musicians, they weren't
interested in revolting against the mainstream. Instead, the
B-52's, along with Blondie and Talking Heads, borrowed elements
from pop culture, repackaged them and presented them in a new, more
danceable context.
	   Armed with surf-guitar rhythms, synthesized B-movie overtones
and lush harmonies, the B-52's slowly reshaped punk's anarchic mold
and also helped usher in the burgeoning early '80s New Wave
movement. Pierson and Wilson's beehives and flip hairdos harkened
back to the '60s girl groups and further solidified the group's pop
vision.
	   As the band was graduating to arena tours, it suffered its
greatest tragedy. The death of guitarist Wilson, Cindy Wilson's
brother, from complications of AIDS in 1985 cast a pall on the
band's future. But the group re-emerged in 1989 with its biggest
commercial and politically charged record, ``Cosmic Thing,'' which
featured drummer Strickland's debut as the band's new guitarist.
This album, along with the singles, ``Love Shack'' and ``Roam,''
elevated the band from cult status into the mainstream.
	   Wilson's death was a turning point for the band and emboldened
it to more openly confront AIDS, animal rights and other social
concerns in its music. Unfortunately, this shift caused
discrepancies between its causes and record marketing tactics.
	   ``Usually, we would just put our politics and environmental
concerns into our interviews,'' Schneider said. The views were
often omitted ``because people would rather hear about wigs and
funny clothes.''
	   ``We never wanted to come across didactic or preachy,''
Strickland added. ``We've always been trying to find that balance
where you can introduce it in there, but, at the same time, keep it
fun and surreal.''
	   The challenge facing the B-52's during the ``Time Capsule'' tour
will be to survive in a music market in which, Schneider said,
bands are being signed and dropped ``as fast as the next
deodorant.''
	   Schneider, though, is optimistic that people will show up for
their performances. ``I think people are ready to dance again.
They're tired of people singing about sinking ships.''

PBS series 'Airport' takes viewers behind scenes at Heathrow 
</HEADLINE>

By BOB THOMAS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Life inside an international air terminal,
with its goofs and smooth operations, its celebrities and common
folk, has been captured in three documentaries by the BBC appearing
on PBS.
	   The series ``Airport'' beginning Thursday in the United States
is no relation to the 1970s movies in which Burt Lancaster,
Charlton Heston and Jack Lemmon delivered jetliner passengers to
safety against all odds.
	   The new films are the real thing: round-the-clock happenings in
the world's busiest international terminal, London's Heathrow.
Everyone knows the scene: bag-laden passengers dashing to the
departure gate in time, others disconsolately waiting, waiting,
waiting.
	   ``Airport'' goes beyond that to focus on workers who try to deal
with the chaos. They include:
	   _ A photographer waiting to cajole Mick Jagger or Paul McCartney
into a pose.
	   _ Narcotics agents looking for suspicious arrivals.
	   _ A class undergoing rigorous tests to become flight attendants.
	   _ A flight dispatcher facing the scramble of departures.
	   _ A cop solving most problems with friendly persuasion.
	   The first documentary was such a hit in England that producers
Nick Catliff and Ben Gale made two more.
	   How were they able to sell Heathrow officials on invading their
turf with cameras?
	   ``That wasn't so easy, yet in a way it was easy,'' explains
Catliff, reached by telephone in England. ``The British Airports
Authority, which owns and runs Heathrow, felt that when you go to
Heathrow, you feel it's a pretty impersonal place. You also feel as
a traveler you are being pushed around.
	   As Catliff recounts, Heathrow's managers wanted to put a human
face on the complex and the 50,000 people who work there. ``It's
like LAX or JFK,'' he says. ``If you look at it from the outside,
it's a monolith. You have no idea what's going on behind all those
doors.''
	   Though Catliff says officials knew it was a risk, ``they bought
into that.'' And, he says, their wariness has since turned to
staunch support of the filming, and a desire for more.
	   One remarkable sequence in ``Airport'' involves the cancellation
of a Belgian airline's flight and the consternation it causes
passengers. Of course, Catliff says, the airline, Sabena,
``screamed about it'' when the show appeared.
	   But, Catliff says, ``The airport stood by us and said, 'Look, it
was effectively a public place. They told you they were filming.
You could see they were filming.' Sabena frankly got caught
behaving badly and treating their passengers like dirt.''
	   The filmmakers purposely chose workers appealing to TV viewers
because, Catliff says, ``when you're competing with sitcoms and
dramas at 8 o'clock in the evening, you don't want someone who is
boring or unpleasant.''
	   Nearly all the stories, he says, ``are about a person who works
at the airport and is faced by a problem and tries to solve it.
Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they fail. But the audience is
almost always on their side.''
	   To avoid disruptions and attention, the action was filmed with a
two-man crew and without added lighting.
	   ``In this kind of a show,'' Catliff says, ``you do want people
who are going to perform a little bit.'' It's not, he concedes,
like old-fashioned, fly-on-the-wall television with cameras
pretending not to be there.
	   ``If they're doing a job and that job is important, they very
quickly forget you're there. Not completely, but they get on with
their job ... and look over their shoulder to see what you're
doing.''

After multiplatinum success, Dru Hill looking ahead to next move 
</HEADLINE>
By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Dru Hill may have officially closed the chapter
on its phenomenal debut run after racking up hit after hit off its
double-platinum, eponymous disc.
	   But turn on the radio or listen in the clubs, and you know it's
still the year of the Dru. And this can only help build
anticipation for their second album.
	   ``We're going to be doing a lot of things that people don't even
know we can do now,'' said Sisqo, the blond member of the group.
``Basically, we've been holding back on the whole first album, on
ideas and things and what we wanted to do so we can have somewhere
to go, somewhere to grow.''
	   Given what they've already accomplished, that might be a
challenge. When their first single, ``Tell Me,'' dropped on the
scene in the middle of 1996, the quartet of Sisqo, Nokio, Woody and
Jazz created an instant buzz with their powerful voices and
harmonies.
	   But unlike other male singing groups, Dru Hill managed to stay
around for more than one hit, and their church-inspired soul drew
comparisons to another successful foursome, Jodeci, which has
disbanded.
	   ``A lot of people try to compare us to Jodeci, which we don't
take as an insult or anything, because Jodeci is a multiplatinum
group,'' said Jazz. ``It's kind of an honor to even put us in the
same category. But if you would look deeper into Dru Hill and what
we're all about and our music, and what we've done in the past year
and a half, you'll see there is a difference between Dru Hill and
Jodeci.''
	   The Baltimore-based group, which doesn't have a member over 20,
formed about four years ago when the lads were in high school. They
caught the eye of Hiriam Hicks at Island Records, after winning
talent shows and doing the performance route. Soon, they had a
record contract.
	   But their rise to the top has not been totally charmed. Last
year, the group sued the label, charging an Island executive with
discrimination. Although the group declined to talk about the
dispute, they say they are pleased it was settled out of court.
	   ``Basically, we're just happy to move on, and we just hope
people will learn to forgive,'' said Sisqo. ``Life is too short to
hold a grudge. The way we felt is as long as everybody learned a
valuable lesson, and as long as the parties that were involved
sincerely apologized, we felt there was no reason not to try and
move on.''
	   Dru Hill isn't shy about taking on the bigwigs, as evidenced by
Sisqo's refusal to change his hair color when record company
executives ordered him to get rid of the blond. He said it was a
hairstyle that signifies his ``wild personality.''
	   ``I wanted people to realize I was different from the first time
they met me,'' he said.
	   They were even ready to quit a recent tour with Puff Daddy when
the group perceived they weren't getting their due respect.
	   ``The production people, all they were worried about was Puffy's
show. To them, nothing else matters; it's like we felt insulted,''
said Sisqo. ``We know Puffy's been working really hard and doing
his thing, and he deserves his respect, but that doesn't mean that
we didn't win six awards this year. It doesn't mean we didn't have
a multiplatinum album.''
	   In the end, Puff Daddy himself smoothed things over with the
group. ``He said, 'I'm sorry for all the inconvenience,' and gave
us his personal number, and said, 'Any problems you have, you call
me, and I'll handle it.' After that, we couldn't leave,'' Sisqo
said.
	   Dru Hill takes their stage show seriously, calling it a crucial
part of their appeal.
	   ``When we get on stage, people always expect the unexpected. You
never know what Dru Hill is going to do next,'' said Jazz. ``You
come to the show looking for something out of the ordinary _ 'What
are they going to do this time?'''
	   The group is looking for new challenges. They've collaborated on
the debut album of singer Mya (Sisqo wrote and appears on her hit,
``It's All About Me''), and plan to continue writing and producing
hits for themselves and other acts.
	   ``We're creeping into the writing and producing world,'' said
Jazz.
	   ``Our whole focus is to become a very big household name and to
go down in history as maybe changing the era or something,'' he
said. ``We just want to make a change, so when you think about Dru
Hill, there's a spot in time which we held very strong.''

Next host Asia proves a World Cup flop AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The next World Cup belongs to Asia. This one
certainly doesn't.
	   While it's far too early to judge which teams are the successes
of France 98, the continent hosting the event in 2002 is thus far a
collective failure. Its four representatives _ Saudi Arabia, South
Korea, Japan and Iran _ are a combined 0-7, including a 5-0 wipeout
of the Koreans by the Netherlands on Saturday night.
	   It was just part of a particularly bad day for the continent:
	   _Saudi Arabia, two days after it became the first team to be
eliminated from second-round contention, became the first team to
fire its coach. Carlos Alberto Parreira, who led Brazil to the
title in 1994 and was coaching his fourth different team at the
World Cup, was the victim of high expectations following the
Saudis' surprise second-round performance four years ago.
	   ``The Saudis were expecting a better result.'' said Parreira,
who announced his own dismissal.
	   The Saudi federation expressed its ``apology and sorrow'' to the
fans, the least it could do given that Prince Faisal had
confidently told reporters on the eve of the tournament that the
team would match its 1994 heroics.
	   _South Korea's loss was the most one-sided score line of the
tournament to date and made the Koreans the second team to be
eliminated from any chance of making the second-round.
	   ``I feel the Netherlands were invincible tonight,'' Korean coach
Cha Bum-kun said.
	   Phillip Cocu, Marc Overmars, Dennis Bergkamp, Pierre van
Hooydonk and Ronald de Boer scored the goals for the Dutch, who now
lead Group E and only need a draw with Mexico on Thursday to
qualify for the second round.
	   The Koreans, without a win in 13 World Cup matches, came here
hoping for their first-ever Cup victory as they prepare to co-host
the finals with Japan in 2002. They'll have one more shot, against
Belgium on Wednesday.
	   _World Cup newcomer Japan proved to be the hard-luck member of
the Asian quartet, giving another gritty performance before losing
1-0 for the second straight game. This time it was Croatia's Davor
Suker who did them in, scoring in the 77th minute as the Croats
kept their record perfect after two games.
	   ``There were so many chances,'' striker Masayuki Okano said.
``They were tired and we were tired, and we couldn't take advantage
of them. I'm really upset.''
	   Of the four Asian teams, Japan has the best chance of winning a
game. It plays another newcomer, Jamaica, in its first-round finale
on Friday.
	   But Japanese coach Takeshi Okada is already looking beyond that.
	   ``For Japanese football, it's not over,'' Okada said. ``We have
good chances in 2002 and 2006.''
	   _As for the Iranians, Saturday meant one final day of questions
about Sunday's match with ``Great Satan'' United States at Lyon. Up
to the last, the players have tried to downplay the match's
political significance.
	   ``It's like any other game for us,'' midfielder Ali Reza
Mansourian said. ``We hope that, God willing, we will beat the
United States and get our three points.''
	   It's already been a tough World Cup for the Iranians. They lost
1-0 to Yugoslavia in their opener, then government officials
considered pulling the team out of the tournament in protest over
the French TV broadcast of a U.S.-made film, ``Not Without My
Daughter,'' which gives a negative portrayal of Islamic Iran.
	   The film controversy has died down, but the hype surrounding the
U.S.-Iran game has taken a life on its own, to the point where it's
suitable for satire.
	   ``This is a game that will determine the future of our planet,''
American defender Alexi Lalas said. ``And possibly the most
important single sporting event that's ever been played in the
history of the world. So we're dealing with that.''
	   In case anyone doubts that Lalas was joking, he quickly added:
``It's just a soccer game.''
	   In other games Sunday, Germany plays Yugoslavia at Lens and
Argentina faces Jamaica at Paris.
	   The one game not involving an Asian team Saturday was a wild
one. Mexico, trailing 2-0 on two goals by Marc Wilmots and with
only 10 men on the field after Pavel Pardo's early ejection,
rallied to tie Belgium 2-2.
	   Mexico's first goal came in the 56th minute on a penalty kick by
Alberto Garcia Aspe, who converted after Belgium's Gert Verheyen
was red-carded for a foul in front of the goal. That left the two
teams at 10 apiece, and Mexico tied it on Cuauhtemoc Blanco's
flying left-footed volley in the 63rd.
	   ``We just didn't give up hope,'' Mexico's Ramon Ramirez said.
``We showed that we know how to come back.''

At the Movies: `Hav Plenty' 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Movie opened Friday
By NIKI KAPSAMBELIS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A homeless novelist with a nagging case of
writer's block, a pair of artfully ripped jeans and an incurable
urge to mug for the camera is shamelessly pursued by beautiful
women who can't resist his humor and honesty. Happens every day,
right?
	   Well, maybe in the movies.
	   The good news is, ``Hav Plenty'' showcases the considerable
talent of writer-director-star Christopher Scott Cherot, whose
mother put up her house and credit to finance her son's inaugural
effort. Cherot is sure to return to the big screen _ one hopes with
an experienced editor next time. Because the bad news is that ``Hav
Plenty,'' although fresh and funny, also has some pretty glaring
flaws.
	   The title characters are that writer, Lee Plenty (Cherot) and
his wealthy, never-a-hair-out-of-place friend, Havilland ``Hav''
Savage (Chenoa Maxwell). When Lee takes a break from dating, Hav _
angry at her famous boyfriend _ invites Lee to her family's home
for New Year's Eve.
	   Throughout the weekend, Lee fends off the advances of Hav's
friends and her newlywed sister, Leigh. (Unfortunately, the similar
names of this minor character and the lead cause unnecessary and
unjustified confusion.) He gets punched out by Leigh's husband
(Reginald James, looking like Urkel on steroids), the once-over by
Hav's grandmother and, finally, a long-awaited come-on from the
beautiful Hav herself.
	   At times, ``Hav Plenty'' is raucously funny. Like when Hav's
friend Caroline (Tammi Jones) climbs all over Lee, leaving him with
a mouthful of feathers from her boa as he tries to escape. The
characters are carefully drawn. And the chemistry is genuine
between the luminously beautiful Maxwell and Cherot, who took over
the part of Lee when one of his actors dropped out at the last
minute.
	   But those moments are overshadowed by Cherot's inexperience as a
filmmaker. He resorts to the gimmicky sound effect of a revving
engine to illustrate Hav's rising temper. He habitually looks into
the camera to talk directly to the audience. The technique is funny
when used sparingly (``Trading Places,'' ``Ferris Bueller's Day
Off'') but annoying when overused.
	   And, at moments, the dialogue echoes other films too closely.
When Hav angrily tells off her boyfriend over the phone, she sounds
suspiciously like Samuel L. Jackson working over a scared kid in
``Pulp Fiction.''
	   As the narrator talking into the camera, Cherot reminds the
audience that this story is true. Even if that were true _ or is it
just another gimmick masquerading as style? _ Cherot probably could
have benefited from a script doctor.
	   ``Hav Plenty,'' a Miramax Pictures release, is produced by
Cherot, Robyn M. Green, S.J. Cherot, Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds,
Tracey E. Edmonds and Bridget D. Davis.

World Cup: All that suffering in leads to a 2-2 draw 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ All that pain, sweat and agony _ only to
find out that in five days even more will be demanded.
	   In searing heat Saturday, Mexico and Belgium played to 2-2 draw
that had weathered veterans begging for early substitution and the
fittest men gasping for air.
	   And, next Thursday, when Belgium plays South Korea and Mexico
faces the Netherlands, both coaches will have the same message to
their men: This time, no draw. Only a win will do.
	   The draw, coupled with the Netherlands' victory over South Korea
on Saturday night, leaves the Mexicans and the Dutch with 4 points
apiece in Group E. The Belgians have 2 and the Koreans 0.
	   ``Now there is only one solution,'' Belgian coach Georges
Leekens said. ``We must beat South Korea.''
	   Mexican coach Manuel Lapuente had the same feeling. While a draw
with the Dutch might be enough to secure a first- or second-place
group finish and passage to the World Cup's second round, only a
victory will keep him from having to watch the scoreboard.
	   ``Now we have to do everything to win that last match,''
Lapuente said. ``And it's going to be extremely tough.''
	   But conditions can hardly be tougher than those on Saturday.
	   The world's wine capital was the hottest spot of the whole of
France, with the official temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (97
degrees Fahrenheit) acerbated by a scorching sun and hardly a
breeze to cool things down.
	   ``Man, I felt like being substituted after 10 minutes,'' said
Belgian captain Franky Van der Elst. ``My legs just didn't move
anymore.''
	   Coach Leekens showed Van der Elst mercy after 67 minutes,
removing him for Glen De Boeck.
	   ``It was just devilish weather,'' said Mexican captain Alberto
Garcia Aspe.
	   One man thrived, or seemed to. Belgium's Marc Wilmots scored two
goals and seemed to run ceaselessly. Afterwards he said, ``I've
never suffered like this, after 20 minutes, my throat was totally
dried out.''
	   At least for him, if paid off.
	   The Schalke 04 powerhouse put Belgium ahead in the 43rd minute
when he connected on a corner from Luis Oliveira and he slammed the
ball, partly with his chest and partly with his thigh, through the
legs of keeper Jorge Campos for the opening goal.
	   Three minutes into the second half, Wilmots added a second,
lumbering through the Mexican defense in his trademark style,
breaking two tackles before unleashing a right-footed shot past
Campos.
	   ``Especially the second goal was one on willpower,'' Wilmots
said.
	   Mexico had its own brand of willpower.
	   Already down to 10 men since the 29th minute when Pavel Pardo
was sent off for an illegal tackle from behind on Vital Borkelmans,
it still managed to come back.
	   Mexico got its glimmer of hope in the 55th minute when Ramirez
took a pass from Cuauhtemoc Blanco in the penalty area before Gert
Verheyen brought him down to concede a penalty kick. Alberto Garcia
Aspe converted the spot kick, and Verheyen was sent off to make the
game a 10-a-side affair.
	   Eight minutes later, Mexico completed its recovery when the same
duo combined on a fast break. Ramirez broke free on the left and
crossed into the penalty area, where Blanco stabbed the ball home
with a left-footted flying volley.
	   The Belgians were left shaking their heads.
	   ``If we lead 2-0, we should never give that away,'' Van der Elst
said.

At the Movies: `The X-Files' AP National Writer

Eds: Film opened Friday.
By TED ANTHONY
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When we last saw our intrepid FBI duo, Mulder
and Scully of the hit Fox TV series ``The X-Files,'' their office
was in ashes and their futures as investigators of the paranormal
uncertain.
	   Quick primer: Fox Mulder. Nicknamed ``Spooky'' by his
colleagues. Obsessed with aliens and unexplained phenomena since
(he says) his sister was abducted by aliens when they were kids.
Dark humor, loose cannon. Strikingly handsome in that brooding geek
way.
	   And Dana Scully. Medical doctor. Dispassionate scientist with a
passionate nature. Lush red hair and impossibly full lips. Adept at
glowering and being introspective. Paired with Mulder to debunk his
work, but has grown into a partner and confidante who seems always
on the verge of believing.
	   These traits make ``The X-Files'' so popular, and they serve
Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Mulder (David Duchovny) well as their
global-conspiracy show is cross-marketed to the big screen.
	   It's an unusual tactic. The series' season ended a few weeks ago
with an episode that leads into the film; the film's conclusion,
producers say, will lead into the next season. Such is
entertainment in the late '90s.
	   That said, it is the characters _ Mulder and Scully in
particular _ who carry the movie. The plot, a muddled hodgepodge of
aliens, conspiracies and assorted weird doings, starts solid but
drifts off into an unlikely ending _ even for science fiction.
	   That's the point, you say: It's supposed to be unlikely. But
it's not supposed to be this murky. Suffice it to say that, by the
end, even the most rabid aficionados of the show might ask just
what happened.
	   In true ``X-Files'' fashion, though, the small moments carry the
day: Mulder relieving himself on an old ``Independence Day'' movie
ad; Scully and Mulder bantering in a way that Maddie and Dave of
``Moonlighting'' might have if they'd been scripted by Charles
Addams; the interactions between Mulder and his skulking tipster,
Kurtzweil (Martin Landau).
	   Duchovny and Anderson exhibit their usual high level of talent
and help the transition from small to big screen. Each seems
comfortable with the additional space and depth of a feature film,
and both manage to convey a strong screen presence while
maintaining the eerie, muted sense of persona necessary to their
characters.
	   They even hint at a kiss in a scene that blends perfect comic
timing with passion and, ultimately, violence.
	   Landau (``Ed Wood'') has a craggy John Carradine gauntness
perfect for ``The X-Files''; it's a surprise he didn't appear on
the show earlier. He plays an OB-GYN and possible pedophile who has
some key information about a global conspiracy he says is
spearheaded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
	   ``FEMA _ the secret government,'' he whispers.
	   ``And they call ME paranoid,'' responds Mulder.
	   Fans of the show will be disappointed in how recurring
characters are used.
	   Assistant FBI Director Skinner, played adeptly by Mitch Pileggi
with a weary integrity and ambiguity unusual in a TV series, is
barely window-dressing. The mysterious and usually evil Cancer Man
(William B. Davis), who became more equivocal as the series
progressed, is bad and unambiguous here (probably because to deal
with his character more closely would have been too arcane for
non-X-philes). John Neville, though, gets some welcome screen time
as the mysterious ``well-manicured man.''
	   ``The X-Files'' is, at its most basic, the narrative version of
what might be in the closet or under the bed. It shines when its
dialogue crackles and its weirdness permeates, and that's what
we're offered here: creepy-crawlies growing inside translucent
bodies, 3 a.m. autopsies, quotes like ``I think it's gestated.''
	   It's a visceral experience, darkly visual in an even better way
than the series _ full of liquids, viscous black oozing, swarming
bees, heat, ice, bowels of the Earth and billowing steam. The
cinematography is often amazing, darkly over the top but never
cartoonish, always reminding us how menacing the American outback
can be.
	   It comes down to this: The ``X-Files'' movie slows the byzantine
machinations of the show just enough to satisfy neophytes without
alienating (heh, heh) fans. But in the end, the story is just plain
unsatisfying.
	   ``The X-Files'' has taken a place in sci-fi that could soon
rival that of ``Star Trek.'' Its big-screen debut, while not one
for the ages, is a competent effort and a sign that Scully and
Mulder will be back to investigate another day.
	   ``The X-Files'' is directed by Rob Bowman (who has directed 25
series episodes). It is produced by Daniel Sackheim and X-Files
creator Chris

	   ``Before These Crowded Streets'' (RCA) _ Dave Matthews Band
	   Memo to Dave Matthews:
	   It looks as though your band might be the hottest act in pop
this summer, Dave, with a big tour and new CD. But there's one
thing you need to know about the record, just for future reference:
It's too long.
	   Ten songs in 70 minutes? Who do you guys think you are, the
Grateful Dead?
	   First, you should have dumped the interminable ``Halloween''
midway through the record _ it makes you sound like you're trying
to blow your voice out. Then, you needed to hit the fade button
sooner on a few other tracks. Your name is Matthews, not Mahler.
	   Jammin' is fine, especially when a band has Boyd Tinsley on
violin and LeRoi Moore on horns. And these songs are undoubtedly
terrific in concert. But on disc, they sound constructed rather
than played, and Tinsley and Moore are given few chances to cut
loose. You needed more instrumental fizzle to justify so many
7-minute tunes.
	   Nonetheless, ``Crowded Streets'' has some scintillating moments.
The rousing ``Stay (Wasting Time)'' is a surefire hit, and
``Crush'' is a wonderful Marvin Gaye tribute. ``The Dreaming Tree''
should be great live, inviting inventive improvisation because of
its seven-eight meter. And the love ballad ``Spoon'' brings the
record to a beautiful close, highlighted by Bela Fleck's nifty
banjo, Alanis Morissette's otherworldly vocals and terrific
interplay between Moore and Tinsley _ all in only 5 1-2 minutes!
	   Hey, Dave, you've got a great, expressive voice, a band with
eclectic instrumentation and a laconic attitude that's way cool. So
is your unique blend of rhythm 'n' blues, jazz and folk. Who else
would come up with your combination of guest artists _ Fleck,
Morissette and the Kronos Quartet?
	   But attention spans are shorter these days, Dave, and your songs
should be, too.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Bespoke Songs, Lost Dogs, Detours and Rendezvous _ The Songs
of Elvis Costello'' (Rhino) _ Various Artists
	   Elvis Costello supposedly can listen to an unfamiliar band and,
based solely on the music, correctly guess what city they're from.
Such a talent is testimony to his mastery of pop music.
	   So is a new CD from Rhino _''Bespoke Songs, Lost Dogs, Detours
and Rendezvous.'' It's not a tribute album per se, but a collection
of 21 Costello compositions recorded over the past couple of
decades by artists famous and obscure.
	   The remarkable thing about the set is the range of material and
performers. There's power pop by Dave Edmunds (``Girls Talk''), Tin
Pan Alley pop by For Real (``Unwanted Number''), raw country by
Johnny Cash (``Hidden Shame''), art rock by Robert Wyatt
(``Shipbuilding'') and jazz by Chet Baker (``Almost Blue''). It's
hard to believe it was all written by the same composer.
	   The biggest disappointment is that only one song _ ``Girls
Talk'' _ is included from Costello's 1977-82 heyday, when he was a
New Wave pioneer. Oddly, rock 'n' roll is one of the few genres
unrepresented.
	   Costello's song-by-song liner notes are fun and illuminating.
Roy Orbison, Ruben Blades, June Tabor and Aimee Mann are among the
contributors who shine, and there are only a couple of clunkers.
Most of the artists have a better voice than Costello, who will be
remembered not for his singing, but for his songwriting.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Been There'' (Maverick) _ Ebba Forsberg
	   The pervasiveness of American pop music can be perverse. Ebba
Forsberg was born in Sweden and grew up in the West Indies and
Botswana, so her debut album naturally presents her as a Top 40
balladeer _ and a good one.
	   A touch of European cool makes Forsberg distinctive. Her
deceptively casual singing style is reminiscent of Natalie
Merchant, but Forsberg is less offhand and more passionate _
better, in other words.
	   On ``Been There,'' Forsberg composed the music and her sister,
Kajsa Ribbing, provided the lyrics. The two must be close, because
Forsberg sings the words as if she wrote them herself. The 11 songs
are slow to mid-tempo ballads, but shards of guitar and nice
dynamic touches give the melancholy mood an edge.
	   Forsberg will be hard-pressed to match the popularity of
Maverick label-mate Alanis Morissette, but ``Been There'' deserves
to be a hit.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``At Budokan: The Complete Concert'' (Epic/Legacy) _ Cheap Trick
	   It's a humbling realization for aging Baby Boomers: Remember how
Fats Domino's ``Ain't That a Shame'' seemed ancient when Cheap
Trick revived the song in 1978? Well, now Cheap Trick's version is
20 years old.
	   ``At Budokan: The Complete Concert'' is filled with such oldies
but goodies. The crowning achievement of Cheap Trick's career has
been remastered and repackaged into a 19-song, two-CD set,
documenting the complete concert in Japan in 1978.
	   Nine songs were left off the original album, and thanks to their
inclusion, Budokan roars like never before. Among the ``new''
material are some of Cheap Trick's best rockers, such as ``High
Roller'' and the glorious ``California Man.''
	   The sound quality is just OK _ it still sounds like 1978. The
audience is more audible in the new release, which is a bit
distracting but reflects the Cheap Trickmania that gripped Japanese
teen-agers at the time. Drummer Bun E. Carlos is also prominent in
the mix, and that's good because he has always been the band's
anchor.
	   Most important, ``Ain't That a Shame'' _ Cheap Trick's finest
moment, and perhaps the greatest cover of a '50s tune in rock
history _ sounds even better with age. Forget the band's 1996
four-CD box set; this is all the Cheap Trick you'll ever need.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Howlin' at the Moon'' (Sugar Hill) _ Sam Bush
	   Bluegrass multi-instrumentalist Sam Bush is one of those
virtuosos who has always been better in concert than on record. But
he comes close to capturing the energy of his live work on
``Howlin' at the Moon,'' 14 tracks loaded with good humor and hot
licks.
	   The disc includes seven instrumentals, ranging from the fiddle
tune ``Big Rabbit'' and the all-mandolin ``Ozzie and Max'' to
``Funk 42,'' a breakdown that jumps from one
``don't-try-this-at-home'' solo to another. Such stellar guests as
J.D. Crowe, Jerry Douglas and former New Grass Revival bandmate
Bela Fleck swap jaw-dropping riffs with Bush, who shines on
mandolin, fiddle and guitar. His vocals are fine, too.
	   The only clunker is an uninspired cover of Steve Winwood's
``Hold On.'' Bush wrote or co-wrote seven tunes, including the
nifty ``Cloverleaf Rag,'' a solo instrumental that ends too soon,
and ``Song for Roy,'' a tribute to the late bassist Roy Huskey Jr.
	   Bush closes the set with a joyful, inventive rendition of ``Take
Me Out to the Ballgame'' that would make even Albert Belle smile.
With that, ``Howlin' at the Moon'' touches all the bases.

World Cup: Suker leads Croatia 1-0; Japanese scoreless streak continues 
</HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ In the end, the difference was Davor
Suker.
	   For stretches, Japan pestered Croatia, intercepting passes of
the more experienced Europeans, creating chances through Hidetoshi
Nakata and even using a little subterfuge.
	   With the Croats creating but failing to put a number of chances
on target, they appeared out-of-synch, even frustrated.
	   But Suker persevered, finally pushing across the only goal of
the match to give Croatia a 1-0 victory over Japan on Saturday. It
put one World Cup debutante _ Croatia _ on the verge of the second
round and the other _ Japan _ on the edge of elimination.
	   Despite shooting wide on several attempts early and putting
another off the bar in the 72nd, Suker remained poised on a cross
from Aljosa Asanovic in the 77th minute, settling the ball and
evading Japanese defender Eisuke Nakanishi in the same motion.
	   He then focused and shot, knocking the ball off keeper
Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi's left hand and into the net.
	   ``There were many chances, but they couldn't take advantage of
them,'' Suker said. ``Japan really needed to win this game, and
they waited too long.''
	   With Nakata directing the offense, the Japanese troubled
Croatia, whose coordination appeared thrown off by the absence of
injured captain Zvonimir Boban.
	   But all Japan could manage was to be almost there. It never got
truly close to a goal.
	   ``They knew we were going for a win. They played a better
game,'' midfielder Motohiro Yamaguchi said. ``It seemed so close,
yet so far.''
	   Shoji Jo stirred some excitement with a scissors kick in the
58th minute, but it bounced wide.
	   Japan's best chance was squelched when Nakata fed forward
Masashi Nakayama, but Croatian keeper Drazen Ladic, despite falling
the opposite direction, got half of his left hand out to block the
shot.
	   In the second half, Masayuki Okano, who replaced Nakayama,
caught up with the ball near the corner and crossed it to an
unmarked Naoki Soma, but his shot soared over the bar.
	   Japan even tried a little trickery in the 21st minute. Nakata
gently lifted a rolling free kick over a wall of defenders into the
area, where a surging Jo was barely headed off by Ladic.
	   ``There were so many chances. They were tired, but we were
tired, too. We couldn't seize the chances. I'm really upset,''
Japanese coach Takeshi Okano said. ``These teams that have more
experience like them, they're powerful.''
	   Most of the game, played in 30-degree-plus Celsius (mid-to-high
80s Fahrenheit), was Croatia's, although it, too, suffered
problems. Suker had three shots at goal in the first 13 minutes _
all high or wide.
	   ``We suffered a lot in this game. This was a very difficult game
for us,'' said Croatia coach Miroslav Blazevic, adding that Suker
had lost 3.8 kilograms (eight pounds) in the game.
	   In the 79th minute, Okada sent in midfielder Hiroaki Morishima
for defender Akira Narahashi, but he was unable to give Ladic much
to worry about.
	   Japan's scoreless streak reached five game, having last scored
in an international in the 86th minute for a 1-1 draw at home with
Paraguay on May 17 in the Kirin Cup.
	   When the double whistle blew, captain Masami Ihara collapsed and
sat in the grass, unable to move, surrounded by the stands that had
turned blue from the thousands of Japanese who had flown across the
world to sing, chant and cheer their heroes on.
	   ``I am happy for the players that people may say we played a
good game,'' Okada said. ``But I feel the door to the world _ and
the goal _ were far away.''
	   Croatia still must play Argentina in its final first-round
match, a game that likely will decide the Group H winner. Japan,
which lost to Argentina 1-0, plays Jamaica.

Vienna archbishop seems a man in a hurry With Austria-Pope 
</HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ When Pope John Paul II's plane landed in
Vienna, a prelate in cardinal's red raced down the back stairs and
bounded up the front ramp to officially welcome the pope to the
Austrian capital.
	   It seemed only natural that it was Cardinal Christoph
Schoenborn, the archbishop of Vienna, clearly a man on the move.
	   Only elevated to cardinal by John Paul in February, Schoenborn
is already being talked about for a top Vatican post _ not to
mention speculation that he may be pope himself some day.
	   By church standards, Schoenborn is, at 53, young for such lofty
positions.
	   But since taking over as Vienna archbishop in September 1995, he
has shown himself to be open, highly articulate and courageous as
he stepped into the middle of a storm engulfing the church in this
traditionally Roman Catholic bastion.
	   ``I hope the pope's visit will show that the Austrian church is
alive, not without problems, but full of vitality,'' he told the
international press, answering questions in fluent English, Italian
and French as well as his native German, shortly after John Paul
arrived Friday in Salzburg.
	   In what many Austrians consider his significant act, Schoenborn
offered a public apology to those who were allegedly molested by
his predecessor, Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, who is accused of
pedophilia.
	   Groer was forced to relinquish all his duties and go into exile
by the pope in April, but Schoenborn is one of the few official
church voices to speak out on the affair.
	   He has tried to hold the country's troubled church, which has
been buffeted by demands and attacks on some of the country's
conservative bishops.
	   Schoenborn was born in Czechoslovakia to a noble family of
Austrian descent, which fled to Austria to escape the communists.
	   He was educated in Austria, Germany and France.
	   He joined the Dominican Order in 1963, was ordained as a priest
seven years later and was elevated to bishop in 1991.
	   As an expert in Catholic theology, he has been mentioned as a
possible successor to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the Vatican's
powerful watchdog on moral issues.
	   Schoenborn's friends point out that he has another important
quality, being able to laugh at himself.
	   Describing the relationship between lay people and priests, he
explained to reporters that the ``church must act as a body, and
work together like arms and legs.''
	   He paused, looked up and asked: ``Am I being too pious?''

World Cup: Sacked Brazilian coach sees himself as a scapegoat 
</HEADLINE>
By ADNAN MALIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MELUN-SENART, France (AP) _ From World Cup record breaker to
first-round victim.
	   Distressed over being fired by the ``very demanding Saudis''
Saturday, coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who guided Brazil to its
record fourth World Cup triumph four years ago, said he had been a
scapegoat in Saudia Arabia's early exit from the 1998 championship.
	   ``Obviously... they were looking for someone to blame and I
guess in this case the coach will get it,'' Parreira said a few
minutes before he left his hotel to get the news of sacking.
	   Looking weary after returning from an hour's meeting with Saudi
sports officials, Parreira told reporters at the team hotel: ``The
Saudis were expecting a better result.
	   ``As of now we are no longer with the Saudi team.''
	   Saudi Arabia lost its first two matches, 1-0 to Denmark and 4-0
to host France to become the first of the 32 nations to go out. The
team has one more game Wednesday against South Africa and Mohammed
al-Khuraishi, a Saudi coach, will direct the team at that match.
	   Parreira was the eighth coach to be sacked by the Saudis in less
than four years. He signed a one-year contract with the Saudi
federation in December for a reported dlrs 3 million.
	   The decision to fire him was taken by the Saudi soccer
federation, which met in an extraordinary session in Paris late
Friday.
	   ``I don't feel happy and I don't feel comfortable with the
decision taken by the Saudi officials. At least they should have
let us continue until the end of the World Cup,'' Parreira said,
adding that ``I did not do it just for money.''
	   Saudi officials ``should at least give more time for the coach
and players to get used to each other,'' he said.
	   Parreira was not the first Brazilian coach to be fired by the
Saudis. Zagallo, who is currently coaching the Brazilians had an
unsuccessful stint in 1984.
	   Parreira said he had ``very good relations with the Saudi
players.'' Several were seen hugging him just before was driven to
a Paris hotel to get the word on his sacking. But none was
available to comment after he returned to the team hotel.
	   Parreira said he planned to stay in Paris until the end of the
World Cup on July 12, then would be on vacation through December.
	   He said he would weigh offers from three national teams and
several clubs, but he didn't name any.
	   The Brazilian said the reason given for his dismissal their
``very high expectations _ at least to repeat what they had done in
the last World Cup, to reach the second round.''
	   Since the team failed to achieve the goal, he said, ``they have
taken the decision to cancel my contract and not to coach the Saudi
team any further.''
	   The Saudi federation, headed by Prince Faisal bin Fahd, Saudi
King Fahd's son, discussed the performance of the national team and
its early exit from the finals, the Saudi Press Agency said.
	   In its six-hour meeting, the federation decided to call
al-Khuraishi to take charge of the team in its last match against
South Africa on Wednesday. A committee also was formed to
investigate the poor showing of the players.
	   On the eve of the match against France, Prince Faisal
confidently told reporters that his country would win and move on
to the second round to match its performance in 1994.
	   ``The federation expresses its apology and sorrow for the
loving, loyal sports fans in the kingdom and the Arab and Muslim
world for failing to meet their hopes and expectations,'' the
agency quoted the federation as saying.
	   In 1994, Saudi Arabia became the only Gulf team to reach the
second round of the World Cup.
	   Parreira led Kuwait in 1982 and the United Arab Emirates in 1990
to the World Cup finals. Saudi Arabia won the Asian Cup in 1988
under him.

<TEXT>
	   SAINT ETIENNE, France (AP) _ After two solid World Cup
performances, Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert is letting
others praise his play.
	   The outspoken Chilavert, one of the world's best keepers, was
unusually modest after Friday's match against Spain, a scoreless
draw in which he snuffed four shots headed to the net.
	   ``I'm only doing what any goalkeeper is supposed to do, and that
is to make the team feel secure,'' said Chilavert, whom head coach
Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani calls his ``on-the-field coach.''
	   Against Spain, Chilavert came up big in the 19th minute when he
sent Juan Pizzi's dangerous header over the bar.
	   Four minutes later, Spain's Raul got around defender Carlos
Gamarra and blasted a low shot from 10 meters (yards).
	   But Chilavert, diving to his right, got a hand on the ball, and
the young Real Madrid forward was left shaking his head.
	   ``I've no idea how he was able to touch that ball and avoid the
goal. I think luck was on their side,'' Raul said.
	   Paraguay's next match is against Nigeria, which has advanced to
the second round as Group D winner with victories against Spain and
Bulgaria.
	   But Chilavert doesn't worry about the Nigerians' speedy and
powerful attack.
	   ``They're a difficult team, but we'll do everything in our power
to win,'' said Chilavert. Group D play ends Wednesday with Nigeria
facing Paraguay in Toulouse and Spain playing Bulgaria in Lens.

	   POTENZA, Italy (AP) _ Officials in Potenza gave city
governmental office workers Tuesday afternoon off to allow them to
watch the World Cup match beteween Italy and Austria on television.
	   A city spokesman said most employees had been asking for the
afternoon to see the match, causing a problem of adequate staff. He
said the employees will make up for the unworked afternoon hours on
one of the next game-free days.

	   PARIS (AP) _ American Esse Baharmast will referee the Group A
clash between already qualified Brazil and Norway, while Hungarian
Laszlo Vagner will get the Chile-Cameroon match in the last Group B
tilt, FIFA has announced.
	   They were the first two referees to be announced after the
initial group of 34, leaving 12 more to be named for the remaining
dozen games. FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said they were to named
Sunday night.
	   Baharmast was the on-field official for Nigeria's 3-2 victory
over Spain while refereed the 1-1 draw between Norway and Scotland.
Both matches came before FIFA president Sepp Blatter made his
comments this week saying referees had been too lenient.
	   Neither issued a red card in their games.

	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero scored three goals
and Filippo Inzaghi and Enrico Chiesa added two each as Italy
downed a local amateur team 7-1 in a warmup game Saturday.
	   The hero of the day was Sebastien Barniaud, who scored Senlis'
only goal in the second half beating third-string Italian keeper
Francesco Toldo.
	   Coach Cesare Maldini fielded mostly reserves in the match,
intended to test Del Piero, who has been recovering from a thigh
strain.
	   Christian Vieri and the others who started against Cameroon last
Wednesday watched the hour-long game from the stands, signing
autographs and following play through lenses given them by some
friendly photographers.
	   They had a training session in the morning.

Pope to beatify three Austrians, including nun beatification ceremony begins at 0730 GMT.

By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Midway through his visit, Pope John Paul
II has failed to address the increasing split between conservative
Austrian Catholics and those who want the church to become more
progressive.
	   On Sunday, the pope will beatify three Austrians, including a
nun beheaded by the Nazis, in a nationally televised ceremony on
Vienna's sweeping Heldenplatz, or Heroes' Square, where Adolf
Hitler was cheered by tens of thousands after annexing his native
Austria in 1938.
	   On Saturday, the pope held an open air Mass at St. Poelten, some
60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Vienna, and the seat of Austria's
most controversial bishop, conservative Kurt Krenn.
	   Krenn is at the center of a storm rocking the Austrian church.
Many Austrian Catholics object to the pope's conservative policies
on naming bishops, priestly celibacy and refusing to ordain women.
	   No protests disturbed the Mass, attended by some 25,000 people.
But Krenn opponents stood at the edges of the crowd, holding black
balloons and slogans such as ``Krenn, a shepherd without a flock,''
and handing out anti-Krenn leaflets.
	   Krenn has insisted on supporting Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer,
accused of sexually molesting trainee priests. Groer, another
conservative, was replaced as Archbishop of Vienna after the first
allegations surfaced in 1995.
	   This spring, Groer was sent into exile at a monastery in Germany
after the Vatican launched an inquiry into new allegations of
sexual abuse.
	   Krenn mentioned Groer by name as someone who should be included
in Catholics' prayers _ a gesture that is sure to deepen the
church's divisions.
	   John Paul did not mention Groer, or appointments in the Austrian
church. Many Austrian Catholics had hoped for some papal apology.
	   Austrians were waiting for ``that redeeming little phrase ...
`I'm sorry that I sent you many a bishop without listening to your
wishes and requirements. I'm sorry that I caused divisions in your
church,''' the main daily in Salzburg wrote in a front-page
editorial Saturday.
	   When he met with diplomats in Vienna's former Imperial Palace on
Saturday, John Paul had a strong message for the diplomats and
politicians gathered in the Hofburg palace, and Europeans beyond _
seek reconciliation with the Jews for the ``unspeakable suffering''
inflicted on them.
	   ``Don't forget the history of Europe is closely intertwined with
the history of that people from which the Lord Jesus came,'' John
Paul said. ``The Jewish people have been inflicted with unspeakable
suffering in Europe, and we can't affirm that all the roots of
these injustices have been cut.''
	   ``Reconciliation with the Jews is one of the fundamental duties
of Christians in Europe,'' John Paul said.
	   John Paul has spoken out often against anti-Semitism and the
horrors of the Holocaust, when an estimated six million Jews
perished at the hands of the Nazis.
	   But Saturday was believed to be the first time he put the burden
specifically on Europeans to make amends.
	   John Paul also noted the aspirations of the former communist
countries in Europe as the

Former appliance sales manager grabs lead in Canadian Senior Open 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ Walter Hall, a former sales manager for
a North Carolina appliance distributor, shot a 3-under-par 69
Saturday for a three-stroke lead in the dlrs 1.1 million AT-and-T
Canada Senior Open.
	   Hall completed 54 holes at 10-under-par 206, three better than
Tom Jenkins and Brian Barnes, who shared the 36-hole lead, and
Bruce Summerhays, who had a piece of the opening-day lead.
	   Barnes and Jenkins each shot 73s and Summerhays had a 71 over
the 6,942-yard (6,345-meter) Glencoe Golf and Country Club course.
	   Bobby Stroble, with a 71, was at 6-under 210, Dana Quigley shot
69 for 211 and Larry Laoretti had a 73 for 212.
	   Hall's round was highlighted by birdies on Nos. 3, 5, 14 and 16.
His only bogey came at No. 9.
	   ``I've had a real 8-to-5 job most of my adult life and so when I
turned pro and have a chance to even play with these great guys ...
I'm sort of the guy out here walking on cloud nine.''
	   ``If I play well tomorrow, someone's got to play better to beat
me,'' he said. ``I've never had a lead going into the last round of
a Senior PGA Tour event. It'll be a new experience for me.''
	   Barnes said he'd ``rather be in the position I'm in than Walter.
I have nothing to lose and Walter has got to keep it all together.
It's easier coming from my position than holding onto it. I've won
two or three times from the front, but if you don't watch it you
can very easily become negative.''
	   Barnes said the danger comes when a leader starts playing for
par.
	   ``If you let the guys come to you, then once you start that sort
of game it's easy to start making bogeys,'' Barnes said.
	   Hall, 51, from Clemmons, North Carolina, joined the tour last
year after making four unsuccessful attempts in the 1970s to
qualify for the PGA Tour. He regained his amateur status in 1980,
which he kept until 1994, when he began a bid to make the senior
tour.
	   Hall played in 1994-95 in Asia before returning to play in the
United States in 1996 on various secondary tours.
	   He was a conditional member of the senior tour in 1997,
appearing in eight events and winning dlrs 161,000. His best finish
was a third-place tie in the Bank One Classic.

World Cup: Dutch treat as entire Netherlands squad pitches in 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ It was a Dutch treat at the World Cup,
with all of the Netherlands players pitching in for a 5-0 win over
South Korea.
	   Phillip Cocu and Mark Overmars shot the Netherlands into a 2-0
halftime lead Saturday night before Dennis Bergkamp, Pierre van
Hooijdonk and Ronald de Boer added three more in the final 18
minutes to restore the Dutch team's second round hopes, and destroy
the South Koreans'.
	   With the result, the Netherlands moved to the top of Group E.
That means the team needs only a draw with Mexico to qualify for
the next round.
	   ``We had many goals and it is good to know you don't have to
depend on just one player to score goals,'' said Netherlands coach
Guus Hiddink. ``Our first goal by Cocu was an important one. It
broke the impasse, and the other players then began scoring.''
	   Hiddink's starting lineup raised a few eyebrows, with an
unexpected shuffling of positions that saw Cocu promoted to striker
from midfield, Ronald De Boer shifting to right wing and the
addition of midfielders Edgar Davids and Wim Jonk.
	   But the role swapping hardly appeared to ruffle the squad, as
the team went on to record the biggest score of the tournament, and
further whittle down South Korea's hopes for a first win in five
World Cup appearances.
	   ``Our strength is that we have 22 very good players, all very
talented with many qualities,'' said Frank de Boer, brother to
Ronald, who scored the fifth and final goal of the match.
	   The slick and speedy South Koreans caused a few problems for the
Dutch in the first half, but the Netherlands maintained control and
finally took the lead in the 38th minute when Cocu broke the ice.
	   Cocu was only promoted to the striker's role after Patrick
Kluivert's was suspended for two matches for elbowing Lorenzo
Staelens during the Dutch team's 0-0 draw with Belgium.
	   ``It was the first time in two and a half years that I played
this position,'' said Cocu. ``It was a big change but we have so
much talent on our team I was just happy to be playing all the
time.
	   ``At first I underestimated what I had to do,'' said Cocu.
``With Bergkamp not at the top of his physical level, I had to work
harder. I had to for the team, as the more time Bergkamp spent in
the pitch, the more chances we had.
	   ``I suffered for it but in the end it paid off.''
	   PSV Eindhoven midfielder Bergkamp was starting his first match
since April when he was sidelined with a hamstring injury.
	   ``At first we had difficulty scoring but we played well,'' said
Bergkamp, who is moving to Barcelona next season. ``In the end the
South Koreans went down mentally and that was the difference.''
	   Indeed, as the South Koreans appeared to give way under
pressure, most of the second-half action took place in front of Kim
Byong-ji's net.
	   ``It was very tense in the second half and I was under a lot of
pressure,'' said the South Korean netminder. ``Of course as a
goalkeeper I'm always ready to stop goals, but it was still a lot
of hard work and quite stressful.''

Jones wins 100 in start of quest for three titles with late events. AP Track Writer

By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Marion Jones, attempting a feat not
accomplished in 50 years, got off to a rousing start by winning the
women's 100 meters and long jump at the USA Track and Field
Championships.
	   Jones, trying to sweep the 100, 200 and long jump _ done only by
Stella Walsh, with the last of her four times in 1948 _ was clocked
Saturday in a sparkling 10.72 seconds in the 100 despite a slow
start and won the long jump with a wind-aided 23 feet, 8 inches
(721 centimeters), despite jumping only twice.
	   She completed her exhausting day by winning her 200 semifinal
heat in 23.46. Only she has run faster this year. The 200 final is
Sunday.
	   Jones' 100 time was the seventh fastest in history and only .01
seconds off her career best, which she ran in Friday night's
semifinals and earlier in the season. Only Florence Griffith
Joyner, the world record-holder at 10.49, has run faster than
Jones, clocking 10.70 or better four times.
	   In the 100 final Jones did not come out of the blocks quickly
and trailed early. But by 30 meters, she had surged into the lead,
then accelerated in the middle of the race and won comfortably over
Chryste Gaines, runner-up in a career-best 10.89.
	   ``I'm very excited with the time, but I thought I would run a
little faster,'' Jones said. ``But I have two more events to go
today.''
	   In the first two of those events, she produced her winning jump,
then fouled and passed her final four jumps before racing to
victory in her 200 heat, which was switched to a semifinal instead
of a quarterfinal because of the lack of entrants.
	   Jones said she was attempting the rare triple because ``to keep
myself excited about the sport, I have to set goals. Not every one
can do it.''
	   The men's 100 final became anticlimactic when Maurice Greene,
the world champion, withdrew because of stomach and leg cramps.
	   ``I'm sad,'' said Greene, who had hoped to break the world
record of 9.84. ``I'm disappointed. I had big plans for this
championship meet.
	   With Greene and 1992 Olympic bronze medalist Dennis Mitchell
also withdrawing because of a leg cramp during warmups, Tim Harden
won in a wind-aided 9.88, with Brian Lewis second at 9.98 and Tim
Montgomery third at 9.99. The wind was a strong 4.9 meters per
second, well over the allowable 2.0 meters per second for record
purposes.
	   John Godina completed the first shot put-discus double at the
nationals in 43 years by winning the shot at 71-2 3/4. For the
two-time world champion, it was his first national shot put title.
He won his second straight discus championship Friday night.
	   The last to win both was Parry O'Brien in 1955.
	   Oft-injured Mary Slaney again got hurt. The 39-year-old pulled
up with two laps remaining in the 5,000 with a tendon injury to her
lower right leg and was helped out of the stadium and treated in
the medical tent.
	   LaMark Carter won his second national triple jump title with a
leap of 57-2 3/4, the longest of his career and the longest in the
world this year.
	   Bryan Bronson, a bronze medalist in the world championships, ran
the fastest time in the world this year in the 400 hurdles, 47.81
in a semifinal heat. Derrick Adkins, the 1996 Olympic champion who
has been bothered by a hamstring injury for six weeks, finished
last in his hurdles semifinal and failed to reach the final.
	   Butch Reynolds, the world record-holder in the 400, failed to
advance to the final, finishing fifth in his semifinal heat in
45.40, more than two seconds slower than his best of 43.29.
	   Other winners included Regina Jacobs in the women's 5,000 at
15:32.31, Tisha Waller in the women's high jump at 6-4 1/4, Lance
Deal in the men's hammer throw at 256-6, and Kelly Blair-LoBounty
in the heptathlon with 6,402 points, the best by an American in
1998.

Terry Murray agrees to coach Panthers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Terry Murray will join his brother in working to
turn around the Florida Panthers, agreeing to terms to become the
NHL franchise's fourth head coach.
	   Murray, fired after leading the Philadelphia Flyers to the 1997
Stanley Cup finals, will be introduced Sunday at a news conference
at the team's new Broward County Arena, Panthers spokesman Mike
Hanson said Saturday.
	   Panthers general manager Bryan Murray coached the final 59 games
last season after firing Doug MacLean when the Panthers got off to
a 7-12-4 start. Florida finished with a 24-43-15 record, second
worst in the NHL. That came just two years after the Panthers
reached the Stanley Cup finals.
	   It will mark the second time Terry Murray has followed his
brother into an NHL coaching job. He was the choice of the
Washington Capitals after Bryan Murray was fired in January 1990.
Terry Murray led the Capitals into the conference finals for the
first time in franchise history.
	   Terry Murray has a 281-198-58 record in seven-plus seasons with
Washington and Philadelphia. He spent the past season as a Flyers
scout.

	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ The barrage of Eritrean bombs that
struck this city last week killed four people and destroyed a
desperately needed supply of grain.
	   But the attack's intended target, the Adigrat Pharmaceutical
Factory, was spared. The plant is a gleaming symbol of what
Ethiopians believe is the underlying cause of this war: Eritrea's
resentment over its neighbor's economic development.
	   Two bombs fell 300 yards (275 meters) short of the dlrs 24.5
million plant, one of the many modern factories that provide
Ethiopia's Tigray region with a measure of self-sufficiency and
deny Eritrea a traditional market for its goods.
	   Mamo Asgedom, Adigrat's manager, says the attempt to cripple or
destroy his plant comes down to one thing. ``It's jealousy.''
	   ``I believe one of their aims is to disrupt development activity
in Tigray,'' he said.
	   An Eritrean military source told The Associated Press that the
factory was targeted not to thwart Ethiopia's development but to
stop it from supplying medicines for the Ethiopian war effort and
to disrupt a staging area for the war.
	   But a Western diplomat in the Ethiopian capital supports the
theory that economics and trade are the main reasons for the war.
``The Eritreans don't want Tigray industrialized.,'' he said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Once close friends, Ethiopia and Eritrea have cut off busy trade
routes since border clashes _ ostensibly over land disputes _
erupted May 6.
	   The Eritrean ports of Assab and Massawa, until recently the sole
gateways to the sea for landlocked Ethiopia, are now closed to the
larger southern country.
	   An Ethiopian Investments Authority official described the
closing of the ports as sabotage for Ethiopian businesses, which
now must ship all goods through the smaller, less developed port of
Djibouti. For Tigray, the greater distance also means higher
transport costs.
	   On the other hand, some Eritreans accuse Ethiopia of
intentionally moving its business elsewhere.
	   Thousands from Adigrat and other poor Tigrean towns who had
migrated back and forth across the border to work before the
outbreak of fighting are now unemployed.
	   These may simply be side effects of the war. But many here see
it as the acts of a vengeful neighbor.
	   The pale blue-and-white pharmaceuticals plant and a cement plant
farther south in Mekele _ which has also been bombed by Eritrea _
were built by Ethiopian investors. It's the kind of development
that has eluded Eritrea.
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea are two of the world's poorest countries,
and Ethiopians suspect that Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki is
embarrassed that his country has not progressed as rapidly as hoped
in the five years since it gained independence from Ethiopia.
	   Eritrea denies that.
	   ``These people are talking rubbish because they want to divert
attention from their territorial ambitions,'' said Isaias' adviser
Yemane Gebremeskel.
	   ``They are trying to give this an economic twist, but it's not
true,'' he said. ``You don't make war because you're jealous.''
	   Fighting first began in the 160-square-mile
(415-square-kilometer) Yirga region along Ethiopia's northern
frontier. Eritrea claims the territory based on unclear borders
drawn when Italy occupied Eritrea in the 19th century.
	   Some outside observers say the conflict may hinge on Eritrea's
introduction last year of its own currency, the nafka, after
previously using the Ethiopian birr. The changeover has cost the
Eritrean treasury millions of dollars.
	   ``The nafka has backfired,'' said Patrick Gilkes, a London-based
expert on the Horn of Africa.
	   Whatever the motives for this war that has already claimed
hundreds of lives and has so far defied efforts at peaceful
negotiation, in Tigray, people want progress.
	   ``Whatever the circumstance, the people of Tigray are committed
to their development,'' said Mamo, the pharmaceuticals plant
manager. ``They will never give that up.''

Czech socialists win elections, fear tough coalition talks ahead 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Opposition Social Democrats,
having won the country's early parliamentary elections, know the
toughest part still awaits in upcoming coalition talks.
	   Starting Sunday, parties will be discussing possible alliances
among themselves, before the first negotiations are held with
President Vaclav Havel.
	   The president has invited the leaders of the Social Democrats,
the Civic Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party and the
Freedom Union to Prague Castle on Monday.
	   All four parties, along with the Communists, cleared the 5
percent hurdle necessary for representation in the 200-seat lower
house of parliament.
	   With 98 percent of the vote counted late Saturday, the Social
Democrats, led by Milos Zeman, had 32.4 percent _ a solid lead, but
far short of a parliamentary majority.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus was second with 27.8 percent, according to the Central
Election Committee. Final results were expected by Sunday.
	   More than 76 percent of the country's 8.09 million Czech voters
cast ballots in the elections Friday and Saturday, which were held
two years ahead of schedule after Klaus' coalition fell apart in
November 1997.
	   Zeman is expected to be the first to attempt formation of the
next government.
	   ``It will be a very difficult process,'' Zeman said in a
discussion aired on Czech television Saturday night.
	   In a bitter campaign before the election, Zeman ruled out
cooperation with Klaus' party, the Freedom Union, as well as the
Communists. That leaves the Christian Democrats as his only
coalition partner.
	   But such a two-party coalition would still fall short of a
majority needed to end political instability, a carry-over from the
1996 election.
	   Josef Lux, leader of the Christian Democrats said Saturday he
could imagine a three-party coalition led by Social Democrats, with
his party and the Freedom Union.
	   The proposal was immediately rejected by Jan Ruml, leader of the
Freedom Union, arguing his party's program was incompatible with
that of the Social Democrats.
	   Other Social Democrat leaders wasted no time in voicing their
skepticism about the difficulties in forming a majority government.
	   ``We've suffered a victory,'' said Jaroslav Basta, Zeman's
security advisor.
	   Jan Kavan, Zeman's favorite for the post of foreign minister,
summed up the situation: ``Ours is a Pyrrhic victory.''

	   WAKE DUBA, Eritrea (AP) _ Bearing flags that snapped in hot
blasts of wind, Eritreans remembered those killed in a 30-year war
for independence from Ethiopia as they again faced the same enemy
in a border conflict.
	   In an emotional display of solidarity on Martyrs' Day, more than
100,000 Eritreans on Saturday welcomed home 720 of their countrymen
who had been expelled from Ethiopia.
	   ``People are angry, they feel hurt, but at the same time there
is a sense of pride and unity,'' said presidential adviser Yemane
Gebreab.
	   Diplomatic efforts have failed to resolve the dispute between
the two neighbors, which broke out May 6 and has claimed hundreds
of lives.
	   The fighting, though ebbing, is taking place on three fronts and
still jeopardizes the stability of the Horn of Africa.
	   At dawn Saturday, thousands of people carrying wilting flowers
walked four miles (six kilometers) from the capital Asmara north to
Wake Duba to remember 130 civilians slaughtered 23 years ago by
Ethiopian troops.
	   Crouched on a rocky, thorn-covered hill, they listened to
patriotic speeches and songs paying tribute to the dead and vowed
to protect their hard-won freedom.
	   ``We have learned from experience that we must fight for our
freedom,'' said Paulos Menghistu, 53, whose parents were killed in
Wake Duba. ``Even the children are ready to fight against the
Ethiopians.''
	   It is the horrors of three decades of war, little noticed by the
outside world, that have hardened Eritreans' resolve.
	   About 65,000 Eritreans died in the fight for independence. It
ended in 1991 after Eritrean rebels helped Ethiopian rebels oust
the Marxist dictatorship of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam.
	   Eritreans voted overwhelmingly for independence in a 1993
referendum backed by Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.

	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ In power for 31 years, all but five as a
military dictator, President Gnassigbe Eyadema's campaign has
flooded state-run airwaves in hopes of extending his rule beyond
Sunday's elections.
	   Five opposing candidates were relegated occasional slices of
airtime _ an imbalance that foreign observers and opposition
parties say is typical of electoral conditions.
	   Few people doubt whether Eyadema will make it past the first
round of voting in presidential elections in this sliver of a
Francophone West African country wedged between Benin and Ghana.
	   If a candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote he
automatically becomes president. If no candidate gets 50 percent,
then the two with the most votes pass onto the second round.
	   While exiled opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio is the
best-known contender of the five, he fears for his life and lives
in neighboring Ghana. He is not expected to win the lion's share of
opposition votes.
	   Leopold Gnininvi, a university professor with wide support among
Togo's intellectual class and Yaovi Agboyibo, a lawyer with support
in the country's south, are considered the two candidates with the
best chance to face off against Eyadema in a head-to-head second
round.
	   The Washington-based National Democratic Institute said
conditions were better than in the widely-condemned 1993 elections,
but still reserved criticism.
	   ``Sufficient conditions do not yet exist to ensure a transparent
and fair democratic election on June 21,'' it said last week.
	   The group called for changes, including strict control over
voter cards and maintaining a balance of polling station officials
with different political allegiances. None of their recommendations
are believed to have been followed.
	   Eyadema was elected president in Togo's first presidential poll
in 1993, after ruling the country for 26 years as a military
dictator. His government has been accused of widespread human
rights abuses.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ As security tightened ahead of Sunday's
presidential election, the scandal-plagued ruling Liberal Party
showed surprising strength in polls.
	   Four surveys placed ruling Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa
and Conservative Party challenger Andres Pastrana nearly even.
	   Public anger with the government of President Ernesto Samper had
led most analysts to predict a Pastrana victory in Sunday's runoff,
but Serpa has surprised many with his strong showing the latest
polls. Liberal Party politicians have held the presidency for the
past 12 years.
	   The two candidates each received about 35 percent of the vote in
first round voting May 31. Independent candidate Noemi Sanin placed
a close third.
	   In a poll by the National Consulting Center, Serpa had 44
percent of the vote, compared to 43 percent for Pastrana. The
survey was based on interviews between June 15 and June 18 with
5,509 people in 100 cities and towns. It had a margin of error of
1.3 percent. The other surveys gave similar results.
	   Pastrana, 44, is a president's son and former Bogota mayor who
has run as the candidate of change. Serpa, 55, was Interior
Minister under Samper, who came under attack both at home and
abroad for alleged links to drug traffickers.
	   Also Saturday, an independent watchdog group announced that both
candidates had received hundreds of thousands of dollars from
various government contractors.
	   While not illegal, the practice encourages the corruption
endemic in Colombian politics, said Rafael Mateus, coordinator of
Citizen Watch. The group claimed that more than 70 private
contractors made contributions to the campaigns of Serpa and
Pastrana.
	   The contributions, which were nearly evenly distributed between
the two, came from companies who do business with the government
ranging from road construction firms to television stations and
amounted to more than dlrs 1 million, according to the group.
	   ``It is not right that a state contractor finance a candidate
that in the end will represent that contractor's interests,''
Mateus told The Associated Press in an interview.
	   Whoever wins the election will inherit a guerrilla war that has
reached new depths of violence in recent months, with paramilitary
massacres of civilians, political assassinations and rebels who
control huge swaths of territory.
	   However, in recent days the rebels have staged relatively few
attacks compared to previous elections. They did burn at least 12
buses and kidnap three election officials in rural areas since
Thursday, police said.
	   Police said the rebels also burned ballots in the town of
Planadas, 140 miles southwest of the capital Bogota.
	   The government is dispatching more than 200,000 policemen and
soldiers to ensure peaceful balloting. A ``dry law'' prohibiting
the sale of alcoholic beverages took effect Friday evening.
	   During the first round of elections held May 31, guerrillas
burned electoral materials, detained two journalists and 18
electoral officials and carried out attacks resulting in 10 deaths.

Troubled Japanese credit bank in merger talks: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., a major Tokyo-based
commercial lender, has begun talks about a possible merger with a
troubled credit bank in the latest sign of restructuring in the
Japanese financial industry, a local newspaper reported Sunday.
	   No final decision has been made yet, but a merger between
Dai-Ichi Kangyo and the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. would
create Japan's second-largest bank after the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., the Asahi newspaper said.
	   Stock in the Long-Term Credit Bank lost about 40 percent of its
value last week on rumors _ which company management denied _ that
the bank was struggling to stay afloat.
	   Dai-Ichi Kangyo is the Long-Term Credit Bank's largest single
shareholder, owning about 3.6 percent of its stock.
	   Separately, the Mainichi newspaper reported Sunday that Japanese
financial authorities are considering a plan to transform the
private Long-Term Credit Bank into a state-funded repository
designed to absorb bad loans from across the banking sector.
	   Hobbled by dlrs billions in bad loans resulting from the
collapse of a speculative real estate bubble earlier this decade,
Japan's banking industry has only begun to be been shaken out of
complacency.
	   In May, the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. announced a tie-up
with top Japanese brokerage house Nomura Securities Co. Last
November, leading commercial lender Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd.
failed due to its massive bad loan burden.

Hollway plays down dollar drop 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympics chief executive Sandy
Hollway said Sunday the drop in the Australian dollar had not
rocked the Games but admitted that the organizing committee is
reviewing its finances.
	   Hollway was responding to a newspaper report last week which
said the Australian dollar _ now around the US 62 cent mark _ and
Asian economic crisis were threatening the scale of the Olympics.
	   The report also said the New South Wales state government faced
the prospect of cutting the Games budget or asking taxpayers to
meet any shortfall.
	   ``The Olympics are not rocked by the dollar crisis . . . what I
talked about was possible developments in the external environment
which could affect us potentially,'' said Hollway, head of the
Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG).
	   ``I was not alarmed by those developments, it was just a matter
of keeping a watchful eye on them. There is no way the reforecast
of SOCOG's financial position will lead SOCOG to make any call
whatsoever on taxpayers of New South Wales. We have a keen
understanding of the need to live within our means.''
	   Hollway said a decision to review SOCOG's financial position was
not related to the Asian crisis, but ``simply good management
practice'' at this stage of the committee's preparations. (djp)

One Nation makes Asian Australians feel ``unwelcome:'' Howard 
</HEADLINE>
By ALAN THORNHILL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia, (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said Sunday that he will not endorse the One Nation party in
upcoming elections, saying the anti-immigration party has made some
Asian immigrants feel they are unwelcome in Australia.
	   ``No party should behave in a way that makes any group in
Australia feel unwelcome,'' Howard said in a television interview.
	   Howard said he will put the name of the One Nation candidate
last on the voting ticket he recommends, sending a strong signal to
his conservative Liberal party that all branches should do
likewise.
	   The ruling Liberal-National coalition has been agonizing over
where the place One Nation on its how-to-vote cards since the party
won about 23 percent of the vote at a June 13 state election.
	   Australia's preferential voting system requires all major
parties to list candidates from other groups in a descending order
of preference, to give their own candidates the best chance of
victory.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has been criticized as racist
for claiming Australia is in danger of being ``swamped by Asians''
and opposing immigration. She also opposes special welfare benefits
for Aborigines and advocates protectionist economics.
	   Howard has previously been criticized for refusing to say where
One Nation should be listed on the Liberal party's how-to-vote
cards.
	   The prime minister said Australia has ``some bigots,'' but that
overall it is a racially tolerant country that has nothing to
apologize for.
	   ``Sure, we have some bigots, all countries do. But compared with
countries elsewhere, we are a shining example and it is about time
we were more assertive about that,'' he said.
	   The Queensland Liberal party gave its preferences to One Nation
in the recent state elections, a decision which helped One Nation
win at least nine seats in the 89-seat legislature.

Qantas Airways on track for good performance, says CEO 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. will
likely match its 1996-97 profit in the current business year and
has hit its target of cost savings of U.S. dlrs 310 million for
1997-98, company chief executive James Strong said Sunday.
	   ``Our chairman said at the half year that we believed we would
at least equal last year's profit and obviously we have said
nothing to change that,'' Strong said on the Australia's ``Business
Sunday'' television program.
	   Qantas made about U.S. dlrs 151 million last year in net profit.
	   Strong said further cuts to routes to Asian destinations might
occur if the regional economic situation continued to deteriorate,
but said some routes were showing signs of stabilizing.
	   In two weeks, the company is expected to announce which routes
to Europe and Britain will be assigned further capacity to offset
the drop in business to Asia.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ French police tightened security for
Sunday's Iran-U.S. World Cup match, but Iranian and American soccer
fans were putting politics aside and enjoying themselves.
	   Feri Eftekhari, a London surgeon in a white truck full of Iran
T-shirts, handed them out to anyone, Americans included, who wanted
to join the party.
	   ``Nothing but sports could do this,'' he said, looking at a
Rhone River bridge where U.S. and Iranian flags snapped
side-by-side in the wind. ``Governments want to make something
political of this match, but it is only about people getting
along.''
	   American fans shared his sentiments.
	   Douglas Logan, a New Yorker who is commissioner of Major League
Soccer, alighted from a special train Saturday with 350 Americans
in subdued dress. Except for the odd American flag hat, they might
have coming to sample Lyon's fabled restaurants.
	   ``I think too much has been made of the political aspects,''
Logan said. ``There is enough pressure already on these kids. This
is an athletic event.''
	   But French police were taking no chances. Discreet
reinforcements were ready in case of demonstrations. About a half
million Iranians live in Europe within easy driving distance of
Lyon. Other organizations might also seize the occasion.
	   On Saturday, 50 members of the Association for Women's Rights
Against Fundamentalism marched through downtown. They paused every
few minutes to lie in the street and cover themselves with black
chadors to protest what they said was tyranny in Iran.
	   But despite the bitter rivalry between their governments,
American and Iranian fans were in a relaxed mood before a game that
might take the winner past the first World Cup round.
	   Saied Nili, a telecommunications consultant with U.S. West in
England, unloaded the car that brought him and three other Iranians
to town. He laughed at the suggestion of disturbances.
	   ``If you want trouble, you'll have to go see the English, or the
Dutch, one of those civilized European countries,'' he said.
``We'll give you carnival.''
	   His friend, who preferred to be named only as Feridoon, added,
``It'll be very friendly. What the two governments couldn't do in
10 years, the two nations will fix.''
	   James Appleby, a 33-year-old Washington, D.C., pharmacist and
self-confessed soccer addict, echoed that thought.
	   ``It's unfair to the team to put such pressure on them,'' he
said. ``Their careers are at stake. If they do well, they'll get
contracts with European clubs. We should keep politics out of it.''
	   For most Iranians, the important thing was less the opponent
than the fact that they were there at all. They were the last to
qualify, squeaking past Australia, for their first World Cup
competition since 1978.
	   ``This gives the world a chance to see another side of Iran, and
it gives us a chance to get together,'' Dr. Eftekhari said.
Iranians were coming from as far away as Australia.
	   ``We're scattered around the world,'' he said. ``This is when we
can get together, sing a song, and have some love for each other.''
	   Farzin Hashemi, president of an umbrella group called the
International Council of Resistance of Iran, took the occasion to
condemn the Islamic leadership in Iran.
	   ``The huge crowds of people waving flags will be supporting the
players and the team and their culture, not the government,''
Hashemi said. ``It is important to make that distinction.''
	   Leaders in Tehran wanted badly to win, he added, but in the end
it is only a soccer game. ``The concept that this is like ping-pong
diplomacy with China is just an illusion. Change can only come from
within Iran.''
	   The Lyonnais, an easy-going sort of Frenchmen who inhabit
France's second city, were not rattled. ``Things should be fine,''
shrugged Andre Rannaud, a waiter at Le Regent Cafe, with large
glass windows overlooking the Place Bellecour, where fans will
party. ``It's a sporting event.''
