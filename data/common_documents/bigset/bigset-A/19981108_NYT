MITCHELL BIDS GOODBYE IN STYLE  
 SENIOR RECEIVER HAS CAREER DAY FOR SUN DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Kenny Mitchell insists he doesn't wish he could
do it all over again or at least find one more season somewhere. He
says he's happy with his four years at Arizona State, satisfied
that he contributed to the program.
</P>
<P>
   That's his story, anyway, and the senior wide receiver is
sticking to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here and playing and having the career I did, it was
good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other opinions, however, differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wish I had him back one more year,'' receivers coach
Robin Pflugrad said Saturday after Mitchell caught four passes for
a career-best 169 yards and two touchdowns in ASU's 55-22 victory
over California at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more year, and all I could say is, `Wow,' with a capital
W,'' Pflugrad said.
</P>
<P>
   For Mitchell, a Peoria High School graduate, it was the final
home game of a career that began with great promise, turned
inconsistent and is ending with a flourish. With two regular-season
games left, Mitchell has 25 receptions, four fewer than in 1997.
His 512 yards already exceeds last year (429), and his six
touchdowns is two more than his first three seasons combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``He struggled the first couple of years, but he handled it
well,'' said Lenzie Jackson, another senior receiver and a close
friend. ``Most people would have hung it up, been down on
themselves. But he worked hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell and quarterback Ryan Kealy combined on a 79-yard pass
play, the longest for each, in the second quarter. The 6-foot-4,
202-pound Mitchell beat cornerback Derrick Gardner short, shook off
a hit from safety Marquis Smith along the sideline, managed to stay
in bounds and then outran everyone else to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had stepped out of bounds,'' Mitchell said. ``But
the ref was right there, and he was like, `No, hey, keep going.' So
I just kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   That put ASU up, 14-10, and the Sun Devils kept right on going,
taking all sorts of liberties with what statistically was the No. 2
defense in the Pac-10. Mitchell's 19-yard touchdown pass at the end
of the third quarter made it 45-22.
</P>
<P>
   The play bore no relation to the outcome, but once again
Mitchell's skills flashed in neon.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking his route short because he noticed Smith playing
so far back, Mitchell took reserve quarterback Steve Campbell's
5-yard flip, faked Smith so decisively that he fell flat on his
back, and scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   It was mining this sort of thing from Mitchell that proved to be
``a very fun challenge, but still a challenge,'' Pflugrad said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of redshirting, Mitchell and Jackson were pressed into
service as freshmen in 1995.Jackson was the more dependable
receiver right away.
</P>
<P>
   Not always the most diligent practice player, Mitchell needed to
hone his pass routes. He needed to learn to get his arms up to
catch the high pass and to control his long strides and be quicker
on breaks.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny, Creig (Spann), Lenzie, I can't tell you how well
they've practiced,'' Pflugrad said. ``Every single day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was focused on the game and what it meant (keeping
alive the Sun Devils bowl hopes). But just before kickoff, when
other seniors and his father were on the field, he realized the
added meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really feels good to win a game like this and make plays,''
he said. ``This is the last time I'm ever going to be here.'' &QL;

ANY BETS ON ASU IN LAS VEGAS BOWL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Arizona State would make an attractive
participant in the Las Vegas Bowl because the Nevada city already
is a popular destination of Valley residents, a bowl spokesman said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas Bowl, scheduled for Dec. 19, pairs an at-large
team with the Western Athletic Conference's No. 2 or No. 3 team.
Oregon was awarded the at-large berth last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really happy with our relationship with the Pac-10 and
their response to us,'' said  &UR; Monica Guinn, a member of the Las
Vegas Bowl selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   Guinn attended the game and said she was scouting ASU and
California.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 Sun Devils need one more win to be eligible for a bowl.
The Pac-10 has spots in the Rose Bowl, unless the league winner
plays for the national title, Sun Bowl, Holiday Bowl, Aloha Bowl
and Mele Kalikimaka Bowl. &QL; 
Tap dancing &QL; 
As concern grew for  &UR; J.R. Redmond's ankle during the week, Coach
 &UR; Bruce &UR; Snyder turned to freshman  &UR; Justin Taplin and told him to be
ready to be replace Redmond as the kick and punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, coach,'' Taplin said. ``You won't even know he's
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Taplin meant no disrespect toward Redmond. He is just confident
in his ability.
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. He returned five punts for 73 yards and four
kickoffs for 106, including his longest for 41, against California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be on the field, play any way I can,'' Taplin
said earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are considering having him practice as a
defensive back because of a shortage of players in that area. &QL; 
Honor bound &QL; 
Six former athletes were inducted into the ASU Hall of Fame before
Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jeff Van Raaphorst, the MVP of the 1987 Rose Bowl and the Sun
Devils' radio analyst, was the football program's lone
representative. Also inducted was former men's basketball standout
 &UR; Verl Heap, the great-uncle of ASU freshman tight end  &UR; Todd Heap.
</P>
<P>
   Others inducted were NCAA champion swimmer  &UR; Andy Astbury
(1979-83), Olympic medalist discus thrower  &UR; Leslie Deniz (1981-83),
four-time All-American golfer  &UR; Billy Mayfair and All-American
baseball player
 &UR; Fred Nelson (1967-68). &QL; 
End of the road &QL; 
Sixteen seniors played in their final home game.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the offense were quarterback  &UR; Steve Campbell, tight
end
 &UR; Matt Cercone, right tackle  &UR; Troy Davis, wide receiver  &UR; Lenzie
Jackson, center  &UR; Randy Leaphart, wide receiver  &UR; Kenny Mitchell,
fullback  &UR; Jeff
 &UR; Paulk, center  &UR; Grey Ruegamer, wide receiver  &UR; Creig Spann and
offensive lineman  &UR; Brian Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the defense were defensive lineman  &UR; Albrey Battle,
linebacker  &UR; Joe Cesta, defensive tackle  &UR; Derrick Ford, free safety
 &UR; Mitchell Freedman and defensive ends  &UR; Leroy Hawkins and  &UR; Seanan
Kelly. &QL; 
Quick hits &QL; 
The Sun Devils, No. 2 in the Pac-10 in penalties, didn't commit one
until 8:25 minutes remained in the second quarter. There were no
penalties committed by either team in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's five interceptions were the most since Nov. 8, 1986, when
it had the same number against the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils' 31 second-quarter points were their most in a
quarter since Nov. 14, 1975, when ASU scored 34 against Pacific. &QL;

   JUVENILE
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey's picture-book ride helped get favorite Answer
Lively home first in the Juvenile, but just barely.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey rated Answer Lively behind two dueling pacesetters, then
opened a daylight lead into the long Churchill Downs stretch. The
2-year-old colt, owned by John Franks of Shreveport, La., and
trained by Bobby Barnett, went all out to hold off 70-1 long shot
Aly's Alley by a head. Cat Thief, one of five starters trained by
D. Wayne Lukas, finished a close third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry deserves all the credit,'' Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Answer Lively raced once at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie,
running fifth in the July 19 Middleground Stakes. He is now the
leading contender for an Eclipse Award as champion 2-year-old.
JUVENILE FILLIES
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert's magic at Churchill Downs extends to the Breeders'
Cup as well.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who has trained the last two Kentucky Derby winners,
saddled Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting to a one-two finish
in the Juvenile Fillies. Silverbulletday's impressive move around
the second turn under Gary Stevens helped her defeat her stablemate
by a half-length.
</P>
<P>
   At 4-5 odds, Silverbulletday, owned by Mike Pegram, was the
heaviest favorite on the Breeders' Cup program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't win this one,'' cracked Baffert, ``I would've had
to do the low crawl out of here.'' SPRINT
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Wally Dollase lost a potential Breeders' Cup winner last
week when Sharp Cat had to be pulled from the Distaff, but his son
Craig picked up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Reraise ran hard from start to finish for a two-length victory
in the Sprint over long shots Grand Slam and Kona Gold, making
27-year-old Craig Dollase the youngest trainer to win a Breeders'
Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   Reraise, supplemented into the race at a cost of $120,000, was
the third consecutive Sprint winner ridden by Corey Nakatani,
Craig's brother-in-law. MILE
</P>
<P>
   Running for the second time in two years, 6-year-old gelding Da
Hoss registered an 11-1 upset in the Mile and became the third
horse to win the race twice.
</P>
<P>
   Da Hoss, owned by Art, Jack and J. R. Preston of Houston, won
the 1996 Mile at Woodbine, then was beset with a variety of
ailments that nearly resulted in his retirement. But trainer
Michael Dickinson persevered, and in the most remarkable training
job in Breeders' Cup history, had Da Hoss at peak form.
</P>
<P>
   The first Cup victory for jockey John Velasquez, Da Hoss took
command in midstretch, was passed nearing the wire by Hawksley
Hill, and surged again to claim victory by a head. DISTAFF
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Jerry Bailey chose to ride Banshee Breeze instead
of Escena in the Distaff. Had he waited another week, he might have
gone the other way.
</P>
<P>
   The scratch of Sharp Cat last weekend meant Escena had an
uncontested early lead in the Distaff, and that was just enough to
get her and substitute rider Gary Stevens to the wire a diminishing
nose in front of oncoming odds-on favorite Banshee Breeze.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth Breeders' Cup trophy for owner Allen Paulson
and trainer Bill Mott, who won the Distaff last year with Ajina,
and the sixth for Stevens. TURF
</P>
<P>
   They had pint-sized Buck's Boy in their sights the whole
mile-and-a-half of the Turf, but couldn't run him down.
</P>
<P>
   The first Illinois-bred ever to win a Breeders' Cup race led the
field through a leisurely pace, then outsprinted Yagli in the
stretch for a 1 1/4-length victory under Shane Sellers.
</P>
<P>
   A strong European contingent _ including seventh-place favorite
Royal Anthem _ was never a factor. As a result, 1998 became the
only year a foreign horse failed to crack the top three in a
Breeders' Cup grass race.

AGGIES' DEFENSE WRECKS SOONERS IN 29-0 VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The way the Wrecking Crew dominated
Oklahoma's inept offense last night at Kyle Field, Texas A&AMP;M could
have beaten the Sooners with a wide receiver playing quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the seventh-ranked Aggies did _ for a few
plays anyway.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M flanker Chris Taylor took three inconsequential snaps out of
a shotgun formation as Aggies coach R.C. Slocum continued a season
trend of sleight of hand. But once again the Wrecking Crew was
dominant in an Aggies victory, this a 29-0 shutout of the Sooners,
and backup quarterback Branndon Stewart directed the offense to
three touchdowns and 355 yards total offense against an Oklahoma
defense ranked eighth nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' ninth consecutive victory, their longest string
without a loss since 1993, boosted their record to 9-1 and kept
them atop the Big 12 South Division at 6-0 with games remaining
against Missouri and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The victory also proved to be an apt present on Slocum's 54th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players gave me a birthday cake during the pregame meal. I
told them I expected my gift to be a win and they came through,''
Slocum said. ``I thought our defense controlled the game from the
outset.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's defense held the Sooners without a first down and to 17
yards total offense in the first half. The defense also set up
Russell Bynum's career-long 43-yard field goal in the third quarter
when linebacker Dat Nguyen caused and recovered a fumble. A&AMP;M
permitted Oklahoma a mere 124 yards total offense, an average of
less than 2.3 yards a play.
</P>
<P>
   The Wrecking Crew has not surrendered a touchdown since the
second quarter of a 17-10 victory against Texas Tech _ a string of
10 quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have something special going,'' said cornerback
Jason Webster, who intercepted a pass and scored the game's initial
touchdown _ the first of his career _ on a 55-yard punt return.
</P>
<P>
   Sooners quarterback Jake Sills, in the second start of his young
career, agreed with Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a great defense,'' Sills said. ``We couldn't get
anything going.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart made his first start since the fourth game of the season
as Randy McCown rested a bruised right shoulder. Stewart threw for
two touchdowns and ran for another. He completed 15 of 23 passes
for 234 yards and threw touchdown passes of 24 and 47 yards to
split end Chris Cole, who caught five passes for 118 yards. Stewart
scored midway of the fourth quarter from the 6-yard line to cap a
66-yard drive, the Aggies' longest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I was fortunate on a couple of occasions,''
Stewart said. ``I had a fumble I got back on and had some great
catches by receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing is just going week by week and trying to get
better and preparing as if \RI\S was going to start. I take pride
in doing that. A lot of times guys who are backups sit back and
become complacent and don't care if they know \Rthe game plan\S or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum repeatedly has praised Stewart's focused preparation
since he came in and finished last week's 17-6 victory against
Oklahoma State, throwing a 34-yard touchdown on his first snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought \RStewart\S was great,'' Slocum said. ``I'm really
proud of him. I was not surprised. We were South Zone champions
with him last year.''
Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen yesterday was selected as one of four finalists for the
Lombardi Award. The other finalists: Wisconsin offensive tackle
Aaron Gibson, Georgia offensive tackle Matt Stinchcomb and Ohio
State linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer ... After being listed as
doubtful all week, running back Dante Hall (stinger) and Sirr
Parker (hamstring) both played. Hall carried 18 times for 70 yards,
Parker had four carries for 6 yards. ... The shutout was the first
for A&AMP;M in a Big 12 game, and the 124 yards total offense were the
fewest allowed since North Texas gained 70 yards in the third game
of 1996.

COMMONS PROJECT CREATES CIVIC CORE

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ Santa Monica developer Rick Caruso has built
shopping centers around Southern California that have brought sales
tax dollars and prestige to each neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's going to find out if he can build a city.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, Caruso will open his latest shopping center,
The Commons at Calabasas, in the city's 67-acre Park Centre. And
The Commons, Calabasas officials said, could well be the
cornerstone for a city center that the sprawling west Los Angeles
County community has never had.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the City Council approved a master plan for The
Commons in October 1997, Calabasas City Manager Charles Cate called
it ``a good springboard'' for the rest of the Park Centre project
to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than a year later, he hasn't changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say this is going to be the engine that drives the
remaining development of the property,'' Cate said. ``It's clearly
the cornerstone for development of the remainder of the property.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor James Bozajian agrees, though he emphasizes that the
development won't happen overnight. But when it's done, the Park
Centre's shopping center, hotel, offices and civic center will
comprise the integrated mini-downtown Calabasas has never really
had.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the city's charming Old Town area can fill that role,
Bozajian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really have a larger center where citizens can go and
shop, enjoy entertainment and eat. Everything is sort of spread
out,'' Bozajian said. ``We wanted to have a center that would be a
larger, more attractive center for people who live in Calabasas to
enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Caruso himself said that Caruso Affiliated Holdings Inc.'s
22-acre, 200,000-square-foot The Commons is intended to meet
upper-middle class families' complete shopping and entertainment
needs.
</P>
<P>
   And with its lakes, fountains, sculptures and outdoor seating,
the Commons _ which was designed to resemble a Tuscan village _ is
meant as more than just a shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want you to spend your afternoon here; we want you to spend
your evening here,'' Caruso said. ``We want you to come here for no
other reason than just to hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   The center is expected to generate $400,000 to $450,000 in sales
tax revenues for the city each year, Cate said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials think that The Commons could benefit Calabasas in
other ways; for example, by helping to revitalize the Old Town.
</P>
<P>
   After The Commons opens, the city will run an old-fashioned
trolley between the center and Old Town on weekends to encourage
interaction between the two, Cate said. The trolley will run for
three months on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be residual effects because of all the people who
will be coming there who didn't know what was in the Old Town,''
Cate said. ``We think that will help provide an economic boost to
Old Town Calabasas.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, several projects were proposed for the Park
Centre site that, for various reasons, didn't materialize. About
nine years ago _ before the city's April 5, 1991, incorporation _
Los Angeles County had approved an approximately
1.5-million-square-foot office project that included some retail.
</P>
<P>
   That plan, however, met with considerable opposition from area
residents who objected to its density.
</P>
<P>
   It has since evolved to where it is now _ a 750,000-square-foot
mixed center with retail, a hotel, office space and a civic center
that will include a City Hall and library.
</P>
<P>
   The whole Park Centre project is intended to create a sense of
place for the city, Cate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's creating a mini-downtown area, if you will, that in
effect is becoming the downtown of Calabasas,'' Cate said. ``We
really don't have a downtown other than the Old Town.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commons is the first project to be built at the Park Centre,
but others are online. So far, Atlanta-based Homestead Village Inc.
has been granted city entitlements to build a 150-room hotel on a
parcel it owns in the Park Centre. El Segundo-based Kilroy Realty
Corp. is expected to receive its entitlements for an office project
later this year, Cate said.
</P>
<P>
   The entire site had been owned by Kilroy, which sold it off to
Caruso and Homestead, but retained ownership of a parcel for its
own project, according to Cate.
</P>
<P>
   As for the proposed civic center, the city expects to complete a
final purchase and sale agreement for up to 4{ acres by the end of
the year, Cate said.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel proposal is seen as a clear sign it's not just city
officials who view Park Centre as a potential city center.
Homestead owns a parcel in the Park Centre, but plans are not yet
set on when a hotel will open, company spokeswoman Charlotte Wood
said.
</P>
<P>
   The national chain, she said, caters to business travelers on
extended stays and typically locates its hotels in close proximity
to retail, restaurants and area services that the guests would
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do take that into consideration as far as site livability
and we typically build in areas of high business concentration,''
Wood said.

MAJOR AIR ATTACK LIFTS TEXAS OVER OKLAHOMA STATE

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For once, the role of Texas hero fell to someone
other than Heisman Trophy candidate Ricky Williams during the
Longhorns' six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   But a freshman quarterback and sophomore kicker proved to be
adequate stand-ins for the star of the show, allowing the Longhorns
to escape with a 37-34 victory against Oklahoma State on a dreary,
drizzly day at Royal-Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The new guys even picked up on Williams' flair for the dramatic.
Quarterback Major Applewhite threw for a school-record 408 yards
and three touchdowns. Kicker Kris Stockton banked the game-winning,
29-yard field goal off the left upright with three seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit it very well, but I got lucky,'' Stockton said.
``I'm glad the goal post was wet. Maybe that helped it slide
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton's kick allowed the 20th-ranked Longhorns (7-2, 5-1) to
breathe a collective sigh of relief after the curtain fell on a day
when Williams, the nation's leading rusher, was limited to 90 yards
on 23 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ugly baby, but we're still going to love it and take
it home,'' said Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese in assessing
a triumph that ended any bowl hopes for Oklahoma State (3-6, 2-5)
and kept the Longhorns in the Big 12 South Division race.
</P>
<P>
   Texas trails No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M (9-1, 6-0) by one game in the
league standings. If both teams win next week, they will meet in a
winner-take-all battle for the South title Nov. 27 in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of that season-ending contest stood in doubt as
Oklahoma State rebounded from deficits of 7-0, 21-7 and 31-21
behind an opportunistic offense and a gambling, blitzing defense
that packed nine men near the line of scrimmage in an effort to
stop Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys never led. Their best chance evaporated when Texas'
Cedric Woodard blocked an extra-point attempt after Tony Lindsay's
55-yard touchdown pass to Ethan Howell. The touchdown strike marked
the second for Lindsay (9-of-19, 236 yards) and tied the score
34-34 with 10:25 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   It was still that way when the Longhorns began their final drive
with 3:52 remaining. Williams, limited to 41 yards to that point,
carried six times for 49 yards on Texas' game-winning, 71-yard
march.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest play proved to be a pass by Applewhite
(29-of-40) aimed in the direction of wide receiver Wane McGarity
(nine catches, 125 yards). Oklahoma State cornerback Marcus Jones
was flagged for pass interference, allowing Texas to convert a
third-and-two situation and move the ball to the Cowboys' 17.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Stockton caromed home the deciding kick. Now,
the big decision may be up to Heisman voters to judge Williams'
effort on a day when he caught three passes for 74 yards and a
touchdown but was held below 100 rushing yards for the second time
in his past 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' struggles left him 203 yards behind Tony Dorsett's
NCAA career rushing mark (6,082 yards). Asked if a 90-yard day
might hurt his Heisman hopes, Williams said: ``If that's all the
voters notice, that's a shame. I think I really helped the team win
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Williams threw several telling blocks against blitzing
linebackers, and his receiving total was a season high. Applewhite,
who completed seven passes of longer than 20 yards (including two
for touchdowns), said he could not have picked apart the Cowboys'
defense without Williams' help as a blocker, receiver and decoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured there would be one game where a team sold out to
stop the run and forced me to throw to win it,'' said Applewhite,
who is 6-1 as a starter. ``This team did that. We kept checking off
and hurting them with passes, but they never backed off.''

UCLA DODGES DISASTER AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ The public address announcer gave the catch to
Danny Farmer, but there was no mistaking UCLA's latest hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was open, and I wanted to make sure I looked it in,''
receiver Brad Melsby said of his 61-yard touchdown catch with 21
seconds remaining, which gave the Bruins a 41-34 victory over
Oregon State before 26,017 Saturday at Parker Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The play capped a wild final sequence in which the Bruins took a
three-point lead with 1:17 left on Chris Sailer's 30-yard field
goal, then watched it disappear 46 seconds later on Jose Cortez'
28-yard kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers tried an ill-advised pooch kick, giving UCLA
possession at its 39. On the first play, quarterback Cade McNown
found Melsby down the right sideline for the most improbable play
since . . . since Stanford's fumble last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not going for a small chunk, we were going for a
chunk,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said of the pass to Melsby. ``It was
a three-level pass, with deep, intermediate and short routes. Brad
ran past the (cornerback).''
</P>
<P>
   The latest episode in UCLA's season on the edge featured the
usual characters and plot turns: porous defense, wild momentum
swings, trick plays, fourth-quarter heroics and a slew of big plays
by McNown, who passed for 377 yards and four touchdowns and
directed the Bruins to 24 points in the final 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (8-0, 6-0) covered the emotional spectrum as they
shuffled to their locker room. Athletic director Peter Dalis shook
his head in amazement. Cornerback Jason Bell let out a massive,
echoing sigh of relief. Offensive coordinator Al Borges joked,
``They keep getting easier,'' and showed his laminated play sheet _
on which he had scripted UCLA's overtime plays.
</P>
<P>
   They were that close.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``God must be with us,'' kicker Chris Sailer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who won their 18th consecutive game, now need one
victory _ either Saturday in Seattle, or Nov. 21 against USC _ to
clinch the Pac-10 title and a Rose Bowl berth. Their sights are
higher, of course: the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But to get there, they must solve several ongoing problems.
Oregon State's modest offense not only gained 491 yards, but moved
the ball at will in the second half (286 yards) against a UCLA
defense that seems to regress each week. Saturday, the Bruins made
OSU's reserve tailback, Jason Dandridge, look like the Pac-10's
best runner. He gained 130 yards and averaged eight yards per
carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up way too many big plays,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's kicking game remains troublesome, as well. Sailer had
another field goal blocked, and Oregon State gained 206 yards in
kickoff returns. The Bruins continually kicked to Beavers speedster
Tim Alexander, and almost paid for it with their season.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's 38-yard return, combined with Tod McBride's late-hit
penalty, helped Oregon State tie the game on Cortez' field goal
with 33 seconds left. But as Borges scripted his overtime plays,
McNown hit Melsby. The Bruins celebrated, then stuffed Oregon
State's last chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through this the last four weeks, and it's
nerve-racking,'' fullback Durell Price said. ``But championship
teams know deep down they're going to win. You have to deal with
adversity and just know you're going to come out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers opened the third-quarter with an impressive
nine-play touchdown drive. They mixed their runs and passes
effectively, gaining yards each time. On second down at UCLA's 40,
quarterback Jonathan Smith hit James Battle, who burned Ryan Roques
on a 38-yard completion. Tailback Ken Simonton scored from the 1,
and the Beavers had pulled even at 17-17.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's offense sputtered, as McNown threw behind Brian
Poli-Dixon on third down, and the resurgent Beavers gained
possession at their 35. After two passes to Alexander, they were at
midfield. With the Bruins staggering, OSU shifted to its ground
game. Dandridge ran twice _ busting the second around left end for
a 33-yard touchdown run. Suddenly, the Beavers led 24-17.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing play, Farmer bobbled a long pass from McNown and
OSU's Armon Hatcher snatched it from midair. This time, though,
UCLA's defense held its ground, forcing the Beavers to punt after
three plays.
</P>
<P>
   Given a second chance, McNown pounced. He rolled left, spotted
open field, then broke two tackles and raced 30 yards to OSU's 33.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, McNown pitched right to Jermaine Lewis, drifted
into the left flat, then caught a return pass from Lewis. The
Bruins had practiced the trick play for weeks, and it worked as
designed. McNown ran 22 yards to the Beavers 4, then hit Farmer for
on a touchdown pass that tied the game 24-24 late in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   McNown saved his best pass of the game for the fourth quarter,
rolling right and hitting Farmer for 14 yards on third-and-9. He
ran the option for 9 yards, then pitched left to Lewis for a
first-down run.
</P>
<P>
   At OSU's 43, McNown hit Farmer on a 20-yard post pattern. Farmer
turned it into more when he broke Andrae Holland's tackle and raced
into the end zone for the go-ahead touchdown.

WINNERS, LOSERS SHARE SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a good day for all you California fans, because five of
the seven Breeders' Cup races were won by horses who have raced
here.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day for all you European fans, because the fearsome
foreign forces failed to win a single Breeders' Cup race for the
first time in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it goes in the parimutuel world of the racetrack,
whether it's Churchill Downs or Santa Anita, whether it's a
multimillion-dollar Saturday or a quiet weekday: If it's a good day
for somebody, it's got to be a bad day for somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for friendly young California trainer Craig
Dollase, whose first major victory with front-running Reraise in
the Breeders' Cup Sprint earned him a place alongside Bob Baffert,
Bill Mott, Patrick Byrne and Michael Dickinson, acknowledged
masters of the trade who also won races on the big day.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day for kindly old New York trainer Sonny Hine, who
watched the retiring Skip Away finish out of the money in the
Breeders' Cup Classic and fail to earn a place in history as
racing's first $10 million horse.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for Santa Anita management, as fans in Arcadia
and the satellites bet $20.2 million on the Breeders' Cup
simulcasts and seven live races, the sixth highest single-day
handle in track history.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day for Hollywood Park management, as track
chairman R.D. Hubbard put up $800,000 to make Gentlemen a
supplemental entry in the Breeders' Cup Classic only to watch the
horse finish an eased-up last and fail to collect a penny.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good race-watching day early, when four of the first
five races were undecided until the final strides.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad race-watching day late, when Awesome Again's
victory spoiled the Skip Away-Silver Charm showdown and made this a
disappointing Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for John Franks, the Louisiana horse owner who
has won the annual Eclipse Award four times but hadn't won a
Breeders' Cup race until Answer Lively captured the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day for Bobby Frankel, the Hall of Fame trainer who
is 0 for 29 in Breeders' Cups after a couple more near-misses, and
Alex Solis, the leading Santa Anita jockey who is 0 for 27 after
riding Hawksley Hill to a photo-finish loss to Da Hoss in the
Breeders' Cup Mile.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for former quarterhorse trainers Baffert,
whose Silverbulletday won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, and
Bobby Barnett, whose Answer Lively won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day for former quarterhorse trainer D. Wayne Lukas,
who entered five horses in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and hit the
board with one of them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for Breeders' Cup Ltd., which guaranteed a $5
million pool for the pick-six and, against widespread pessimism,
watched fans across the country wager a whopping $6.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day for NBC, whose Breeders' Cup telecast featured
even more pointless commentary, jarring visual cuts and audio
glitches than usual.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for jockey Gary Stevens, whose victories
aboard Silverbulletday in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and
Escena in the Breeders' Cup Distaff made him the afternoon's only
multiple winner.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day for jockey Frankie Dettori, whose failure to
switch his whip to the right hand allowed Swain to drift so far out
approaching the finish of the Breeders' Cup Classic that the
English horse posed a greater threat to rail-hugging fans than to
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day if you love a star search, because after
Answer Lively's photo-finish victory over the 76-1 long shot in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile, it appears the next Kentucky Derby winner
is still waiting to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day if you love a star, because the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile really could have used Worldly Manner, the Del Mar
Futurity winner who headed overseas after being sold for $5 million
to an Arab sheikh.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for Steve Klein, who was the only one of the
Daily Racing Form's dozen handicappers to pick Reraise in the
Breeders' Cup Sprint, and Jay Privman, who was the only one to pick
Buck's Boy in the Breeders' Cup Turf.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day for Joe Hirsch, who proved that experience is
of limited value, being the only Racing Form handicapper to fail to
pick a winner despite recently celebrating 50 years of covering
racing.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it was on a lively morning and afternoon at the
track.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day to be part of.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day to miss. &QL;

USC CLAIMS DATE FOR HOLIDAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD _ As the last seconds ticked away Saturday, USC's
future finally became something more than idle speculation or
unattainable goals.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in three years, the Trojans grasped a
tangible reward for their on-field efforts: a bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   A 34-9 victory over lowly Stanford before 43,250 at Stanford
Stadium might not seem overly important, but it cured a lot of woes
that have afflicted the program for two years. Namely, it ended a
drought that had seen the Trojans take the past two Decembers off.
</P>
<P>
   With seven victories, USC (7-3, 5-2) is officially eligible for
a bowl game, a significant fact for the majority of Trojans
players, who have never played in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Even the seniors, who remember the 1996 Rose Bowl as their last
taste of postseason play, were jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was in the back of everyone's minds,'' cornerback
Daylon McCutcheon said. ``This is where 'SC should be. I expected
to go to a bowl game every year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't dawn on me until right at the end of the game. I
haven't been to a bowl in three years,'' added teammate Billy
Miller. ``I'm excited. We accomplished a big goal.''
</P>
<P>
   For securing the bowl bid, the Trojans can thank their defense,
which shut down Stanford's offense like no other Cardinal opponent
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's offense scored just seven points, with the other two
coming on a safety. USC limited Stanford to 166 yards passing,
after the Cardinal had tallied 754 in its previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford quarterback Todd Husak was intercepted once, fumbled
twice and was generally harassed into submission. He had a
season-low 39 yards passing at halftime and finished with only 138.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main thing that needs to be said was that our
defense was a dominant force in the game,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said. ``That's clearly the story of the game. Our defense was
challenged and our guys continued to respond. I'm so excited with
the development of the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense even produced as many points as Stanford's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Zeke Moreno stripped the ball from Husak in the
second quarter, and defensive tackle Aaron Williams picked it up
and ran 18 yards for a touchdown that gave USC its first
comfortable lead, 17-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a defensive lineman's dream come true,'' Williams said.
``All I could think was `Scoop and score.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's only fitting that the defense was responsible for the
victory, since it has been forced to carry the Trojans so often
this season. They were so adept at stopping Stanford (1-8, 0-6)
that Hackett admitted he became overly conservative offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the guilty party,'' Hackett said. ``I was in error. I
tightened up when I saw the defense played well.''
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't help that wide receiver R. Jay Soward severely
sprained his right ankle, placing his status for the UCLA game in
two weeks in doubt. Soward returned the opening kickoff 36 yards
and then caught a 22-yard pass on the first series, when he twisted
his ankle as he was pulled to the ground by free safety Simba
Hodari.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just rolled it,'' Soward said. ``I'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   X-rays were negative, but no one was guessing whether he would
be available in two weeks. The Trojans have a bye this week.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Soward, freshman quarterback Carson Palmer
continued to roll right along, completing 19 of 26 passes for 203
yards and one touchdown. It was the second straight game Palmer
played all four quarters, as former starter Mike Van Raaphorst
stayed on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Palmer played ``OK,'' but his teammates were more
effusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the quarterback change has been huge,'' linebacker
Chris Claiborne said. ``The kid is coming in and slinging the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the defense's inspired play, Palmer's presence has
boosted the Trojans' confidence. Even with the magical seventh win,
Claiborne talked about raising the bar now that the bowl bid is
wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just closes another chapter in my career, going to a
bowl,'' Claiborne said. ``It's cool, but 7-5 isn't good enough if
we can finish up 9-3. I would hate to go to a bowl game if they
take us just because we won seven games.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett also tried to downplay the significance of the bowl bid,
coming dangerously close to talking again about the Trojans' chance
of going to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of ramifications to what happened today,''
Hackett said. ``At 6-2 (in the Pac-10), we have a chance to share
the conference championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Merely going to a bowl, ``that's not our biggest concern,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it? The players certainly were talking about it coming
off the field, and it seemed to be the reason so many were smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people told us this week that this game doesn't mean
anything, because Stanford was in last place,'' Miller said. ``But
it was important. We haven't been to a bowl game in so long. I'm a
senior. I can't come back next year. This is all I've
got.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

`GROWING UP'  
 ARIZONA STATE PLAYS AS POLLSTERS PRE DICTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The only close shave Saturday occurred in
Courtney Jackson's apartment, because what transpired at Sun Devil
Stadium was a good old-fashioned blowout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the team everybody talked about before the season,''
wide receiver Lenzie Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   If not, call it a reasonable facsimile. The Sun Devils put on
their best performance of the season in a 55-22 homecoming victory
over California and find themselves in the hunt for a bowl berth.
The win in front of 64,973 was particularly impressive because it
occurred without quarterback Ryan Kealy for the second half and
tailback J.R. Redmond for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can finally get rid of this beard,'' ASU cornerback Courtney
Jackson said. ``I had a bet that I'd grow it until we got a win
``and'' I got an interception. It's been a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had two of ASU's five interceptions and tipped a third
to teammate Christon Rance.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger story was the effort of several seniors playing
in their final home game. Their contributions mean ASU needs to win
one of its remaining two games _ at Oregon and Arizona _ to be
eligible for postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Steve Campbell's effort captured the Sun Devils'
performance. Late in the second quarter, starter Ryan Kealy hobbled
off the field and said, ``My knee feels funny.'' When ASU started
the second half, Campbell was the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He completed 7 of 11 passes for 106 yards and three touchdowns.
The Sun Devils, behind a 31-point second quarter, had a 31-10
halftime lead and outscored the Golden Bears, 24-12, in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came to the huddle, you could see the fire in his
eyes,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   When Kealy sat out most of practice Wednesday with an injured
finger, Campbell took the majority of snaps. He found it odd, but
he didn't want to question ASU Coach Bruce Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want him to tell me it meant nothing and spoil it,''
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he replaced Kealy, who suffered a sprained knee,
with Campbell instead of Chad Elliott Saturday for several reasons:
Campbell's weekly preparation impressed him, and it was the
senior's last home game. When Campbell got on a roll, Snyder
thought, ``Let's ride this through.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy's status for the Oregon game is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils also played without Redmond, who is nursing a
sprained ankle and didn't make a convincing enough argument in
pregame warm-ups. Snyder said he considered using Redmond for
returns, but freshman Justin Taplin stepped in and did the job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the injuries, ASU (5-4 overall, 4-2 Pac-10) rolled up 55
points against a California team (5-4, 3-3) that had not given up
more than 31 points in a game this season and had a defense ranked
No. 2 in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a great job of hanging together,'' Snyder said.
``They're growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   And while ASU's defense was dominating _ besides the five
interceptions, Cal was successful on just 2 of 12 third-down
conversions _ it came against an offense ranked last in the Pac-10.
It was ASU's offense that served up an eye-opening performance.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Kenny Mitchell had four receptions for 169 yards and
touchdowns of 19 and 79 yards. If the NFL scouts didn't notice him
before, they are now.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Lenzie Jackson had four catches for 73 yards and a
touchdown. One reception he grabbed over the Bears' Deltha O'Neal,
a childhood friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him before the game I'd catch one deep on him,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils got two touchdowns runs from Davaren Hightower,
who split time with Gerald Green and had 17 carries for 52 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Sun Devils) are starting to get their groove,''
California Coach Tom Holmoe said. ``They just exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what ASU did in the second quarter. After the
Bears took a 7-0 lead early on a Justin Vedder 43-yard pass to
Marcus Fields, the Sun Devils roared back with 31 second-quarter
points to take a 31-10 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's momentum carried over into the second half because the Sun
Devils were able to exploit California's top-ranked secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is amazing,'' Campbell said. ``Hollywood couldn't have
written a better script.''

BRUINS' MELSBY COMES THROUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ It never bothered Brad Melsby that he lost his
starting job. Nor did it bother him that when he did play, the ball
rarely came his way.
</P>
<P>
   Melsby, who missed virtually all of the last two seasons
recovering from a severe knee injury and emotional distress related
to it, found solace in a well-executed block or a well-run route.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in his words, just happy to be playing football again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, so are the rest of the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   The junior receiver caught his first touchdown pass in nearly
three years Saturday and it couldn't have been bigger: a 61-yard
streak down the sideline with 21 seconds to play that gave UCLA a
41-34 victory over Oregon State before a raucous crowd of 26,017 at
Parker Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such an unselfish person,'' said UCLA coach Bob Toledo.
``I told him afterward that he deserved to have good things happen
to him. He just comes out every day and does what he's supposed to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA has a more dramatic play this season _ a distinct
possibility with this bunch _ it's hard to imagine it coming from a
more unlikely guy.
</P>
<P>
   Even the P.A. announcer was baffled. He announced that Danny
Farmer had caught the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Melsby, whose speed might be generously described as average,
had caught seven passes this season for 69 yards, barely more than
his one catch netted Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked afterward if he'd had any deep balls thrown to him, Melsby
answered with a smile: ``Maybe one or two _ by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, after Jose Cortez' 28-yard field goal tied the score for
Oregon State with 31 seconds left, had the ball at its 39.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Poli-Dixon, Farmer and Melsby were lined up to the right
of quarterback Cade McNown. Melsby and Poli-Dixon were supposed to
run deep to clear out the space underneath for Farmer. Holland left
his man for Farmer and McNown spotted Melsby all alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was wide open,'' said Melsby. ``I just wanted to make
sure I caught the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   When he did, about the 15-yard line, and ran into the end zone
untouched, Melsby was jumped on by several teammates. He quickly
shooed them away and got back to the bench, saying he didn't want
to get a penalty for excessive celebration.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't about to get flagged moments later, when he was
surrounded by a half-dozen reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to help us win anyway I can,'' Melsby said.
</P>
<P>
   This was no watershed moment for Melsby. He caught two TD passes
as a true freshman in the Aloha Bowl but left the team for more
than two months last year, despondent over his slow recovery from
knee surgery that caused him to miss the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed at the start of the season not to be too hard on
himself and to enjoy each practice and each play. His roommate of
more than three years, tackle Kris Farris, says somewhere deep down
Melsby is thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most clutch catch of the season,'' Farris said.
``If he's not excited, he's not human. I don't care if he doesn't
catch another ball while he's here, he might have caught a ball
that wins a national championship. I wish I could say that.''

USC TURNS TO ITS DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD _ Another week, another win for the USC defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to be a trend, huh?,'' USC safety Rashard Cook
said Saturday after the Trojans clinched bowl eligibility with a
34-9 victory at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   This week featured the ongoing maturation of freshman
quarterback Carson Palmer, the loss of deep threat R. Jay Soward to
an early ankle injury, Adam Abrams snapping his slump with two
field goals and another game filled with USC penalties.
</P>
<P>
   But when the game ended and the analyses began, the win, which
improved USC's record to 7-3, belonged to the defense. And the USC
offense noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single week they step up,'' USC wide receiver Billy
Miller said. ``They do so much for this team. You bet we appreciate
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford entered Saturday's game with the Pacific-10's leading
pass offense and plenty of momentum. In three previous games, the
Cardinal averaged 448 yards of offense with all but 64 of that
coming through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a top-notch offense,'' said USC coach Paul Hackett,
whose team limited Stanford to 221 yards on 75 plays. ``The main
thing that needs to be said is that our defense, from the very
beginning, made a statement about controlling the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step of the control came by concentrating on
quarterback Todd Husak. It turned out to be a miserable day for
Husak, who completed 18 of 33 passes for 138 yards with a
first-quarter touchdown, one interception, three sacks and two lost
fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating for me to come out like that _ my play was
inexcusable,'' said Husak, who was 8 of 17 for 39 yards in the
first half. ``If I had played the first two quarters the way I
played the third, we could have been in position to win. I take a
lot of credit for the loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of Husak's mistakes made life easy for the USC offense.
</P>
<P>
   The first _ an overthrown ball intercepted by Daylon McCutcheon
and returned 39 yards to the Cardinal 17-yard line _ set up a
37-yard field goal by Abrams in the first quarter. Midway through
the second quarter Husak fumbled after being sacked by Zeke Moreno
and defensive lineman Aaron Williams scooped up the ball and
rambled 18 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a defensive lineman's dream come true,'' said Williams.
``The ball was on the ground and all I could think was scoop and
score.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a fourth-year junior, also created a second-half score
when he stripped the ball from Husak and recovered 11 yards away
from the end zone. Two plays later, Palmer, who finished 19 of 26
for 203 yards, whistled an 8-yard scoring pass to Windrell Hayes
and the Trojans led 27-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we score or we set up a score,'' Cook said. ``That's
the goal every game. When we do that, we do our job.''
</P>
<P>
   That job may have become more important on Saturday when Soward
badly twisted his right ankle after a 22-yard gain on the game's
third play from scrimmage. It is believed to be just a sprain, but
Soward's availability is questionable for the Trojans
regular-season-ending rivalries against UCLA and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is we are playing better and better each week,''
McCutcheon said. ``That, to me, is the mark of a great defense. Now
we have to go out and make more plays.''

CATS NOTCH ANOTHER WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - For Arizona, the countdown is at nine.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine Arizona victories after a 41-7 victory over
Washington State Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   A possible nine in the national polls awaits.
</P>
<P>
   Nine equals fine.
</P>
<P>
   In any math.
</P>
<P>
   At any time.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's improbable season reached a height that a few months
ago would have been a laughable proposition. The only nine
associated with the Wildcats in preseason included a couple of
other digits, as in 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud to be 9-1,'' Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said. ``But
we try to take these things one at a time. The numbers don't do it
for me. I'm more impressed by winning the turnover battle and the
way guys hit and hustle.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is the promise of one number even Tomey could not
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Ten.
</P>
<P>
   It has a nice, round sound to it. No. 10 Arizona can add it to
the ledger for only the second time in its history next week at
California.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, ten was just impossible to figure. The preseason
portrayal was of one era giving way to another. It was supposed to
be the end of Tomey and the start of a new chapter in Arizona
football.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits were half right. There's a new chapter, but it is
inextricably linked to the other 11 in Tomey's tenure as Wildcats
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Will an unprecedented 11 victories and Rose Bowl appearance be
the story of Chapter 12? That is anybody's guess, which is another
way of trying to explain the BCS, otherwise known as the Bowl
Championship Series. The format for the complicated rating reads
like the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   It's boring and baffling.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, nothing like Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the BCS fine print and contingencies surrounding
the Rose Bowl, there is less and less doubt about the 1998
Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   They've been unpredictable, unconventional, and other than UCLA,
unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats show got even a little bit better in front of a
homecoming crowd of 47,761 at Arizona Stadium against an
overmatched Washington State, which has fallen from last season's
Rose Bowl perch to the bottom of the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Arizona (5-1 Pac-10) resorted to the dramatic. Big
plays are a habit for these Wildcats, who also were No. 10 in the
BCS before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Trung Canidate got the encore started. The junior running back
from Central High School exploded for two touchdowns in the opening
quarter, the first for 75 yards and the second for 45.
</P>
<P>
   On the second, Canidate blew through a huge hole created by
crushing blocks, called pancakes in football parlance. Washington
State (3-6, 0-6) got a double helping, one from Yusuf Scott and the
other from Makao Freitas.
</P>
<P>
   When Canidate caught his breath at the end of the first quarter,
he had 140 yards, or 40 fewer than last week's 180 against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   It's not obvious from the one-sided score, but Arizona trailed
early.
</P>
<P>
   After a drive on Arizona's opening possession stalled and Mark
McDonaldkicked a 39-yard field goal for a 3-0 Wildcats lead, the
Cougars struck.
</P>
<P>
   It took two plays by Washington State and at least a couple of
broken tackles from Arizona for the Cougars to deliver what proved
to be a wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   First, Cougars running back Kevin Brown broke loose for a
43-yard run. Other than white lines and green grass, there was
nothing between Brown and the end zone. But Brown tripped nearly 35
yards from the goal-line.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be a momentary delay. On the next play, Leaf
Hackett caught a 35-yard pass from Paul Mencke for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's response was more than an adjustment. It was an
assault. First, there was Canidate, who had 169 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was an ever improving defense. Washington State
never scored again. Wildcats defenders did. Chris McAlister picked
off a tipped pass and raced 60 yards for a touchdown late in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona would score 17 more points on a 35-yard field goal by
McDonald and two touchdowns by Kelvin Eafon on runs 1 and 8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But, by then, it was over. An exceptional ninth was already part
of an exceptional season. &QL;

UA QUIETLY BUILDS BEST PAC-10 DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Arizona's defense doesn't carry a cute nickname
like their ``Desert Swarm'' counterparts of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And who would have thought there would be a season when the UA
defense would be overshadowed by the offense?
</P>
<P>
   But even without a nickname or a lot of attention, the Wildcats
quietly have developed the Pac-10 Conference's best defense, which
is just as important as Arizona's quick-strike offense to a 9-1
record and a top-10 national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the Desert Storm of the past, but we're at the point
where we're trying to get back to that level,'' cornerback Chris
McAlister said. ``We've got a lot of young players who know that
tradition, and we're trying to establish that again.''
</P>
<P>
   McAlister would get little argument from the Washington State
Cougars, who turned the ball over five times and had a punt blocked
by the Wildcats as Arizona thrashed the Cougars, 41-7, on Saturday
night at Arizona Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday night's game, the Wildcats ranked first in
the Pac-10 in total defense, rushing defense and _ most important _
scoring defense. They were rated second in the league in pass
defense.
</P>
<P>
   And the Wildcats didn't do anything to hurt their statistics
against the Cougars, while also making big plays to contribute to
an explosive UA offense.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest came from McAlister, who intercepted his fourth pass
of the season and returned it 60 yards to score. He became one of
five players in the NCAA to have return a punt, a kickoff and an
interception for touchdowns in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was mostly lucky,'' McAlister said. ``The ball just went
right through the hands (of receiver Nian Taylor), and I was in the
right place at the right time. But I'm proud of everybody stepping
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than a stunningly quick two-play, 83-yard Washington State
scoring drive in the second quarter, the Cougars were relatively
quiet offensively. But they picked up three consecutive first downs
in a third-quarter drive, prompting associate head coach Duane
Akina to burn a timeout for a little chat.
</P>
<P>
   Akina gathered the defense around, shoved up his sleeves and let
it rip. Coach Dick Tomey listened briefly, then walked away to let
Akina have his say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think anybody should score against us,'' defensive
end Joe Tafoya said. ``He told us they weren't going to score
against us, and he told us the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Akina was right. Although the Cougars hit a big pass play right
after the timeout, Tafoya stripped the ball a moment later from
Washington State receiver Jerry Roquemore, and defensive back Greg
Payne Jr. recovered for the Wildcats at their own 15.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cougars knocking on the door again in the fourth
quarter, safety Rich LaChaux intercepted at his own 1-yard line and
went 99 yards for what appeared to be a touchdown. It was brought
back to the 20, but the Wildcats went on to drive for their final
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had made some adjustments at halftime, and we weren't
getting them done,'' Akina said. ``I wasn't worried about the pass
plays. A squad like that is going to hit some passes on you. I was
more concerned about the running game.'' &QL;

McNOWN MAKES PLAYS IN CLUTCH 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ UCLA quarterback Cade McNown does not tell
himself, ``It's time for me to make a big play,'' because he feels
that would compromise the team's execution and performance.
</P>
<P>
   It must be subconscious, then, because McNown's big plays
stopped being a coincidence 18 victories ago.
</P>
<P>
   McNown threw for 377 yards and four touchdowns Saturday in
UCLA's 41-34 victory over Oregon State. But he was at his best when
the Bruins were at their most desperate, trailing 24-17 late in the
third quarter _ submitting his best case yet for the Heisman Trophy
by guiding the Bruins to 24 points in the final 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not have a great game, but when it's crunch time, he's
the man we call on, and he delivers,'' fullback Durell Price said.
``He puts the team on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, McNown completed 8-of-12 passes for two
touchdowns and 189 yards. He used his arm, his hands and his legs,
beginning with a 30-yard run that sparked the first of three
touchdown drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never look to run, I just take what the defense gives,'' he
said. ``When they're in man-to-man coverage, sometimes I can hit
the crease. But it's not something I look to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, McNown caught a pass from tailback Jermaine
Lewis and ran 22 yards to Oregon State's 4. It set up the tying
touchdown _ a short throw to Danny Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth quarter, McNown struck again. On
third-and-9, he made perhaps his best throw of the game, rollng
right and throwing right _ across his body _ to Farmer on the
sideline for 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, he connected with Farmer on a 43-yard
touchdown pass that gave UCLA a 31-24 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets to be crunch time, he makes big plays,'' coach
Bob Toledo said. ``He made big plays again today.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown later drove the Bruins 53 yards in eight plays to set up
Chris Sailer's 30-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   But he saved his best play for last: the 61-yard pass to Brad
Melsby with 21 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to move the ball, '' he said. ``The backs and
line were able to hold the protection, and I found Brad. I read it
as I see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final seconds, you never know. You hope to get a crease
in there. You hope they make a mistake.''

USC WIN PROVES COSTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD _ The fact USC has a bye this week proved fortunate,
and it has nothing to do with the Trojans getting an extra week to
prepare for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   USC's 34-9 victory over Stanford came at a cost, as wide
receiver R. Jay Soward and tight end Lonnie Ford suffered sprained
ankles that could jeopardize their availability for the UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   Both players had X-rays Saturday during the game, which proved
negative. But they were each limping noticeably, and Soward briefly
used crutches on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly severe ankle sprain,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said of Soward's injury. ``I thought he was going to have a great
night. The biggest thing we have to do is get the team healthy and
fresh to play UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Daylon McCutcheon also aggravated his bruised hip,
and had to be helped off the field at halftime, but returned in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to rest at all. I'm going to play,'' McCutcheon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties, penalties: USC continued to distinguish itself as the
Pac-10's most-penalized team, with 10 for 117 yards against
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It continues to frustrate me to death,'' Hackett said. ``I'm
just terribly disappointed. I'm not happy at all about it. I'm at
my wit's end.''
</P>
<P>
   No hard feelings: Although USC threw a 27-yard pass on fourth
down with a little more than a minute remaining, and scored a
touchdown with 15 seconds left instead of taking a knee, Stanford
refused to accuse the Trojans of running up the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make the plays, all the way to the end,'' Cardinal
linebacker Donnie Spragan said. ``The game lasts an hour. I'm not
mad at them for doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams rebounds: Kicker Adam Abrams, who nearly lost his job
last week, was 2 for 2 on field goals, hitting 37- and 40-yard
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Big win: USC's 25-point margin of victory was the Trojans'
largest at Stanford Stadium since it won 54-7 in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Super visit: Hackett had breakfast Saturday morning with Joe
Montana, whom he coached with the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas
City Chiefs. This was Hackett's first visit to Stanford Stadium
since the 1985 Super Bowl, when he was an assistant coach with
49ers in their victory over the Miami Dolphins.

OHIO STATE LOSS HELPS BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ The news shocked everyone in Parker Stadium
except the people it affected most.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA learned of No.1 Ohio State's loss to Michigan State late in
the first quarter and they did not flinch, much less celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't say, `Yea, they lost,' because we know we're in
control of our own destiny,'' fullback Durell Price said. ``If
we're 11-0, we deserve to be in the Fiesta Bowl, and we'll be
there. It didn't matter that Ohio State lost, because we still had
to beat Oregon State.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes' stunning defeat has massive repercussions in the
Bowl Championship Series race.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are three unbeatens with a realistic chance for the
Fiesta Bowl: UCLA, Kansas State and Tennessee. The Bruins were
third in last week's BCS rankings _ behind Ohio State and Tennessee
_ and they'll probably be No. 2 when the new poll is announced
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back in the driver's seat,'' Bruins receiver Brian
Poli-Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   But as they celebrated a 41-34 victory over Oregon State, the
Bruins seemed to care as little about the BCS poll this weekend as
they did last week, or two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care one way or another,'' quarterback Cade McNown
said. ``Whether we're No. 5 or No. 1, it doesn't matter until the
dust settles.''
</P>
<P>
   Down and out: Poli-Dixon had a career-high nine catches, many
coming on short outs and hitch patterns in front of the defensive
backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, we haven't run many hitches all season,
this season or last season,'' he said. ``It seems like they were
giving us the hitch, but we really didn't have a game plan for it.
It was just open. They didn't do anything to prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the time: Kicker Chris Sailer said the Beavers did
exactly as he hoped by calling a timeout before his 30-yard field
goal with the score tied 31-31 and 1:17 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy,'' he said. ``It gave me time to get set. I kicked
well in practice, I'm feeling healthy and it was just a matter of
putting it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Trick for a treat: The Bruins practiced this week's trick play
for two weeks and waited for just the right time to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 24-17, with second down at OSU's 26, offensive
coordinator Al Borges gave the signal: McNown pitched right to
Jermaine Lewis, who passed to McNown on the left side. He ran 22
yards to the 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was four yards too wide,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``We were
supposed to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Short stuff: DeShaun Foster's touchdown gave him six for the
season, a school record for true freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Brad Melsby and tight end Ryan Neufeld had their first
touchdown catches of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ryan Roques led UCLA with 13 tackles, but several
came when he was trailing receivers after the catch.

KINGS LOSE TO STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Besieged by injuries all season and still
accustoming themselves to the concept of life without Rob Blake for
two months, the Kings had to be wondering what else could go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It took them only eight seconds to find out Saturday night _ the
amount of time it took them allow a goal, the earliest they've ever
allowed a goal in a game in their checkered 32-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Kings was that they rallied to make a game
of it. The bad news was that in the end, it wasn't enough to avoid
a 4-3 loss before a crowd of 13,329 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one good thing about it,'' said coach Larry Robinson,
whose team scored more than two goals in a game for only the fourth
time in its first 13 games. ``We were able to come back and play
the way we wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a loss, a setback that extended the Kings' winless
streak to four games, all on a four-game home stand that is
mercifully over. The Kings (4-6-3) have just one victory in their
first six home games. The Stars (7-2-2) are 7-0-6 against the Kings
in the last 13 meetings between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   The main culprit, as it so often has been in the Kings' recent
history, was the power play. It went 1 for 6, producing a
first-period Luc Robitaille goal with a two-man advantage but
failing twice in the third period when the Kings were trying
desperately to overcome their one-goal deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best news for the Kings was that No.1 center Jozef
Stumpel, who has missed the last nine games with a hip-flexor
strain, will accompany the team when it flies to Vancouver for
Monday night's game against the Canucks. Stumpel may play Tuesday
at Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   But that was of little consolation early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings fell behind off the opening faceoff, with plenty of
mental errors to go around. Robinson blamed Tony Hrkac's goal on
mistakes by Josh Green and Garry Galley and a goaltending miscue by
Manny Legace. Philippe Boucher, whose pass behind the net took a
strange carom off the boards and landed on Hrkac's stick, blamed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew coming into the game, we needed a good start,''
Boucher said. ``It was a bad start, and I'll take the blame for
that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hrkac scored from a sharp angle, his shot banking off Legace's
stick and between his right leg and the goal post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a letdown,'' Legace said of allowing the quick
goal. ``I was so nervous, looking at their lineup, seeing Brett
Hull and Mike Modano. I was nervous. That took all the nervousness
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings did respond well to the sudden deficit. Vladimir
Tsyplakov tied the score at 15:11 off a nifty pass from Green, and
Robitaille gave the Kings the lead with his team-high sixth goal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars roared back with three second-period goals, two on
the power play, the first of those by Hull after an extremely
questionable interference penalty on Russ Courtnall.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, interference is called when a player checks
someone who doesn't have the puck. But when Courtnall attempted a
hip check on Modano, the puck was in Modano's skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad call,'' Courtnall said. ``He clearly had the
puck. It was the wrong call, and it ended up costing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad luck contributed to Hull's tying goal as Steve Duchesne
attempted to clear the puck down the ice from behind his net.
Instead, his clearing shot hit teammate Nathan LaFayette directly
in front of Legace and landed on the stick of Hull, the last person
the Kings would have selected to receive such a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, Derian Hatcher gave Dallas the lead with a
quick, accurate shot from the high slot that beat Legace, who
appeared to be screened by Boucher. Little more than one minute
after that, Legace stopped Guy Carbonneau on a 2-on-1, but Boucher
and Dallas' Grant Marshall collided with the rebound and the puck
skittered into the net, Marshall receiving credit for the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are going bad, you don't get bounces your way,''
Robinson said. ``You can hang your head in frustration. But you've
got to keep working at it. We've made some good strides.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was one of the livelier efforts for the Kings during
their dreary start to the season. They cut the deficit to a goal
early in the third period on Glen Murray's fourth goal, but could
not penetrate the tough Dallas defense for the equalizer.

NORTHRIDGE TAKES OVER BIG SKY LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ The announcement came with seven minutes
remaining in the second quarter, and the news was significant for
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   It was Eastern Washington 31, Montana State 24.
</P>
<P>
   To those following the Big Sky Conference, it was the most
anticipated announcement of the game.
</P>
<P>
   So when Cal State Northridge left North Campus Stadium with a
32-28, cling-for-your-life win against Portland State, it meant the
Matadors were again on top in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard everyone cheering, but I didn't know what happened,''
CSUN quarterback Marcus Brady said. ``I was like, `What's going
on?' We were in the middle of a play. But now I know we're on
top.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a plateau with great meaning in the Division I-AA playoff
picture.
</P>
<P>
   A win at Idaho State in two weeks ensures CSUN (6-3, 5-2 Big
Sky) at least a share of the conference title. If Montana State
wins out, the Bobcats would earn the Big Sky's automatic berth and
CSUN would be listed second as far as playoff consideration is
concerned. That, too, is important. Since the playoff format
expanded to 16 teams in 1986, the Big Sky runner-up has been
invited every year.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Montana, which hosts Montana State in the season
finale, wins its remaining two games, it would tie CSUN for first.
In that case the Matadors, with a win at Idaho State, would hold
the tiebreaker and grab the conference's automatic bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for the Griz to get the Bobcats,'' CSUN
coach Ron Ponciano said. ``It looks like if we can beat Idaho State
we're going to be co-champions, and that would be special.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, which plays an important nonconference game next week at
Southwest Missouri State, got to its current slot by beating the
hottest, and arguably most talented, team in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Portland State (5-4, 4-3) had its four-game winning streak
snapped, but not without some wacky plays and loads of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost was the play in which CSUN defensive lineman
Shambay Jones intercepted a pass after it ricocheted off the foot
of running back Derrick Brame. Jones returned it to the Vikings' 7
before running back Melvin Blue scored from the 3 on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Portland State quarterback Tyson Parsons (15 of
26, 1789 yards) threw what appeared to be an incomplete pass to
Cheo Angel. But after Angel rolled over, CSUN safety Vito Clemente
scooped up the loose ball and returned it to the 3.
</P>
<P>
   And on second down Marcus Brady connected with Drew Hill (9
catches, 68 yards) for a 4-yard touchdown. CSUN scored 26 straight
points, including 14 in the final 1:31 of the first half, to build
a 32-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half we were out there taking stuff and in the
second half we got complacent,'' said Matadors receiver Aaron
Arnold, who caught eight passes. ``In the second half, we put it on
the defense's shoulders. It came down to that for us, which it
shouldn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Portland State, which averaged nearly 42 points per game
during its winning streak, countered with a feverish rally.
</P>
<P>
   Super back Charles Dunn, who gained just 37 yards in the first
half, exploded in the second and finished with 167 yards on 26
carries. He scored on a 39-yard run on Portland State's first
possession of the second half and added a 5-yard touchdown run with
2:06 left in the third quarter to cut CSUN's lead to 32-27.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Matadors offense generating very little yardage in
the second half, the Vikings embarked on a journey.
</P>
<P>
   After being pinned on their own 4-yard line with 14:46 to play,
Dunn ran the Vikings out of a hole and into scoring position. His
11-yard run put the ball inside CSUN's 10 with eight minutes left
before linebacker Shayne Blakey made the defensive play that was
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   On first down, Blakey shot through the middle of the line and
stopped Dunn in his tracks. Defensive end Brennen Swanson followed
that with a sack of Parsons as the drive stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were picking us apart,'' said Clemente, who also had an
interception as the Matadors forced four turnovers. ``I don't know
what it was, but then Blakey had that big hit. I don't know what
changed, but we should play like that all the time.''

STARS' VICTORY ISN'T BY THE NUMBERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The numbers said the Stars had to win last night.
</P>
<P>
   They had not lost to the Los Angeles Kings for 12 consecutive
games, they set a franchise record by scoring eight seconds into
the game and they beat the best penalty-killing team in the NHL for
two power-play goals _ 50 percent of what they had yielded in the
previous 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the injury-riddled Kings were without captain Rob
Blake (broken foot) and their top two goalies.
</P>
<P>
   But as dominating as the statistics and odds might have been,
the Stars had to hold on for a 4-3 victory against the Kings before
13,329 at the Great Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars took their first road victory in four games as the
visitor this season and moved their unbeaten streak over the Kings
to 13 game (7-0-6). They also pushed their record to 7-2-2, good
for an NHL-best 16 points. But in doing so they squeezed 16 shots
into a 10-minute span in the second period. Otherwise, they were on
their heels for most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly the consistent 60-minute performance Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock was looking for. But Hitchcock and his players said
they weren't unhappy with the uneven, penalty-filled game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still part of the game we have to work on, being
consistent for 60 minutes,'' defenseman Craig Ludwig said. ``We
have done this before, but we're winning and working on our
problems. That's the good thing. We have 70 more games to continue
to work on the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hrkac showed no rust from a three-game layoff of healthy
scratches. The veteran center scored eight seconds into the game
when he converted a turnover by Kings defenseman Phillipe Boucher
into a shot that caught Kings goalie Manny Legace by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both their D-men went behind the net and the puck just came to
me,'' Hrkac said. ``I saw an opening and just fired it.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal was the quickest ever in Stars history and the fastest
given up by the Kings. It also gave the Stars what seemed like
instant retribution for a 4-0 loss Wednesday to the San Jose
Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of building on the gift, the Stars again shifted
into neutral and allowed the Kings to outshoot them in the period,
11-3, and take a 2-1 lead. The Stars were whistled for retaliation
penalties three times as the duo of Ian Laperriere and Eric Lacroix
targeted Mike Modano and the usually quiet Modano answered with
cross check and a boarding penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' power play, worst in the NHL and missing quarterback
Blake, finally broke through when Modano handed them a
five-on-three at the 18:12 mark, It took just 14 seconds for Luc
Robitaille to score on a one-timer from the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   That goal added to an earlier score by Vladimir Tysplakov gave
the Kings a 2-1 lead and hopes of beating the Stars for the first
time in their past 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars followed their least offensive period (three
shots) this season with their most offensive period _ 16 shots in
the first 10 minutes of the second period that resulted in three
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of four power-play chances, the Stars scored
twice with the man advantage. Brett Hull got his fourth goal of the
season when he took advantage of another Kings turnover to tie the
game at the 3:55 mark of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Derian Hatcher then scored his first on the season, converting a
perfect feed from Jamie Langenbrunner on the power play at the 8:25
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an inconsistent game, but it was an inconsistent game
because of all the penalties,'' Hatcher said. ``We haven't won on
the road and we had a pretty poor performance against San Jose, so
this was a game we wanted to win. We want to win them all, but this
was a game we were put a lot of focus into.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Marshall picked up a key insurance goal 69 seconds later
as he shoveled in a rebound for what proved to be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Kings winger Glen Murray beat Belfour on a 30-foot wrister at
the 1:33 mark of the third period and the Stars sat on their 4-3
cushion for the rest of the period, firing off just one shot before
getting five shots off on a late power play that ended the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars received points from seven players, including
defenseman Shawn Chambers' first the season, getting it when he
assisted on Hatcher's power-play goal.

   DIPLOMATIC-COST _ WASHINGTON _ For decades the American
government has tried to woo foreigners, coax them to come to
American colleges, bring selected leaders over for all-expense-paid
visits, and work to win friends and influence opinion leaders from
192 outposts abroad. Is this all needed in the post-Cold War world
at a time when foreigners need only turn on their TV sets to see
American programs? Critics say it's a waste of money. Defenders say
this $400 million a year public relations effort is still needed.
After all, does TV's ``Baywatch'' represent America? (Malone, Cox

`GATES OF FIRE': GRIPPING AND SWASHBUCKLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herodotus, in his great history of the Persian Wars, says that
the bravest combatant of them all was the Spartan Dienekes who,
when told that the Persian arrows blocked out the sun, jauntily
replied: ``Good. Then we'll have our battle in the shade.''
</P>
<P>
   That anecdote serves as an epigram for Steven Pressfield, whose
new novel, ``Gates of Fire,'' is a gripping and swashbuckling
re-imagining of the battle of Thermopylae, perhaps the most famous
military engagement of antiquity. Not surprisingly, one of
Pressfield's main characters is the very Dienekes who, naturally,
utters the words that Herodotus attributed to him.
</P>
<P>
   Dienekes' display of defiant humor is one small example of the
way in which Pressfield has woven history into a novel that, in
addition to plenty of sweep and sting, has a feel of authenticity
about it from beginning to end. These pages are written as a kind
of heroic saga, drenched in the gore of battle and the dust of
Spartan discipline. Pressfield sprinkles his text with the
vocabulary of the Greeks _ with helots (slaves) and hoplites (foot
soldiers), the 8-foot spears and the short daggers of the Spartans,
the medications used to treat wounds and the especially pungent
vocabulary of a martial society.
</P>
<P>
   But along with a stirring history lesson, Pressfield has created
a stirring story. His Spartan heroes are Homeric in dimension, but
they are fully formed figures, struggling with the terror of
battle, pondering the meanings of freedom and obedience as well as
the sacrifice of oneself for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Most of ``Gates of Fire'' is narrated by Xeones, battle squire
to one of the 300 Spartan warriors who fought at Thermopylae, all
of whom, in historical fact, died there in an audacious holding
action aimed at slowing the advance of the invading Persian army
under Xerxes, the King. The badly wounded Xeones has survived the
battle despite the Egyptian hoplite spear that penetrated his rib
cage, and he has been taken prisoner by the Persians.
</P>
<P>
   Xerxes himself, though victorious at Thermopylae, has lost
20,000 of his own soldiers to the far smaller Greek force, and he
wants to know the secret of the Spartans' courage and skill in
battle. He orders his physicians to save Xeones' life and, that
done, listens carefully as the defeated squire tells his life
story.
</P>
<P>
   And an exciting, romantic, star-crossed story it is. After
losing his mother and father in an attack on his home by enemy
soldiers, Xeones and his female cousin Diomache become hunters in
the mountains, led there by a former slave, Bruxieus, who watches
over them. When Bruxieus dies, the cousins _ Xeones is 12, Diomache
15 _ have no choice but to go their separate ways, she to Athens
and he to Sparta. There he becomes a kind of sparring partner and
companion to a youth undergoing the brutal 13-year course of
military training required of all high-born male members of Spartan
society.
</P>
<P>
   Though a foreigner excluded from full Spartan citizenship,
Xeones is loyal to his adopted city, eager to acquire training to
avenge the death of his parents and to take care of Diomache, who
is his beloved. The youth he is attached to is Alexandros, whose
sponsor is Dienekes. Alexandros is a too-delicate young man who
entertains philosophical objections to the Spartan cult of warfare
and suffers accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Together the two boys grow up in the extreme world devised by
the upper ranks of Spartan society, the Peers, in response to the
war-torn state of Greece. When Xerxes, defeated earlier at
Marathon, invades Greece for a second time, with 2 million men
under his command, the two are among the elite chosen to sacrifice
themselves for the cause at Thermopylae.
</P>
<P>
   As a historical novelist, Pressfield, whose previous novel is
``The Legend of Bagger Vance,'' is not at the level of the very
best ones, say, the Robert Graves of ``I, Claudius'' and ``Claudius
the God.'' But he is close. His ``Gates of Fire'' is full of an
earthy, profane vitality and a narrative power that make it
difficult to put down.
</P>
<P>
   The battle scenes are expertly drawn, full of the horror of
ancient warfare. He manages also to describe Spartan society in all
its brutality and yet to humanize it at the same time, largely by
rendering its characters in rounded, complex fashion. The
obscenity-laden speeches that he puts into the mouths of the
Spartan heroes as they await battle are worth the price of the
volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does one conquer fear of death, that most primordial of
terrors, which resides in our very blood, as in all life, beasts as
well as men?'' Dionekes asks on the eve of the great battle. ``We
cobble our courage together on the spot, of rags and remnants. The
main we summon out of that which is base. Fear of disgracing the
city, the king, the heroes of our lines. Fear of proving ourselves
unworthy of our wives and children, our brothers, our comrades in
arms.'' But, Dionekes continues, this is not real courage. ``Nor is
beastlike fury or panic-spawned self-preservation. These are
katalepsis, possession. A rat owns as much of them as a man.''
</P>
<P>
   One answer to the question of true courage given is that the
highest valor ``lies in that which is female,'' and Pressfield
gives a resonant and complicated role to the women of this story.
The wife of Dionekes, Arete, is an especially compelling figure, a
woman whose courage is all the greater because it stems not from
fear of embarrassment but from deep compassion. The war with Persia
provides the occasion for ``Gates of Fire,'' but the conflicts
within Sparta, caused by divided loyalties and private animosities,
are the true stuff of this novel's drama, and these conflicts are
mediated by Pressfield's women.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he brings his story to a finish, we have learned a
great deal of history, and we have sensed as well the protean
grandeur of antiquity. It's not unlikely that Herodotus, who made
Pressfield's story possible, would have enjoyed this book.

SWAPPING WALL STREET SECURITY FOR INTERNET RISK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He seemed to be where all the new-media financial
wannabes would want to be. But last April, Robert Lessin quit his
successful career as a vice chairman of one of the country's bigger
investment banks to devote his time and money to the Internet _ and
to the many new companies he believes it can still spawn.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best-known Wall Streeter to make such a dramatic
change, Lessin, 43, left his lofty perch at Salomon Smith Barney
Inc. and within days became chairman of Wit Capital Corp.
(www.witcapital.com), a tiny 2-year-old private investment company
with offices above the Strand bookstore on Broadway in Manhattan's
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   With about 65 employees and some $11 million in capital _ and a
couple of slow elevators to its rather dowdy sixth-floor offices _
Wit is seeking to make itself the conduit of choice for individuals
interested in investing in young, fast-growing companies, most of
them ventures related to the Internet. And just this week, Lessin
said, Wit expects to get a further capital infusion of several
million dollars from a group of outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   Wit caught the eye of the investment community in 1996 when it
became the first company to sell stock directly to investors over
the Internet, in an initial public offering for Spring Street
Brewing Co. (www.witbeer.com). Wit is the brainchild of Andrew
Klein, 37, a former associate at the law practice Cravath, Swaine &AMP;
Moore, who set up the investment firm to finance Spring Street.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under Lessin's guidance, Wit aims not only to invest in the
Internet economy, but to use the Internet to help change the
economics of investing. ``We want to empower the individual in the
capital-raising process,'' Lessin said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Lessin said, getting in on the ground floor of
initial offerings has tended to be a privilege available only to
insiders, investment bankers and big institutional investors. Wit's
aim, Lessin said, is to bring individual investors into the game by
using the Internet to build a community of investors.
</P>
<P>
   The focus, he said, is not so much on stock trading and
brokerage services, but on building and maintaining an online
capital-raising franchise for individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   So far, in a succession of 31 initial public offerings that was
halted by the August downturn in the stock market, Wit has raised
about $50 million from individuals for start-up companies. The
offerings in which Wit has participated, along with other
underwriters, include Micro Strategy, an information technology
consultant; 24/7 Media, an online advertising sales firm, and
Cyberian Outpost, an electronic commerce site for technology
products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some big investors have taken stakes in Wit itself,
including Mitsubishi Capital Corp., a subsidiary of the Japanese
financial giant, and the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Draper
Fisher Jurvetson. And some established names from the financial
community have taken their place on the Wit board, most notably
Joseph Hardiman, former chairman and chief executive of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, and Edward Fleischman,
senior counsel at Linklaters &AMP; Paines and a former commissioner of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, Wit's founder, now plays the role of strategist for the
company, which has also brought in Ronald Readmond, a former
executive vice president at Charles Schwab, as its vice chairman
and president, as Wit seeks to win acceptance among Wall Street's
established firms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, promising as this all may sound, skeptics note that until
Wit takes a bigger part in more initial offerings larger than its
biggest to date _ an undisclosed portion of the $600 million
offering for Capstar Broadcasting, the radio properties sold off by
Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst _ Wit's promise remains just that.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the summer turmoil in the stock and bond markets,
most analysts agree, has curtailed much stock-issuing activity for
months, if not years, to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll take a long time to happen, longer than they think,''
said Tom Taulli, a market analyst in Newport Beach, Calif., who
works for Silicon Investor, an online financial site in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever Wit's rhetoric about empowering individuals, Taulli
cautioned that a little power can be a dangerous thing. Taulli, who
is writing a book on initial public offering investing for
individuals, said that ``when you open markets, you have to be very
careful how you educate investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial public offerings are particularly risky investments,
Taulli said: ``Every research study shows IPOs underperform the
market. Most of them don't do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessin, who readily conceded that Wit has not yet had time to
prove its model, said the recent stock market turmoil nevertheless
was ``a net positive'' for his firm _ because it has allowed Wit to
demonstrate that it had placed shares into steady hands that would
not sell at the first sign of trouble. Of the stock placed by Wit,
85 percent remains with the original investors two months after
being issued, a proportion that compares favorably with much of
mainstream Wall Street, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, should there be any doubt about his commitment to the
Internet as an investment opportunity, Lessin said he had sunk
millions of dollars _ more than $15 million, by some estimates _ of
his own money into tens of different Internet-linked ventures.
</P>
<P>
   These bets, placed separately from Wit, include budding, still
private companies like Culture Finder (www.culturefinder.com), an
online source of cultural events around the country; Inns and Outs
(www.innsandouts.com), an online bed and breakfast site, and the
Main Xchange (www.mainx.com), which Lessin described as ``the
leading teen-age-oriented online stock exchange site.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lessin devotes about one-quarter of his time to
Dawntreader, an investment fund that is separate from Wit but that
shares his services as its chairman. Dawntreader, which aims to
invest at much earlier stages in start-up ventures than would Wit,
has so far put money into Watch World (www.watchworld.com), a
retail business selling timepieces that now is expanding onto the
Internet and Sports Cappers (www.sportscappers.com), a fee-based
online business with tips for sports bettors.
</P>
<P>
   If Lessin's plate-spinning act sounds frenetic, it belies the
assumption by some on Wall Street that it was the serious stroke he
suffered in 1994 that led to his decision to forgo the stress of
the financial big leagues for the whimsical pursuit of Internet
start-ups. Lessin, who had returned to work at Smith Barney in a
wheelchair within weeks of his stroke, said his leap into
cyberspace was anything but an escape. Instead, he described it as
a logical move made after analysis of the pending societal changes
he summarized in a book ``The Middle Chapter: Musings of an
Investment Banker,'' that his employers at Smith Barney published
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the book he enthused that ``the Internet is replicating in
five years the superstructure of retailing (distributors,
wholesalers, boutiques, malls, superstores, catalogs, etc.) that
developed over centuries.'' After writing that, he said, it would
have been hypocritical not to follow his own advice by staking his
future on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   To some on Wall Street, Lessin and his new path seem rather
outre. ``He's very bright, but very strange,'' said one former
investment banking colleague, speaking on condition that he not be
identified by name. ``Sometimes, he'd turn up to work in chinos and
no shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessin disputed that account, saying he had always worn shoes to
work. And while he may on occasion have shed such formal wear as
coat and tie, he noted, he always wore the mandatory business suit
for meetings with Fortune 500 companies. That said, he conceded,
``No one has ever accused me of being normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, until his sudden move to Wit, Lessin in many ways
epitomized the Wall Street establishment. A native of Lexington,
Mass., and a graduate of Harvard, Lessin, the son of a college
teacher, followed a well-beaten path to Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co. after
he earned his MBA at Harvard Business School in 1978. A sportsman
who loves to ski and play tennis, he met his wife, Naida Wharton
Lessin, through his passion for ballroom dancing. The couple, who
live in Englewood, N.J., have three children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, along with his mentor Robert Greenhill, and a group of
other Morgan Stanley bankers, Lessin left for Smith Barney where he
and his colleagues tried, with only limited success, to power that
firm into the top echelon of investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after raising billions of dollars for the biggest companies
in the country, Lessin _ laptop computer and HP620 personal
organizer in hand _ busies himself with small start-up companies
that may be long on promise, but often are struggling to make even
a few thousand dollars in profits.
</P>
<P>
   While Wit has suffered significant losses in the recent carnage
in the securities markets, and particularly in the market for
initial public offerings, it is now seeking to negotiate a capital
infusion that would push the capital invested in it to over $25
million, Lessin said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge to Wit's business model remains the fact
that the vast majority of initial offerings still are handled by
the traditional brokerage firms. And Internet investors account for
only an infinitesimally small fraction of one percent of all
investment in new stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly small, very small,'' Lessin said, ``but I
intend to make it much larger.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Wit has in recent months affiliated itself with
a loose collection of companies that calls itself the e-group _
whose members also include Waterhouse Securities, Quick &AMP; Reilly's
online brokerage operation, Datek Online and some 10 other firms
that, together, account for about 30 percent of the online
investing market. The plan is to band together to participate as a
group in IPO underwritings involving bigger, conventional brokerage
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Wit, in fact, was named in August as the e-group's manager in an
underwriting group led by J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., which plans to raise
capital for EarthWeb Inc., a software services company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergence of the Internet,'' Lessin said, ``changes the
role that the individual will play in the capital-raising
process.'' As for the companies that serve those individuals, he
added, ``the winners are those who create the brand.''

ADVERTISING: JOE CAMEL ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Joe Camel, the advertising icon that became a
powerful symbol to critics of the tobacco industry's efforts to
lure minors to smoking, will go on trial on Monday, more than a
year after he was retired by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission brought the case contending that
Reynolds, a unit of RJR Nabisco, committed an unfair trade practice
by using the Joe Camel character to attract children and
adolescents to cigarettes. Government lawyers assert that once
Reynolds introduced the campaign, Joe Camel became as recognizable
to children as Mickey Mouse, promoting a lethally addictive product
for a segment of the cigarette market that was central to the
company's future.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the culmination of an eight-year struggle between
the FTC and Reynolds over the Joe Camel campaign. It is also the
first time the commission has characterized a tobacco advertising
program as unfair because of its effect on young consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company voluntarily decided to pull the campaign last
year just weeks after the commission filed its complaint, the case
has turned into the regulatory equivalent of a probate contest,
with the two sides fighting over Joe Camel's corpus.
</P>
<P>
   The government seeks a permanent ban blocking Reynolds from ever
using Joe or his brethren characters, which include Buster, Max and
Floyd, in cigarette ads. Government lawyers have also asked the
administrative law judge hearing the case to order Reynolds to pay
for a consumer education program that would discourage adolescents
and teen-agers from buying cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, Reynolds has tried to transform Joe Camel from a
cool and goofy promotional character to a protector of the First
Amendment. The company says that Joe Camel has had no significant
impact on smoking by people younger than 18 and argues that the
commission's complaint poses fundamental constitutional issues that
are certain to affect how other industries can go about marketing
their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The witnesses and other evidence the FTC will put on will not
show that Joe Camel caused anyone _ let alone underage persons _ to
start smoking, smoke more or not quit when they otherwise would
have,'' said Guy Blynn, vice president and deputy general counsel
of Reynolds. ``This attack on cigarette advertising will fail both
because it does not meet the Federal Trade Commission's own
standard for establishing unfairness, and because it tramples on
the constitutionally protected right of a lawful industry to
advertise a lawful product.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at the commission respond that the First Amendment does
not protect unfair trade practices, particularly in a case like
this in which the product at issue causes so many deaths and
illnesses. In a trial brief filed two weeks ago, the FTC said that
the Camel campaign ``had immediate and dramatic effects on youth
smoking behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Within one year, Camel's brand share of smokers below the
legal smoking age almost tripled and within five years
quadrupled,'' the brief said. ``More disturbing, the incidence of
youngsters age 12-17 smoking their first cigarette began to
increase, as did the incidence of daily smoking by this age
group.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a federal survey, the brief concluded, the
incidence of new smoking increased by nearly a third, and the
incidence of daily smoking rose by 50 percent, during the years of
the Joe Camel campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the company contends that the Joe Camel campaign was aimed
primarily at the 18-to-24-year-old age group. The case will feature
a stream of testimony and company documents about its advertising
campaign, revealing the marketing strategy of Reynolds at a time
when it was beginning to see a serious erosion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to company executives who worked on the campaign,
the two sides are expected to call experts in health, marketing and
economics.
</P>
<P>
   The Joe Camel character was created in 1974 by a British artist,
Nicholas Price, for a Camel advertising campaign in France that
subsequently appeared in other countries throughout the 1970s. The
character arrived in the United States in 1988 in materials created
by Trone Advertising in Greensboro, N.C., for the 75th anniversary
of the Camel brand.
</P>
<P>
   The figure almost immediately attracted the attention of
officials studying the problem of smoking among the young.
</P>
<P>
   After studies found that Camels were 10 times as popular among
teen-agers as adults and that illegal sales of cigarettes to minors
had reached $500 million, the surgeon general, Antonia Novello,
called on Reynolds to withdraw the Joe Camel campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the FTC staff recommended banning Joe Camel ads
because of their appeal to children. But in 1994 the commission
rejected the recommendation by a vote of 3-2. President Clinton
then attacked Joe Camel, saying the campaign told minors that
``smoking is cool.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, the staff of the FTC once again recommended
action against the campaign and two months later, the commission
approved the complaint that is to be heard on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The case is expected to be completed next month.

DESPITE HOPE, `BELOVED' GENERATES LITTLE HEAT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ What happened to ``Beloved''?
</P>
<P>
   The film adaptation of the Toni Morrison best seller about
slavery was one of the most lavishly advertised films of the fall
and received generally respectful reviews. Its star and producer is
one of the most popular figures in America, Oprah Winfrey, who
aggressively promoted the movie on her talk show and in numerous
newspaper, magazine and television interviews. So did Jonathan
Demme, the Academy Award winning director and one of the most
respected filmmakers in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the film has grossed only about $21.2 million, less even
than many of those who predicted tough box-office sledding had
foreseen. It is expected to fade at the box office in the face of
competition from forthcoming holiday movies. Walt Disney Co. is
estimated to have spent as much as $75 million to $80 million to
produce and market the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``All there is is pain,'' Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney
Studios, said of the film's weak showing. ``You try to do something
good, artistic, adult. It's like barking in the wind. It's the rare
serious movie that gets the moviegoing audience these days.'' He
added, ``I feel badly for Jonathan and Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   (Roth was enduring far less pain over Disney's newest film,
``The Water Boy,'' the Adam Sandler comedy, which grossed about
$39.1 million in its first weekend. Several rival distribution
executives termed the figure extraordinary.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved,'' a three-hour adaptation of the Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel by Ms. Morrison, a Nobel laureate, deals with a
runaway slave in rural Ohio named Sethe (Ms. Winfrey) who struggles
to overcome the devastation and violence of a life that has haunted
her. The drama includes some harrowing scenes depicting the
brutalities of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Although Disney had been uncertain about the commercial
prospects for the film, the low box office came as a shock to
executives not only at Disney but at rival studios. ``Beloved'' had
been seen as almost a test case of whether an expensive and serious
film that dealt with the black experience would appeal to
mainstream audiences. The box office results will almost certainly
make it even more difficult for filmmakers to find studio support
for large-budget movies involving racial themes, many longtime
movie executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Grove, a box office analyst on CNN and a columnist at The
Hollywood Reporter, said that the audience for ``Beloved'' has been
consisting mostly of readers of the Morrison novel and fans of Ms.
Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there was any crossover audience,'' Grove
said. ``Disney brought in the core audience initially. But after
that it was up to the movie. And the problem seems to be that when
a movie is three hours long, and word of mouth says that it's
depressing and brutal, most people would rather do something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Several distribution executives at rival studios said the film's
appeal to black audiences seemed limited. Younger black audiences
did not show up in large numbers for the movie, whose attendance
drew heavily from black women over 30, the executives said. One
distribution executive said that in its second week, the film
dropped sharply among African-Americans, a big disappointment to
Disney. He said that the film was now playing in mostly upscale
theaters, catering to white as well as black audiences, and was
performing poorly at suburban malls.
</P>
<P>
   Demme said he was hopeful that the film would slowly attract
more customers and endure for a long time. ``The movie is
struggling, but it also has a foothold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still utterly believe that it will hang in there and we'll
see growth over the next several months,'' he added. ``People are
going. There's positive word of mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Demme said ``Beloved'' faced plenty of hurdles. ``The odds
are stacked against it,'' he said. ``It's a difficult picture. The
material is demanding. You have the length of the picture, too.
There are fewer show times.'' He added, ``The big surprise for me
is how prematurely the death of the movie has been foretold.''
</P>
<P>
   Box office analysts and studio executives said, however, that
the prospects for ``Beloved'' were bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which
monitors box office receipts, said: ``The film was tough going for
a lot of audiences. Disney did a first-rate job marketing the film.
The problem is word of mouth really hurt the film. There's no
amount of marketing that can overcome negative word of mouth. And
the word of mouth was that it was grim and hard to follow.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This was underscored by conversations with theater owners.
Michael Patrick, president of Carmike Cinemas, based in Columbus,
Ga., one of the largest exhibitors in the nation, mostly in
medium-size and smaller cities, said he had expected ``Beloved'' to
open far more strongly. He said there seemed to be intense interest
in the movie among filmgoers before it opened: the signs included
phone calls to theaters asking when the film would be unveiled and
what times it would be playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my computers will not tell me what happened and why it
opened at a third of what we expected,'' said Patrick. ``Then I
thought it would hold extremely well in its second weekend, even if
it didn't open well. It didn't. We thought it would do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper and magazine reviews for the film were generally
respectful and often positive but failed to have an impact. Several
rival studio executives said a risky and difficult-to-sell film
like ``Beloved'' needed superlative reviews that essentially told
moviegoers that they must see the film. By and large, the reviews
in large-circulation newspapers and magazines did not quite carry
that message. Moreover, the reviews may have unintentionally hurt
the film because many of them cited the movie's length, its
supernatural elements and its grimness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some classic word-of-mouth movies that succeed like
`There's Something About Mary,' where people tell each other that
you have to see it,'' said Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst at Paul
Kagan Associates, a media research and consulting company. ``Then
there are movies where people say, `I saw it and hated it' and
`Don't waste your time.' And then there's movies that no one really
talks about. And `Beloved' is sort of in that category. It hasn't
generated any heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives said they believed that if ``Beloved'' was
nominated for an Academy Award or two early next year, which is
probable, the film could generate some additional revenue on video
sales.

MAGAZINES TRY TO SELL SOMETHING NEW: REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Page through the most recent issue of More _ a magazine
introduced last year by Meredith Corp. _ and you'll find the
fashion spreads, advice columns and lush cosmetics advertisements
favored by most glossy women's magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But look closely. The model swathed in Carmen Marc Valco sequins
gazes at you from a face softened with age, her eyes radiating
laugh lines. The advice column offers solace to a reader who asks
what to wear when meeting her husband's ex-wife for the first time.
A health article answers this question: Is menopause ``nature's big
mistake?''
</P>
<P>
   More is a fashion magazine in which the celebration of beauty
and the concerns of womankind are not limited to youth. More's
editor, Myrna Blyth, says that it's a matter of editorial policy
that no model under the age of 40 appear in her pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted More to be celebratory, but realistic,'' said Ms.
Blyth, 58, who is also the editor of Meredith's Ladies' Home
Journal, which has a circulation of 4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Realistic? Since when does realism sell magazines? Haven't
consumer magazines always spun gossamer fantasies in which the
model is always slender and youthful, the children are freshly
bathed, the sofas are expertly upholstered and the cocktail party
is well-attended by famous faces?
</P>
<P>
   A dose of reality may help to sell some magazines to an aging
American population; in the last 18 months, several new magazines
have put that theory to the test. The only problem is that major
advertisers are slow to invest in magazines that celebrate ordinary
conditions like advancing age, ample thighs and anything less than
apple-cheeked good health.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike magazines before them that tried to address aging or
illness, this crop takes real issues and buffs them to a high
gloss; the women in More magazine may be 50 years old, but they are
_ after all _ models.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for More struck Ms. Blyth and Christopher Little,
president of Meredith Publishing Group, in the early 1990s when
they first heard the statistic that an American turns 50 every
eight seconds. After two test issues and two subsequent issues this
year, More will declare a monthly rate base of 400,000 in January.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Mode, aimed at what the publishers call the
average-sized American woman: sizes 12, 14, 16 and beyond.
Published in partnership with Freedom Publications Inc., which owns
75 newspapers in the United States, including The Orange County
(Calif.) Register, Mode has a rate base of 500,000 _up from 250,000
with its first issue 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mode's beginning was so encouraging that the publishers, Nancy
Nadler LeWinter and Julie Lewit-Nirenberg, have introduced Girl, a
magazine for young women that features models who are model-thin as
well as downright chubby.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, no one wanted to recognize the reality that the
average American woman is a size 14,'' Ms. LeWinter said. ``What
Mode basically did was say, `Excuse me, but real women who wear a
size 16 can be gorgeous too.'''
</P>
<P>
   There's the independently published We, a monthly glossy
magazine for, as the subtitle reads, ``people with disabilities,
their families and friends.'' Again, the models are stylishly
turned out, but they pose with their seeing-eye dog companions or
in wheelchairs; in the current issue, an article frankly details
the perils to the immune system caused by total paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   We's publisher, Charles Riley II, said that We's rate base of
90,000 was three times larger than its initial circulation one year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mamm, a magazine for women with cancer, is owned by Poz
Publishing and is produced by the same editorial team behind the
5-year-old Poz, a magazine for people who are HIV-positive. (Poz
became profitable in 1997.) With a circulation of 70,000, Mamm will
go monthly in April, and the publishers, the brother-sister team of
Sean Strub and Megan Strub Whiting, have not only started to
publish Poz en Espanol this year, but plan to start a version of
Mamm for men next year.
</P>
<P>
   While nontraditional fashion magazines like More and Mode are
markedly different from magazines like Mamm or We, which deal with
chronic illness, all of the magazines begin with the notion that
not every consumer craves perfection. More often, say publishers,
readers seek acceptance for their condition, whether they are
simply getting older or struggling with a disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no fantasy about these issues,'' said Christine
Miller, executive vice president of marketing for the Magazine
Publishers of America. ``Aging? No fantasy comes to mind. So it
would be ludicrous to think of making these subjects into
fantasies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller said the magazine industry had long portrayed issues
that increasingly affect real people _ like aging, chronic illness
or weight problems _ as negative. ``Reality is always portrayed as
negative, and it's not,'' Ms. Miller said. ``So there's a hole in
the marketplace for people living these things. Their only option
has been negative, so these magazines fill a huge market need.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, magazines that address health issues are not new.
Diabetes Forecast has been around since 1948 and has a guaranteed
rate base of 330,000; Arthritis Today has a circulation of 625,000,
according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. However, those
magazines originated as publications for medical professionals or
association members, while Poz and Mamm originated as consumer
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   More's audience is one of the fastest-growing in the United
States. And Meredith, its parent which is based in Des Moines,
Iowa, has the largest consumer database in the United States, with
information on 73 percent of the home-owning households in the
country, Little, president of the publishing group, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this enormous demographic shift coming,'' he said.
``However, it was not only the huge number of people entering this
age group, but the demographics of the age group. They tend to be
more active, healthy and involved. They work. It's a generation
we've never seen before. It's women in their 50s who are acting
like women in their 30s.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The real test of whether reality sells is whether corporations
will pay for advertising. Advertisers shied away from earlier
incarnations of More _ like Lear's and Mirabella, which both
originated as magazines for older women. Now Lear's is defunct and
Mirabella has been restyled by its owners _ Hachette Filipacchi, a
unit of Lagardere Groupe _ as a general-interest women's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And advertisers continue to be wary. Roberta Garfinkle, senior
vice president and director of print media at the advertising
agency McCann-Erickson, pointed out that Lear's and Mirabella may
have been a little too early to successfully surf the demographic
wave. She said that ad sales in any magazine that tackles
less-than-perfect health or beauty issues would come when the
readers had proved their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has anything to do with what the advertising
community is ready for,'' she said. ``It's an issue of, `How ready
is the culture of magazine readers to accept reality and get away
from fantasy?'''
</P>
<P>
   All of these magazines do, however, have built-in advertisers.
While Mode has not been able to attract some of the high-end
cosmetics lines like Estee Lauder, it does have an advertising base
of large-size apparel retailers, which is the fastest-growing
apparel industry in the United States, according to the NPD Group,
a marketing information concern.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical and vitamin companies flock to Poz, Mamm and We.
Linda Ciccarelli, media director of Sandler Communications, an
advertising company that specializes in pharmaceutical products,
said that she sought out magazines like Poz and Mamm that have
dozens of pages of direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising,
if not the cars of General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know there's a group of people out there who are
guaranteed to be interested in your drug, you can't advertise in a
better place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Strub and Ms. Whiting of Mamm have failed to convince car
and cosmetics companies to advertise in their pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wouldn't you want to buy a lipstick if you have cancer?''
asked Strub. ``We're really very angry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley of We is looking forward to seeing a profit soon, he said.
And he's been surprised by who is interested in the magazine. He
said he recently sold 4,500 subscriptions to Continental Airlines,
which plans to distribute the magazine free to passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking behind that was that no matter how bad your
flight is, if you read about these people's struggles, then it puts
things in perspective,'' he said.

A BUSY MAN OF OPERA GETS EVEN BUSIER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even by his own standards, Placido Domingo has accomplished an
extraordinary hat trick in recent weeks. At the same time he was
discussing extending his contract at the Washington Opera, where he
has been artistic director since 1996, he was also meeting
individually with members of the board, and with the entire
executive committee, to explain why they should not be alarmed at
his decision to become the artistic director of the Los Angeles
Opera while continuing to hold the reins in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo's contract in Washington ends in 2002, and the extension
under discussion would take it to 2004. The Los Angeles post, which
was announced last week, begins in July 2000. The announcement
comes at a time when the Los Angeles company is hoping to increase
its number of productions and performances, and Domingo says he is
willing to curtail his own performing schedule in order to keep up
with his new responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Domingo says he regards his Los Angeles position as more
of an upgrade than an entirely new job. His connection with the
company goes back to its founding in 1984. At first, he signed on
as a member of its board, and when Peter Hemmings became its first
general director, Domingo took the title of artistic consultant. He
sang the title role in the company's first production, ``Otello,''
in 1986 and became artistic adviser in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At 57, he now succeeds Hemmings, who is retiring at 64. Hemmings
has already planned the 2000-01 season, so Domingo's own
programming will not be seen until 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of my new position as an upgrading,'' Domingo said in
a telephone interview between rehearsals in Washington, ``because
as artistic adviser I was involved in discussions with Peter
Hemmings about the productions, the casting. It was a
collaboration, although it was minor compared with what I will have
to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Domingo's dual directorship raises questions. The most
immediate is: Where in his schedule is the room to pencil in
further commitments? He continues to give more than 60 performances
a year in international opera houses, and in recent years he has
been conducting as well, both in the opera pit and on the symphonic
podium. Every four years, when the World Cup games are played, he
joins Luciano Pavarotti and Jose Carreras to trawl for megabucks as
the Three Tenors. He sponsors Operalia, which is billed as the
world's largest opera competition, held annually. And to keep
things exciting, he owns a restaurant, called Domingo, in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   If the Washington Opera board members have doubts about
Domingo's ability to run two companies effectively, they have not
expressed them publicly. Robert Craft, the president of the
company, said that after he faxed board members to warn them, on
Oct. 30, that the Los Angeles appointment would be announced the
following Monday, he received no protests, comments or questions.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo and spokesmen for both companies have advanced a variety
of reasons why the dual directorship poses no problems for either
side. But weighing heavily in the equation is something the
companies do not go out of their way to point out: Domingo's value
as a fund-raising asset more than offsets any problems that might
be caused by potential scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Opera companies, and arts organizations in general, learned long
ago that if they are associated with an artist who is a household
name, corporate and private donations flow more freely. Beverly
Sills discovered this when she was director of the New York City
Opera, and she has continued to put her celebrity to use in raising
money as chairwoman of Lincoln Center. Domingo, as one of the
best-known opera singers of his generation, has proved to be a
similar lure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But those in the opera world who expected Domingo to be little
more than a money magnet have been surprised at his hands-on
approach to the Washington job. No mere figurehead, he has taken
charge of the company's programming, offering both standard
repertory and unusual works. His success has been mixed: rarities
like ``Il Guarany,'' by the 19th-century Brazilian composer Antonio
Carlos Gomes, and the company's current production of Verdi's
``Simon Boccanegra'' have been skewered by critics; others,
including a revival of an American classic, Douglas Moore's
``Ballad of Baby Doe,'' have fared better.
</P>
<P>
   Craft, noting that Domingo has also been involved in
administrative aspects of the Washington company, said the level of
energy he has brought to his work helped persuade the board that
his taking on another directorship would not be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think there were doubts expressed in the
executive committee after hearing him explain how he could do both
these jobs,'' Craft said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Domingo's presentation, both Craft and Domingo said, was
a demonstration that the production schedules of the two companies
did not overlap, allowing Domingo to focus on each during crucial
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can organize the dates so that if something is happening in
one company, it is not also happening in the other,'' Domingo said.
``In other words, as an artistic director, I begin to think three
years ahead about a production: about casting, conductors,
designers, directors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, if you have the right people with you, they can
start to get in touch. That's not work I have to do. I have the
ideas. Then, when the production begins, I am involved in the
beginning moments, I attend the first rehearsals; I look in as the
rehearsals develop and I attend the final rehearsals and the
opening. I don't have to be in the city the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings, the outgoing general director of the Los Angeles
Opera, noted that Domingo was succeeding him only partly, coming in
as artistic director, not general director. ``So there will be
someone else to take on that part of the job,'' he said. ``And the
search for that person has not yet begun.''
</P>
<P>
   But that raises further questions. Can a directorship be
maintained if so much is delegated? And what will happen if crises
occur when Domingo is on the other side of the country? A division
of responsibilities of this sort, however, is hardly without
precedent. Artistic and administrative duties are handled by
separate staffs, under separate directors, at both the Metropolitan
Opera and the New York City Opera; and James Levine, the artistic
director of the Met, spends time away from his company.
</P>
<P>
   The model that Domingo presented to his board in Washington,
moreover, included some tempting blandishments, including the
possibility of sharing productions, and therefore costs, with the
Los Angeles Opera. The two companies have borrowed each other's
productions on occasion; now that arrangement would be formalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be some synergies and economic possibilities,''
said Christine Hunter, the chairwoman of the Washington Opera's
executive committee. ``It would be an ace in hand to assemble a
wonderful cast for a production and have it performed both places.
Even if the production begins in Los Angeles and comes to
Washington, we have a true ensemble when it arrives.''
</P>
<P>
   Domingo did not think that was quite what he had proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice dream,'' he said, ``but I don't see it working
exactly that way. It's difficult to get singers to commit that much
time, for rehearsals and a production in one city, and then moving
to another city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking that our shared productions would not coincide
in the same season. But there are exceptions. In 2003, for example,
I hope to celebrate the anniversary of Berlioz with a big
production of `Benvenuto Cellini.' That could be in both theaters.
But it would be an exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Craft expressed complete confidence in Domingo's energy, noting
that one week recently, he sang at the Met on a Saturday night,
stayed up until 5 a.m. studying the score of Saint-Saens' ``Samson
et Dalila,'' which he was about to conduct, then attended a Sunday
noon brunch in Maryland on his way to ``Simon Boccanegra''
rehearsals in Washington. That night, he flew to the West Coast,
and was back to conduct ``Aida'' at the Met on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo, however, has started to rethink his ability to take on
an imprudent number of commitments, and he said that when he began
in Los Angeles, the shape of his performing schedule would change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will cut my touring,'' he said, ``so I can spend more time
around Washington and Los Angeles. When I am working at the
Washington Opera and singing at the Met, I can commute. When I am
in Los Angeles, that will give me a chance to perform more with the
San Francisco Opera, which is a company I love very much. But to do
this, I will have to give up some of my European engagements.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Washington and Los Angeles companies are of
comparable size: Washington, with a budget of $25 million, presents
70 performances of eight productions a year; Los Angeles has a $19
million budget and presents 54 performances of eight productions.
</P>
<P>
   Both, however, have cautious expansion plans. After the
renovation of the Kennedy Center Opera House, the company may add
slowly to its production schedule, assuming it can raise the money
to do so. The Los Angeles Opera, which shares the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, will be in a position
to expand when the philharmonic moves to Walt Disney Hall, possibly
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next two years, Hemmings said, the company expects to
add another production, and by the 2003-04 season, it envisions
giving 80 to 90 performances of 9 or 10 productions. This expansion
is tied to the ability to raise money and expand the audience.
Besides his skill at attracting donations, Domingo has another edge
in Los Angeles: The company hopes that having a Spanish-speaking
director _ and one with a passion for zarzuela, a form of popular
Spanish opera _ will help it reach into the growing Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense, too, that time is on Domingo's side. Neither
company is likely to expand much before 2000, and his
responsibilities in Los Angeles do not begin in full until 2001. By
the time that growth at either company begins to exert any real
pressure on him, Domingo will be in his early 60s, and may be
reconsidering his singing schedule yet again. If worst came to
worst, he could decide between companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings, who is returning to his native England, where he will
consult and oversee the construction of an opera house, discounts
assertions that holding two positions will be unduly taxing for
Domingo, and in any case, he has no fears for the company he built
in Los Angeles over the last dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an incredibly busy and active man,'' Hemmings said. ``He
has considerable roots here. Because I'm not a performer, I've
always been resident in the place I'm working, and have therefore
had time for a lot of the administrative details. But those will
now devolve upon an executive director. So a lot of the structure
is in place, and I think he'll succeed.''

 READING A CATHER BOOK WITH A DIRECTOR'S EYE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Joanne Woodward talked about her favorite book,
Willa Cather's ``Lucy Gayheart,'' it was as if she were directing a
movie based on the novella.
</P>
<P>
   It was winter in the small Midwestern town, Cather wrote, and
the Platte River was frozen. In a wide shot, Ms. Woodward could see
her heroine skating, with, in the author's words, ``the two ends of
a long crimson scarf ... floating on the wind behind her, like two
slender crimson wings.'' Lucy's perpetual suitor, Harry Gordon,
arrives, and she takes his arm. Then they cross hands and dance
away, breaking free of the skating party. The camera remains at a
distance, recording the idyllic panorama.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward gradually moved her hands closer together until
Lucy's lovely face filled the imaginary screen. ``If I was shooting
this,'' she said, ``it would never be in close-up until Lucy is on
the train to Chicago. Then you begin the journey.'' The train takes
Lucy back to her work as a piano student and teacher, and that
leads to her meeting with the celebrated concert singer Clement
Sebastian, a man who will forever change her life.
</P>
<P>
   At least once a year, Ms. Woodward rereads and savors the story,
one of Cather's least-known and most memorable books. For years,
Ms. Woodward has dreamed about turning it into a movie. As a first
step in bringing ``Lucy Gayheart'' to a wider public, she was
preparing to read it aloud for an audience at Symphony Space: the
entire book, in two parts in two evenings, concluding Monday night.
Ms. Woodward is the first actress in a series entitled ``Singular
Women,'' to be followed by Claire Bloom with ``Enter the Actress''
and Vanessa Redgrave reading from ``Mrs. Dalloway.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward said she was unsure how she first came across the
book but thought that Gore Vidal introduced it to her many years
ago. She was immediately drawn to the character of Lucy, the golden
girl of her community, and to the story of a tragic love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere it strikes a very deep chord in me,'' Ms. Woodward
said. ``I have no idea why, except that it is so intensely
romantic,'' despite the fact the romance is never consummated. ``It
has a sense of longing, a desire to go someplace else, which was a
part of me as a child.''
</P>
<P>
   She opened her paperback copy and read the description of the
first time Sebastian embraced Lucy: ``Before she had time to speak,
just as she was, in her hat and coat, he took her in his arms. They
stood for a long while without moving, in the dusky little hall
among overcoats and walking-sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward said: ``It's highly sensual, partly because Lucy is
very young, and he's much older.'' Speaking about the movie in her
mind (and perhaps in her future), she added, ``Placido Domingo was
born to play the role.'' Naturally, she would discover a new young
actress to play Lucy.
</P>
<P>
   Partly the book is about the tricks that life plays on people,
the accidents that become turning points. ``It's interesting to
think about Willa Cather,'' Ms. Woodward said. ``What brought this
out? Was it a loss on her part? It doesn't happen in her other
books. This was much later, in 1935. The older we get, we begin to
think about things we didn't think about when we were young.
Everything begins to iris in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy reminds her of the golden girls of her own youth. She
remembered one in particular, a classmate at Louisiana State
University, who was crowned queen of the school in both her
freshman and sophomore years. ``She had the most radiant smile,''
she said. ``A light somehow glimmered around her. When I think of
casting, I think of her.'' Ms. Woodward was a member of the queen's
court: ``I was the dark neurotic one wearing black sweaters and
rather pretentiously carrying around a copy of `Ulysses.'''
</P>
<P>
   After two years, she left LSU and moved to New York to become an
actress. Her classmate? ``I've often wondered what happened to her.
Probably she married a younger version of some good ol' boy. I
would hate to think that, because she had so much more.'' And if
Lucy had married her suitor, Harry? ``She might have been frozen in
time,'' and would never have had that transforming experience.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was a Sebastian, ``a big singer,'' in her own
past, Ms. Woodward admitted to having had a crush on Ezio Pinza,
who was starring in ``South Pacific'' when she arrived in New York.
She bought a standing-room ticket to see him in the musical and
``used to haunt the Astor Pharmacy'' to get a glimpse of him on the
way to the theater. ``Ah, heaven,'' she said, ``if only I could
have played the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   As an understudy in William Inge's ``Picnic,'' she met, and
later married, Paul Newman. Then she went to Hollywood to act in
``Count Three and Pray,'' a Civil War western, ``a joyous time,''
to be followed by some less than happy experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making films is like brain surgery,'' she said. ``It's scary.
Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.'' Among those that worked were
``Three Faces of Eve,'' ``Rachel, Rachel'' and ``Mr. and Mrs.
Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, she has turned down movie offers. ``I keep
getting scripts in which people say, `We would like you to consider
the role of grandma,' '' she said. ``I think: `Wait a minute, I
don't have to play that. I am somebody's grandma.'''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, she acts on the stage, and increasingly she has
worked as a director, specializing in plays by Clifford Odets
(``Golden Boy,'' ``Waiting for Lefty'') and working with young
actors at the Blue Light Theater Company and the Williamstown
Theater Festival. Currently she is directing a workshop of ``Dark
of the Moon,'' a Broadway hit in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   She also went back to school, studying at Sarah Lawrence
College. ``I started college in 1947,'' she said, ``and I graduated
in 1990, making me by a long shot the oldest living
undergraduate.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a great reader, she took a tentative step onstage in May
with a short story at Symphony Space. With ``Lucy Gayheart,'' she
occupies the stage for two full evenings. Last Monday, she began
her reading, working her way through the lyrical Cather landscape
and standing in for all the characters. Afterward, Isaiah Sheffer,
the artistic director of Symphony Space, invited the audience to
return Monday night to hear the conclusion of the story and to find
out if Lucy Gayheart lives happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have read the story know otherwise, and look forward
to the magical closing words. When Lucy was 13, she left her
footprints in the newly paved sidewalk outside her home, where they
remained locked in time, in Cather's words, ``three light
footprints, running away.'' Should Ms. Woodward film ``Lucy
Gayheart,'' that would, of course, be the final poignant image.

   A few weeks later _ reportedly pressed by Springer _ the
syndicator altered that policy, saying it would ``responsibly
edit'' each show to tone down the violence, while keeping the
confrontational formula that makes the show so popular.
</P>
<P>
   Now, whatever the precise policy, the brawling or attempted
brawling have resumed (the show's beefy black-shirted security
guards now step in to block some punches and kicks), along with so
many bleeps that it is often impossible to follow the dialogue, and
the show's ratings have risen in tandem with its ribaldry.
</P>
<P>
   The show's popularity, which crosses all age boundaries and
appeals to both men and women, keeps it thriving despite protests
from various community groups, the flight of some national sponsors
and the fact that some stations make scant if any profit on it. It
does turn a healthy profit _ estimated at $50 million this season _
for Studios USA, a unit of USA Networks, and gives a lift to the
stations that carry it.
</P>
<P>
   Springer's show has been No. 1 in the daytime Nielsen ratings
for 35 of the last 38 weeks. On any given day, it might beat
``Oprah,'' the longtime leader, by more than 1 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when broadcast television audiences are declining
steadily, ``Jerry Springer'' and ``Judge Judy'' are the only
syndicated shows with ratings that have grown since last season,
said Marc Berman of Seltel Inc., an analyst who advises local
stations about programming choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a station manager looking to attract an audience,
the quickest way to do it is with `Jerry Springer' or `Judge Judy,'
'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   That is the primary value of ``Springer'': its large audience
often carries over to whatever follows it, and it may even help the
show that precedes it, because people tune in early.
</P>
<P>
   Also, placing promotional spots for a station's other shows in
``Springer'' guarantees that the spots will be seen by many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an oddity in that you can put him on at any hour of the
day, and he'll get a big audience,'' Berman said. ``We've seen
situations where stations were doing a 1 rating or lower in a time
period and suddenly they're doing 5s or 6s.''
</P>
<P>
   That in turn lifts a station's overall rating for a week, a
month or a season. Stations often sell advertising time not in
individual shows but in certain time periods (morning, afternoon or
prime time) or in packages that place commercials in several
different time blocks. An overall higher rating can mean higher
prices for those packages.
</P>
<P>
   All this compensates for the lower advertising rates for
``Springer'' itself.
</P>
<P>
   Like other syndicated shows, ``Jerry Springer'' is sold to
stations for a weekly licensing fee (as high as $60,000 a week in
the most populous markets) and some advertising minutes, known as
barter. But in a departure from the usual, Studios USA keeps only
two-and-a-half minutes of barter _ because many national
advertisers shun ``Springer'' _ leaving stations a hefty 12 minutes
to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the clout of its high ratings, `Springer' has
flipped the typical financial model on its head,'' said David
Smith, president of entertainment for Frank N. Magid Associates, a
media market research and consulting firm. ``Stations pay a higher
licensing fee but give up less barter, because barter is not that
valuable to Studios USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Some station managers worry that ``Jerry Springer'' is not worth
its cost because it repels some advertisers _ those who want to
avoid association with its tawdry image, or those seeking a more
affluent audience.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do advertise in the show pay less. This season, a
typical national 30-second commercial on ``Oprah'' costs $48,000,
while a similar spot on ``Jerry Springer'' costs only $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Springer'' show's commercials are dominated by
1-800-number ads _ for technical schools, personal-injury law
firms, mortgage lenders, insurance companies and health services.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina Roman Catholic
Church in Chicago, was the most prominent leader of last spring's
protest against ``Jerry Springer,'' recruiting church and community
groups in other cities to denounce the show's violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the NBC-owned station dropped ``Jerry Springer'' in
April. When the Fox station, WFLD, leaped to buy it, Pfleger
persuaded executives there to edit out any physical violence. (The
station continues to do so; if a punch is thrown, editors
substitute an audience shot or some other angle.)
</P>
<P>
   Pfleger also started a campaign to write to companies that
advertised on the show, urging them to withdraw. Of 19 companies,
five have dropped out and one promises to do so by Jan. 1, said
Vince Clark, Pfleger's assistant.

FINDING A HOME FOR PUBLIC RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MATTHEW ROSENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the University of Maryland's College of Journalism decided
to, in the words of its dean, Reese Cleghorn, create ``more of a
journalism with a capital `J' program,'' the public relations
division of the program was sent packing.
</P>
<P>
   The move was a sharp departure for the journalism school, which,
like most others throughout the country, had lumped journalism
education with advertising and public relations under the rubric of
mass communications. (The school's advertising program is being
phased out entirely, due to a separate, budget-related decision.)
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, faculty members of the College of Journalism voted,
10-9, with two abstentions, to eliminate public relations. But
after a summer of intense negotiations by the division's two
professors, James Grunig and Larissa Grunig, a husband-and-wife
team, public relations found a new home within the university, at
the College of Arts and Humanities. Next fall it will become part
of a newly organized communications department there.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the change, Cleghorn said the academic connection
between public relations and journalism stemmed from the often
close working relationship between members of both professions.
That relationship, he said, was essentially a marriage of
convenience that took place many years ago, when journalism and
public relations programs sprouted up at universities throughout
the country. But he does not believe that the two fields require
the same skills or have the same professional ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A journalist's mission is to tell the truth,'' Cleghorn said.
``It's not to sell something, it's not to sell people on something
_ it's to find out and disseminate the truth in a responsible
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, he said, ``We should be able to deal with the
complex questions that arise from that particular mission all the
way through our curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, instead of giving students four majors to choose from _
news editorial, broadcast, advertising and public relations _ the
school will now have a single curriculum that includes courses on
ethics and the history of journalism. In addition, Cleghorn said,
better-qualified students will be sought.
</P>
<P>
   James Grunig said he was looking forward to the move to the
College of Arts and Humanities. He complained that the public
relations program, in which he and his wife were the only full-time
faculty members last year for 239 students (32 percent from the
College of Journalism), never received the necessary resources from
the College of Journalism. Now, two full-time faculty members along
with additional graduate students will join the program to teach
and advise undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Bowen, a doctoral candidate in public relations, said:
``I have no roots with journalism. We study completely different
things than they do. They would be studying advanced public affairs
reporting and we'd be studying strategic planning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of shunned,'' she added, ``and the only
professors we had were the Grunigs. The new situation is going to
be a lot better.''

   &UR; The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye: Five Fairy Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By A.S. Byatt. Vintage International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   These fairy tales may be full of magic and quests, but they're
also spun from contemporary cloth as they explore the lives of
characters who feel imprisoned by their prescribed fate. ``Byatt is
a storyteller who could keep a sultan on the edge of his throne for
a thousand and one nights,'' Nancy Willard wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jonathan Raban. Vintage Departures, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This English author displays a quirky eye and restless energy in
his account of a two-year odyssey to American locales as varied as
Alabama, Seattle and New York, where he indulges in a full-scale
cultural deconstruction of Macy's department store. ``In an era of
jet tourism, he remains a traveler-adventurer in the tradition of
... Robert Louis Stevenson,'' Justin Kaplan wrote in these pages in
1991. ``He has a gift for vivid observation, description, anecdote
and personal encounter.''  &UR; Soft City &LR;  (Harvill, $12), an earlier
book by Raban that has just been restored to print, is both a sharp
portrait of London and its comfortable middle-class young in the
1970's and a spirited defense of urban life. ```Soft City' shows
how, in the midst of physical decay, a city can flourish by
fulfilling an elemental human need, the need to play out fantasies
of self,'' Richard Sennett said here in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Iliad &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Homer. Translated by Robert Fagles. Penguin, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   This translation of Homer's tale of the Trojan War is marked by
free, cadenced lines and simple, direct language that resembles
real speech. ``His narrative has real pace, it presses onward,
leading the reader forward with an irresistible flow,'' Oliver
Taplin wrote here of Fagles in 1990. ``His version is imbued with
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Impeachment: A Handbook &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Charles L. Black Jr. Yale University, $6.95.
</P>
<P>
   In a guide written during the Watergate era but reissued in the
lengthening shadow of the Clinton impeachment hearings, a
constitutional scholar stresses the need for caution and common
sense as he outlines the process for removing a president from
office. In 1974 our reviewer, Mary Ellen Gale, called this an
``elegantly written, lucid, intelligent and comprehensive
handbook.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Springs of Affection: Stories of Dublin &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Maeve Brennan. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.
</P>
<P>
   These 21 tales by a former writer for The New Yorker who died in
1993 dwell on the small joys, hurts and unrealized dreams tucked
away in the red-brick houses of a single Dublin neighborhood.
``Brennan's book is full of small miracles presented in elegant but
simple prose,'' Jay Parini wrote in the Book Review last year. The
narrator of  &UR; An Irish Eye &LR; , by John Hawkes (Penguin, $11.95), is a
13-year-old orphan whose bizarre adventures include a romance with
an aging World War I veteran and enslavement by the mistress of a
manor house. In 1997 our reviewer, Liam Callanan, called this novel
``an engaging blend of genres and literary traditions ... that
ultimately becomes a kind of post-modern picaresque.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; My Brother &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jamaica Kincaid. Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $10.
</P>
<P>
   In reconstructing her brother's life and his death from AIDS in
their native Antigua, Kincaid refuses to romanticize her story,
choosing instead to follow the circular flow of her memory to
portray death as it really is, not as we might prefer it to be. The
result is ``a sustained meditation on the grinding wheel of family,
with mother always at the hub; on the countries of our past, both
real and emotional, which we have fled and in which we have felt
like strangers,'' Anna Quindlen wrote here in 1997. In  &UR; Daughter of
the Queen of Sheba &LR; , by Jacki Lyden (Penguin, $12.95), a National
Public Radio correspondent recalls growing up in the Midwest as the
daughter of a manic-depressive woman whose delusional behavior was
dazzlingly bold and exotic. Last year in these pages, Caroline
Knapp said Lyden succeeds in ``vividly capturing both the horror of
her mother's illness and the seductive, transporting power of her
insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dreams of My Russian Summers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Andre Makine. Translated by Geoffrey Strachan. Scribner,
$7.99.
</P>
<P>
   This French novel by a Russian emigree tells of how a remarkable
woman with a dual allegiance to her French past and her Russian
destiny endows her grandson with a sensibility that enables him to
endure life in the Soviet Union. ``Makine employs a highly poetic
voice to blend memory and imagination,'' Victor Brombert wrote here
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ken Croswell. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The history of extrasolar planetary astronomy is one of
frustration and false promises, but advances in the 1990s have
turned the field into an exciting growth industry. ```Planet Quest'
is of no practical use whatever ... but it is fascinating and
worthwhile nonetheless,'' John Durant wrote in these pages in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Leave It to Me &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Bharati Mukherjee. Fawcett Columbine, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   The heroine of this raucous road novel is a misfit adoptee who
sets off from Schenectady, N.Y., to California on a vengeful (and
ultimately lethal) quest for her true parents. She is ``a brilliant
creation -- hilarious, horribly knowing and even more horribly
oblivious,'' Lorna Sage wrote here last year.

 &HT;    VENERABLE USIA VUNERABLE IN INFORMATION AGE
 &HT;    Editors: A PHOTO OF JOSEPH DUFFEY IS AVAILABLE ON THE COX PHOTO
WIRE IN THE NATIONAL FOLDER
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With much of the world now tuning into CNN for news
updates and international audiences paying to see Hollywood
productions, do the taxpayers still need to fund emissaries to
inform the world about America?
</P>
<P>
   That's the $1 billion question that challenges the venerable
U.S. Information Agency, which spends about that much each year to
woo friends and influence opinion makers around the globe. To that
purpose, USIA maintains 192 overseas offices, a vast news network
that includes TV and radio broadcasting, and a foreign student
exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   Why does the U.S. government still need to mount such extensive
public relations efforts now that the Iron Curtain has collapsed
and the information age has taken hold?
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it's hard to make the case,'' USIA director
Joseph Duffey, a former University of Massachusetts president,
conceded in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years in which he has headed USIA, the agency
has suffered budget cutbacks. Most of its operations will soon be
folded into the State Department. Government studies have urged
that key functions be left to the private markets.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, former foreign service officer Charles Schmitz,
suggests that much of the agency is obsolete. ``The USIA got its
start to tell our story overseas so we could be sure that we
wouldn't lose the ideological battle against communism,'' said
Schmitz, a consultant and chairman of Global Access Institute.
``Now the battle is won.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffey's response to critics and budget cutters has been to
downsize and computerize but to keep his agency's core functions
intact:
</P>
<P>
   The government continues to operate worldwide news services,
including Voice of America radio, Worldnet TV broadcasts, Radio
Free Asia, and broadcasts to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could some of the things be better done in the private sector?
Yes.'' Duffey said. But he argued that commercial broadcasts are
not enough to give the American side to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Explaining America is not Ted Turner's agenda,'' he said,
referring to the founder of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for Hollywood, Duffey said: ``The people who are making
films in Hollywood are not necessarily trying to send messages
about America.'' He cited 'Independence Day' and 'Air Force One' as
box office smashes abroad that have done little to promote ``the
best side of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffey's agency also spends about $3 million a year to operate
400 educational advisory centers worldwide to assist foreign
students interested in attending American colleges and
universities. The agency produced a computerized compact disk that
gives prospective foreign students a ``virtual tour'' of a typical
campus, complete with advice on dating life, food, and local
hangouts.
</P>
<P>
   But such government guidance is no longer necessary at a time
when students from abroad are so common on U.S. campuses, according
to findings by the U.S. General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, and the State Department's own
inspector general. About half a million foreigners study on U.S.
campuses a year, and the vast majority arrive with private
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Duffey agreed that colleges should take the lead on recruitment
and counseling abroad and said that his agency was about ``30
percent'' the way toward turning the work over to them.
</P>
<P>
   The USIA still sends out its daily ``Washington file,'' a
collection of official positions and news media reports that for
decades were laboriously teletyped to U.S. outposts around the
world. Now that effort has been turned into a cyberspace operation
in which 400 workers post information on Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   That saves 60 percent of the cost, said Jonathan Spalter, who
heads the ``I'' (for Information) Bureau, that also keeps
communications flowing on the Internet in a host of languages,
including Arabic and Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're providing the context on the American viewpoint,'' said
Spalter. Does it assist American foreign policy goals? He said he
can't be sure, although he pointed to tens of thousands of visits
to the web sites.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the USIA still has its traditional
person-to-person diplomacy, including exchange visits that bring
rising young leaders on tours of the United States and spends $95
million a year for Fulbright academic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   And about a quarter of the agency budget is spent on overseas
postings, even in friendly countries where information about the
United States is abundant. In France, for example, the agency has
five officers plus as many as 20 local employees. Their job is to
reach out to local opinion leaders, journalists and others to build
support for U.S. positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very different from what a lobbying firm does'' in
Washington, said Brian Carlson, who oversees European and Canadian
Affairs at the agency. Asked if the effort works, Carlson said, ``I
think so,'' but conceded that ``it's very hard to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the USIA has organized a working group of young
Palestinian and Israeli leaders who conducted a workshop and later
came to the United States for a joint visit as part of an effort to
develop a deeper dialogue. It's part of a search for ``new arenas
for interchange,'' said Daniel Sreebny, who helps direct USIA work
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will that make the peace process more successful?
</P>
<P>
   I can't say,'' he said.

   But such government guidance is no longer necessary at a time
when students from abroad are so common on U.S. campuses, according
to findings by the U.S. General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, and the State Department's own
inspector general. About half a million foreigners study on U.S.
campuses a year, and the vast majority arrive with private
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Duffey agreed that colleges should take the lead on recruitment
and counseling abroad and said that his agency was about ``30
percent'' the way toward turning the work over to them.
</P>
<P>
   The USIA still sends out its daily ``Washington file,'' a
collection of official positions and news media reports that for
decades were laboriously teletyped to U.S. outposts around the
world. Now that effort has been turned into a cyberspace operation
in which 400 workers post information on Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   That saves 60 percent of the cost, said Jonathan Spalter, who
heads the ``I'' (for Information) Bureau, that also keeps
communications flowing on the Internet in a host of languages,
including Arabic and Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're providing the context on the American viewpoint,'' said
Spalter. Does it assist American foreign policy goals? He said he
can't be sure, although he pointed to tens of thousands of visits
to the web sites.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the USIA still has its traditional
person-to-person diplomacy, including exchange visits that bring
rising young leaders on tours of the United States and spends $95
million a year for Fulbright academic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   And about a quarter of the agency budget is spent on overseas
postings, even in friendly countries where information about the
United States is abundant. In France, for example, the agency has
five officers plus as many as 20 local employees. Their job is to
reach out to local opinion leaders, journalists and others to build
support for U.S. positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very different from what a lobbying firm does'' in
Washington, said Brian Carlson, who oversees European and Canadian
Affairs at the agency. Asked if the effort works, Carlson said, ``I
think so,'' but conceded that ``it's very hard to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the USIA has organized a working group of young
Palestinian and Israeli leaders who conducted a workshop and later
came to the United States for a joint visit as part of an effort to
develop a deeper dialogue. It's part of a search for ``new arenas
for interchange,'' said Daniel Sreebny, who helps direct USIA work
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will that make the peace process more successful?
</P>
<P>
   I can't say,'' he said.

MEASURING JAUNDICE IN NEWBORNS  
 CHEMICAL HELP FOR BINGE DRINKERS  
 TESTING FOOD WITH A DOILY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., Ga., Ill.)  (js) 
 BY TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As many as 80,000 babies in the United States are hospitalized
annually for the treatment of jaundice _ a common condition among
newborns whose hallmark is a yellow cast to the skin.
</P>
<P>
   In severe cases, jaundice can cause hearing loss, cerebral
palsy, mental retardation, or even death. Thus, many jaundiced
newborns are placed in incubators outfitted with special blue
lights. These lights help the baby's immature body convert
bilirubin _ a toxic compound manufactured when red blood cells
break down and are replaced _ into a water-soluble form that be
easily excreted.
</P>
<P>
   But while the bilirubin lights protect against real injury in
certain infants, many newborns treated with the lights have
jaundice that would otherwise go away by itself.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, according to Charles Ahlfors, a neonatologist at
the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, is trying
to distinguish infants who are at risk from those who would be fine
_ and in the long run better off _ without treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlfors recently patented a blood test that he contends will
make such a distinction quickly, easily and cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phototherapy is a disruption of maternal-infant bonding,''
Ahlfors said. ``These newborns are put under the lights for a
couple of days during the first three to four days of life. That's
a time when moms are just starting to nurse their babies, and it
can really create a lot of havoc.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, doctors decide whether a baby needs phototherapy by
measuring the overall levels of bilirubin in the blood. But
bilirubin levels are not necessarily a good indicator, according to
Ahlfors.
</P>
<P>
   That's because bilirubin exists in different states. The
dangerous kind is known as ``unbound'' bilirubin _ unbound because
it roams freely, unattached to albumin, a naturally occurring
protein in the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The albumin acts kind of like a bus, taking the bilirubin to
the liver and dropping it off and then leaving to pick up new
bilirubin,'' Ahlfors said.
</P>
<P>
   Since bilirubin is not dangerous when it is bound to the
albumin, the question, according to Ahlfors, is how much unbound
bilirubin is in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlfors came up with a test to measure this while studying tiny
baby rats who had been bred to have jaundice. ``We had such small
blood samples to work with that we had to find a new way of testing
the blood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlfors did this by creating a new test from two known tests _
one used to measure bilirubin levels in infants, the other used to
measure bilirubin during laboratory research.
</P>
<P>
   ``By combining the two tests together, we can tell which part of
the bilirubin is the bad part,'' Ahlfors said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlfors' patent, No. 5,804,405, has been assigned to Research
Corporation Technologies, a company in Tucson, Ariz., that
specializes in commercializing new inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical Help For Binge Drinkers
</P>
<P>
   Binge drinking, especially among college students, has been
drawing considerable attention in recent years. Indeed, some 300
people die annually from binge drinking. These deaths result
because once the body has become overloaded with alcohol, there is
little that medical attendants can do to speed up its elimination
from the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergency room staff might evacuate the stomach or
administer activated charcoal, but they do that just to appease the
relatives,'' said David Whitmire, a chemical engineer who studied
the biomechanics of binge drinking while a doctoral student at
Auburn University. ``Those things don't help unless there are other
drugs involved as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitmire just received a patent for what he contends might one
day be used to help people rapidly metabolize alcohol: a group of
enzymes embedded in a substrate of dihydroxyacetone _ best known as
a prime ingredient in quick-tan pills sold during the 1970s (and
subsequently banned by the Food and Drug Administration).
</P>
<P>
   One pair of enzymes works together to oxidize the alcohol into
acetic acid _ the same acid present in vinegar _ which is then
easily metabolized by the body. The third enzyme reduces the
dihydroxyacetone to glycerol, a type of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmire's patent, No. 5,759,539, was assigned to the Georgia
Research Foundation, and has been licensed to Compumed, of
Manhattan Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Testing Food With a Doily
</P>
<P>
   It is a common scenario: a group of friends order coffee after
dinner at restaurant. The waiter arrives with the coffee,
momentarily puzzles over which cups are regular and which are
decaffeinated, and then with a show of confidence distributes the
cups to the diners.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she has anything against waiters, but Florine McKay,
the retired president of a printing plant, is suspicious that they
do not always give you the right cup of coffee. Thus she has
invented a doily that, when moistened with the coffee, will tell
you whether it has caffeine in it.
</P>
<P>
   Her patent also covers a doily that will test food for such
allergenic ingredients as monosodium glutamate or peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McKay, who lives in Burr Ridge, Ill., is looking to license
her patent, No. 5,824,554.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

DISPUTE SWIRLS AROUND WRINKLE IN YEAR 2000 PROBLEM

 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did a history teacher from Michigan and an obscure Canadian
programmer discover a twist to computing's Year 2000 problem that
the experts had missed?
</P>
<P>
   That question has ignited a simmering technical debate in which
some experts _ including Year 2000 specialists at Compaq Computer's
Year 2000 Expertise Center in Albany, N.Y. _ see a real, if
imperfectly understood, flaw that could cause many computers to
malfunction after seeming to sail smoothly into the year 2000. Many
experts, however, see it as a case of unfounded scare mongering.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy turns on the intricacies of how computers keep
time. It underscores how the approach of 2000 is stirring doubts
among computer users and corporate America about who the true
experts are and how much they can be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from a seemingly simple glitch:
Computers have long used just two digits to refer to the year, such
as 98 for 1998, and often have trouble recognizing that 00 is 2000
rather than 1900. But, as this dispute shows, that simple problem
spawns questions that can defy quick, clear-cut answers.
</P>
<P>
   The purported timekeeping flaw was first reported in August 1997
by Jace Crouch, a 46-year-old professor who teaches courses on
Western civilization at Oakland University in Michigan. It was
subsequently described at length on the Internet
(www.intranet.ca/mike.echlin/bestif) by Michael Echlin, a
35-year-old programmer at Atomic Energy Canada Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the timing of the flaw's onset unpredictable, they
say, but so are the results, which include malfunctions that can
wipe out data, prevent computers from starting up, and lead
software programs to make faulty calculations. The problem is said
to affect primarily older computers, but some more recent IBM
clones are also said to be susceptible. One report of the flaw
involved an Apple Computer Macintosh, and the flaw may lie hidden
in a wide range of electronic machinery.
</P>
<P>
   But is the flaw real? Or is it, as some critics say, a reckless
claim by the two men, who have set up a small company that markets
software to identify and neutralize the problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are selling a fix for something they can't even
explain,'' said Thomas Becker, chief executive of Rightime Co., a
Miami-based software company that specializes in products that
regulate timekeeping on personal computers. ``They are trying to
capitalize on fear.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the conflict over what has been variously
called the Crouch-Echlin Effect, time dilation, or simply, T.D.,
has been waged largely on a handful of Internet sites favored by
computer buffs. Even critics like Becker say that Crouch and Echlin
have undoubtedly encountered something strange that urgently needs
further research and explaining.
</P>
<P>
   It all began with Crouch's decision more than a year ago to set
his office computer forward to Dec. 31, 1999, to test how it would
handle the transition to the year 2000. The rollover happened
without a hitch, even though the machine ran on a clone of Intel's
aged 286 microprocessor chip _ a relic from the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Since Crouch was using the computer for word processing in which
the date it logged made no difference, he decided not to change the
date back. But to his consternation, during the next two weeks the
computer's clock jumped ahead to December 2000. Other odd
malfunctions cropped up.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch's report of these anomalies on the Year 2000 forum at the
comp.software newsgroup on the Internet intrigued Echlin. He set up
experiments on several computers, then posted results suggesting
Crouch's problems were not isolated.
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly was baffling. While some testers reported
computers jumping ahead for minutes or months, others said they
experienced leaps backward, while on some machines the clock
appeared to simply slow down. Some afflicted computers were unable
to locate the pathway to outside phone lines or even their own hard
disk, making it impossible to fire up programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out on exactly what is happening,'' said
Douglas de Lacey, who oversees computer systems at Cambridge
University's School of Arts and Humanities in Britain and has
reported encountering the Crouch-Echlin Effect on two aging Toshiba
laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for a verdict is building, though, especially since a
recent, widely distributed e-mail announcement from Compaq's Year
2000 office in Albany that said the company would be reselling the
software fix created by Crouch and Echlin.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said that he was being peppered by anxious calls from
major clients like General Motors and Exxon asking what they should
do. If the Crouch-Echlin Effect is real, computer users may have to
spend billions of dollars testing and possibly replacing equipment
that seemed ready for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Theories of what is causing the Crouch-Echlin Effect have come
and gone. Most Crouch-Echlin believers now suspect that the problem
stems from a glitch in the process through which computers can _
each time they are turned on _ update the time from a
battery-powered chip called the real time clock, or RTC. The real
time clock keeps track of time even during periods when the
computer's external power is switched off.
</P>
<P>
   The clock is used as the source of the time and date by a
computer's operating system and is also directly accessed by some
software programs, unless the computer is part of a network in
which a central server keeps time for a coordinated group of
devices.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Crouch-Echlin Effect has only been observed in
computers with ``nonbuffered'' real time clocks, a design not used
in today's name-brand computers but common in older devices.
</P>
<P>
   Nonbuffered real time clocks cannot be read for an instant as
their own second counter clicks over to the next second. Because
computer designers know of this limitation, all computers are
programmed to avoid checking nonbuffered real time clocks during
that update.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Here's how: A chip known as the Basic Input-Output System, or
BIOS, looks to the real time clock for the time and date when the
computer user hits the ``on'' switch.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a nonbuffered real time clock, the BIOS chip will
see the electronic equivalent of a red flag for 244 microseconds
before the update is to occur. Seeing this flag, the BIOS waits
briefly. If the flag is not there, the BIOS figures it has enough
time to complete its reading and proceeds to do so.
</P>
<P>
   All this works fine until the computer reaches the year 2000,
according to Echlin. After that, he says, computers with
nonbuffered real time clocks may trip up if an unlucky user turns
them on at the wrong instant in the update cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Echlin said, is that at least some BIOS chips
actually calculate by relating what they read to elapsed time since
a Jan. 1, 1980, start date _ a sort of universally presumed dawn of
time in the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   After 2000, that takes two steps: Time from 1980 until the end
of 1999 is added to time since the beginning of 2000, he said. The
extra fraction of a second it takes to complete the Year 2000
translation could push the time check beyond the 244 millisecond
safety window if the computer happens to be switched on just before
the flag goes up, Echlin said. The result is a garbled time check
with unpredictable results, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make a very solid argument,'' said Jeff Floyd, a real
time clock specialist for Motorola Inc., the giant semiconductor
company that manufactured the real time clock chip on Crouch's
computer.
</P>
<P>
   But critics like Becker contend that Echlin is being needlessly
alarmist. They complain that Echlin and Crouch have declined to
provide equipment on which they have seen their effect to critics
who have asked to test it.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said his doubts grew last year after he set up his own
test. He harnessed two computers with nonbuffered real time clocks
to a third device that turned them on and off 25,000 times over a
three week period. There was no sign of the Crouch-Echlin Effect,
he said. Testing just two machines is hardly definitive, Becker
conceded. But he said it was pointless to devote more time and
resources without the cooperation of Crouch and Echlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deny there is something going on, but we tried to work
with them and couldn't get their cooperation,'' said James Lott,
manager of timekeeping devices at Dallas Semiconductor, a maker of
real time clocks and other chips. ``We have full lab facilities and
would guarantee confidentiality. The cloak of secrecy turns all of
us off.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the critics suspect the supposed Crouch-Echlin Effect is
a variation on common timekeeping problems that are caused by
faults in a computer's power supply.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics challenge the BIOS explanation. David Ross, an
engineer with Phoenix Technologies, a leading BIOS manufacturer,
said that the process by which a BIOS chip checks the time and date
occurred too rapidly to create the situation Echlin had described.
A more likely explanation, in his view, is not that the affected
BIOS chips are taking too long to identify the year 2000 date, but
that they are simply confused by encountering ``00.''
</P>
<P>
   Echlin insists that power supplies are not the problem because
the computers performed flawlessly on dates earlier than 2000. He
also bridles at charges that he and Crouch withheld crucial
evidence. Early this year, they sent the motherboard from Crouch's
computer to Mark Slotnick, a sympathetic technician at what was
then Digital Equipment's Year 2000 Expertise Center, to verify
their results. Digital was acquired by Compaq last June.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Barry Pardee, manager of the center, told Echlin that
Digital had confirmed the Crouch-Echlin findings in its own tests.
Shortly after Digital's merger with Compaq, Pardee agreed to resell
the software fix developed by Yeovil Systems and Development
Research Inc., a venture set up by Echlin, his sister-in-law, and
Crouch. Pardee said at the time that the testing had not turned up
any problems in Digital or Compaq computers but that the software
would be sold as a service to customers whose offices had a mix of
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq-Digital also sent along an initial royalty payment that
Echlin described as ``about $1,000 for each of us.'' Crouch and
Echlin met soon afterward for the first and only time, in Sault St.
Marie, Ontario, half-way between their homes, where Echlin
hand-delivered Crouch's check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not planning to get rich,'' Echlin said, adding that
Yeovil gets just $1 for each copy of the software sold. ``We were
going to give this away but corporate America doesn't trust
anything that's free.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Digital's endorsement spread in October via an e-mail
from Pardee that Digital salesmen distributed to customers. It
included pricing for the software fix. Digital offered the software
at prices from $32 a unit for 50 computers down to $3 each for
orders of 25,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch-Echlin critics were dumbfounded by Pardee's endorsement.
Becker alerted Karl Fielder, chief executive of Greenwich Mean Time
Ltd., a Year 2000 consulting company, who contacted Compaq
officials at the company's headquarters in Houston. Some engineers
within Digital also expressed doubts, a Compaq spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of activity may soon bring the issue of whether
Crouch-Echlin is real to a head. Compaq officials plan to test the
device that produced the results Pardee found convincing and to
ship it to Becker, a spokesman said. Pardee and Slotnick did not
respond to requests for comments.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they were skeptical and would not ship
the Crouch-Echlin software fix unless further testing changes their
minds. One customer has purchased it, the company said, and will
receive a refund if the testing does not confirm the flaw.
</P>
<P>
   But Echlin is not backing down. ``Jace and I have been hoping
ever since we found this that someone would come along and prove us
wrong,'' he said. ``No one who has followed our test procedures
has.''

   Even by his own standards, Placido Domingo has accomplished an
extraordinary hat trick in recent weeks. At the same time he was
discussing extending his contract at the Washington Opera, where he
has been artistic director since 1996, he was also meeting
individually with members of the board, and with the entire
executive committee, to explain why they should not be alarmed at
his decision to become the artistic director of the Los Angeles
Opera while continuing to hold the reins in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo's contract in Washington ends in 2002, and the extension
under discussion would take it to 2004. The Los Angeles post, which
was announced last week, begins in July 2000. The announcement
comes at a time when the Los Angeles company is hoping to increase
its number of productions and performances, and Domingo says he is
willing to curtail his own performing schedule in order to keep up
with his new responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Domingo says he regards his Los Angeles position as more
of an upgrade than an entirely new job. His connection with the
company goes back to its founding in 1984. At first, he signed on
as a member of its board, and when Peter Hemmings became its first
general director, Domingo took the title of artistic consultant. He
sang the title role in the company's first production, ``Otello,''
in 1986 and became artistic adviser in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At 57, he now succeeds Hemmings, who is retiring at 64. Hemmings
has already planned the 2000-01 season, so Domingo's own
programming will not be seen until 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of my new position as an upgrading,'' Domingo said in
a telephone interview between rehearsals in Washington, ``because
as artistic adviser I was involved in discussions with Peter
Hemmings about the productions, the casting. It was a
collaboration, although it was minor compared with what I will have
to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Domingo's dual directorship raises questions. The most
immediate is: Where in his schedule is the room to pencil in
further commitments? He continues to give more than 60 performances
a year in international opera houses, and in recent years he has
been conducting as well, both in the opera pit and on the symphonic
podium. Every four years, when the World Cup games are played, he
joins Luciano Pavarotti and Jose Carreras to trawl for megabucks as
the Three Tenors. He sponsors Operalia, which is billed as the
world's largest opera competition, held annually. And to keep
things exciting, he owns a restaurant, called Domingo, in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   If the Washington Opera board members have doubts about
Domingo's ability to run two companies effectively, they have not
expressed them publicly. Robert Craft, the president of the
company, said that after he faxed board members to warn them, on
Oct. 30, that the Los Angeles appointment would be announced the
following Monday, he received no protests, comments or questions.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo and spokesmen for both companies have advanced a variety
of reasons why the dual directorship poses no problems for either
side. But weighing heavily in the equation is something the
companies do not go out of their way to point out: Domingo's value
as a fund-raising asset more than offsets any problems that might
be caused by potential scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Opera companies, and arts organizations in general, learned long
ago that if they are associated with an artist who is a household
name, corporate and private donations flow more freely. Beverly
Sills discovered this when she was director of the New York City
Opera, and she has continued to put her celebrity to use in raising
money as chairwoman of Lincoln Center. Domingo, as one of the
best-known opera singers of his generation, has proved to be a
similar lure.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But those in the opera world who expected Domingo to be little
more than a money magnet have been surprised at his hands-on
approach to the Washington job. No mere figurehead, he has taken
charge of the company's programming, offering both standard
repertory and unusual works. His success has been mixed: rarities
like ``Il Guarany,'' by the 19th-century Brazilian composer Antonio
Carlos Gomes, and the company's current production of Verdi's
``Simon Boccanegra'' have been skewered by critics; others,
including a revival of an American classic, Douglas Moore's
``Ballad of Baby Doe,'' have fared better.
</P>
<P>
   Craft, noting that Domingo has also been involved in
administrative aspects of the Washington company, said the level of
energy he has brought to his work helped persuade the board that
his taking on another directorship would not be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think there were doubts expressed in the
executive committee after hearing him explain how he could do both
these jobs,'' Craft said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Domingo's presentation, both Craft and Domingo said, was
a demonstration that the production schedules of the two companies
did not overlap, allowing Domingo to focus on each during crucial
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can organize the dates so that if something is happening in
one company, it is not also happening in the other,'' Domingo said.
``In other words, as an artistic director, I begin to think three
years ahead about a production: about casting, conductors,
designers, directors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, if you have the right people with you, they can
start to get in touch. That's not work I have to do. I have the
ideas. Then, when the production begins, I am involved in the
beginning moments, I attend the first rehearsals; I look in as the
rehearsals develop and I attend the final rehearsals and the
opening. I don't have to be in the city the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings, the outgoing general director of the Los Angeles
Opera, noted that Domingo was succeeding him only partly, coming in
as artistic director, not general director. ``So there will be
someone else to take on that part of the job,'' he said. ``And the
search for that person has not yet begun.''
</P>
<P>
   But that raises further questions. Can a directorship be
maintained if so much is delegated? And what will happen if crises
occur when Domingo is on the other side of the country? A division
of responsibilities of this sort, however, is hardly without
precedent. Artistic and administrative duties are handled by
separate staffs, under separate directors, at both the Metropolitan
Opera and the New York City Opera; and James Levine, the artistic
director of the Met, spends time away from his company.
</P>
<P>
   The model that Domingo presented to his board in Washington,
moreover, included some tempting blandishments, including the
possibility of sharing productions, and therefore costs, with the
Los Angeles Opera. The two companies have borrowed each other's
productions on occasion; now that arrangement would be formalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be some synergies and economic possibilities,''
said Christine Hunter, the chairwoman of the Washington Opera's
executive committee. ``It would be an ace in hand to assemble a
wonderful cast for a production and have it performed both places.
Even if the production begins in Los Angeles and comes to
Washington, we have a true ensemble when it arrives.''
</P>
<P>
   Domingo did not think that was quite what he had proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice dream,'' he said, ``but I don't see it working
exactly that way. It's difficult to get singers to commit that much
time, for rehearsals and a production in one city, and then moving
to another city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking that our shared productions would not coincide
in the same season. But there are exceptions. In 2003, for example,
I hope to celebrate the anniversary of Berlioz with a big
production of `Benvenuto Cellini.' That could be in both theaters.
But it would be an exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Craft expressed complete confidence in Domingo's energy, noting
that one week recently, he sang at the Met on a Saturday night,
stayed up until 5 a.m. studying the score of Saint-Saens' ``Samson
et Dalila,'' which he was about to conduct, then attended a Sunday
noon brunch in Maryland on his way to ``Simon Boccanegra''
rehearsals in Washington. That night, he flew to the West Coast,
and was back to conduct ``Aida'' at the Met on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo, however, has started to rethink his ability to take on
an imprudent number of commitments, and he said that when he began
in Los Angeles, the shape of his performing schedule would change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will cut my touring,'' he said, ``so I can spend more time
around Washington and Los Angeles. When I am working at the
Washington Opera and singing at the Met, I can commute. When I am
in Los Angeles, that will give me a chance to perform more with the
San Francisco Opera, which is a company I love very much. But to do
this, I will have to give up some of my European engagements.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Washington and Los Angeles companies are of
comparable size: Washington, with a budget of $25 million, presents
70 performances of eight productions a year; Los Angeles has a $19
million budget and presents 54 performances of eight productions.
</P>
<P>
   Both, however, have cautious expansion plans. After the
renovation of the Kennedy Center Opera House, the company may add
slowly to its production schedule, assuming it can raise the money
to do so. The Los Angeles Opera, which shares the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, will be in a position
to expand when the philharmonic moves to Walt Disney Hall, possibly
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next two years, Hemmings said, the company expects to
add another production, and by the 2003-04 season, it envisions
giving 80 to 90 performances of 9 or 10 productions. This expansion
is tied to the ability to raise money and expand the audience.
Besides his skill at attracting donations, Domingo has another edge
in Los Angeles: The company hopes that having a Spanish-speaking
director _ and one with a passion for zarzuela, a form of popular
Spanish opera _ will help it reach into the growing Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense, too, that time is on Domingo's side. Neither
company is likely to expand much before 2000, and his
responsibilities in Los Angeles do not begin in full until 2001. By
the time that growth at either company begins to exert any real
pressure on him, Domingo will be in his early 60s, and may be
reconsidering his singing schedule yet again. If worst came to
worst, he could decide between companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings, who is returning to his native England, where he will
consult and oversee the construction of an opera house, discounts
assertions that holding two positions will be unduly taxing for
Domingo, and in any case, he has no fears for the company he built
in Los Angeles over the last dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an incredibly busy and active man,'' Hemmings said. ``He
has considerable roots here. Because I'm not a performer, I've
always been resident in the place I'm working, and have therefore
had time for a lot of the administrative details. But those will
now devolve upon an executive director. So a lot of the structure
is in place, and I think he'll succeed.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Joanne Woodward talked about her favorite book,
Willa Cather's ``Lucy Gayheart,'' it was as if she were directing a
movie based on the novella.
</P>
<P>
   It was winter in the small Midwestern town, Cather wrote, and
the Platte River was frozen. In a wide shot, Ms. Woodward could see
her heroine skating, with, in the author's words, ``the two ends of
a long crimson scarf ... floating on the wind behind her, like two
slender crimson wings.'' Lucy's perpetual suitor, Harry Gordon,
arrives, and she takes his arm. Then they cross hands and dance
away, breaking free of the skating party. The camera remains at a
distance, recording the idyllic panorama.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward gradually moved her hands closer together until
Lucy's lovely face filled the imaginary screen. ``If I was shooting
this,'' she said, ``it would never be in close-up until Lucy is on
the train to Chicago. Then you begin the journey.'' The train takes
Lucy back to her work as a piano student and teacher, and that
leads to her meeting with the celebrated concert singer Clement
Sebastian, a man who will forever change her life.
</P>
<P>
   At least once a year, Ms. Woodward rereads and savors the story,
one of Cather's least-known and most memorable books. For years,
Ms. Woodward has dreamed about turning it into a movie. As a first
step in bringing ``Lucy Gayheart'' to a wider public, she was
preparing to read it aloud for an audience at Symphony Space: the
entire book, in two parts in two evenings, concluding Monday night.
Ms. Woodward is the first actress in a series entitled ``Singular
Women,'' to be followed by Claire Bloom with ``Enter the Actress''
and Vanessa Redgrave reading from ``Mrs. Dalloway.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward said she was unsure how she first came across the
book but thought that Gore Vidal introduced it to her many years
ago. She was immediately drawn to the character of Lucy, the golden
girl of her community, and to the story of a tragic love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere it strikes a very deep chord in me,'' Ms. Woodward
said. ``I have no idea why, except that it is so intensely
romantic,'' despite the fact the romance is never consummated. ``It
has a sense of longing, a desire to go someplace else, which was a
part of me as a child.''
</P>
<P>
   She opened her paperback copy and read the description of the
first time Sebastian embraced Lucy: ``Before she had time to speak,
just as she was, in her hat and coat, he took her in his arms. They
stood for a long while without moving, in the dusky little hall
among overcoats and walking-sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward said: ``It's highly sensual, partly because Lucy is
very young, and he's much older.'' Speaking about the movie in her
mind (and perhaps in her future), she added, ``Placido Domingo was
born to play the role.'' Naturally, she would discover a new young
actress to play Lucy.
</P>
<P>
   Partly the book is about the tricks that life plays on people,
the accidents that become turning points. ``It's interesting to
think about Willa Cather,'' Ms. Woodward said. ``What brought this
out? Was it a loss on her part? It doesn't happen in her other
books. This was much later, in 1935. The older we get, we begin to
think about things we didn't think about when we were young.
Everything begins to iris in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy reminds her of the golden girls of her own youth. She
remembered one in particular, a classmate at Louisiana State
University, who was crowned queen of the school in both her
freshman and sophomore years. ``She had the most radiant smile,''
she said. ``A light somehow glimmered around her. When I think of
casting, I think of her.'' Ms. Woodward was a member of the queen's
court: ``I was the dark neurotic one wearing black sweaters and
rather pretentiously carrying around a copy of `Ulysses.'''
</P>
<P>
   After two years, she left LSU and moved to New York to become an
actress. Her classmate? ``I've often wondered what happened to her.
Probably she married a younger version of some good ol' boy. I
would hate to think that, because she had so much more.'' And if
Lucy had married her suitor, Harry? ``She might have been frozen in
time,'' and would never have had that transforming experience.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was a Sebastian, ``a big singer,'' in her own
past, Ms. Woodward admitted to having had a crush on Ezio Pinza,
who was starring in ``South Pacific'' when she arrived in New York.
She bought a standing-room ticket to see him in the musical and
``used to haunt the Astor Pharmacy'' to get a glimpse of him on the
way to the theater. ``Ah, heaven,'' she said, ``if only I could
have played the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   As an understudy in William Inge's ``Picnic,'' she met, and
later married, Paul Newman. Then she went to Hollywood to act in
``Count Three and Pray,'' a Civil War western, ``a joyous time,''
to be followed by some less than happy experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making films is like brain surgery,'' she said. ``It's scary.
Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.'' Among those that worked were
``Three Faces of Eve,'' ``Rachel, Rachel'' and ``Mr. and Mrs.
Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, she has turned down movie offers. ``I keep
getting scripts in which people say, `We would like you to consider
the role of grandma,' '' she said. ``I think: `Wait a minute, I
don't have to play that. I am somebody's grandma.'''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, she acts on the stage, and increasingly she has
worked as a director, specializing in plays by Clifford Odets
(``Golden Boy,'' ``Waiting for Lefty'') and working with young
actors at the Blue Light Theater Company and the Williamstown
Theater Festival. Currently she is directing a workshop of ``Dark
of the Moon,'' a Broadway hit in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   She also went back to school, studying at Sarah Lawrence
College. ``I started college in 1947,'' she said, ``and I graduated
in 1990, making me by a long shot the oldest living
undergraduate.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a great reader, she took a tentative step onstage in May
with a short story at Symphony Space. With ``Lucy Gayheart,'' she
occupies the stage for two full evenings. Last Monday, she began
her reading, working her way through the lyrical Cather landscape
and standing in for all the characters. Afterward, Isaiah Sheffer,
the artistic director of Symphony Space, invited the audience to
return Monday night to hear the conclusion of the story and to find
out if Lucy Gayheart lives happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have read the story know otherwise, and look forward
to the magical closing words. When Lucy was 13, she left her
footprints in the newly paved sidewalk outside her home, where they
remained locked in time, in Cather's words, ``three light
footprints, running away.'' Should Ms. Woodward film ``Lucy
Gayheart,'' that would, of course, be the final poignant image.

ANALYSIS: DISARMING MICROSOFT: CASE STRESSES ANTICOMPETITIVE
PATTERN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As its antitrust trial moves into the fourth week, Microsoft
Corp. finds itself trying to deflect a flood of charges of threats
and bribes. The litany of shameful misconduct, according to the
government, was directed not only at Microsoft's rivals but just
about everyone in the industry _ including personal computer
makers, Internet service suppliers and others.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's story line is that, time after time,
the digital-age monopolist showed up in the doorway, brandishing a
club in one hand while offering price discounts and marketing
support with the other. It is, as an antitrust expert said, an
``800-pound gorilla'' case. It is certainly entertaining. But is it
a strong legal case?
</P>
<P>
   No, Microsoft insists, as it asks ``where's the body?'' _ where,
in other words, is evidence that consumers are being hurt by the
company's tough business tactics.
</P>
<P>
   That is a real hurdle for the prosecution, particularly because
the personal computer industry where Microsoft is so powerful is
not flashing the conventional warning signal of consumer distress _
rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   But that hurdle is by no means insurmountable, antitrust experts
say. What the government must do, they say, is to marshal enough
evidence of anticompetitive behavior by Microsoft to convince the
court that there would be more innovation, more competition and
probably lower prices if the company were forced to change its
ways. For example, the next government witness is to be Steven
McGeady, an Intel vice president, who will testify that Microsoft
prodded the big chip maker to step back from developing Internet
and multimedia software and from supporting Netscape
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's case is largely about the future _ the loss of
opportunities, the government says, in a field at the forefront of
a new economy. ``It does require a court to make an inference, to
decide that the corporate behavior in question simply has to have
negative effects,'' said William Kovacic, a visiting professor at
George Washington University Law School. ``But since the Standard
Oil case, courts have been willing to make inferential leaps into
the future if they are persuaded that the bad conduct is serious
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Supreme Court's ruling in 1911 to uphold the breakup
of Standard Oil was one of the biggest judicial leaps into the
future. Standard Oil, in its defense, had argued cogently that
kerosene prices had declined since the 1880s and that the company,
led by John D. Rockefeller, was an engine of industrial innovation,
wealth creation and job generation. ``Standard Oil's pitch was why
tamper with success, just as Microsoft is warning today,'' Kovacic
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Microsoft's view, the government ``simply doesn't have the
evidence to make its big-is-bad case,'' said Charles Rule, a former
senior Justice Department official who is now an adviser to
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these alleged anticompetitive meetings,'' Rule said,
``amount to Microsoft basically informing another software company
that it plans to compete vigorously in some new field and telling
that company you can consider joining us. Saying you're going to
compete like heck is not a violation of the nation's antitrust
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft recognize
that they must present an array of damaging evidence to overcome
the company's defense _ that rivals may be hurt by its actions but
consumers are not. Since the trial began, the government has used
piles of e-mail it has subpoenaed to make its case.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement, David Boies, the Justice Department's
trial lawyer, showed an e-mail message from an executive at
Hewlett-Packard to a Microsoft executive. The message protested
restrictions Microsoft had placed on personal computer makers,
barring them from making changes on the first screen that appears
on computers when Microsoft's Windows operating system starts up.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had said its contract restrictions were to insure a
``uniform consumer experience,'' but the government says that the
curbs were intended to restrain the distribution deals that its
rival in the Internet browser market, Netscape, could strike with
PC makers.
</P>
<P>
   The Hewlett-Packard executive wrote that his company was ``very
disappointed'' with Microsoft's restrictive contracts. ``From the
consumer perspective,'' he said, the restrictions are ``hurting our
industry and our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   After displaying the e-mail message in court, Boies declared:
``This is not a better-product, consumer-driven approach, your
honor. This is a monopolist, able to ignore the demands and the
complaints and the protest of their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's early witnesses have repeatedly advanced the
argument that the future of computer software innovation would be
brighter if Microsoft were held in check. James Barksdale,
Netscape's chief executive, testified that he thought there would
be more innovation and more competitors in the browser market if
Microsoft had not bundled its browser, the Internet Explorer, with
its industry-standard Windows operating system and given the
browser away free _ essentially removing the commercial incentive
for entrepreneurs to invest in the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Avadis Tevanian Jr., a senior vice president at
Apple Computer, described a series of threats from Microsoft. The
company, he testified, succeeded in getting Apple to make Internet
Explorer the main browser on Macintosh computers, and Microsoft
also tried to force Apple to step back from the new market for
multimedia software. Market muscle and deep pockets _ not
innovative smarts _ are the forces that make Microsoft a winner in
new software markets, Tevanian asserted.
</P>
<P>
   With its industry witnesses, the government is arguing that
Microsoft bullied companies into deals that reduce competition and
do not result in any discernible consumer benefit. Thus, the
government adds, these deals must hurt consumers, even if there is
little immediate evidence of harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is closing in on what is critical _ a loss of
consumer choice and prices that are higher than would be the case
if there were unrestricted competition,'' said Stephen Axinn, an
antitrust litigator who is a partner of Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider
in New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like all of contemporary music, American opera has
many currents and tributaries, and any blanket assertions about it
will quickly draw shouts of contradiction. But an important school
of thought about this repertory, rooted to some extent in a
Germanic and Russian conception of opera, holds that American opera
will resonate most strongly if it is linked to American literature.
</P>
<P>
   This philosophy was eventually supplanted by one in which recent
news events attained primacy as operatic subject matter, but
between the 1940s and the '70s, several works were based on
American novels, plays and short stories.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Carlisle Floyd's setting of the John Steinbeck
novel ``Of Mice and Men,'' returned to the New York City Opera
repertory on Saturday evening after a 15-year absence in a
persuasive new production by Rhoda Levine. Ms. Levine's production,
which occupies spare naturalistic sets by John Conklin, was first
staged at the Glimmerglass Opera in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbeck's story of itinerant farm workers has ample operatic
potential. Its main characters, the feebleminded Lennie and his
companion and protector, George, fantasize about buying a small
farm of their own, thereby breaking the cycle of wandering the
countryside, taking low-paying harvesting jobs and getting chased
out when Lennie lands them in trouble. They nearly achieve this
dream when Candy, another worker, offers to put his substantial
savings at their disposal if he can join them.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample foreshadowing to warn us that this plan will go
awry, as well as a near tragedy when Lennie ends up in a brawl with
Curley, the boss. Lennie's passion for petting soft things, but
doing it so hard that he destroys them (coupled with a tendency to
panic under pressure), leads him to inadvertently kill Curley's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, who wrote his own libretto, kept close to the Steinbeck
story, one of his major departures being a slight expansion of the
character of Curley's wife, who is given no further name. In the
novel, we get a sense of her discontentedness; in the opera, her
dreams of better things parallel George's and Lennie's, and Floyd
has her express them in a coloratura line.
</P>
<P>
   His music otherwise is in the vernacular of midcentury tonality:
It is chromatic, often declamatory, occasionally lyrical _ George,
Lennie and Curley's wife are all given plenty to work with, and it
has the picturesque qualities of verismo opera.
</P>
<P>
   It also has an undercurrent of mildly folksy, Coplandesque
melodies that have become the standard musical depiction of a
Western accent, but it avoids veering too close to Copland's own
``Of Mice and Men'' film score.
</P>
<P>
   The City Opera has assembled an admirable cast. Anthony Dean
Griffey gives us two views of Lennie: As an actor, he astutely
conveys the nuances of Lennie's childlike personality; as a singer
with an attractive, focused tenor, he conveys the full measure of
Lennie's vulnerability. As George, Dean Ely is vocally and
dramatically well matched to Griffey, and the rich timbre of his
bass-baritone enlivened his solo turns and ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Allen Lundy handled Curley's wife's music with agility and
a nicely understated sweetness that made her more sympathetic than
Steinbeck's character. And Joel Sorenson made the most of the few
lines afforded the bellicose Curley.
</P>
<P>
   There were also fine contributions from Julian Patrick, as
Candy, and Victor Benedetti, as Slim, the levelheaded leader of the
workers. The singers' English diction was fine all around, but the
company used supertitles nevertheless, a prudent move in so big a
house. As it happened, the orchestra, which played reasonably well
under Stewart Robertson's baton, often overpowered the singers.

RICH, FAMOUS, UNSATISFIED: STEPHEN KING REMARKETS HIMSELF

<TEXT>
<P>
   At midcareer and middle age, Stephen King is a restless member
of the magic circle of best-sellerati, the exclusive elite of
commercial authors whose pricey prose can pay for a football team
or pad a publishing house's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   His latest novel of haunted love, ``Bag of Bones'' (Scribner),
may occupy the prime real estate of best-seller lists and his new
publishing partnership appears to be a blissful business marriage.
But King is not entirely satisfied. He wants more.
</P>
<P>
   Readers, that is. There are the lapsed female fans who, focus
groups indicate, have tiptoed away from his brand of horror for
tales such as the ``vampire lit'' of Anne Rice that King dismisses
as soft-core pornography. Then there are the up-market customers
who have shunned him like ``Carrie,'' or the potential readers that
know him only from plot twists in films and television movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is psychological,'' explained King, whose quest for more
readers gives him the zeal at times of a director of marketing. ``I
would like to sell. I wanted to have one more book that was big,
that felt like I was running the tables in terms of sales. I wanted
to knock Tom Clancy out of the number-one spot. Like Leonardo
DiCaprio, I'm king of the world, even if it's only for two weeks,
whatever. I wanted those things.''
</P>
<P>
   At 51, with library shelves of best-selling books in his name
and pen-names, King is aggressively confronting the arc of his long
career, a line that the writer character in ``Bag of Bones''
gratefully remarks is ``longer for novelists because readers are a
little brighter than fans of the non-written arts and thus have
marginally longer memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Today his newest title clings to the upper tiers of best-seller
lists, but his opening sales do not compare with some of his
rivals, including new authors seeking to enter that preserve. And
while more than 20 of his books have climbed the rungs of the New
York Times best-seller lists, King's newer titles spend less time
there. In its crucial debut week in late September, ``Bag of
Bones,'' for instance, sold in numbers at the Barnes &AMP; Noble chain
that were a third of the opening sales for Tom Clancy's ``Rainbow
Six'' (Putnam) or half of those for Robert Jordan's ``Path of
Daggers'' (Tor/Doherty), which nudged ``Bag of Bones'' out of No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, King parted with his newly merged publisher,
Viking, and started a very awkward public search for a new literary
home amid sniping in publishing circles that the author had passed
his prime. His sales, the critics felt, were too flat to justify
the almost $18 million advance he initially demanded for the ``Bag
of Bones'' manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the courting rituals with various publishers ended
in a unique profit-sharing partnership with Simon &AMP; Schuster, the
unit of Viacom which paid him a $2 million advance against profits
for each title in a three-book deal plus a share of the profits of
more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, King has expanded that arrangement to include two
more books and he speaks of his new publishing house like a
satisfied groom _ one who is even more elated because he is rid of
his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of an enormous advance gives both sides more freedom,
according to King. ``You become a partner in how the book does and
you're not expecting somebody to take the fall if the book does
badly,'' he said. ``The problem with the big advance today,
particularly for a writer who has sold as well as I have in the
past, is that it says to the publisher that `all I'm doing is
taking out flop insurance.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the author is so content with the partnership that he
describes it as a ``honeymoon cruise'' with executives at his new
imprint, Scribner, who ``make me feel like I'm 35.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, he said, in his ``marriage with Viking, I played
the woman's part. I felt like the little housewife who stays home
and works all day, while my husband is out taking all the credit
and sporting around town in his nice tailored suit. And I felt that
I wasn't being respected and I was being taken for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   With the merger of Viking's parent into the Penguin Putnam
Group, King said he felt he was caught in a power struggle between
top executives in the different companies. Putnam, he said, already
had megaselling authors like Tom Clancy and Patricia Cornwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clancy sells more copies than I do and Phyllis Grann is their
rabbi, simple as that,'' he said, referring to Penguin Putnam's
president, who makes bit appearances in ``Bag of Bones'' as a
doting publisher willing to help the novelist protagonist ``with
almost any concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grann declined to comment on the past negotiations. Several
associates of King with knowledge of those talks, though, said the
company did make serious efforts to keep him; one person, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said King was nervous that the
publishing house had become ``Tom Clancy's company and he had this
incredible competition with Clancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now King and his new partner, Simon &AMP; Schuster, have settled on
a strategy to try to increase his sales _ which had seemed to reach
a plateau of less than 1.3 million copies _ by seeking lapsed
readers through appeals promoting the writing quality in ``Bag of
Bones'' or highlighting its romance elements.
</P>
<P>
   Focus groups, a rarely used expensive research tool in the
publishing industry, met for four nights to analyze the ``Bag of
Bones'' manuscript and to discuss what makes readers run to buy
Stephen King books or to bolt in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that a lot of people who had fallen away were
women,'' King said of the research results that, he added, did not
affect the book's editing. ``A lot of them felt that I was writing
strictly horror stories and I knew that wasn't true. And I've
always been a little shy about saying, `Now, wait a minute, I'm a
lot more than just a horror writer' because it sounds so
conceited.'''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   That became the task of Scribner's publisher, Susan Moldow, who
personally promoted the title among booksellers in places like
Michigan and Alabama in the hopes that the book would reach new
readers through positive word-of-mouth reviews from bookstore
employees.
</P>
<P>
   It was her view that many people knew King's work through movies
or television series, but, surprisingly, not through his own words.
``The best way to address that is to get as many people as possible
to read him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So she sent personal notes to many of her personal contacts in
bookstores, pointing out that ``any woman who has proved
susceptible to the charms of `Rebecca''' would be intrigued by
King's ``surprising update of Daphne du Maurier's world of
festering secrets.'' The company's executives worked with large
discount chains like Wal-Mart Stores and Costco's Price Club to
develop special displays and a special collector's edition of a
Stephen King magazine. Viacom offered billboard space to promote
the book and television commercials in its Blockbuster video
stores.
</P>
<P>
   With a bigger stake in the deal, King made more of a personal
effort to promote the book, submitting to a rare publicity tour and
the questions of late-night talk-show hosts and reporters _ a
process that his novelist hero in ``Bag of Bones'' compares to
being sushi at a sushi bar.
</P>
<P>
   Though he does not say it himself, King's longtime personal
editor, Charles Verrill, said the author considers his new novel
one of the best of the more than 40 he has written. The book's plot
centers on a popular author who develops a severe case of writer's
block in the aftermath of his wife's death. After years of literary
drought, the writer retreats to his vacation home in western Maine
where he encounters ghosts and romance with a young mother caught
in a child-custody struggle with her wealthy father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that he loves this book had a great deal to
do with the failure of negotiations. He finished the book as he
turned 50,'' Verrill said, referring to the negotiations with
Penguin Putnam. ``I think that psychologically he was offered a
little bit less for a novel that he loved so dearly and, at this
point in his career, it came as a kind of wound or blow. Money was
the language. Money was the gesture and the gesture came as a
blow.''
</P>
<P>
   But expanding King's base is in some ways a delicate task. By
emphasizing romance elements, the publisher also risks turning off
loyal readers who are drawn to King's work for plots stressing
horror and the supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure this is the real Stephen King or is this a
mask that he's putting on for this particular book,'' said Jim
Farrelly, a professor of English at the University of Dayton who
had been teaching courses featuring King's books for almost as long
as King's career. ``I'm really convinced that I'm not going to
teach it in my class. The romance is really like going back to
soft-core horror instead of hard-core horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far the effort to reach new readers has had mixed results,
though the publishers say they have shipped out more than 1.55
million copies, an increase from the past.
</P>
<P>
   Though the publisher was clearly trying to reach up-market
customers, King's new novel has actually shown the most growth in
the large discount chains like Wal-Mart or Dayton Hudson Corp.'s
Target chain. Still, the Borders bookstore chain, which draws an
older, affluent base of customers, also reports that King's sales
have grown with this book, and Ms. Muldow said sales are obviously
up in online bookstores, a sales outlet that didn't exist 19 years
ago when King had his first best seller, ``The Dead Zone.'' Sales,
though, have remained average at mall stores, which draw younger,
more impulsive buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that it could sell better than anything I've
done in years,'' said King, who at times sounds very much like the
novelist protagonist in his new book. ``I've been in this business
for 25 years and there is an arc. It's a lot slower for novelists
than it is for comics and singers and I'm grateful for that.''

`SIDE MAN': A NEW DRAMA ON BROADWAY AND A NEW SON IN TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Talk about a play with legs: ``Side Man'' has been
using them on a veritable walking tour of Manhattan. The
production's unusual journey began last spring with a brief,
acclaimed run in a little off-Broadway theater and continued with a
successful move for the summer to the main stage of the normally
revival-driven Roundabout Theater Company.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``Side Man'' has entered an even unlikelier phase of its
nomadic life, leaving the relative security of nonprofit theater
for a commercial Broadway run at the 800-seat John Golden Theater.
The significance of the drama's rise, and the bravery of its
producers, should not be understated. Although in recent years new
musicals like ``Rent'' and ``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk''
have moved popularly and profitably from off-Broadway, uprooting a
new straight play to Broadway is an altogether iffier proposition
because the production can't count on the musical-devouring tourist
trade or on the kind of built-in hype that often attends a glittery
London transfer. Its survival depends on a smaller, specialized
audience of serious playgoers, many of whom may already have
discovered it.
</P>
<P>
   The odds, therefore, may be especially long on Warren Leight's
lovely ``Side Man,'' which reopened Sunday night. The show is such
an anomaly on Broadway, a tender, deeply personal memory play about
the turmoil in the family of a jazz musician as his career crumbles
at the dawn of the age of rock-and-roll, that seeing it on a big
stage is like peering at Broadway through the giant stereopticons
of ``Ragtime.'' It's a gentle reminder of bygone days, when a new
play by Tennessee Williams or William Inge would stir up the public
and fill seats for months.
</P>
<P>
   In its depiction of a young man struggling to remain the glue in
the troubled marriage of his vacant, trumpet-playing father and
unbalanced, alcoholic mother, the play has an abiding power,
although of a muted variety. (Men, I think, whose fathers were
emotionally unavailable will respond especially strongly to the
hero's predicament.) But if you go to ``Side Man'' expecting tour
de force portrayals or actorly pyrotechnics, you're liable to feel
as if you've walked into the wrong neighborhood. Go instead for the
more refined pleasures of Leight's offbeat story and his
true-to-life, as opposed to larger-than-life, characters.
</P>
<P>
   The production, directed by Michael Mayer, is practically a
mirror of its Roundabout incarnation, with one important exception:
the addition to the cast of the movie actor Christian Slater in the
central role of Clifford, the play's put-upon son and narrator.
(Robert Sella, the role's originator, left to fill in for Alan
Cumming as the M.C. in ``Cabaret.'')
</P>
<P>
   Slater's performance is courageously economical and without
showiness; it retains the actor's cinematic sense of containment in
close-up. This works extremely well in a role that is all about the
witnessing, absorbing and denying of pain. His composure pays off
remarkably at the play's subtle climax, when Clifford must
thoroughly assume the role of parent to his parents and cast his
ineffectual father, Gene (played by Frank Wood), out of the
family's apartment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The actor never overplays Clifford's festering anger. It's
expressed, in fact, only once, when Gene suggests that he has no
responsibility for the pathetic condition of his wife, Terry (Wendy
Makkena), now confined to a psychiatric hospital. Disgusted, Slater
sends Wood flying helplessly into a chair. Suddenly aware of his
power, and inclined to use it, the son has taken control. Slater
pulls this off so unself-consciously that you believe in it as an
act of frustrated love rather than rage.
</P>
<P>
   Alternating between the family's apartment and Gene's world of
versatile, freelance jazz musicians _ the side men of the title _
the play conjures an extremely specific slice of New York City
between 1953 and 1985. It pairs the story of the decline of jazz
with the disintegration of Clifford's family, and yet some of the
moodier interludes erupt with astonishing joy, as when, in
flashback, Gene woos Terry with a bluesy trumpet version of
Debussy.
</P>
<P>
   No moment is better than the one in which Gene, sitting with two
of his cronies, played delightfully by Michael Mastro and Joseph
Lyle Taylor, is swept away listening to a cassette of a
heartache-filled trumpet solo. Wood's rapture is even more
wrenching than the music.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer holds onto much of what made ``Side Man'' so touching, but
a few things have also slipped in the move around the corner to
West 45th Street. It may be that the actors are too conscious of
the higher stakes on Broadway because they are now misguidedly
pushing things, trying to convince us that this is a punchier, more
monumental play than written.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Makkena, saddled with the difficult job of ending Act I with
the declaration of a not-very-potent threat, has become intolerably
broad and cartoonish. This is only partly her fault. Terry is the
play's toughest role, consisting largely of volume-raising rants
and pitiful tears. How many ways can an actor do meltdown? And the
gang of jazz men suddenly seems to be actively courting audiences
(and Tony voters) by telegraphing the laugh lines, which, of
course, only makes the laughs harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of ``Side Man'' is that it holds its characters
accountable and, with affection and efficiency, tells us things
about people in a quirky little cul-de-sac that reminds us of
people in our own imperfect worlds. This honesty and directness is
what makes it a vital and refreshing experience, and what, if
anything in the unpredictable whirlpool of Broadway, will sustain
it.

CLINTON'S INTERNET ENVOY TO RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ira Magaziner, the author of the Clinton
administration's ill-fated national health plan, who most recently
has led government efforts to foster the growth of the Internet and
electronic commerce, said Friday that he would leave the White
House before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as the administration prepares to turn
over governance of the Internet to a private, multinational
organization and heads into a period of presumably tough
negotiations with the European Union over data-privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner, a senior assistant to the president for policy
development, has led a push for industry self-regulation of how
personal data on consumers is collected and used, a stance that has
placed the United States at odds with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that he was satisfied he had completed the
main job by moving the broad issue of electronic commerce onto the
world's agenda. Although he has not set a departure date and was
not prepared to say what he would do next, Magaziner said he hoped
to wrap up his duties in the next month and move back to
Providence, R.I. His wife and children moved back there a year ago,
and he has been commuting since then.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner joined the administration five and a half years ago to
draft what turned out to be a doomed effort to create a national
health care system. Then he turned to the Internet, where he has
been aggressively trying to shape domestic and international policy
for electronic commerce and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping win passage of two federal laws imposing
a moratorium on new Internet taxes and protecting digital age
copyrights, he successfully pushed for international agreements to
keep the Internet duty-free and to set standards for international
payment systems.
</P>
<P>
   Brian O'Shaughnessy of the Internet Alliance, an association of
companies with Internet interests, said: ``I think it's pretty
clear to say that at a time when there was a lot of confusion about
where the industry was going both domestically and internationally,
Ira Magaziner was the guy who rolled up his sleeves and got into
the nitty-gritty of how technology works, what the effect would be
on our society, and then took those notions and began to be the
evangelist for the Internet industry in a global marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, after studying the Internet for 15 months,
Magaziner released the administration's ``Framework for Electronic
Commerce,'' which called for a hands-off, market-driven approach to
Internet regulation. His philosophy then and now is that while the
Internet is growing rapidly, it could be slowed by government
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has led efforts to hand administration of the
network over to private ownership and has traveled widely, pushing
other nations to endorse his tax-free, unregulated approach to the
medium.

   Trial to Start for Joe Camel
</P>
<P>
   Joe Camel, the advertising icon that became a powerful symbol to
critics of the tobacco industry, will go on trial Monday, more than
a year after he was retired by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco. The case is
the culmination of an eight-year struggle between the Federal Trade
Commission and Reynolds over the campaign, which the commission
contended was an unfair trade practice because it used Joe Camel to
attract children and adolescents to cigarettes.

   `Jerry Springer' Warms Back Up
</P>
<P>
   Despite promises earlier this year by the owner of ``The Jerry
Springer Show'' to tone down the program's violence, the brawling
or attempted brawling have resumed, along with so many bleeps that
it is often impossible to follow the dialogue, and the show's
ratings have risen in tandem with its ribaldry.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner to Leave Government
</P>
<P>
   Ira Magaziner, who has led government efforts to foster the
growth of the Internet and electronic commerce, said he would leave
the White House before the end of the year. The announcement comes
as the government prepares to turn over governance of the Internet
to a private multinational organization and as it heads into a

   Thrust and Parry at Microsoft Trial
</P>
<P>
   As its antitrust trial moves into the fourth week, Microsoft
finds itself trying to deflect a flood of allegations of threats
and bribes. The Justice Department contends that the digital-age
monopolist showed up in the doorway, brandishing a club in one hand
while offering price discounts and marketing support with the
other. Microsoft insists that consumers are not being hurt by its
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal Differences in Capital
</P>
<P>
   Different attitudes toward venture financing at established
technology companies on the East and West coasts have resulted in
very different environments for the incubation of high-technology
start-ups in Silicon Alley and Silicon Valley. On the West Coast,
entrepreneurs routinely seek out larger established technology
companies as part of the start-up process. On the East Coast, the
corporate-to-entrepreneur network is not as evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Separate Home for Public Relations
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp departure from other journalism schools, which have
incorporated advertising and public relations under the rubric of
mass communications, the University of Maryland's College of
Journalism has dropped public relations, which will be part of a
communications program in another department.

   A variety of inclement conditions are expected from the southern
Rockies to the northeast Plains as a large disturbance redevelops
over Kansas. Travel will be difficult through the high ground of
southern Colorado and northern New Mexico due to periods of snow
whipped by 40 mile an hour winds. Light to moderate snow will fall
in the mountains of Wyoming and across much of Montana. Flurries
are expected in higher elevations of Idaho and central Utah.
</P>
<P>
   A corridor of warmer and more moist air will stream inland from
the western Gulf of Mexico into the Mississippi Valley. Bands of
showers and a few thunderstorms are likely in the central and
eastern Gulf States, except for Florida where sunshine will
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing warm air will be resisted by retreating chilly air in
the Ohio and upper Mississippi Valleys. As a result, rain will
develop from northern Illinois westward across Iowa to eastern
Nebraska. Farther north, a mixture of snow, sleet and rain is
expected from central Wisconsin to eastern South Dakota. Wet snow
should accumulate between two and four inches in an area from
northwest Wisconsin to central North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure stretching from the eastern Carolinas to southern
Quebec will sponsor near seasonal readings from the Northeast to
the Middle Atlantic States. Clouds and some fog will cover the
Appalachians as ribbons of clouds drift across southern New England
and the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler air will be ushered into California on gusty winds.
Clouds will yield to sun in the deserts. The Northwest will be
chilly with limited sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: First of the Season
</P>
<P>
   The first rain in several weeks dampened the interior Southeast
on Sunday morning and the first significant snows fell on the high
plains of central Colorado on Saturday. Each of these events
signify a shift from the prevailing weather pattern. Indeed,
Atlanta had measured only a quarter of an inch of rain since late
September, while Denver finally noticed its first inch of snow this
season, about three weeks later than usual. The jet stream will
undergo a large transformation this week which will produce many
more firsts of the season from the West Coast to the Great Lakes.

   The poor showing by the Republicans in the elections last week
reinforced what public-opinion polls have indicated for months _
people are sick and tired of the Clinton-Lewinsky investigation.
But they are evidently not that sick and tired.
</P>
<P>
   Since first reports of President Clinton's extramarital affair
broke in January, the weekly television ratings of the 24-hour news
networks like Time-Warner Inc.'s CNN; MSNBC, owned by both General
Electric and Microsoft; and the Fox News Channel of News Corp. have
spiked each time there has been a significant development in the
case. You could hardly blame the networks for hoping for long,
drawn-out impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   For the week that ended on Aug. 23, after Clinton acknowledged
having an inappropriate relationship, the networks had their
highest ratings of the year. Even the elections, which generally
are events that play to the networks' strengths, failed to approach
the ratings of turning points in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of news magazines have also been bolstered. In the first
half of the year, the issues that appeared after reports of the
relationship emerged were the top newsstand sellers for Newsweek
and U.S. News &AMP; World Report and ranked No. 2 for Time behind a
cover story on a man named Jordan (Michael, not Vernon).

   DIPLOMATIC-COST _ WASHINGTON _ For decades the American
government has tried to woo foreigners, coax them to come to
American colleges, bring selected leaders over for all-expense-paid
visits, and work to win friends and influence opinion leaders from
192 outposts abroad. Is this all needed in the post-Cold War world
at a time when foreigners need only turn on their TV sets to see
American programs? Critics say it's a waste of money. Defenders say
this $400 million a year public relations effort is still needed.
After all, does TV's ``Baywatch'' represent America? (Malone, Cox

   NEW YORK _ When does a magazine go too far?
</P>
<P>
   New York magazine went too far last week, said David Watkins,
the president and chief executive of Icon Life Style Marketing, the
firm that planned and promoted the ballyhooed 29th birthday party
for the rap impresario Sean ``Puffy'' Combs on Wednesday. More than
7,000 people showed up at the party, and the New York Police
Department shut down the five blocks around the downtown restaurant
where it was going on.
</P>
<P>
   In a short item in its Gotham section, the magazine listed the
private RSVP phone number that had been sent to the 1,200 birthday
guests, who had received velvet-wrapped videotaped invitations to
the party. The New York item read in part: ``Why not strike a blow
against velvet-rope snobbery: Bring a crowd and make some noise.
Where? Just call ...'' _ and then it gave the number.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said that as soon as the issue hit newsstands, Icon
began to receive 700 to 1,000 phone calls an hour and that some
early callers were lucky enough to find out the location of the
party, which was held at Cipriani Wall Street, and then spread the
word. It is unclear how many of the invited guests did a bit of
their own location-spilling.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyed, Watkins and executives at Combs' label, Bad Boy
Records, agreed to disinvite the reporters who wrote the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dealing with a celebrity like Sean, that kind of
action is really disrespectful,'' Watkins said. ``I don't think
they would have done the same thing to a celebrity like Giorgio
Armani. But the fact that it was an urban party, that it was a
hip-hop party, and the fact that it was a party for a black person
made them feel that they could invite everyone and, quite frankly,
incite a riot.''
</P>
<P>
   Was New York irresponsible in its reporting, or was this just a
chance to annoy a celebrity and generate magazine buzz?
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Miller, the editor of the magazine, said that her
conscience was clear. ``We didn't identify the day or the place,''
she said. ``What we did was make a little joke about the sheer
magnitude of the pre-party publicity with the velvet invitations
and the video and suggested that anyone who felt slighted might
call the RSVP line and make a pitch.'' She added: ``You'd think
anyone calling themselves Bad Boy Records would be able to enjoy a
little prank.''

<P>
   He's on His Way Up; No, He Resigned; Uh-Oh
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the great sweepstakes of deadline journalism,
there are winners and losers. And one of the big business stories
of last week _ James Dimon's resignation from Citigroup on Nov. 1,
a Sunday _ was a test of deadline mettle.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, Carol Loomis _ a reporter and member of the board of
editors of Time Warner's Fortune magazine _ stayed at the Fortune
offices until 10:30 p.m., trying to figure out what turmoil was
about to be unleashed at Citigroup. The company, the recently
merged product of Citicorp and Travelers Group, looked as though it
was about to undergo a shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   But deadline loomed, and because the editors of the biweekly
Fortune sign off on Friday night and the magazine starts rolling
off the presses on Saturday morning, Mrs. Loomis filed a piece that
predicted that Dimon, the president of Citigroup, would ascend to
the position of director of Citigroup's Global Capital division.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, however, Sanford Weill and John Reed, Citigroup's
co-chief executives, asked for Dimon's resignation. He complied.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, The Wall Street Journal published an article that
made its way into at least two regional editions and speculated
that Dimon was being groomed for the position of chairman of
Citigroup _ after he had already resigned. Later editions of The
Journal carried a new article saying that he had left the company.
</P>
<P>
   Things got a little nasty. Later that day, the Fortune Web site
jumped into the fray, pointing fingers at The Journal for flubbing
the story. (The reporter also said that Fortune wasn't up to speed
on the news, either.)
</P>
<P>
   Web sites and daily newspapers quickly find their way to the
trash heap, but biweekly magazines linger on. And on. After the
smoke cleared, Mrs. Loomis _ who in her spare time likes to play
online bridge with the investor Warren Buffett _ was left with a
brand-new issue of Fortune that would glare at her from newsstands
for two long weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew something big was going to happen,'' Mrs. Loomis said.
``I still don't know to this day whether I could ever have found
out under any circumstances or whether decisions were still being
made.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take out that one paragraph and the fact that the
organizational chart doesn't have three of the right people in the
right places, the story's great,'' she said. ``But we had to make a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if you're a chief executive and you're reading
this: Don't resign on Sundays.

   Bookstore Goliaths Fax to the Finish
</P>
<P>
   Book-selling heavyweights are reaching for their slingshots and
bons mots.
</P>
<P>
   After Barnes &AMP; Noble's announcement Friday of its $600 million
purchase of the United States' leading book wholesaler, Ingram Book
Co., its fierce rival Amazon.com responded with a short statement
that started a duel of news releases.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, said
that ``like other independent booksellers,'' Amazon hoped that
Ingram would treat all bookstores fairly. Ingram fills more than 58
percent of orders for Amazon, an electronic bookstore, and though
Amazon is planning to diversify its distribution system, it will
still need a business relationship with Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos then added an assurance to his customers: ``Those who make
choices that are genuinely good for customers, authors, and
publishers will prevail. Goliath is always in range of a good
slingshot.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, which has challenged Amazon.com's claim that it
is the earth's biggest bookstore _ countered with its own news
release. ``Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. is amused to read Jeff Bezos' quote
where he describes himself as an independent bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Bezos, what with market capitalization of some $6
billion and more than four million customers, we suppose you know a
Goliath when you see one. Your company is now worth more than
Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders and all of the independent booksellers
combined. Might we suggest that slingshots and potshots should not
be part of your arsenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com responded with a terse news release from its Seattle
headquarters: ``Oh.''
</P>
<P>
   Point. Counterpoint. This relationship remains a literary work
in progress.

   Court TV Schedules Some Fictional Homicide
</P>
<P>
   For five years, NBC's award-winning drama ``Homicide: Life on
the Street'' has suffered under its image as ``the best show
viewers aren't watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Court TV has had a similar rap _ a cable network that was
critically applauded but ratings-challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Now Court TV, normally an all-nonfiction channel, has acquired
the off-network rights to ``Homicide'' and will make the show its
first entertainment program, as Court TV's new president tries to
redesign the network to embrace a wider range of legal and justice
matters in various formats.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Schleiff, the new president, said the idea behind showing
``Homicide'' was ``not only to broaden the overall appeal of the
network, but also to put a spotlight on what we're trying to do
with original programming at 10 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   The new series scheduled for 10 p.m. will be ``a collection of
original programs highlighting various aspects of the justice
system,'' he said. He plans to introduce them at a major
cable-industry trade show later this month.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 p.m., Schleiff has scheduled ``Johnnie Cochran Live,'' a
revised version of the defense attorney's current show, on which
Cochran will interview guests and lead debates about legal topics.
</P>
<P>
   The hour-long episodes of ``Homicide'' will be shown at 9 p.m.
starting Jan. 1. Court TV bought them from Lifetime cable network,
which has been showing the repeats for three years.

ONE TRADEMARK LAWSUIT THAT MICROSOFT MIGHT AVOID 
UNDER A TECHNOLOGY STRAIN, EGGHEAD REMAKES ITSELF AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ONE TRADEMARK LAWSUIT THAT MICROSOFT MIGHT AVOID &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kerstein, a former McCaw Cellular Communications executive
who is now an Internet entrepreneur in Falls Church, Va., says he
has no interest in tangling with Microsoft over the use of the term
Windows 2000. But plenty of people are eager to help him try.
</P>
<P>
   After Client Server News, a the trade publication, disclosed
last week that he had both the trademark Windows2000 and the domain
name www.windows2000.com, Kerstein received more than 100 messages
in one day from people congratulating him and, in many cases,
offering to help him capitalize on the name. ``People keep telling
me I've won the lottery,'' Kerstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The presumed payoff stems from the fact that the Microsoft Corp.
announced recently that Windows 2000 would be the name for the next
version of its Windows operating system. (Unlike Kerstein's
trademark, Microsoft's product name will use a space between
Windows and 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Microsoft reportedly paid $5 million to
settle a claim brought against it by a small Internet developer
called Synet, which had sued over rights to the name Internet
Explorer that Microsoft uses for its Web-browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerstein says he has no plans to take action against
Microsoft, even though a Microsoft spokesman, Adam Soan, said
Microsoft has no intention of changing its plans to use the name.
</P>
<P>
   Kerstein holds what is known as a common-law trademark on
Windows2000 by having been the first to start using the term
commercially in early 1996. He operates a Web site that offers a
series of live camera views from around the world, including the
Eiffel Tower and the Wailing Wall in Israel and a glimpse of
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Kerstein said he is not in the business of ``domain name
blackmail,'' and that he has been put off by the number of people
encouraging him to try prying money out of Microsoft. But he said
he might someday consider offering services related to Windows 2000
software to people who happen to stumble upon his site.
</P>
<P>
   UNDER A TECHNOLOGY STRAIN, EGGHEAD REMAKES ITSELF AGAIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost a year since Egghead Software, a fallen
leader in software retailing, announced it would close the last 80
of its stores to begin anew as an Internet-only operation. Now the
company says it is ready to start over _ again. While online sales
on its three Web sites have been brisk all year, Egghead said its
technology could no longer handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   Operating under the new corporate name Egghead.com Inc., the
company, based in Portland, Ore., is rolling its three sites into
one this week (egghead.com), using technology that will enable it
to offer a broader selection of products and monitor customer
traffic more closely. And gradually, the company intends to branch
into discounted products that would include sporting goods and
digital cameras. ``Our objective is to become a value-oriented
retailer online,'' said George Orban, Egghead's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   A victim of strategic blunders, shrinking margins, and
unforeseen competition from superstores and direct sellers, the
company has not had a profitable year since 1995. The stock price,
which had edged above $25 in July and dipped below $5 by October,
closed Friday at $9.0625.

`SLOW FOOD' FAIR AIMS TO PRESERVE ENDANGERED DISHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TURIN, Italy _ The English will kill each other to protect
animals. The French fight to the death to preserve the purity of
their language. Italians, however, rarely get indignant about
anything, except food. Few other nations, for example, have so
passionate a grass-roots movement to preserve endangered species of
cheese and protect vegetable rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plants have a soul,'' playwright and Nobel prize winner Dario
Fo warned a rapt audience last week at a conference on Biodiversity
and Genetic Species on the Verge of Extinction. ``They have
feelings. And some are assassins, using poison to destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fo is one of the intellectual pillars of Slow Food, a food and
wine organization created 13 years ago by an Italian journalist,
Carlo Petrini, as an antidote to fast food. Both men were expecting
more than 100,000 people to Slow Food's Salone del Gusto, a
five-day food fair, drawing epicures dedicated to the languorous
enjoyment of slowly prepared regional delicacies. Petrini became
radicalized when he entered the Piazza di Spagna in Rome and
smelled mass-produced french fries wafting from the country's first
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Slow Food, which was begun by a group of leftist intellectuals
disenchanted by politics and disgusted by the fast-food trend, has
in the last few years become fashionable in Italy and throughout
Europe. After an initial, mostly botched effort to infiltrate the
United States eight years ago, it is now catching on via the
internet with American food and wine connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   Now with 40,000 members in 35 countries, Slow Food's manifesto
warns against ``obsessive worrying about hygienic matters'' and
pledges to preserve such endangered foods as Firiki apples from
Greece and Sicilian lattume di tonno, sperm of male tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Il Salone del Gusto, held in a giant convention center which was
once a Fiat car factory, boasts 300 regional food stands, with free
samples, 50 gourmet dinners and 325 workshops on everything from
``Cooking in the Antipodes'' to ``Hungarian Foie Gras and Tokaij,''
(or Tokay, a white wine). It is to ordinary food fairs what
Republican national conventions are to New Hampshire political
coffee klatches. Here, however, delegates vote with their forks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel how the fat gallops in your mouth,'' Piero Sardo, a
cheese expert and co-founder of Slow Food, instructed 110 gourmands
who signed up and paid $16 for last Thursday's workshop, ``Strong
Cheeses and Sweet Wines.'' He was commenting on a Stilton, served
with a Greek port wine. His students, seated at conference tables
behind six tasting glasses and a plate of cheeses labeled by
number, swallowed obediently before nibbling a French Roquefort,
which they were informed, contains ``noble'' salt levels.
</P>
<P>
   Food is not just good at these workshops, it is dripping with
history. ``Real iberico,'' a Spanish ham, comes from a breed of
pig, Cerdo Iberico, which is the direct descendant of the
Mediterranean boar that man began domesticating in Neolithic times.
Uncontaminated by any crossbreeding, raised in the Dehesa, an
ancient Mediterranean forest and fed on la bellota, a kind of
acorn, the Cerdo Iberico is a kind of ``thoroughbred swine,''
according to Giovanni Pellinghelli del Monticello, a consultant to
a guild of Iberian ham producers, who delivered the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never know what the Bollinger Louis XV drank really
tasted like,'' he said sadly, referring to phylloxera, a disease
that destroyed European vines in the late 19th century. ``But this
pig is an uncontaminated breed, its ham today has exactly the same
taste it had when it was eaten by Charles V of Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   French, British and American history buffs are known for their
re-enactments of famous battles _ Austerlitz, Waterloo or
Gettysburg. Italians prefer to dwell on the great meals of history.
Actually, so do their American acolytes. Patrick Martins, a Slow
Food activist based in Bra, a food-obsessed town in Piedmont,
Italy, wrote his thesis at New York University on Medieval Food
Sculptures, which, among other things, involved molding asparagus
into a giant chess-set.
</P>
<P>
   Fo and others complain about multinationals, which favor mass
production and have steadily reduced the world's varieties. At the
turn of the century, there were 30,000 varieties of rice in India.
Now, there only 12.
</P>
<P>
   But the public also prefers convenience, speed and lower prices.
``Our real enemy is the obtuse consumer,'' Sardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the Salone, even among the initiated, there were some
Slow Food recidivists. Lorenzo Molinacci, 42, who makes Panforte di
Siena, a sophisticated brand of fruitcake, was discovered at
lunchtime wolfing down a prefabricated prosciutto sandwich at the
Autogrille, an Italian fast-foot outlet inside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else could I do,'' he said sheepishly. ``I'm very busy
and I had to go somewhere and eat fast.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Post-modern food tastings at the fair were provided by theater
director Silvio Panini, who created a ``degustazione teatrale,'' in
which the diners, wearing earphones and seated at stark steel
tables, sample tiny drops of balsamic vinegar and minimalist
morsels of parmigiano while a performance artist recites sensual
eating instructions. ``Agriculture is an aesthetic,'' Panini
explained.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas, it is also a dying art. Lard from the region
surrounding Carrara, which was the basic food for the marble
workers who supplied Michelangelo, is in danger of extinction,
according to Slow Food. ``Pigs today are small and too meaty,
everyone wants pork-light,'' complained Marino Giannarelli, 50,
whose family firm, Lardo di Colonnata, produces a small amount of
extremely thick, succulent lard.
</P>
<P>
   The Caciocavallo Podolico is a rare, fragrant cheese from the
Campania region, which relies on finicky free-range white cows, who
will only give milk if their calves are standing near them, and
even then, only a few liters a day. ``You have to be a hero to make
it,'' Sardo said. ``And also a bit crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   A kilo of Caciocavallo Podolico costs $37, three times as much
as more ordinary varieties of Caciocavallo. To raise consumer
consciousness, Antonio Madaio, a processor from Eboli, has begun
selling three-pound balls of his cheese in wooden trophy boxes,
with a certificate attached.
</P>
<P>
   Participants ranged from Jonathan White, an artisanal
cheese-maker from Peekskill, N.Y. who makes butter for the White
House, to some of the world's most high-minded chefs. Miguel
Sanchez Romera, 45, for example, is a neurologist who on weekends
cooks Spanish nouvelle cuisine at his restaurant, L'Esguard, in a
small town outside Barcelona. He was one of three chefs selected to
prepare a three-course, $178 gourmet meal for 36 people, which
included a dish of egg and caviar inspired by Van Gogh's
Sunflowers. Romera gave a lecture explaining the neurological
impulses of appetite.

PINOCHET ISSUES FIRST STATEMENT SINCE HIS ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator,
said Sunday that he was ``hurt and bewildered'' by his arrest in
London, and he vowed to fight ``with all my spirit'' attempts to
extradite him to Spain to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Sunday morning from the private clinic
where he is recovering from back surgery, the 82-year-old general
said: ``A show trial in Spain, a foreign land, is not justice. It
is certainly not British justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was taken into custody on Oct. 16 in a surprise arrest
by British police acting on an extradition request from a Spanish
magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, who is investigating atrocities
committed during the ``dirty wars'' in Latin America in the 1970s
and 1980s. Garzon wants to bring charges of genocide, torture and
terrorism against him in the loss of more than 3,000 lives in Chile
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28, the High Court in London ruled that Pinochet enjoyed
immunity from arrest and prosecution because he was a former head
of state, but they ordered him to remain here under police guard
while an appeal of that decision is argued. That appeal is now
before the law lords of the House of Lords, England's highest
court, and a third day of arguments is scheduled Monday, with a
final decision on the general's liberty to leave Britain expected
later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys seeking a reversal of the High Court order argued last
week that crimes against humanity historically were never protected
by sovereign immunity and that some of the charges against Pinochet
date to a military junta period in which he was not the head of
state of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement Sunday, the first word from Pinochet since the
episode began, he said that he was lying in his hospital bed when
his wife told him of his arrest. ``She was in tears as she tried to
speak,'' he said. ``I was hurt and bewildered.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the peaceful future of countries that had experienced
internal conflict lay in ``reconciliation,'' and he said that ``in
Chile as elsewhere, recrimination is the enemy of reconciliation.''
He cited Spain, South Africa and Northern Ireland as positive
examples where ``wide decisions have been made not to revisit the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening up of old wounds, bringing back into debate issues
where the true facts have long since been forgotten, serves no
purpose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In that connection, he said that reports of what took place in
his own country had been ``a travesty of the truth'' and that he as
a result had become victimized by ``spurious attempts by foreign
prosecutors to convict me on unproven charges.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was heartened by the support of the Chilean
government but made no mention of the divided sentiments among the
people of Chile over his fate. ``My fellow citizens have come to
terms with our nation's past,'' he said. ``They are my true judges.
That is why I shall fight this extradition request with all my
spirit, supported by the president and government of my country.
And God willing, I shall return home to Chile with my family where
I hope to live the last years of my life in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave a version of Chile's recent history and his role in it
at odds with that of his opponents who accuse him of the bloody
overthrow of a democratically elected government and a systematic
campaign of torture, kidnapping and murdering to keep himself in
power. In 1973 under President Salvador Allende Gossens, he said,
he took over the country because it was ``crippled'' by
governmental chaos, and a Soviet-style insurrection was being
planned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I have lived with my conscience and my own memories for over a
quarter of a century since the events of 1973,'' he said. ``I wish
things could have been different. I wish Allende had left of his
own accord with the guarantees of safety I offered to him. In the
end he chose not to take this course. Instead he chose suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``I am clear in my mind that the return to Chile of
true democracy, and from that the true freedom to which all
individual people are entitled could not have been achieved without
the removal of the Marxist government.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that many freedoms were lost ``for a brief period
during the early 1970s.'' Then added: ``Yes, it took time to bring
them back. But I regard it as my greatest achievement that these
freedoms did indeed return.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was dismayed with Britain, a country he has always
expressed fondness for and that he supported in the 1982 Falkland
Islands war with Argentina. ``I am saddened that the experience of
my arrest has shaken my belief in Britain. Previously, I never
doubted that Britain was a country where people may move about
freely.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government backed Garzon's extradition action in a
Cabinet vote Friday, provoking an angry response from Chile, which
withdrew its ambassador to Madrid. The British government has said
that the Pinochet case is a judicial one between magistrates in two
European countries and that it therefore cannot act on requests
from people like Margaret Thatcher to free the general and let him
return home. Pinochet had tea in Thatcher's home shortly before his
arrest.

 By JAMES C. McKINLEY JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Jose Antonio Amaya Garcia has lived long
enough to survive three hurricanes, but the devastation wrought on
Central America by the gargantuan maelstrom known as Mitch took
even him by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a punishment from God,'' Amaya, an elderly carpenter,
said late last week as he searched under an avalanche for what was
left of his house. He is tiny and frail in his soiled shirt and
pants, the last clothing he owns. ``I am 73, and I've never seen a
disaster like this.''
</P>
<P>
   As the scope of the devastation became clear, many Central
Americans like Amaya were wondering what had hit them. No other
hurricane in modern history has wreaked such havoc and death in
this region, no stranger to these tempests of nature. But unlike
past storms that struck hard and moved on, this hurricane stalled
just off Honduras' north coast for four days, dumping several feet
of water on Central America even as it lost power.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for two more days, it crawled across Central America from
the Atlantic coast of the isthmus to the Pacific coast, before
turning west, raking Guatemala and El Salvador, and moving into
southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It was the rain, not the storm's winds, that did the most
damage. The torrential downpours spawned floods and avalanches that
killed more than 10,000, erased entire villages, devastated crops
and destroyed much of the infrastructure in Honduras, Guatemala, El
Salvador and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitch took a walk through all our territory,'' said Martin
Baide, a spokesman for the Honduran president's office.
</P>
<P>
   The freakish behavior of the storm is the major reason it caught
governments and people off guard. But the high death toll also owes
something to poverty and politics. Most working-class houses are
poorly built, and many impoverished people erect their homes, often
illegally but with a wink from local politicians, on marginal lands
close to rivers or clinging to unstable mountain slopes that have
been stripped of trees.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, many people did not heed government warnings on
the radio to abandon riversides and coastal regions for higher
ground. Many Hondurans remembered Hurricane Fifi in 1974 and
Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, huge storms that concentrated their fury
on the north coast of the hilly country but did not move inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the hurricanes that have come by have only touched the bay
islands and the north coast,'' said Dr. Marcio Galo, a government
physician. ``In Tegucigalpa we didn't expect such a quantity of
water would fall or would cause such damage. And we never expected
it would affect the south too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second week of October, an unremarkable atmospheric
disturbance, accompanied by thunderstorms, moved west out of the
Sahel in Africa and into the Atlantic Ocean. A hundred or so of
these tropical waves, as meteorologists call them, do the same
every summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   For a week the tropical wave that would become a hurricane
raised few alarms as it crossed the ocean, eventually reaching the
eastern Caribbean, near the Lesser Antilles, on Oct. 19. It was
just another band of thunderstorms, and nine out of 10 these waves
eventually dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see thunderstorms every day,'' said John Guiney, a
hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
``The key thing is persistence.''
</P>
<P>
   But this disturbance did persist, and it grew stronger as it
moved into the warm waters of the central Caribbean, where
sea-surface temperatures are well above the 80-degree mark
necessary to generate a hurricane. Over the next two days, it
sucked up moisture and heat and its winds began to rise.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21 scientists at the Miami center determined that the
pinwheel-shaped storm had become a tropical depression, as baby
hurricanes are known, and they dubbed it Mitch, in accordance with
their alphabetical list. It was 360 miles due south of Kingston,
Jamaica, moving northward.
</P>
<P>
   By the next afternoon, the hurricane's winds had risen to about
45 miles an hour, and it was classified a tropical storm. But it
still offered no clue to U.S. Air Force scientists who flew over it
in a specially outfitted C-130 cargo plane of what it would become.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really wasn't much of a center,'' recalled Maj. Rich
Harter, a meteorologist on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The night of Oct. 22 and through the next day, everything
changed. The storm exploded in size and ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   By Oct. 24 it was a full-blown hurricane with 90 mile-an-hour
winds, about 200 miles south-southwest of Kingston and inching
north at seven miles an hour. Though the storm was far out at sea,
torrential rains hit Costa Rica, causing floods that killed seven
people.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba and Jamaica began preparing for the impact, but on Oct. 25
the storm veered westward and ambled menacingly toward the Yucatan
Peninsula. People in Belize and Mexico braced for the worst. Dozens
of foreign journalists traveled to the resort city of Cancun,
Mexico, to cover the storm.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, Oct. 26, the hurricane had became a true monster,
with winds of 180 miles an hour, moving west. Although the eye of
the storm was 100 miles north of the Honduran coast, heavy rains
began falling across Central America. The barometric pressure at
the center _ a standard measure of intensity _ fell to 905
millibars, tying it with Camille in 1969 for the fourth-strongest
Atlantic hurricane on record.
</P>
<P>
   To meteorologists, it was beautiful, a true marvel of nature.
The Air Force reservists who flew into it, members of a crew based
in Biloxi. Miss., called the Hurricane Hunters, saw a perfect
bowl-shaped mass of clouds around a clear center, with circular
tiers like a football arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all in awe,'' said Guiney, in Miami. ``This was the
atmosphere at its worst in terms of its impact on man.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, nature's caprice intervened once more, in the form of a
high-pressure system north of the hurricane. These east-west winds
deflected the hurricane and steered it west before slackening and
leaving the storm drifting aimlessly off the Honduran coast, often
hovering over one spot in the ocean, churning up cold water from
deeper in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of a Honduran island, Guanaja, had to take cover
on the afternoon of Monday, Oct. 26. They spent a hellish three
days as the storm meandered. Vacationers in the resort at Posada
del Sol described days of listening to a shrieking wind outside
their cement compound, like a freight train or jet engine. Many of
the island's 5,000 residents waited out the storm in a protected
canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Pagoada, 48, a land surveyor, weathered the storm with 12
other people inside a fishing trawler pulled up on a beach behind a
seawall. Although the group had food and water, he said, they
nearly lost their composure by the third day of screaming winds and
high surf pounding the wall. ``We didn't know if the sea was going
to bury us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane destroyed most houses on the island, tore boats
from their docks and knocked out all power and telephones. Flowers
and greenery were blown away, leaving a barren landscape, with only
tree trunks protruding from denuded hills, Pagoada said. Six people
were killed. ``It was just luck, luck, simple luck that I
survived,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Thursday, Oct. 29, the hurricane hit the hilly
north coast of Honduras, near Trujillo. Its winds slackened to 60
miles an hour, downgrading it to a garden-variety tropical storm.
But it produced enormous downpours throughout the region. Harter,
of the Hurricane Hunters, said flying through the storm at that
point ``was like being in a shaky car wash for about six hours.''
</P>
<P>
   As it wandered across Honduras over the next 48 hours, the storm
dumped as much as two feet of rain a day in some locations,
according to unofficial estimates. The rivers and creeks lacing
Honduras' mountainous countryside quickly swelled to several times
their normal size, flooding entire towns and neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In the north, the floods destroyed vast banana plantations
belonging to American companies and damaged coffee crops. Countless
families were stranded on rooftops, surrounded by water. Countless
others drowned as they struggled to find higher ground.
Communications were knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, the Choluteca River had put many parts of
the capital, Tegucigalpa, under water. Factories, hospitals,
prisons and several neighborhoods were swept away, along with
livestock and an unknown number of people. People living next to
the river abandoned houses and sought shelter on higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went by in the river,'' said Alejandro Isaguire, a
35-year-old farm worker. ``Cattle, cars, tires, buses,
refrigerators. It was scary. It made me pray to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday and in the early hours of Saturday, the true horrors
began. Across Honduras, landslides and avalanches buried whole
villages and destroyed dozens of poor neighborhoods in major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Zelaya Gomez, 73, was asleep in his bed with his wife when
his house was destroyed in a landslide that took the lives of at
least 13 people, including his daughter and granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear the noise because I was sleeping,'' he said.
``But when I woke, I felt that the walls were falling in. I grabbed
my wife and we left our room and went into the corridor. There was
this enormous crash.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple made it out of the wreck, only to find most
neighbors' houses had slid into a river below or collapsed in an
avalanche. With the earth still moving under his feet and the rain
continuing to fall, Zelaya tried desperately to pull friends and
relatives from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later there was another rumbling from the
mountainside. The survivors fled just before a second landslide
took everything left of the homes down into the river below.
</P>
<P>
   Some riverside communities, like Morolica in southern Honduras,
were entirely washed away. The floods destroyed dozens of shrimp
farms and melon plantations in the south. Scores of bridges were
knocked out, along with power and telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no place was harder hit than Casita Volcano, in
northwestern Nicaragua, near the town of Posoltega and close to the
border with Honduras. The incessant rains filled the volcano's
crater with water, creating a lake. On Friday afternoon, the
crater's wall gave way, burying about 14 villages in mud and
killing at least 1,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like a desert littered with buried bodies,'' said the
mayor of Posoltega, Felicita Zeledon.
</P>
<P>
   News of the catastrophes was slow to emerge. By Saturday
morning, Oct. 31, communications systems were crippled and all the
major roads impassable in Honduras and much of Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the storm was not yet finished. Unwinding and slowing
down, Mitch moved west across Honduras on Saturday, then raked
through Guatemala and El Salvador on Sunday, finally losing power
that afternoon as it entered Mexico, near Tapachula.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as skies cleared somewhat, the scale of the disaster
became apparent. ``We have before us a panorama of death,
desolation and ruin throughout the entire country,'' the Honduran
president, Carlos Flores Facusse, told his stunned nation in an
address that evening.
</P>
<P>
   La Ceiba, in the north, was flooded and cut off by downed
bridges. The second-largest city and economic hub, San Pedro Sula,
was under a meter of water and its airport was badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The road linking the capital to San Pedro Sula and the Caribbean
port at Cortes was cut, as was the road from the capital to the
Pacific Coast. Much of downtown Choluteca, the economic engine of
the south, had been buried in mud. Government officials say
Honduras has lost most of its coffee and banana crops, worth about
$500 million, and about 70 percent of the year's grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tragic what has happened to us,'' said Marco Polo
Michiletti, the deputy minister for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Central America, hundreds of towns found themselves
cut off, unable to get shipments of food or medicine and without
clean water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are completely incommunicado,'' said Juan Francisco
Alvarez, mayor of Soledad, when a Mexican helicopter arrived with a
small shipment of food last week. His community lost 14 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of our roads are damaged,'' he said, wearily
ticking off the town's woes. ``All the bridges are out. There is no
electricity. There are no telephones. We are rationing food.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, the U.S Air Force began search-and-rescue
helicopter operations from Palmerola, about 30 miles northwest of
the capital, plucking more than 670 people from roofs and trees
over the next three days. More than 600,000 homeless people were
crammed into schools, churches and other temporary shelters.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, more help arrived. Mexico sent helicopters, cargo
planes, troops trained in rescue missions and 700 tons of food.
Japan pledged to repair two crucial bridges. The United States
followed suit, pledging $70 million to help rebuild Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   As the week wore on, Tegucigalpa grew tense. Prices rose and
food disappeared rapidly from grocery shelves. Hundreds of cars
lined up at gasoline stations, where armed guards kept order. The
government instituted a nightime curfew and banned the drinking of
alcohol to combat looting. Desperate people dug through the muddy
rubble of former stores, looking for canned goods.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday the main highway linking Tegucigalpa to Port Cortes
was reopened after engineers, working 24 hours a day, filled in the
gaping ravine left when water washed away a culvert. Trucks
carrying fuel and food began reaching the capital.
</P>
<P>
   As the waters receded, more and more bodies were discovered.
Although the bodies of most of the 6,400 people the government
estimates were killed in Honduras may never be found, the hurricane
appears to have been the Atlantic's deadliest in two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa, only 20 bodies have been recovered. Hundreds
have been reported missing, and are presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge number of people are buried,'' the city coroner, Dr.
Lucy Marrder, said. ``There are entire settlements that are buried
and they haven't recovered the bodies.''

<P>
   TURIN, Italy _ The English will kill each other to protect
animals. The French fight to the death to preserve the purity of
their language. Italians, however, rarely get indignant about
anything, except food. Few other nations, for example, have so
passionate a grass-roots movement to preserve endangered species of
cheese and protect vegetable rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plants have a soul,'' playwright and Nobel prize winner Dario
Fo warned a rapt audience last week at a conference on Biodiversity
and Genetic Species on the Verge of Extinction. ``They have
feelings. And some are assassins, using poison to destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fo is one of the intellectual pillars of Slow Food, a food and
wine organization created 13 years ago by an Italian journalist,
Carlo Petrini, as an antidote to fast food. Both men were expecting
more than 100,000 people to Slow Food's Salone del Gusto, a
five-day food fair, drawing epicures dedicated to the languorous
enjoyment of slowly prepared regional delicacies. Petrini became
radicalized when he entered the Piazza di Spagna in Rome and
smelled mass-produced french fries wafting from the country's first
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Slow Food, which was begun by a group of leftist intellectuals
disenchanted by politics and disgusted by the fast-food trend, has
in the last few years become fashionable in Italy and throughout
Europe. After an initial, mostly botched effort to infiltrate the
United States eight years ago, it is now catching on via the
internet with American food and wine connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   Now with 40,000 members in 35 countries, Slow Food's manifesto
warns against ``obsessive worrying about hygienic matters'' and
pledges to preserve such endangered foods as Firiki apples from
Greece and Sicilian lattume di tonno, sperm of male tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Il Salone del Gusto, held in a giant convention center which was
once a Fiat car factory, boasts 300 regional food stands, with free
samples, 50 gourmet dinners and 325 workshops on everything from
``Cooking in the Antipodes'' to ``Hungarian Foie Gras and Tokaij,''
(or Tokay, a white wine). It is to ordinary food fairs what
Republican national conventions are to New Hampshire political
coffee klatches. Here, however, delegates vote with their forks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel how the fat gallops in your mouth,'' Piero Sardo, a
cheese expert and co-founder of Slow Food, instructed 110 gourmands
who signed up and paid $16 for last Thursday's workshop, ``Strong
Cheeses and Sweet Wines.'' He was commenting on a Stilton, served
with a Greek port wine. His students, seated at conference tables
behind six tasting glasses and a plate of cheeses labeled by
number, swallowed obediently before nibbling a French Roquefort,
which they were informed, contains ``noble'' salt levels.
</P>
<P>
   Food is not just good at these workshops, it is dripping with
history. ``Real iberico,'' a Spanish ham, comes from a breed of
pig, Cerdo Iberico, which is the direct descendant of the
Mediterranean boar that man began domesticating in Neolithic times.
Uncontaminated by any crossbreeding, raised in the Dehesa, an
ancient Mediterranean forest and fed on la bellota, a kind of
acorn, the Cerdo Iberico is a kind of ``thoroughbred swine,''
according to Giovanni Pellinghelli del Monticello, a consultant to
a guild of Iberian ham producers, who delivered the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never know what the Bollinger Louis XV drank really
tasted like,'' he said sadly, referring to phylloxera, a disease
that destroyed European vines in the late 19th century. ``But this
pig is an uncontaminated breed, its ham today has exactly the same
taste it had when it was eaten by Charles V of Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   French, British and American history buffs are known for their
re-enactments of famous battles _ Austerlitz, Waterloo or
Gettysburg. Italians prefer to dwell on the great meals of history.
Actually, so do their American acolytes. Patrick Martins, a Slow
Food activist based in Bra, a food-obsessed town in Piedmont,
Italy, wrote his thesis at New York University on Medieval Food
Sculptures, which, among other things, involved molding asparagus
into a giant chess-set.
</P>
<P>
   Fo and others complain about multinationals, which favor mass
production and have steadily reduced the world's varieties. At the
turn of the century, there were 30,000 varieties of rice in India.
Now, there only 12.
</P>
<P>
   But the public also prefers convenience, speed and lower prices.
``Our real enemy is the obtuse consumer,'' Sardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the Salone, even among the initiated, there were some
Slow Food recidivists. Lorenzo Molinacci, 42, who makes Panforte di
Siena, a sophisticated brand of fruitcake, was discovered at
lunchtime wolfing down a prefabricated prosciutto sandwich at the
Autogrille, an Italian fast-foot outlet inside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else could I do,'' he said sheepishly. ``I'm very busy
and I had to go somewhere and eat fast.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Post-modern food tastings at the fair were provided by theater
director Silvio Panini, who created a ``degustazione teatrale,'' in
which the diners, wearing earphones and seated at stark steel
tables, sample tiny drops of balsamic vinegar and minimalist
morsels of parmigiano while a performance artist recites sensual
eating instructions. ``Agriculture is an aesthetic,'' Panini
explained.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas, it is also a dying art. Lard from the region
surrounding Carrara, which was the basic food for the marble
workers who supplied Michelangelo, is in danger of extinction,
according to Slow Food. ``Pigs today are small and too meaty,
everyone wants pork-light,'' complained Marino Giannarelli, 50,
whose family firm, Lardo di Colonnata, produces a small amount of
extremely thick, succulent lard.
</P>
<P>
   The Caciocavallo Podolico is a rare, fragrant cheese from the
Campania region, which relies on finicky free-range white cows, who
will only give milk if their calves are standing near them, and
even then, only a few liters a day. ``You have to be a hero to make
it,'' Sardo said. ``And also a bit crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   A kilo of Caciocavallo Podolico costs $37, three times as much
as more ordinary varieties of Caciocavallo. To raise consumer
consciousness, Antonio Madaio, a processor from Eboli, has begun
selling three-pound balls of his cheese in wooden trophy boxes,
with a certificate attached.
</P>
<P>
   Participants ranged from Jonathan White, an artisanal
cheese-maker from Peekskill, N.Y. who makes butter for the White
House, to some of the world's most high-minded chefs. Miguel
Sanchez Romera, 45, for example, is a neurologist who on weekends
cooks Spanish nouvelle cuisine at his restaurant, L'Esguard, in a
small town outside Barcelona. He was one of three chefs selected to
prepare a three-course, $178 gourmet meal for 36 people, which
included a dish of egg and caviar inspired by Van Gogh's
Sunflowers. Romera gave a lecture explaining the neurological
impulses of appetite.

H IS FOR HIKE TO 33 CENTS ON A FIRST-CLASS POSTAGE STAMP
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To ease customers into the new postal rates that take effect
Jan. 10, the U.S. Postal Service will start Monday to flood the
country with its new H for Hat stamp _ 14,692,520,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps, which were printed during the last several years
before the new basic 33-cent rate was approved, picture Uncle Sam's
hat and the words ``USA H First-Class Rate,'' but do not show any
value. They are part of a series printed in advance for other rate
increases, with A, B, C and D picturing only letters, followed by E
for Earth, F for Flower and G for Old Glory.
</P>
<P>
   The last rate increase, to 32 cents from 29, took place on Jan.
1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service is also releasing a nondenominated stamp on
Tuesday, which is worth 1 cent and pictures a rooster weather vane,
to use with any 32-cent stamps that customers have left over on
Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Not all postal rates will rise in January. The cost of
additional ounces for heavier letters will fall 1 cent, to 22
cents, so the cost of a 2-ounce letter will remain 55 cents and the
cost of a 3-ounce letter drops to 77 cents, from 78.
</P>
<P>
   That means new 22-cent and 77-cent stamps, picturing Uncle Sam
and Mary Breckinridge, respectively. Breckinridge was the founder
of the Frontier Nursing Service in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The basic Priority Mail rate rises to $3.20 from $3 (with
another stamp to be issued Tuesday, showing a space-shuttle
landing), and Express Mail goes to $11.75 from $10.75 (with still
another stamp, showing a shuttle piggybacked on a transporter
plane, but not until Nov. 19).

CHURCHES FIND NEW FOCUS IN OPPOSING PERSECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Colo., Texas, Okla., Va.)  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moving in ``a'' news file.) 
(lb) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a cramped loft apartment in Macungie, Pa., a grass-roots
group that includes a mechanic, a retired teacher, a physician and
a concrete salesman gathers every Tuesday to pray for what they
call Christian martyrs around the world who are victimized, raped
and killed for their faith.
</P>
<P>
   In Highlands, Colo., volunteers fill a Presbyterian church hall
to hear a Nigerian refugee testify that Muslims in his village back
home tied him to a tree, beat him and left him for dead, all
because he tried to preach the Gospel of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, 5,000 people march through the streets singing
hymns to honor the Christians they are told are suffering in
countries like China, Saudi Arabia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly and without much publicity, a new kind of solidarity
movement is gaining force among Christians across the United
States. Their focus is what they call ``the persecuted church'' _
the fellow Christians throughout the world who they say have been
targets of abuse solely because of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   The concern has grown as Christianity has sprouted up in parts
of the world long cultivated by other faiths, resulting in
increasing clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian persecution movement has gained momentum despite
the advice from international scholars and some foreign-aid groups
that what outsiders often label Christian persecution is often a
complex brew of racial, economic, political, tribal and religious
rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, very real photographs of tortured pastors and
burned churches have had a powerful effect.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about persecuted Christians first emerged about two
years ago in the conservative and evangelical churches usually
associated with the Christian right. But now it is transcending
denominational and political boundaries. Churches that have long
found themselves on opposing sides in the debates over abortion or
homosexuality are finding common cause in Christian persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Christians everywhere, the body of Christ, are really one
body, so if one part is feeling pain, we should all be feeling
pain,'' said Amy Wierman, who is the host of the prayer group in
her apartment in Pennsylvania each Tuesday. ``The Christian woman
raped in Egypt, that is my sister. The guy shot in Pakistan, that
is my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a wide swath of Americans who admit they never before paid
much attention to foreign affairs or human rights is beginning to
exert its influence on U.S. foreign policy. They are lobbying
cities to stop doing business with nations that they say persecute
Christians. They are writing letters to countries _ some of whose
names they cannot pronounce _ demanding the release of Christian
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   They are swelling the coffers of groups that aid persecuted
Christians. And they are traveling to refugee camps in Africa and
Asia, taking donated Bibles and gathering testimony of suffering to
take back to their congregations in Ohio or California.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, this fledgling movement succeeded in persuading the
Senate to pass by unanimous vote the International Religious
Freedom Act, which requires the president to take action against
countries that the State Department finds are violating the
religious rights of their citizens. The punishment could range from
sending a private diplomatic note to invoking economic sanctions.
President Clinton signed the bill into law on Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights is now no longer the prerogative only of the
left,'' said Richard Cizik of the National Association of
Evangelicals. ``Believe it or not, the religious right is making a
distinctive contribution to American foreign policy. We are shaping
policy. And on human rights? Who would have predicted that?''
</P>
<P>
   In a movement that is even more spiritual than political, the
antidote often promoted is prayer. Next Sunday, as many as 100,000
U.S. churches _ about a third of the churches in the nation _ are
expected to participate in the International Day of Prayer for the
Persecuted Church, an annual event that began two years ago in just
5,000 churches.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Day of Prayer say the event will be observed
by a broad array of congregations that rarely find themselves
allied, including Methodist, Southern Baptist, Roman Catholic,
Pentecostal, Orthodox and Salvation Army churches.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, from both the theological left and right, a
consensus is emerging. After decades of soul-searching over the
indifference or even complicity of some Christians in the Holocaust
and in genocidal wars in Rwanda and Bosnia, Christians are seeing
themselves as the victims and martyrs of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   In church services, in literature and in videos put out by the
persecuted church movement, they are likening Christian persecution
to the Holocaust. They quote from Anne Frank and Elie Wiesel. And
for moral reinforcement, they frequently note that it is two Jews,
Michael Horowitz, director of the conservative Hudson Institute,
and A.M. Rosenthal, a columnist at The New York Times, who have
been raising the loudest protests about the persecution of
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing that happened to the Jews _ to the people of
the book _ is now happening to Christians,'' said John Noska, the
concrete salesman whose prayer group in Pennsylvania has produced a
video on Christian persecution for cable television. ``Here in
America, many of us are living in a comfort zone, and the Lord is
saying: `Come out of your comfort zone. What about your brothers
and sisters who are suffering?'''

<P>
   A Change in Focus
</P>
<P>
   No Longer Praying for Missionaries
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Steve Haas always ended his bedtime prayers with a
plea to the Lord to protect the American missionary families he
knew who were risking their lives to share the Gospel in Asia,
Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, president of Prayer for the Persecuted Church, says that
his prayers are now for the Asians, Africans and Latin Americans
whom the missionaries converted to Christianity. Indigenous
Christians on those continents, and not white missionaries, are now
the victims of Christian persecution, Haas said.
</P>
<P>
   This reflects the global shifts in Christianity in the last 30
years. In 1960 more than 70 percent of all evangelical Christians
were Americans, Canadians and Europeans, according to Prayer for
the Persecuted Church. By 1990 the picture had flipped, and 70
percent of all evangelical Christians were Africans, Asians and
Latin Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In a mere 30 years, a ``born again'' brand of Christianity has
spread to countries inhabited primarily by Muslims, Hindus,
Buddhists and Animists, resulting in some places in religious
conflict and rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Christians begin to have some influence in the life of a
nation,'' said Andrew Vanderbijl, a Dutch missionary better known
as Brother Andrew, ``morally, maybe politically, culturally,
economically,'' then others in the community turn against them.
</P>
<P>
   In predominantly Muslim Indonesia, for example, Chinese
Christians control the economy, he said, ``and when they exert
influence, they have opposition, and that may turn into
persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Christians are a minority, they are subject to human
rights abuses. A State Department report last year listed about 70
countries in which there is a wide range of violations against
Christians, from censoring tracts to detention to torture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many missionaries, aid workers, scholars of foreign affairs
and State Department officials say they fear that the American
churches' framing of Christian persecution as a global threat is a
misguided oversimplification.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that where there is persecution of Christians,
there is also widespread persecution of people of many religions
and ethnicities (for example, Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists in
China, Animists and moderate Muslims in southern Sudan, Bahais in
Iran and Ahmadiya Muslims in Pakistan).
</P>
<P>
   Also, scholars say, Christians persecute other Christians in
places where the dominant church senses a threat to its supremacy _
in Russia and Greece, for example, and in Central America and South
America.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to solve these problems by focusing only on Christians is
``like pulling on one strand of a sweater,'' said David Little, a
senior scholar at the U.S. Institute of Peace. ``Meanwhile, the
whole sweater is unraveling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you have smoke, you have fire,'' Little said. ``Where
you have religious persecution, you invariably have violations of
all other kinds. There are local forces, local interests, so it's
not subsumable under one kind of conspiracy against Christians. ''
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders of the Christian persecution movement acknowledge
these flaws in their approach, but say it is only natural for
American Christians to care first for their own suffering brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of established human rights organizations agree. William
Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A., points
out that many people get involved in human rights work by fixating
first on their counterparts; feminist groups focus on women
overseas, labor unions on workers.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said,
``Whenever we can get a large, powerful constituency interested in
human rights issues, so much the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian missionary groups that for years had been crying in
the wilderness about Christian persecution are now seeing their
contributions soaring, enabling them to do even more evangelizing
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   At Voice of the Martyrs in Bartlesville, Okla., a group founded
in 1967, the mailing list, number of staff members and income have
tripled in the last two years. Christian Freedom International in
Front Royal, Va., has experienced similar growth.
</P>
<P>
   A Martyr's Account
</P>
<P>
   Tempering Fears of Islam
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Cherry Creek Presbyterian Church outside Denver, 87
Christians from six local churches turned out on a Saturday night
earlier this year to hear the testimony of a Nigerian Christian lay
preacher.
</P>
<P>
   The preacher, Sati, who said he feared revealing his last name,
recounted a personal history of horrors at the hands of his Muslim
neighbors: blinded at age 6 by Muslims jealous of his fathers'
flocks; tied to a tree and stoned at age 20 by Muslims who accused
him of insulting the prophet Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to kill me,'' Sati said. ``I was merely debating
them, and you don't do that if you're trying to reach an Islamic
person.''
</P>
<P>
   His audience listened in silence. Afterward, 30 people submitted
green and white response cards volunteering to start Christian
persecution task forces in their own churches _ just one indication
that this movement is being fueled primarily by lay people, not
pastors.
</P>
<P>
   It is events like this in Colorado that have led some critics to
accuse the Christian persecution movement of fanning the flames of
confrontation between Christianity and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular evening in Colorado, Sati's story of Muslim
persecutors _ which he has repeated in many churches _ was tempered
by a follow-up talk by the organizer, Haas. Haas told the audience
the problem was not with most Muslims but with ``a radical form of
Islam now invading North Africa and the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   But such distinctions probably elude most American Christians
who are unacquainted with Islam. One woman in Haas' audience raised
her hand and asked him to please explain the difference between
Muslim and Islam (one is a person, the other a religion).
</P>
<P>
   Concern about anti-Muslim undertones in the Christian
persecution movement is voiced by American Muslim leaders and even
by some Christian missionaries active in Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are creating an enemy image of the Muslims and
making it worse, aggravating the problem,'' said Brother Andrew,
who began 40 years ago by smuggling Bibles into communist nations
and now works primarily in the Islamic world. ``It is not as bad as
it is often portrayed, as if Muslims are always persecuting
Christians. Culturally and historically Muslims and Christians have
usually gotten on fairly well together, and we are distorting the
history when we are saying the Muslims are persecuting
Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   The Church
</P>
<P>
   Revitalization and Martyrdom
</P>
<P>
   Previous solidarity movements _ like those concerned with South
Africa, Central America or Soviet Jewry _ have defined success as
the end of oppression. But people active in the Christian
persecution movement say their goal is not to stop the persecution.
For one thing, they say that it is not possible. But they also have
a theological reason: They say that just as Jesus suffered,
modern-day Christians will also inevitably suffer for their faith.
Martyrdom feeds the faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other faiths have said: Blood is spilled, that's when we grow.
That's very true in Christendom,'' Haas said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, many Americans devoting themselves to spreading the
word about Christian persecution say they hope not only to save the
victims but also to save a moribund church in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's done me a world of good in my commitment,'' said John
Wildenthal, a municipal judge in Houston, ``to see the examples of
these people who have joy and strength in their faith while they
daily face the threat of personal disaster. It would produce a
religious revival in the U.S. if the people in the pews were to
realize the strength and joy that those living in daily danger
exhibit. It would revitalize the church in America.''

SALT BATH SURE TO SET TONGUES A-CLUCKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Please pass the salt, Alice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't tasted your food!''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, now I've tasted it. Please pass the salt, Alice.''
</P>
<P>
   How often is that conversation repeated in your home? Neither my
Alice nor your Alice is to blame. They have been brain-washed by
do-gooders in our society who fail to draw the line at doing
something ``good'' for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Like a balky power mower, they are propelled by tch . . . tch .
. . tchs. In lectures and in print they insist that society conform
to their tastes and standards. And they are usually fueled by
faulty generalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Salt provides a good example. I always include it in my pasta
water. It's essential in mashed potatoes, Son-of-a-Gun Stew and
certainly on theater popcorn. I don't use inordinate amounts in
recipes, realizing there are different strokes for different folks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bible, it was Jesus who used the phrase, ``salt
of the Earth.'' In the old testament salt was described as a proper
offering to God. Ezekiel (16:4) refers to the custom of rubbing
newborn babies with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Give me a break. All I do is sprinkle a little on my haunch of
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are salt sensitive and are better off swallowing the
cellar rather than the seasoning inside. They are the ones who walk
around with blood-pressure bulbs hanging from their sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   But an exhaustive study funded in part by the World Health
Organization indicated that between 5 and 10 percent of the
population has this severe reaction to salt. The study found no
significant link between salt and hypertension for the other 90 to
95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Should I give up Dungeness crab and Penn Cove mussels because
shellfish give some people the hives? Should I toss my snack pack
out the window of the 737 jetliner as it taxis for takeoff because
somebody aboard might be allergic to pretzels?
</P>
<P>
   Well, I guess I could get by without pretzels. But there may be
a nasty fork fight if somebody reaches for my Dungeness crab.
</P>
<P>
   And when I reach for the salt in a restaurant, I don't want to
feel as though I have just pinched a passing waitress. (That would
likely also elicit a response from Alice the Artist.)
</P>
<P>
   Herbs and spices add a nice touch to roasted poultry. But the
absolute best way to season a chicken is by immersing it in a
saline bath. It's called a chicken cure and it sure cures the
hungries around our household.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cured'' Chicken
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons salt
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 quart water
</P>
<P>
   Dissolve the salt and sugar in the water. Pour into deep bowl.
Plop one whole fryer chicken in the seasoned water, cover and
refrigerate for 2 or 3 hours, turning occasionally. Or substitute
boned chicken breasts, and let sit in the liquid for 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to bake the whole chicken, pat it dry, then paint
lightly with olive oil and sprinkle heavily, inside and out, with
your favorite seasoning blend. I have used the Creole seasoning
available in the spice section of supermarkets. I have also used a
lively seasoning blend called Deer Valley Oomph! (which you can
order from Deer Valley Resort, P.O. Box 889, Park City, UT 84060.)
Or you can make up a variation of the spice mixture listed below,
adding or subtracting herbs to your taste.
</P>
<P>
   Roast a whole chicken, breast side down, in a 350-degree oven
for 30 minutes, then turn breast side up and continue roasting.
Figure on 25 minutes of total cooking time, per pound.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to cook cured chicken breasts is to sprinkle with
the spice mixture and then grill over a barbecue fire until no
longer pink when sliced in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Homemade Oomph!
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup chili powder
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons each ground cumin, ground coriander, dried oregano
leaves and dried basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon each dried thyme leaves and garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters teaspoon cayenne
</P>
<P>
   Mix thoroughly, sprinkle over chicken as needed and store
remainder in airtight container.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentially, Ezekiel did not recommend rubbing newborn babes
with Oomph. But it might not be a bad idea.

THE SAMPRAS FALL TOUR TAKES ANOTHER DETOUR IN PARIS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Pete Sampras has visited but not really seen
Switzerland, Austria, Germany and now France. His autumn tour of
European arenas continues, and this week he will spend more time
indoors in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm losing my tan,'' Sampras, the southern Californian turned
Floridian, said.
</P>
<P>
   He is chasing computer points more than trophies, and after five
weeks of sustained effort and intermittent physical treatment on
his often-fragile body, he has helped his cause considerably, but
not necessarily his aura of supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras might be the finest tennis player of all time: a sleek,
composed cocktail of baseline fluidity and serving acuity, but for
all his motivation to cling to his No. 1 ranking and all his
natural aptitude for indoor tennis, he has managed to win only one
of the five tournaments he has played on this side of the Atlantic
since losing in the U.S. Open semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   He withdrew in mid-tournament in Lyons with a bad back, lost to
Wayne Ferreira in three sets in Basel and to Richard Krajicek in
three sets in Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he again lost, this time in three sets to Greg
Rusedski in the final of the Paris Indoor, but this match was no
cliffhanger. Unlike the others, it was a three-of-five-set match,
and Rusedski served it out, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, and then
immediately and understandably began serving up superlatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think it's the best match of my career,'' he
said. ``To beat Pete Sampras, the No. 1 player in the world, is an
unbelievable feeling considering my record.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, Rusedski was 0-6 against Sampras, but that
lopsided score line does not reflect that Rusedski has often given
him trouble. Looking at a left-handed serve that is as powerful and
difficult to read as Rusedski's does not take long, and Sunday, he
delivered what may be the fastest second serve ever recorded: a
nearly 135 mile-an-hour effort in the second set that was far
quicker than any first serves of Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the service gun is really nothing more than a
marketing tool: an elicitor of gasps from the stands. One does not
beat Sampras in straight sets with only a serve on an indoor court
as medium-paced as the one at the Palais Omnisports de Bercy.
Rusedski's game has evolved considerably since he decided to leave
Canada in 1995 and play for Great Britain, where his mother was
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely tough when he's on,'' Sampras said, ``and he
was definitely on today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski's tennis remains ungainly at times _ a bit
premeditated. His wickedly effective inside-out forehand is a
slash, not a sweep. His on-court movements are often abrupt, but
his footwork has improved considerably along with his once
vulnerable backhand and returns. That progress has not been as
evident lately because he injured his ankle in June, forcing him to
retire from his first-round match at Wimbledon and hindering him
the rest of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't put it totally behind him until Vienna last month,''
said his coach, Sven Groenveld, who took over after Rusedski and
Tony Pickard split on acrimonious terms after Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Groenveld, a well-traveled 33-year-old Dutchman, has more
experience coaching women than men, although he did help Michael
Stich reach the 1996 French Open final. He has been disappointed by
the self-centered attitudes of some of his pupils in the past, but
he and the relentlessly cheerful Rusedski have struck up a
friendship. ``I've been going through a divorce, and Greg has been
very supportive of me through it,'' he said. ``It's something I
will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-ranked Rusedski will never forget beating Sampras, but
it might not have happened if Sampras had not played poorly when
serving for the second set at 5-3. He double-faulted twice in that
game and missed a routine backhand volley, and that was essentially
all the reassurance Rusedski needed to win the final Super 9 event
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he really wanted this match, as well,'' Rusedski said
of Sampras. ``And that makes it even more special.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski has a fine chance of qualifying for the ATP Tour
Championships in Hanover later this month. If Yevgeny Kafelnikov
loses before the final this week in Moscow, Rusedski is in. Body
willing, Sampras will be there, too, attempting to hold off Marcelo
Rios and finish No. 1 for the sixth consecutive year. His chances
are good, although they would have been better if he had won today.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bit of a false debate in that Rios has yet to win a
Grand Slam event. But the Chilean has won three Super 9 titles this
year _ Indian Wells, Calif.; Key Biscayne, Fla., and Rome. Sampras
has won Wimbledon, but only three other minor tour events. If
Sampras does fulfill his mission, he will break his tie with Jimmy
Connors, a better showman but not a better player who finished No.
1 from 1974 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's probably not rooting for me, knowing him,''
Sampras said. ``The reason I'm doing this is I feel like it's one
of the records that in tennis won't be touched.''
</P>
<P>
   At a moment when beating Sampras is beginning to look
increasingly within reach for eager ATP members like Rusedski, that
is a timely approach.

NETSCAPE PIONEER TO INVEST IN SMART VCR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new technology intended to replace the
traditional home videocassette recorder is expected to get an
important vote of confidence on Monday with the announcement that a
co-founder of Netscape Communications Corp. has invested in one of
two companies developing digital television recording systems.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Andreessen, who founded Netscape along with Jim Clark in
1995, will announce that he is investing in Replay Networks Inc., a
small Silicon Valley start-up company and will join its board.
</P>
<P>
   Replay Networks, based in Palo Alto, is one of two Silicon
Valley companies developing television systems that enable viewers
to watch, store and retrieve programs in novel ways, including
pausing while the programs are in progress and returning to the
point of the pause as much as 30 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the company will begin shipping the system, known
as ReplayTV, which will enable users to record a complete program
that is already in progress, to automatically record programs that
meet a predetermined criterion _ for example, movies featuring a
particular actor _ and to intelligently skip commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But just as important as the bells and whistles, Replay
executives say, is that unlike most traditional VCRs, ReplayTV is
simple enough to program without resorting to a manual. The system
includes an interactive programming guide that the viewer can use
to instruct the system to record all programs related to a
particular sports team, for example, or to capture a particular
program whenever it is on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that most people can relate to is never missing
their favorite show,'' said Anthony Wood, Replay's founder and
chief executive. ``People have busy lives, and it's not worth it to
program their VCR.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Replay and Tivo Inc., based in Sunnyvale, are trying to
adapt a strategy of Internet Web portal companies like Yahoo and
Excite to television by offering viewers the ability to create
custom TV channels.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' technologies are essentially powerful computers
with large hard drives that can store seven to 40 hours of
digitized video. And both intend to license their technologies to
consumer electronics manufacturers that will produce the new VCRs
at prices below $500.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carmel Group, a consumer electronics market
research firm, the market for so-called personal TV systems will
reach $380 million and 760,000 subscribers next year.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are developing different business models, but
both are built around subscription services that require a new
generation of digital VCRs capable of delivering them.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies will transmit electronic program guides to their
subscribers via telephone connections. However Tivo plans to charge
viewers a $10 monthly fee, while Replay intends to support its
service by advertising alone.
</P>
<P>
   Replay executives also said that the two services were different
in their privacy policies. The Replay system will not collect
information on users' viewing habits; Tivo plans to monitor that
information and sell advertisers the ability to deliver their
commercials to the specific audiences they want.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer versions of both systems are expected to be available
sometime in mid-1999. However, Replay plans to begin shipping a
high-end $1,000 version of its product before the end of the year
in an effort to jump-start the market for the recorders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, it was Replay's advertisements in home theater magazines
that attracted Andreessen's interest in the company. A high-end
video buff, Andreessen said he contacted Replay in an effort to
become a product tester of their system, which he described as
something ``I had to have.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Replay system made more sense to him than the
WebTV set-top box, a technology now owned by Microsoft Corp. that
connects users to the Internet through their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``ReplayTV will do for TV what the browser did for the
Internet,'' said Andreessen, who was a part of the team at the
University of Illinois that developed the technology on which
Netscape was founded. ``It's the browser for TV.''
</P>
<P>
   While WebTV tries to integrate the Internet with television,
Replay, he said, ``is an effort to enhance the TV experience first
and foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You sit back 10 feet, and you're relaxed and you watch what
you want to watch,'' he said, noting that watching television is a
very different activity from surfing the World Wide Web on a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen declined to disclose the amount of his investment.
Several people with knowledge of the company's history said that
Replay had spent about $1 million _ an unusually low amount _ to
develop its technology since the company was founded in September
1997.

SPY CHARGES SPOTLIGHT ISRAEL-TURKEY RELATIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The arrest of two Israelis on suspicion of spying on
a military installation in Cyprus had a comic caper element that
immediately raised questions here about whether it was the latest
in a series of bungles by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious level the arrest of two Israeli men in a small
fishing village near Larnaca, Cyprus, spotlighted increased
regional tensions about the growing security cooperation between
Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Udi Hargov, 27, and Yigal Damary, 49, who claimed
to be teachers, were held on suspicion of espionage after the
Cypriots said they had been found with a complement of electronic
equipment while recording police or military conversations off a
sophisticated scanner.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Cypriots, the men had visited the coastal
village, Zygi, which abuts a military camp, twice before in the
previous month. The proprietor of a local taverna, Panikos
Cristoldo, had been alerted to notify the authorities if they
returned. When they did, Cristoldo turned them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something in my heart told me these were spies who had come to
hurt my country,'' Cristoldo told the Israeli daily Maariv. ``Since
my intuition never disappoints me, I knew that when the police
turned up, they would not go away empty-handed. Everyone in our
small village suspected them.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's president, Ezer Weizman, traveled to Nicosia just last
week to smooth tensions with Cyprus, where the government is wary
of the growing closeness between Israel and Turkey. Cyprus has been
in a tense dispute with Turkey since 1974, when Turkish forces
seized control of the northern third of the island. Tensions have
been aggravated by the Greek Cypriots' recent purchase of Russian
anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally we are not happy that holders of Israeli passports
were involved in something like this,'' said Euripides Euriviades,
the Cypriot ambassador to Israel. ``There is a lot of anxiety back
home with what is happening with the ongoing strategic, military
relationship between Israel and Turkey. We had the assurances of
President Weizman last week that no harm could come to us from this
relationship. So the timing of the incident is not great, although
we have due process back home and everyone is innocent until proved
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1990s, Turkey and Israel have forged a close
strategic relationship. The Israelis have sold military equipment
and provided training to the Turks, and the Turks have allowed
Israeli military planes to fly over Turkish air space. Before the
Turkish prime minister visited Israel in early September, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel created a political storm by
saying the relationship constituted a ``new axis'' in the Middle
East. He later retracted this description, saying he had not
expressed himself well.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Ron Ben
Yishai, a security expert, said the highly publicized arrests were
meant to send ``a warning to Israel lest it decide to provide
Turkey with any intelligence or military assistance in its fight
against Greek Cyprus.''
</P>
<P>
   Euriviades said the Cypriots would probably charge the two with
espionage within the week. Spying is punishable by a maximum
sentence of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But it remained unclear Sunday whom _ if anyone _ the two
Israelis represented. Some intelligence experts theorized that they
were working directly for the Turks, who have vowed to block the
imminent delivery of the new surface-to-air missiles. The Cypriots
fear that the Israelis have trained Turkish pilots in sophisticated
interception techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The Mossad has been known to use Cyprus for training missions,
and Gad Shomron, a former Mossad agent, conjectured that the two
Israelis, who had previously visited Cyprus, were on such a
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The previous visit had coincided with a Greek-Cypriot military
exercise off the coast, the Cypriot authorities said. The Israelis'
activities raised suspicions, and when they returned, Cypriot
officials obtained a search warrant for their temporary apartment,
and said they had found cameras, maps, two scanners and tapes of
Greek conversations between police or military officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that based on the information that we have,
they came for the purpose of spying on the Republic of Cyprus and
specifically the National Guard,'' Sgt. Kyriakos Kyriacou, the
police lawyer for the Larnaca district, told a court.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli press Sunday used the occasion to recount all
Mossad's most recent blunders. They included an incident earlier
this year, when five Mossad agents were caught trying to bug a
house in Bern, Switzerland. That same week, the Mossad director
resigned over a bungled attempt to assassinate a Hamas official in
Jordan last fall.

<P>
   LHASA, Tibet _ On an old stone stairway beside the Potala
Palace, the empty fortress where the Dalai Lama once presided over
Tibet, an elderly woman navigated her way down a long procession of
steps after coming here to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always come carrying the hope that I will live long enough
to see the Dalai Lama here again,'' said the woman, Chanchup Lhamo.
``But I am getting old, and now I am afraid I may never get the
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears spilled down her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me that good things will come in the future,''
said Mrs. Lhamo, 76, wiping her eyes with the sleeve of her
sheepskin-lined robe. ``But I wait and wait and never see it. It
never comes.''
</P>
<P>
   An intensely religious people who revere the Dalai Lama as a god
and a king, Tibetans nurture a fervent desire to see their leader
return to the Potala Palace, vacant since the day he fled to India
in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Many do not hesitate to say they would happily sacrifice all of
their material possessions to see the Dalai Lama in Tibet for a
single day.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing year, fear grows that any return, or visit, by
the Dalai Lama is less likely. Beijing exercises tight control over
Tibet and has little incentive to negotiate with the exiled
religious leader.
</P>
<P>
   Yet international pressure on China to relax its grip on Tibet
has mounted in recent years, and the Dalai Lama himself is
proposing a new initiative that he hopes will lead to talks with
Chinese leaders. Ultimately, he would like to see an agreement
allowing more self-rule for Tibet under Chinese sovereignty, and,
of course, to visit his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Courting support for his proposal, the Dalai Lama is expected to
meet with Vice President Al Gore at the White House during his
current visit to Washington. During the last such visit, President
Clinton dropped by, and he may well do so again this time.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan exiles have said the Dalai Lama would like to meet the
president of China, Jiang Zemin at a holy Buddhist mountain in
northern China. A secluded location, where the Tibetan leader can
technically travel as a monk, not as a political figure, may be
more conducive to quiet talks.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the political atmosphere in China seems more
open to negotiations on Tibet than at any time in a decade. Within
the conclave of Beijing's secretive politics, Jiang has been
steadily gaining clout, giving him potential leeway to shift ground
on China's most sensitive foreign policy problems, Tibet and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes among Tibetan exiles lifted when Jiang seemed to respond
with mild favor to a suggestion made by Clinton during his visit to
Beijing last June that Jiang someday meet the Dalai Lama, who won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent work to gain
greater freedom for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   But China's position on Tibet has yet to soften. Chinese
officials have reacted negatively to news reports about the Dalai
Lama's new proposal, voicing irritation that it has been discussed
publicly rather than sent to Beijing quietly through the informal
back channels that Chinese leaders prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Beijing's position is that it will not recognize
the Dalai Lama as a religious leader of Tibetan Buddhists until he
declares total allegiance to Beijing, affirming that Tibet has
always been an inseparable part of China.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 40 years, China's main concern has been to keep a
firm political and military grip on Tibet. Even a one-time visit
here by the Dalai Lama could spark pandemonium among worshippers,
who uncontrollably mobbed delegations that included siblings of the
Dalai Lama in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have often said that they regard the Dalai
Lama as an agent of anti-China forces who relies on political and
financial backing from large foreign powers, namely India and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama's calls for greater autonomy, Beijing claims, are
a way to gain international support for his longer-term goal, and
Beijing's greatest fear: making Tibet an independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   So Beijing insists on verbal declarations of allegiance to the
Chinese nation by the Dalai Lama, and insists on the same from
other prominent Buddhist lamas who are considered `living buddhas,'
or reincarnations of deceased lamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All living buddhas have to be patriotic,'' said Ma Chongying,
deputy director of the Minority &AMP; Religious Affairs Bureau in
Tibet. ``If you're not patriotic, there's no such thing as being a
living buddha. This is an unchangeable principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally unchangeable, it seems, is the common reverence here for
the Dalai Lama, despite relentless denigration by the Chinese
authorities. A visitor to Tibet who mentions the Dalai Lama's name
to a local resident is routinely greeted with a toothy smile and a
big thumbs-up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No open worship of the Dalai Lama is permitted. A favorite
practice of displaying the Dalai Lama's picture is banned except in
private homes. Monks and other worshippers sometimes ask visitors
for a likeness of the Dalai Lama, but only out of earshot from the
men and women in plainclothes who loiter around religious sites in
oddly large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Chinese officials evidently hope that the Dalai
Lama issue will disappear. Looming behind the current efforts at
negotiation is the critical question of the Dalai Lama's
succession, traditionally decided through a highly mystical
procedure of locating his reincarnation in a young boy somewhere on
the Tibetan plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders are likely to prevent Tibetan religious leaders
from choosing a new reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, or to control
the process so tightly that Beijing in fact determines the choice.
The current Dalai Lama is 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Dalai Lama dies, he dies,'' said Ma, the religious
affairs official in Tibet. ``There will be no replacement.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the Potala Palace, a 1,000-room mansion that majestically
crowns the entire valley surrounding Lhasa, Tibet's holy capital,
pilgrims come each day to worship the Dalai Lama, even if they do
not mention his name too loudly while doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Inside one room of the Dalai Lama's former living quarters, a
small throne draped with green-and-white silk embroidery and offset
by a long row of gold-encased cabinets filled with Buddhist statues
and jewelry is covered by thousands of white scarves brought by
devoted pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, an elderly couple dressed in the long black
and maroon robes of herdsmen from the countryside stepped forward
to prostrate themselves on the worn stone floor. Their two children
followed suit on the floor behind, as did a granddaughter in a
bright yellow parka.
</P>
<P>
   A Lhasa policeman, with a mild paunch and dark sunglasses,
watched silently from the back of the room. After the family moved
on to the next room, he stepped forward and put a 10-yuan note, the
equivalent of about a dollar, on a silver chalice.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After a year dominated by scandal in the White House and an
inquiry into the impeachment of the president, Democrats made
unexpected congressional gains on Election Day, picking up five
seats in the House and not losing any ground in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of voters leaving polling places throughout the country
showed that some groups that had shifted toward the Republicans in
1994 are moving back toward the Democrats, including voters in the
East, Catholics and those who live in big cities.
</P>
<P>
   The table, based on the voter surveys, shows how 115 demographic
groups voted for House candidates this year and in the past nine
elections. The surveys used to draw this portrait are based on
large numbers of respondents, making it possible to examine the
preferences of some groups whose proportion of the voting
population makes them too small to look at in typical surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Gender and Age
</P>
<P>
   Men continue to be more likely than women to vote for
Republicans. Before 1994, the percentage of men who voted
Republican was three to six percentage points higher than the
percentage of women who voted Republican. In 1994, the difference
soared to 11 points, in 1996 it was nine points and in the latest
election there is a 7-point gap between the number of men and women
who voted for the Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between men and women are particularly evident
among voters with college degrees and voters under 30.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three elections, a majority of voters 60 and older
has given its votes to Republican candidates, perhaps signaling the
departure of the New Deal generation.
</P>
<P>
   This trend toward supporting Republican candidates among older
voters is seen among both men and women. Sixty percent of older
white people voted for the Republican candidate in their district,
but older black voters continued to support Democrats
overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Party Loyalty
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the Republicans have been doing a better job of
holding onto most self-identified Republican voters, getting at
least 90 percent of their votes. Democrats have also been doing
well at retaining their party's adherents.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three elections, increasing numbers of
independents, who make up a little more than one-fourth of all
voters, have been voting for Republican candidates. This year, the
votes of independent women are divided equally between the
Republicans and the Democrats. Independent men are more inclined
than independent women to vote Republican, but not to the degree
that they were in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the white voters who consider themselves
independent supported the Republican candidate in their district.
And although a large majority of black independents supported the
Democratic candidate, one-fifth favored the Republican candidate.
Overall, only 11 percent of blacks voted Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Financial Concerns
</P>
<P>
   Candidates from the party of the incumbent president tend to be
favored by voters who believe their economic situation has
improved. In 1980, 1994 and 1996, the Democratic candidates were
backed by a majority of voters who said their financial situation
had improved. And voters appear to turn against the incumbent party
when they believe their situation has worsened. Most of the voters
who described their family as being either less well off or the
same voted for Republican candidates, as they did in 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Social Alliances
</P>
<P>
   There are still some signs of the social alliances that have
existed since the Great Depression. For example, less affluent
voters, those with annual income under $30,000, gave the majority
of their votes to the Democrats. Black, Hispanic and Jewish voters
remained strongly Democratic. Voters who lived in a household with
a union member continued to support the Democratic candidate, as
did urban voters.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, voters whose income exceeded $30,000 and white
Protestants voted for Republican candidates. Republican candidates
were favored by suburbanites, as well as by those who live in small
towns and rural areas.

<P>
   TURIN, Italy _ The English will kill each other to protect
animals. The French fight to the death to preserve the purity of
their language. Italians, however, rarely get indignant about
anything, except food. Few other nations, for example, have so
passionate a grass-roots movement to preserve endangered species of
cheese and protect vegetable rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plants have a soul,'' playwright and Nobel prize winner Dario
Fo warned a rapt audience last week at a conference on Biodiversity
and Genetic Species on the Verge of Extinction. ``They have
feelings. And some are assassins, using poison to destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fo is one of the intellectual pillars of Slow Food, a food and
wine organization created 13 years ago by an Italian journalist,
Carlo Petrini, as an antidote to fast food. Both men were expecting
more than 100,000 people to attend Slow Food's Salone del Gusto, a
five-day food fair, drawing epicures dedicated to the languorous
enjoyment of slowly prepared regional delicacies. Petrini became
radicalized when he entered the Piazza di Spagna in Rome and
smelled mass-produced french fries wafting from the country's first
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Slow Food, which was begun by a group of leftist intellectuals
disenchanted by politics and disgusted by the fast-food trend, has
in the last few years become fashionable in Italy and throughout
Europe. After an initial, mostly botched effort to infiltrate the
United States eight years ago, it is now catching on via the
internet with American food and wine connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   Now with 40,000 members in 35 countries, Slow Food's manifesto
warns against ``obsessive worrying about hygienic matters'' and
pledges to preserve such endangered foods as Firiki apples from
Greece and Sicilian lattume di tonno, sperm of male tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Il Salone del Gusto, held in a giant convention center which was
once a Fiat car factory, boasts 300 regional food stands, with free
samples, 50 gourmet dinners and 325 workshops on everything from
``Cooking in the Antipodes'' to ``Hungarian Foie Gras and Tokaij,''
(or Tokay, a white wine). It is to ordinary food fairs what
Republican national conventions are to New Hampshire political
coffee klatches. Here, however, delegates vote with their forks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel how the fat gallops in your mouth,'' Piero Sardo, a
cheese expert and co-founder of Slow Food, instructed 110 gourmands
who signed up and paid $16 for last Thursday's workshop, ``Strong
Cheeses and Sweet Wines.'' He was commenting on a Stilton, served
with a Greek port wine. His students, seated at conference tables
behind six tasting glasses and a plate of cheeses labeled by
number, swallowed obediently before nibbling a French Roquefort,
which they were informed, contains ``noble'' salt levels.
</P>
<P>
   Food is not just good at these workshops, it is dripping with
history. ``Real iberico,'' a Spanish ham, comes from a breed of
pig, Cerdo Iberico, which is the direct descendant of the
Mediterranean boar that man began domesticating in Neolithic times.
Uncontaminated by any crossbreeding, raised in the Dehesa, an
ancient Mediterranean forest and fed on la bellota, a kind of
acorn, the Cerdo Iberico is a kind of ``thoroughbred swine,''
according to Giovanni Pellinghelli del Monticello, a consultant to
a guild of Iberian ham producers, who delivered the lecture.

   ``We will never know what the Bollinger Louis XV drank really
tasted like,'' he said sadly, referring to phylloxera, a disease
that destroyed European vines in the late 19th century. ``But this
pig is an uncontaminated breed, its ham today has exactly the same
taste it had when it was eaten by Charles V of Spain.''

   French, British and American history buffs are known for their
re-enactments of famous battles _ Austerlitz, Waterloo or
Gettysburg. Italians prefer to dwell on the great meals of history.
Actually, so do their American acolytes. Patrick Martins, a Slow
Food activist based in Bra, a food-obsessed town in Piedmont,
Italy, wrote his thesis at New York University on Medieval Food
Sculptures, which, among other things, involved molding asparagus
into a giant chess-set.
</P>
<P>
   Fo and others complain about multinationals, which favor mass
production and have steadily reduced the world's varieties. At the
turn of the century, there were 30,000 varieties of rice in India.
Now, there only 12.
</P>
<P>
   But the public also prefers convenience, speed and lower prices.
``Our real enemy is the obtuse consumer,'' Sardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the Salone, even among the initiated, there were some
Slow Food recidivists. Lorenzo Molinacci, 42, who makes Panforte di
Siena, a sophisticated brand of fruitcake, was discovered at
lunchtime wolfing down a prefabricated prosciutto sandwich at the
Autogrille, an Italian fast-foot outlet inside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else could I do,'' he said sheepishly. ``I'm very busy
and I had to go somewhere and eat fast.''

<P>
   Post-modern food tastings at the fair were provided by theater
director Silvio Panini, who created a ``degustazione teatrale,'' in
which the diners, wearing earphones and seated at stark steel
tables, sample tiny drops of balsamic vinegar and minimalist
morsels of parmigiano while a performance artist recites sensual
eating instructions. ``Agriculture is an aesthetic,'' Panini
explained.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas, it is also a dying art. Lard from the region
surrounding Carrara, which was the basic food for the marble
workers who supplied Michelangelo, is in danger of extinction,
according to Slow Food. ``Pigs today are small and too meaty,
everyone wants pork-light,'' complained Marino Giannarelli, 50,
whose family firm, Lardo di Colonnata, produces a small amount of
extremely thick, succulent lard.
</P>
<P>
   The Caciocavallo Podolico is a rare, fragrant cheese from the
Campania region, which relies on finicky free-range white cows, who
will only give milk if their calves are standing near them, and
even then, only a few liters a day. ``You have to be a hero to make
it,'' Sardo said. ``And also a bit crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   A kilo of Caciocavallo Podolico costs $37, three times as much
as more ordinary varieties of Caciocavallo. To raise consumer
consciousness, Antonio Madaio, a processor from Eboli, has begun
selling three-pound balls of his cheese in wooden trophy boxes,
with a certificate attached.
</P>
<P>
   Participants ranged from Jonathan White, an artisanal
cheese-maker from Peekskill, N.Y. who makes butter for the White
House, to some of the world's most high-minded chefs. Miguel
Sanchez Romera, 45, for example, is a neurologist who on weekends
cooks Spanish nouvelle cuisine at his restaurant, L'Esguard, in a
small town outside Barcelona. He was one of three chefs selected to
prepare a three-course, $178 gourmet meal for 36 people, which
included a dish of egg and caviar inspired by Van Gogh's
Sunflowers. Romera gave a lecture explaining the neurological
impulses of appetite.

   TURIN, Italy _ The English will kill each other to protect
animals. The French fight to the death to preserve the purity of
their language. Italians, however, rarely get indignant about
anything, except food. Few other nations, for example, have so
passionate a grass-roots movement to preserve endangered species of
cheese and protect vegetable rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plants have a soul,'' playwright and Nobel prize winner Dario
Fo warned a rapt audience last week at a conference on Biodiversity
and Genetic Species on the Verge of Extinction. ``They have
feelings. And some are assassins, using poison to destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fo is one of the intellectual pillars of Slow Food, a food and
wine organization created 13 years ago by an Italian journalist,
Carlo Petrini, as an antidote to fast food. Both men were expecting
more than 100,000 people to attend Slow Food's Salone del Gusto, a
five-day food fair, drawing epicures dedicated to the languorous
enjoyment of slowly prepared regional delicacies. Petrini became
radicalized when he entered the Piazza di Spagna in Rome and
smelled mass-produced french fries wafting from the country's first
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Slow Food, which was begun by a group of leftist intellectuals
disenchanted by politics and disgusted by the fast-food trend, has
in the last few years become fashionable in Italy and throughout
Europe. After an initial, mostly botched effort to infiltrate the
United States eight years ago, it is now catching on via the
internet with American food and wine connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   Now with 40,000 members in 35 countries, Slow Food's manifesto
warns against ``obsessive worrying about hygienic matters'' and
pledges to preserve such endangered foods as Firiki apples from
Greece and Sicilian lattume di tonno, sperm of male tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Il Salone del Gusto, held in a giant convention center which was
once a Fiat car factory, boasts 300 regional food stands, with free
samples, 50 gourmet dinners and 325 workshops on everything from
``Cooking in the Antipodes'' to ``Hungarian Foie Gras and Tokaij,''
(or Tokay, a white wine). It is to ordinary food fairs what
Republican national conventions are to New Hampshire political
coffee klatches. Here, however, delegates vote with their forks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel how the fat gallops in your mouth,'' Piero Sardo, a
cheese expert and co-founder of Slow Food, instructed 110 gourmands
who signed up and paid $16 for last Thursday's workshop, ``Strong
Cheeses and Sweet Wines.'' He was commenting on a Stilton, served
with a Greek port wine. His students, seated at conference tables
behind six tasting glasses and a plate of cheeses labeled by
number, swallowed obediently before nibbling a French Roquefort,
which they were informed, contains ``noble'' salt levels.
</P>
<P>
   Food is not just good at these workshops, it is dripping with
history. ``Real iberico,'' a Spanish ham, comes from a breed of
pig, Cerdo Iberico, which is the direct descendant of the
Mediterranean boar that man began domesticating in Neolithic times.
Uncontaminated by any crossbreeding, raised in the Dehesa, an
ancient Mediterranean forest and fed on la bellota, a kind of
acorn, the Cerdo Iberico is a kind of ``thoroughbred swine,''
according to Giovanni Pellinghelli del Monticello, a consultant to
a guild of Iberian ham producers, who delivered the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never know what the Bollinger Louis XV drank really
tasted like,'' he said sadly, referring to phylloxera, a disease
that destroyed European vines in the late 19th century. ``But this
pig is an uncontaminated breed, its ham today has exactly the same
taste it had when it was eaten by Charles V of Spain.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AS SKIP AWAY FADES, AWESOME AGAIN RISES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ ``They come once in a lifetime,'' Sonny Hine
said after the final curtain had been lowered on Skip Away. ``Sure,
I'm unhappy to lose him. For the last three years, he's been our
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away did not need a eulogy. True, in his final performance,
he ran sixth in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on
Saturday and went home with no money, meaning that his brilliant
career at the races was ending $383,455 short of Sonny Hine's
obsession: to pass Cigar at $9,999,815 and become racing's richest
horse. And in his race before that one, the $1-million Jockey Club
Gold Cup at Belmont Park, Skip Away ran third. So, he was fading
into the sunset with a two-race losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows better than Sonny Hine that Skip Away had a
winning streak of nine before he had a losing streak of two, and
that he went to the post 38 times in his career, won 18 times and
finished in the money 34 times. He ran in 21 Grade I stakes, and
finished first, second or third 20 times. This year, he won seven
of nine. So, relax, Sonny, you may have lost the battle of the
Breeders' Cup, but not the war for horse of the year honors.
</P>
<P>
   Skippy became the durable superstar who took the baton from
Cigar, who took it from Holy Bull, in an unbroken string of
virtuoso performances in the 1990s, when racing was declining as a
business but apparently not as a sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the road for the last 36 years,'' the 67-year-old
Hine said, reflectively. ``You live in hotels and motels. I went
into a store in Louisville, and they offered me a 10 percent senior
citizen's discount. I wondered where the years had gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very touching, what's going on. I used to cry when
watching Lassie movies. I cried at `E.T.' That was the last movie
we saw.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cried at the Breeders' Cup Classic, but he could have
saved the tears. On a resplendent but cool afternoon in Kentucky,
racing staged its $13.2-million day of championships before a
record crowd of 80,452. It was a day of sheer suspense that saw
some sad endings in the Classic for Skip Away (sixth), Coronado's
Quest (fifth after leading for one mile) and Gentlemen (10th and
last with pulmonary bleeding, after his owner had gambled $800,000
in supplemental entry fees to get him into the race).
</P>
<P>
   But the 15th Breeders' Cup also played to some great theater
with happy beginnings. And as surely as Skip Away, Gentlemen and
Coronado's Quest closed their honorable careers, new heroes rose
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   First, nothing matches the soap-opera comeback of the 6-year-old
Da Hoss. He won the $1-million Mile race in October 1996, then
missed two years of racing with a series of injuries. But he was
revived by his patient trainer, Michael Dickinson, a creative
Yorkshireman who keeps an imported, eight-horse exercise machine on
his farm in Maryland. And Da Hoss, after winning one warm-up race
last month, promptly won the Mile for the second time, two years
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of dark days and long nights,'' Dickinson
said. ``We keep him at the farm. When he gets to the race track, he
goes ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Da Hoss won't start again until Gulfstream Park in next year's
Breeders' Cup _ this time, without a prep.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new leading man in racing is the 4-year-old colt named
Awesome Again, who not only won the Classic in a blanket finish
with four horses less than one length apart, but also closed out
his year with a perfect record: 6 for 6. His trainer is Patrick
Byrne, the newest hero of the Breeders' Cup. He hit two home runs
in his first two at-bats last year when he won the two juvenile
championships with Countess Diana and Favorite Trick, who also
nosed out Skip Away for horse of the year.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the plot became too corny to be true: Byrne, an
engaging 42-year-old Englishman, surrendered tutelage of his two
champions to accept a job as trainer for Frank Stronach, a global
auto-parts dealer who owns homes in Canada, Switzerland, Florida,
Colorado and Kentucky, and also is buying the Santa Anita race
track. And one of Stronach's 900 horses is Awesome Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he's King Kong,'' Byrne said Sunday morning. But, if
Sonny Hine will forgive us, he added: ``I think you can make a good
case for Awesome Again for horse of the year. He is unbeaten and,
when the time came, he beat the best horses around in the richest
race there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert knows the highs and lows of the game. Remember, he
won both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness in the last two years but
was nosed out in the Belmont both times. In the Breeders' Cup on
Saturday, his gallant horse, Silver Charm, lost the richest race in
the world by three-quarters of a length.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to comment Sunday morning, Baffert shook his finger
at Pat Byrne, and said with stage severity: ``I'm mad at you.''

<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. -- Forget Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura as
Minnesota governor. That's strictly small-time, bush-league,
backwater politics, brother. Try this singlet on for size instead:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood'' Hulk Hogan for president.
</P>
<P>
   Like it? Kinda sends shivers down your spine, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, get ready America. In the wake of Ventura's stunning
electoral victory last Tuesday in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, Hogan,
a part-time resident of Westlake Village, a Southern California
suburb approximately 35 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles,
said he is ready to toss his own hat into something other than the
wrestling ring.
</P>
<P>
   He's thinking big, thinking the way you'd expect the heavyweight
pro wrestling champion of the world to think, the way you'd expect
a man to think whose programs dominate cable TV ratings and sell
out arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``On `Monday Nitro' (the TNT cable channel's wrestling program
at 8 tonight, where Hogan regularly appears) I'm going to announce
my candidacy for president,'' Hogan said from his other home, the
one in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just tired of the (politicians) who say they're
perfect when they're not. People are ready for a change. Everybody
has a little bit of good in them, even the worst criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of the upcoming announcement, Los Angeles politicians
greeted it with a twinkle in their eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hulk Hogan for president?'' asked Assemblyman Robert
Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys. ``What's next? ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin
for Senate? The way things are going, the World Wrestling
Federation is going to have to register as a political party.''
</P>
<P>
   That Hogan would run for president doesn't surprise his
mother-in-law, Gail Claridge, who lives in Somis in nearby Ventura
County. ``I think it'd be great. He's a very smart man, a
successful businessman. Certainly to stay on top as long as he has
takes a great deal of business and personal ethics. I've always
been proud to say he's my son-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Hogan met his wife at a nightclub in Southern
California's San Fernando Valley and lived in the area for several
years before moving to Tampa to be near his elderly parents.
</P>
<P>
   But the former valley resident still returns every few months to
see his wife's family and recently bought a house in the Country
Club Estates area of Westlake Village. A week ago Hogan and his
wife had a party there to celebrate the Claridges' 40th wedding
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Born Terry Bollea, Hogan said Ventura's success in Minnesota
spawned a raft of inquiries about his own political plans.
</P>
<P>
   The media and other calls have been so heavy that it reminds him
of the mid-1980s when Hulkamania was ``getting so popular I told my
wife I should run for president, but I didn't want to take a cut in
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   And how formidable would the bulging, balding, 6-foot, 8-inch
wrestler be in the political ring?
</P>
<P>
   Straw polls by a Tampa-area paper matching Hogan against
President Clinton and just-elected Florida Gov. Jeb Bush showed
Hogan won both contests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And if it ever came to putting the arm on recalcitrant
legislators, not even the strapping Lyndon Johnson, famous for his
hammerlock move in breaking up Senate stalemates, could stay in the
ring with Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   But Hertzberg, an Al Gore backer for 2000, warned that the
rough-and-tumble world of politics is a little different than
surviving a steel cage match at the local civic center.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a fighter to win in politics, but it takes more
than muscle to get the job done,'' Hertzberg said. ``If Hogan gets
into the race, I'll bet Al Gore gives him a political body slam
he'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But the Internet is already abuzz with jokes about how
politics would change if wrestlers ran the country.
</P>
<P>
   One list, possibly cribbed from David Letterman's show, notes
that a wrestler president ``now shouts entire state of the union
address with face 18 inches from the camera,'' and that it ``now is
considered acceptable to yield to the gentleman wielding the
folding chair.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hogan is ready to wrestle with Congress over the big
issues of the day, don't ask him yet what his positions are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to regroup here, brother,'' said Hogan, 44.
``I'm not ready for all these detailed questions and answers.''
</P>
<P>
   But heck, that's not vital anyway. Hogan promised to surround
himself with smart advisers of all political stripes who can help
him make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be no special interest groups'' involved, Hogan said.
``Everything that comes across my desk will be done for the best
interests of the country. I think a child who knows right from
wrong could make a lot of common-sense decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   And as far as financing his run for office, ``Hulk Hogan is not
a poor man. I've been wrestling nothing but main events for 20
years. I saved my money and I may find a penny or two lying around
for the campaign. I need the write-offs anyway.''

LIVINGSTON APPEARS CONFIDENT OF SECURING SPEAKER'S POST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., La., Mo., Ohio, Okla., Wash.)  (See also REPUBS-SPEAKER, REPUBS-ROCKIES) 
(js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the endorsements of top Republicans in his
pocket, Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana all but declared
himself speaker of the House Sunday, two days after the abrupt
resignation of Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have over a hundred votes or so now, and I need about 112,
and I'll have them probably within the next two days,'' said
Livingston. ``I will be the next speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Rep. Christopher Cox, a conservative from
California and the only other announced candidate for speaker, said
he had gathered about 90 commitments and should not be counted out.
But by Sunday evening, reports spread through the Capitol that Cox
would withdraw from the race on Monday in the interest of party
unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He concluded that Livingston was so far ahead that it would be
hard to catch up, although Livingston didn't have it wrapped up,''
said one Republican close to Cox. He added that Livingston had
``intimidated'' a number of members into supporting him because
even if he lost the race for speaker, he would remain as chairman
of the Appropriations Committee, an enormously powerful position
that allocates federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   The unofficial news of Cox's withdrawal prompted the only other
potential candidate on the horizon, Rep. Jim Talent of Missouri, to
issue a statement Sunday night saying that he had decided not to
enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the bag for Livingston,'' said a top Republican aide,
who predicted that Cox's formal withdrawal would have ``a very
soothing effect'' on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives unhappy with Livingston have been promoting Cox's
candidacy, saying as late as Sunday that Livingston was not a true
fiscal conservative, was too hot-headed and was too stuck in the
old ways to bring change to the House. But a Republican aide said
Sunday evening that the conservatives, known as CATS, an acronym
for Conservative Action Team, are expected to drop their
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CATS aren't purring but they're on board,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston also had the backing of several committee chairmen
and that of Rep. Tom DeLay, the House whip, who commands the
party's vote-getting and vote-counting organization that is used to
advance the leadership's goals.
</P>
<P>
   Still brewing are contests for other leadership positions. The
majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, is being challenged by Steve
Largent of Oklahoma. The conference chairman, John Boehner of Ohio,
is being challenged by J.C. Watts, Jr., of Oklahoma and George
Radanovich of California. The whip, DeLay, is believed to be secure
in his post.
</P>
<P>
   But the speakership, which is third in line of succession to the
presidency after the vice presidency, is the most powerful and the
most visible.
</P>
<P>
   If Cox drops out, Livingston could claim credit for
out-organizing and out-gunning his opposition that, for three hours
after he announced his candidacy on Friday, included Gingrich
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The race to replace Gingrich soared into overdrive Sunday,
lighting up Capitol Hill offices that are usually dimmed and dull
in the post-election season when Congress is out of session.
Members scurried back over the weekend from their home districts
for internal party brawls over leadership posts in the aftermath of
the Republicans' loss of five House seats in last week's midterms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The jousting spilled over onto the television talk shows Sunday.
Several candidates for three of the party's four hierarchical jobs
took their case to a national audience, even though the voting,
scheduled for Nov. 18, will be conducted only among the incoming
223 Republican House members.
</P>
<P>
   This use of national television for internal party positioning
seemed in part a response to the overwhelming concern of
Republicans that they learn how to better communicate their actions
and goals to voters. They blamed Gingrich for a failure to
articulate a clear message to voters this fall, although many also
said that the Republicans had accomplished so little this year that
there was nothing to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at stake here is not just the future of the House of
Representatives but the future of Congress and the country,'' Cox
said Sunday on the CBS program ``Face the Nation.'' Cox had
announced his candidacy for speaker on ``Larry King Live'' on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington said in response to a question
on the NBC News ``Meet The Press'' that she was considering running
for majority leader, a higher position than she had previously
indicated. ``It's possible that I will take a look at that in the
next couple of days,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The swamping of the airwaves is also an effort to give the party
a quick facelift now that Gingrich is gone. Democrats repeatedly
exploited Gingrich's image, demonizing him as the embodiment of
what they cast as an extremist Republican Party.

NIGERIANS AWAIT DEMOCRACY WITH HOPE AND SKEPTICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ She was at least as elusive as the other dreams
this country has pursued. A mermaid was spotted last week under
Falomo Bridge, swimming in the murky creek spilling into Lagos
Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   After word spread, hundreds of drivers parked on the bridge,
which leads to Victoria Island, this city's business center,
creating an extraordinary traffic jam, or ``go-slow'' in the local
slang. The curious, the hopeful, the doubtful stood there and
peered into the waters below.
</P>
<P>
   It is with a similar mixture of desperate hope, cautious
optimism and deep skepticism that Nigerians are watching their
country's new military rulers who have promised a permanent change
to a civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduling of elections, the release of political prisoners
and other reforms have earned positive reviews in the West for Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar, who took over as president in June after the
unexpected death of Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   But in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and one long
split by ethnic, religious and regional loyalties, distrust of such
promises runs deep. Many Nigerians _ journalists and activists,
opponents of the government and even some of its own officials _
warn against being too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Nigerians say there is already a greater feeling
of freedom, they are quick to add that political reforms have not
gone as far as they should. They say Nigeria's problems will not be
quickly solved. Among them are a military accustomed to holding
power and a split between the south, which produces the country's
oil, and the north, which controls it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes are only cosmetic,'' said Olisa Agbakoba, a
prominent human rights lawyer in Lagos and a member of the Ibo, one
of the three major ethnic groups in the country. ``It's nice that
Abubakar doesn't wear dark glasses'' _ a reference to Abacha _
``and that he's supposed to be a nice guy. But nothing has changed
fundamentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Nigeria is to start lurching toward democracy in a
series of elections that are to culminate in February with the
presidential contest and a transfer of power to a civilian
government on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has a great stake in these events, having
raised its investments in the Nigerian oil industry and relied
increasingly on the country, as West Africa's dominant power, to
keep peace in the area.
</P>
<P>
   For now, before the government's promises have been put to the
test of elections, even Agbakoba admits, reluctantly, that things
have improved.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, under the old regime, he was arrested at the
airport here after returning from London, even though he had taken
the precautions of returning through Ghana and using a second
passport. The authorities, he said, suspected anyone traveling to
Britain or the United States of fraternizing with the Nigerian
exiles there.
</P>
<P>
   After two months in jail _ and, more important, after Abacha's
death _ Agbakoba became one of the hundreds of political prisoners
freed by Abubakar. Today he travels freely, holds meetings with
fellow political organizers and talks on the telephone without
speaking in code.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shadow is no longer there,'' he said. ``You feel easy. You
sleep easy. Both eyes firmly shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the release of political prisoners, the new openness has
touched many levels of society. Exiles, most notably Wole Soyinka,
the Nobel Prize-winning author who lives in Atlanta, accepted
Abubakar's invitation to visit.
</P>
<P>
   On the traffic-clogged, fume-filled streets of Lagos, giant
billboards now demand human rights. Darting in and out of traffic
and rapping their knuckles against car windows with pleas of
``Master,'' children now hawk political magazines, like Tell, which
was banned until a few months ago and whose assistant editor was
jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Independent Journalism
Center here, said ``guerrilla journalism'' tactics were no longer
necessary. Targeted publishers no longer have to move from one
printing site to another each week to avoid detection, editors do
not have to hold meetings in restaurants, and reporters are now
permitted to attend government news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   But this new openness, Akingbulu and others say, may be
temporary. They point out that the government has yet to repeal a
notorious law, Decree No. 2, that allows the authorities to arrest
and detain people indefinitely under the catch-all of state
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abubakar has been in power for five months,'' said Femi
Falana, a well-known opposition lawyer. ``It doesn't take anything
to repeal that decree. It just takes a single stroke of his pen. If
you say you are controlling the military, and you are popular among
citizens, why are you leaving this problem for the next civilian
president?''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Haruna, chief press secretary to Abubakar, said there
was a limit to what the president could do in a short time.
Undertaking all necessary reforms would prolong his tenure and
inevitably bring accusations of wanting to cling to power, Haruna
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Koiranga Jada, a member of the Fulani ethnic group who
is seeking the governorship of the northeastern state of Adamawa,
said many changes would have to wait until after the scheduled
transition in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we have in this country is that people are never
satisfied and are too impatient,'' he said. ``When we get to
full-blown open democracy, we can take care of everything. After
May, we can restructure anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jada belongs to the All People's Party, one of the nine parties
that succeeded in registering nationally after Abubakar allowed
political parties to form before the scheduled elections.
</P>
<P>
   An independent body was created to oversee the elections, but
irregularities have already been reported. About 16 million
voter-registration cards vanished, preventing many people from
registering, said Haruna and opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, reforms to ensure the viability of a
civilian government after May have yet to be undertaken. No
constitution has been presented to the nation. The military, which
has put an end to civilian governments in the past, has not been
reformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, despite Abubakar's good intentions, the
monstrous military institution is still there,'' said Tunji
Braithwaite, a prominent Lagos lawyer who formed a party, the
Democratic Advance Movement, and is seeking the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Even Haruna, the president's press secretary, did not rule out
the possibility that the military, which is led by Northerners of
the Hausa and Fulani ethnic groups, could take action if it was
unhappy with the election results. ``It's possible,'' he said.
``You can't discount that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It has done so before, annulling an election in 1993 presumably
won by a southerner, Moshood K.O. Abiola, who was this country's
most prominent political prisoner until he died in detention this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Haruna said he suspected that reactionary forces _
high-ranking military officials and their civilian allies who have
much to lose in a democracy _ have at times fed the general bad
advice.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Abubakar recently announced a plan formed by Abacha
to more than double government workers' minimum monthly wage to
roughly $56. But the government simply cannot afford such an
increase, Haruna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one who wants him to succeed would have given him that kind
of advice,'' Haruna said.
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians in Lagos are calling for a decentralized
political structure that would give greater autonomy to the regions
and weaken the grip of the few hands in the north that control
Nigeria's fate. But barring such a reform, the office of the
presidency remains all-important and the potential cause of ethnic
and regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the most prominent figure to have declared his
presidential ambitions, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, is a member of the
southwestern Yoruba group with close ties to the northern military
rulers. While he is widely believed to be acceptable to the north,
many of his own ethnic group dismiss him as being too close to
northerners.
</P>
<P>
   Jada, the Fulani gubernatorial candidate, said he had supported
the presumed winner of the country's last election, Abiola, a
Yoruba who had converted to Islam and had succeeded in unifying
this fractious country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that for the stability of Nigeria, we require a power
shift to a southerner,'' Jada said. ``But the southerner should be
nationally popular, like Abiola.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the presidential election three months away, no figure
has appeared yet to Jada in Abuja, or to the hundreds standing on
Falomo Bridge.

<P>
   FORT WAYNE, Ind. _ On Oct. 30, children, teen-agers and adults
packed the balcony overlooking the gymnasium floor at the Indiana
Institute of Technology to watch the Fort Wayne Fury practice.
Excited fans jockeyed for position, standing on tiptoe and pushing
one another aside to videotape and photograph the action on the
court. The Fury is one of the strongest teams in the Continental
Basketball Association, but the crowd had not gathered to watch it
run through its plays _ they were there to see the Fury's newest
and already most popular player, the platinum-selling rap artist
Master P.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually have eight or nine kids hanging around the top of
the gym watching practice,'' said Rob Brown, media relations
director for the Fury. ``When P showed up for his first practice,
word started to get around that he was there. Some people called
their friends. Others left and went to get friends, and by the end
of practice there were 200 people surrounding the gym shooting
videos and taking pictures. It was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   What Percy Miller, known to legions of rap fans as Master P, is
attempting to do is incredible. In five years, he has made the
record label he owns, No Limit, not just the biggest rap label in
the country, but the biggest independent label. By reviving mostly
Southern-style gangster rap, and smartly creating buzz on the
street, No Limit has sold an estimated $200 million in records this
year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Also his label's most successful rapper, Miller entered the pop
charts at No. 1 in June with his most recent album, ``M.P. Da Last
Don.'' At the time, Miller announced that he was going to retire as
a rapper (a rarity for any pop musician at the top of his or her
game) so he could concentrate on being an executive.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, he set his sights on another prize: basketball.
A former high school star in New Orleans, Miller, a 6-foot-3-inch,
195-pound point guard, is trying to make it in the CBA, one step
below the National Basketball Association, with dreams of
eventually landing a spot in the NBA. While a number of NBA players
and other athletes have attempted to cross over into the
entertainment world _ and some, most notably Shaquille O'Neal, have
been successful _ spokesmen for the NBA, the Knicks and the Lakers
said they could not remember a rap or pop star ever trying to make
it into the league.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to playing ball, Miller is fast becoming a
significant sports businessman. Last year, he started No Limit
Sports Management, which represents four NBA players, including two
of 1997s most promising draft picks, the Cleveland Cavaliers
shooting guard Derek Anderson (a devoted Master P fan who had the
rapper's slogan ``No Limit Soldier'' tattooed on his arm four years
ago) and the Boston Celtics swingman Ron Mercer, whom Miller wooed
away from David Falk, the most powerful agent in the business. Both
players now live with Miller at his No Limit compound in Baton
Rouge, La., a multimillion dollar dormitory created for the rappers
and athletes he works with.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I offer my players is that I show them how to start up
their own businesses and how to prepare themselves for the
future,'' said Miller, who is not an agent himself but whose
company employs several licensed sports agents. ``I tell them that
basketball is going to end someday and that they have to prepare
themselves for a future outside of basketball. They know I know
what I'm talking about because that's what happened to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't always selling a million records. I started out
selling 1,000 and 500. They know about my success in business and
they know that I can market them: I can put them in movies, I can
put them in videos, I can have them endorse clothing lines, I can
help them make good investments. By being in the entertainment
business, I have connections that other agents don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Other agents, including Falk, have been able to put a number of
NBA athletes into movies and videos. What lured Mercer, along with
Miller's connections, was Miller's ability to relate to young
athletes and the camaraderie he felt at No Limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could talk to P about everything from basketball to
business,'' said Mercer, who appeared in a No Limit music video
this summer. ``Once I sat down and saw that everybody at No Limit
was real and straight up, I signed with them. There was a real
family atmosphere there. I can't say that about other agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as a masterful negotiator and street-smart businessman,
Miller has also invested in real estate, a Foot Locker franchise
and a gas station in addition to starting a No Limit clothing line,
a phone sex service and a film division that has produced several
best-selling straight-to-video movies starring Miller.
</P>
<P>
   In September, on its list of the country's highest-paid
entertainers, Forbes magazine placed Miller at No. 10 _ behind
Jerry Seinfeld, Steven Spielberg and the Rolling Stones but ahead
of Celine Dion, Puff Daddy and the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a plush, three-bedroom executive suite on the top
floor of the Fort Wayne Hilton (the 17 other players trying out for
the team stayed at a Best Western), Miller said his dream was
always to play basketball, not to make records. Rapping, he said,
was just something he was good at and a ticket out of the ghetto.
But, with no professional or major college experience, years of
non-physical work as a rapper and executive, and a training history
that only goes back to the beginning of this summer, is it
realistic to think that he could play in the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Master P as a businessman said they had little
doubt that he would accomplish whatever he sets his mind to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he sat down two weeks ago and told me he was going to
play in the NBA, I was skeptical,'' said Bryan Turner, president of
Priority Records, which distributes Master P's No Limit label.
``But then he put in a tape of him playing with all these NBA
players for charity in Houston, and I couldn't even tell it was
him. He held his own. Then I flashed back to five years ago when he
came to me and said he was going to sell millions of records. He
believes anything can be accomplished, and he's proven it. He's
definitely going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Miller and his younger brother, the 6-foot-7-inch Vyshonn (rap
name: Silkk the Shocker), were the only non-NBA players to compete
three weeks ago in that charity game at the University of Houston.
On the court with NBA players such as Stephon Marbury, Nick Van
Exel, Rasheed Wallace and Penny Hardaway, Percy Miller scored 22
points.
</P>
<P>
   While he displayed solid ball-handling skills and court vision,
Miller's success must be kept in perspective _ the players, wary of
injuring themselves, played little defense. Keith Smart, the Fort
Wayne Fury's head coach, who played professionally in Europe, the
CBA and the NBA, said Miller has good skills but is not near the
NBA level yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a born leader,'' Smart said. ``He can handle the ball and
he pushes the ball really well on the fast break. But it's going to
take some coaching to smooth out the rough edges. He's been playing
street ball, pickup ball, where there's no defense. Now, he has to
learn how to deal with officials, how to read different defensive
schemes, and how to run an offense while someone's putting pressure
on you. Those are things you would normally get by playing with a
coach every day, but he lacks them right now.''
</P>
<P>
   What impressed Smart the most was that Miller arrived at
training camp in ``basketball shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said: ``Most people probably think that since I'm a
rapper, I'm hanging out at the bar room and smoking weed all night.
But that ain't Master P. If I was in the league and they had a drug
test right now, I would pass because I don't do drugs. I'm an
athlete. I keep myself in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's basketball background is unclear. He played at Booker
T. Washington and Warren Easton High Schools in New Orleans; he
said he graduated from Warren Easton in 1987 and received a full
basketball scholarship to the University of Houston, where he
injured his knee during preseason practice and subsequently left
the school after he refused to be red-shirted.
</P>
<P>
   While Rick Poulter, sports information director at the
University of Houston, said Percy Miller is not mentioned in any of
the school's basketball media guides, he did find a team
questionnaire that apparently was filled out by Miller in 1985. The
questionnaire, which Poulter said proves that Miller was on the
team for at least two weeks, lists him as being a 6-4, 178-pound
freshman who averaged 18 points, nine assists, five rebounds and
three steals for Warren Easton. Poulter said Miller probably was a
walk-on, but did not rule out the possibility of his having been on
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaire also says Miller graduated from Easton in 1985
and was born in April 1968, which would make him 30 today. But
Miller, who maintained that he did not fill out the questionnaire,
said he was born in 1970 and is 28.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 18 players currently scrimmaging with the Fury, the team
will keep 10 in addition to one developmental player. The roster
must be set by Wednesday, and the first game is Friday against the
Connecticut Pride in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The average salary in the CBA is $1,500 a week. Miller signed a
nonguaranteed contract for $1,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Though Smart only implied that P was going to make the team, Jay
Leonard, one of the Fury's majority owners, said it was a
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that first week, we really felt like he was going to
make the team,'' Leonard said. ``He can help us as far as
publicity, which we're getting right now. We've got CNN and ESPN
coming in next week. It's good for us because a lot of people don't
know what the CBA's all about and how good these guys really are.''
</P>
<P>
   For Miller to earn significant playing time, however, may be
difficult. The Fury has two of the best point guards in the league:
Damon Bailey and Moochie Norris, both former second-round draft
picks in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Though the popular rhythm-and-blues singer and songwriter R.
Kelly played a few games for the Atlantic City SeaGulls in the less
competitive U.S. Basketball League, and Mark Miller, the lead
singer in the country group Sawyer Brown, worked out once with the
Fury, neither had the talent or commitment that Master P has
displayed. The Fury players said that at first they were skeptical
about the rapper's abilities, but he quickly proved himself as a
player and teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you don't think of a rapper as being a great player
or even a good player, but he belongs here,'' Bailey said. ``He's a
good player. You could tell that the first day he was here, and
he's getting better. Whether or not he makes the team, I don't
know. But if he does make the team, nobody can say that it's a
gimmick because he's talented enough to play in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everybody else on the team, Miller waits in line after
practice for the standard $15 per diem players receive during
training camp. The other players sometimes tease the multi-platinum
rapper about taking the money, but he responds, ``Man, I ain't
letting nothing get by me.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is taking Miller's attempt to play basketball
lightly. Some skeptics in the music business wonder whether the
time it will take to play in the CBA and train for the NBA will
distract him from his very hands-on duties running his record label
No Limit.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bryan Turner at Priority said he was not worried. ``P
said: `Bryan, think of the marketing possibilities. Everyone's
going to have to buy our records now.' And then we both started
laughing.''
</P>

GLENN NEARLY BACK TO NORMAL AFTER TAXING MISSION
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By MARK CARREAU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ John Glenn, the world's oldest space
traveler, appeared refreshed and sure-footed on Sunday, his first
full day back on Earth after nine in weightlessness aboard the
orbiting shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great this morning. I slept like a log last night,''
Glenn, 77, told a news conference at NASA's Kennedy Space Center
early Sunday. ``I'm probably 95 to 98 percent re-adapted. It will
be a few days before I'm completely back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery touched down at Kennedy at midday Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn soon joined his six shuttle colleagues in a brief walk
around inspection of Discovery but appeared wobbly as he strolled
on the runway. Later, the crew's NASA flight surgeon canceled plans
for a post landing press conference by the astronauts because a
round of medical examinations took longer than the scheduled four
hours.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Glenn acknowledged that his body was taxed by the
first sensations of gravity he experienced as Discovery returned to
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you come back from something like that you feel a
little bit woozy,'' said Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   He also characterized himself as ``alligator-headed,'' a
reference to his efforts not to swivel his head too rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Many astronauts find it difficult to stand without fainting
immediately after their return to Earth. The difficulty disappears
after their cardiovascular system becomes accustomed to working
harder to pump oxygen rich blood to their brains. Rapid head
motions are also unsettling and sometimes provoke nausea
immediately after astronauts return to Earth. The sensation
disappears as the gravity sensing mechanisms of their nervous
system re-acclimate to gravity.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the discomforts, Glenn said he was elated by his
latest spaceflight and elated to be re-united with close family
members and, with the rest of Discovery's crew, to receive a
congratulatory phone call from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie was very glad to have me back, and I was glad to see her
obviously. It was a very touching moment,'' Glenn said of his
reunion with his wife of 55 years. While most of the encounter was
private, the elderly astronaut said the couple shared the pack of
Wrigley's Doublemint gum that he left with her the night before
Discovery blasted off.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Glenn's often risky career as a Marine Corps aviator,
test pilot, astronaut and U.S. Senator, he would playfully tell his
wife that he was going to the corner store for a pack of gum when
they faced a lengthy separation.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn made history on Feb. 20, 1962, when as one of NASA's seven
original astronauts he became the first American to orbit the
Earth, making the flight alone in a tiny Mercury capsule. He soon
left NASA when he could not be assured of another trip to space and
successfully pursued careers in business and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn won the chance to fly aboard Discovery by volunteering to
serve as a subject in a range of medical experiments designed to
compare the stresses of spaceflight with those of the natural aging
process.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Glenn ranked his nine-day shuttle flight with the
five-hour Mercury flight in terms of its personal satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got great satisfaction out of it of just being up there and
being the first to do that for our country,'' he said of the 1962
flight. The Mercury mission that proved humans could pilot a
spacecraft, a feat that eventually helped America to win a Cold
War-era race to the moon with the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am all these years later,'' Glenn said, pointing to his
shuttle crewmates. ``I'm just very proud and have a great sense of
satisfaction of participating (in a space flight) with such a great
crew as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will spend most of the next three weeks in Houston
completing the post-landing phase of Discovery's medical
experiments. Two of the most crucial will examine how his muscles
and sleep patterns readapt to life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   He will retire from the Senate in January after 24 years,
returning to his native Ohio, spending more time with his wife and
possibly assisting NASA in winning greater public support for the
space program.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery commander Curt Brown, pilot Steve Lindsey, flight
engineer Scott Parazynski, Japanese astronaut Chiaki Mukai and
European Space Agency astronaut Pedro Duque each reported they had
fared well on their flight.
</P>
<P>
   Payload Commander Steve Robinson, however, sported a small cut
on his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a spacecraft-body contact I had not anticipated. I
bonked into the shuttle,'' Robinson joked.
</P>
<P>
   The astronaut said he struck his head while floating through the
darkened tunnel that linked the small laboratory in Discovery's
cargo bay and the shuttle crew compartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my story,'' said Robinson. ``And I'm sticking to it.''

   Media lockout proposal: Until the NBA's labor issues are
resolved, stories shall cease about who talked to whom on the phone
to set up another unproductive meeting, whose bad-faith modified
proposal was struck down by whom, whose agent stuck his nose into
whose business, what's the difference between a strike and a
lockout, how many days have passed, how much money has been lost,
how many players are about to file for bankruptcy, how many other
players are doing radio shows to promote themselves, or how long

to get our lives together. I promise to write more about hockey and

sport for joy.'' . . .
</P>

   __ Retailers, by the way, are blaming the lockout for sluggish

fact the shoe is just plain ugly. . . .

</P>
<P>
   __ Aside from NBC's Dick Ebersol claiming he's found some new
original programming with the network's announcement of the
``Gravity Games'' next year, the fact remains: Today's kids are
more and more detached from the sports their parents grew up with,
more disinterested in the labor talks and money issues, more
disillusioned with bad-ass athletes and more in tune to getting
outside and actually participating in biking, boarding and bass
fishing _ things that give them a sense of personal accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   And aside from this looking like a network desperately trying to
reach a certain age demographic, it's just the way sports are
going, and the media is going to have to make adjustments.

<P>
   TURIN, Italy _ The English will kill each other to protect
animals. The French fight to the death to preserve the purity of
their language. Italians, however, rarely get indignant about
anything, except food. Few other nations, for example, have so
passionate a grass-roots movement to preserve endangered species of
cheese and protect vegetable rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plants have a soul,'' playwright and Nobel prize winner Dario
Fo warned a rapt audience last week at a conference on Biodiversity
and Genetic Species on the Verge of Extinction. ``They have
feelings. And some are assassins, using poison to destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fo is one of the intellectual pillars of Slow Food, a food and
wine organization created 13 years ago by an Italian journalist,
Carlo Petrini, as an antidote to fast food. Both men were expecting
more than 100,000 people to attend Slow Food's Salone del Gusto, a
five-day food fair that ends Monday night, drawing epicures
dedicated to the languorous enjoyment of slowly prepared regional
delicacies. Petrini became radicalized when he entered the Piazza
di Spagna in Rome and smelled mass-produced french fries wafting
from the country's first McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Slow Food, which was begun by a group of leftist intellectuals
disenchanted by politics and disgusted by the fast-food trend, has
in the last few years become fashionable in Italy and throughout
Europe. After an initial, mostly botched effort to infiltrate the
United States eight years ago, it is now catching on via the
internet with American food and wine connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   Now with 40,000 members in 35 countries, Slow Food's manifesto
warns against ``obsessive worrying about hygienic matters'' and
pledges to preserve such endangered foods as Firiki apples from
Greece and Sicilian lattume di tonno, sperm of male tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Il Salone del Gusto, held in a giant convention center which was
once a Fiat car factory, boasts 300 regional food stands, with free
samples, 50 gourmet dinners and 325 workshops on everything from
``Cooking in the Antipodes'' to ``Hungarian Foie Gras and Tokaij,''
(or Tokay, a white wine). It is to ordinary food fairs what
Republican national conventions are to New Hampshire political
coffee klatches. Here, however, delegates vote with their forks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel how the fat gallops in your mouth,'' Piero Sardo, a
cheese expert and co-founder of Slow Food, instructed 110 gourmands
who signed up and paid $16 for last Thursday's workshop, ``Strong
Cheeses and Sweet Wines.'' He was commenting on a Stilton, served
with a Greek port wine. His students, seated at conference tables
behind six tasting glasses and a plate of cheeses labeled by
number, swallowed obediently before nibbling a French Roquefort,
which they were informed, contains ``noble'' salt levels.
</P>
<P>
   Food is not just good at these workshops, it is dripping with
history. ``Real iberico,'' a Spanish ham, comes from a breed of
pig, Cerdo Iberico, which is the direct descendant of the
Mediterranean boar that man began domesticating in Neolithic times.
Uncontaminated by any crossbreeding, raised in the Dehesa, an
ancient Mediterranean forest and fed on la bellota, a kind of
acorn, the Cerdo Iberico is a kind of ``thoroughbred swine,''
according to Giovanni Pellinghelli del Monticello, a consultant to
a guild of Iberian ham producers, who delivered the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never know what the Bollinger Louis XV drank really
tasted like,'' he said sadly, referring to phylloxera, a disease
that destroyed European vines in the late 19th century. ``But this
pig is an uncontaminated breed, its ham today has exactly the same
taste it had when it was eaten by Charles V of Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   French, British and American history buffs are known for their
re-enactments of famous battles _ Austerlitz, Waterloo or
Gettysburg. Italians prefer to dwell on the great meals of history.
Actually, so do their American acolytes. Patrick Martins, a Slow
Food activist based in Bra, a food-obsessed town in Piedmont,
Italy, wrote his thesis at New York University on Medieval Food
Sculptures, which, among other things, involved molding asparagus
into a giant chess-set.
</P>
<P>
   Fo and others complain about multinationals, which favor mass
production and have steadily reduced the world's varieties. At the
turn of the century, there were 30,000 varieties of rice in India.
Now, there only 12.
</P>
<P>
   But the public also prefers convenience, speed and lower prices.
``Our real enemy is the obtuse consumer,'' Sardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the Salone, even among the initiated, there were some
Slow Food recidivists. Lorenzo Molinacci, 42, who makes Panforte di
Siena, a sophisticated brand of fruitcake, was discovered at
lunchtime wolfing down a prefabricated prosciutto sandwich at the
Autogrille, an Italian fast-foot outlet inside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else could I do,'' he said sheepishly. ``I'm very busy
and I had to go somewhere and eat fast.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Post-modern food tastings at the fair were provided by theater
director Silvio Panini, who created a ``degustazione teatrale,'' in
which the diners, wearing earphones and seated at stark steel
tables, sample tiny drops of balsamic vinegar and minimalist
morsels of parmigiano while a performance artist recites sensual
eating instructions. ``Agriculture is an aesthetic,'' Panini
explained.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas, it is also a dying art. Lard from the region
surrounding Carrara, which was the basic food for the marble
workers who supplied Michelangelo, is in danger of extinction,
according to Slow Food. ``Pigs today are small and too meaty,
everyone wants pork-light,'' complained Marino Giannarelli, 50,
whose family firm, Lardo di Colonnata, produces a small amount of
extremely thick, succulent lard.
</P>
<P>
   The Caciocavallo Podolico is a rare, fragrant cheese from the
Campania region, which relies on finicky free-range white cows, who
will only give milk if their calves are standing near them, and
even then, only a few liters a day. ``You have to be a hero to make
it,'' Sardo said. ``And also a bit crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   A kilo of Caciocavallo Podolico costs $37, three times as much
as more ordinary varieties of Caciocavallo. To raise consumer
consciousness, Antonio Madaio, a processor from Eboli, has begun
selling three-pound balls of his cheese in wooden trophy boxes,
with a certificate attached.
</P>
<P>
   Participants ranged from Jonathan White, an artisanal
cheese-maker from Peekskill, N.Y. who makes butter for the White
House, to some of the world's most high-minded chefs. Miguel
Sanchez Romera, 45, for example, is a neurologist who on weekends
cooks Spanish nouvelle cuisine at his restaurant, L'Esguard, in a
small town outside Barcelona. He was one of three chefs selected to
prepare a three-course, $178 gourmet meal for 36 people, which
included a dish of egg and caviar inspired by Van Gogh's
Sunflowers. Romera gave a lecture explaining the neurological
impulses of appetite.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ One day in January, Bill Owens will shuttle cardboard
boxes down a hall of the state Capitol here, moving from the
treasurer's office to the governor's. For the first time since
1974, the year President Nixon resigned, Colorado is to have a
Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   But on a larger scale, Owens' election seals the interior West
as the most Republican region in the country. Republican governors
are set to rule every state in the 14-state expanse bounded by the
Sierra Nevadas to the West and Missouri and Arkansas Rivers to the
East, a gain of three for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The region that was known in the 1980s for such Democratic
stalwarts gas Govs. Dick Lamm of Colorado, Cecil Andrus of Idaho
and Pat Williams of Montana has decisively shifted into the
Republican camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was head of the Western Governors' Association in the
late 70s, we had only one Republican governor, everyone else was a
Democrat,'' marveled Philip M. Burgess, president of the Center for
the New West, a regional think tank here.
</P>
<P>
   The new Republican dominance can be seen at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 of the 14 states, Republicans control 20 of the 26
chambers. (Nebraska has a single nonpartisan chamber.)
</P>
<P>
   In the region's congressional delegation, Republicans have a
2-to-1 advantage _ 64 Republicans to 33 Democrats. If Texas is
excluded, the Republican advantage jumps to 3 to 1, or 49 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   After the 2000 census, the interior West is expected to gain
seven House seats, while the Northeast is expected to lose five.
</P>
<P>
   Thinly populated, the interior West traditionally has received
scant attention from national political strategists. The seven
states of the Mountain Time Zone _ Arizona, Colorado, Idaho,
Montana, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming _ have a combined population
of 14 million, the same as Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 2000 presidential election, political attitudes in
the Mountain states may carry more weight. On Nov. 16, leaders from
these states, plus Nevada's, are to meet in Salt Lake City to
decide on a date for a joint Western presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues important to the interior West have been virtually
ignored in past elections,'' said Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer, a
coordinator of the effort. ``If several states band together to
hold a primary, we increase the odds that the voice of the West
will carry beyond our borders and all the way to Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the interior West, Democrats rule the Pacific
West. Democrats will be governors and will control state
legislatures next year in California and Washington state. Oregon
will have a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly is not one West anymore,'' said William T. Pound,
executive director of the National Conference of State
Legislatures, a research group based here. ``There is a striking
contrast between the Pacific West and the mountain West.''
</P>
<P>
   On a simplistic level, conservatives have moved from coastal
southern California to the interior West, tipping ideological and
partisan balances. Over the last decade, 1.6 million people,
largely whites, have migrated from California. Nevada, Arizona,
Idaho, Utah and Colorado experienced the nation's highest
population growth rates, with California supplying the largest
group of migrants.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, polls indicate that the newcomers have been far
more likely to register Republican than Democratic, according to
Floyd Ciruli, the president of a polling company here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the Southern Californians, the people facing the fires,
the floods, the riots, and all the other reasons to leave,'' he
said. ``Republicans out here speak of an orderly society, personal
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, voter registration in Colorado has moved
from an even balance to a 130,000 advantage for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the whole Rocky Mountain area, to win as a
Democrat is an uphill climb,'' conceded Colorado Gov. Roy Romer,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Romer did not seek
re-election Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With three interior Western states _ Nevada, Utah and Arizona _
experiencing the nation's highest rates of job creation, Democrats
had hoped that the influx of newcomers would foster activist
environmental politics. Instead, affluence has reinforced existing
conservative, small government values.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rocky Mountain West is becoming more economically viable,
and when people are comfortable, they vote Republican and for
incumbents,'' said Dottie Lamm, wife of the former governor. Last
week, as Colorado's Democratic candidate for senator, she was
defeated by an almost 2-1 margin by Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, a Colorado real estate developer and chairman of
the Republican National Committee, said Friday: ``The spirit of the
Rocky Mountain West, the emphasis on freedom and rugged
individualism, coincides well with Republican values and ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems hindering the Democrats is that their core
constituency groups, such as union members and racial minorities,
are at low levels in the Rockies. But critics say that Democrats
have also allowed Republicans to carry the flag on issues popular
here: term limits, tax cuts, local control and individual
responsibility.

<P>
   While the Civil War may still define politics in the South,
public lands still define Western politics.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lands account for about half of all Western lands.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt alienated many Westerners when he
sought to charge ranchers and miners more to use federal land.
About five years ago, conservatives started talking about the
Clinton administration's ``War on the West.'' They described
Babbitt, who comes from an Arizona ranching family, as Washington's
colonial agent for the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the interior Rocky Mountain states, the federal government
is still seen as the nanny,'' said Burgess. ``Democrats like Al
Gore and Bruce Babbitt are always telling us how to use our water,
how to use our public lands.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also have lost a generation of political figures who
managed to take care of their liberal base and to capture the
moderate middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lamms and the Romers gave East Coast folks the wrong
impression that this was a liberal region,'' said Gary Hart, who
was a Democratic senator from Colorado in the 1980s and now works
as a lawyer in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Colorado, the Romers, the Lamms, the Harts _ that
generation has passed,'' said Dick Wadhams, the campaign manager
who engineered Owens' razor thin, 7,928-vote victory over the
Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler.
</P>
<P>
   Her defeat ``put the final spade of dirt on that generation of
Democratic elected officials,'' Wadhams said.
</P>
<P>
   But others caution that the Western voter is not a partisan
voter, but an independent. In the 1992 presidential campaign, the
West was Ross Perot's strongest region.
</P>
<P>
   Romer, who at 70 has been in Colorado politics for 40 years,
predicted confidently, ``This is going to swing back. The culture
is going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Predicting that rampant growth would create a need for a more
interventionist government, he said: ``In Colorado, it was
wide-open spaces and leave us alone. Now, everybody is stuck in a
traffic jam. They can't get into their parks.''

BACK ON EARTH, GLENN NOW FACES TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ John Glenn, the world's oldest space
traveler, said Sunday that he slept ``like a log'' his first night
back on Earth after a nine-day shuttle mission.
</P>
<P>
   At the Discovery crew's first news conference after their
return, Glenn admitted that he ``didn't feel too hot'' when he
emerged from the shuttle upon landing on Saturday. Glenn, 77, who
in 1962 became the first American to orbit Earth, said he struggled
against gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking straddle-legged to keep my balance a little
bit,'' he said. ``I'm probably 95 or 98 percent back to normal
now.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA doctors said none of the astronauts showed significant
medical problems after a journey of 3.6 million miles and 134
orbits around the earth. Stephen Robinson, 43, a mission
specialist, said he gashed his head traveling through a tunnel
inside the shuttle ``going kind of fast,'' but that he did not lack
for doctors on board. ``They just jumped with delight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn steered questions to his crewmates: Lt. Col. Curtis Brown
Jr., 42, the shuttle's commander; Lt. Col. Steven Lindsey, 38, the
pilot; Scott Parazynski, 37, a mission specialist and the senator's
attending doctor in space; 35-year-old Pedro Duque, another mission
specialist and the first Spaniard to go into space; and Chiaki
Mukai, 46, the payload specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the heroes of this thing as far as I am concerned,''
Glenn said. Some other members of the Discovery crew said they were
grateful for the interest Glenn brought to the space program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attention is wonderful and I hope it does last,'' said
Parazynski, whom Glenn called ``Count Dracula'' because he was
always drawing blood from him.
</P>
<P>
   The crew and their families flew to Houston Sunday after the
press conference for a welcoming ceremony and 17 more days of
testing at the Johnson Space Center. Glenn, who is the subject of
geriatric research, faces more blood tests and urine collection, as
well as cardiovascular, bone loss and sleep studies. He will not be
allowed to drink alcohol or caffeine and his sleep, exercise and
food consumption will be monitored.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, Glenn said the space trip left him with
both a sense of accomplishment and ``a little letdown that the
whole thing is over.'' He said this would be his last attempt at
space flight in deference to Annie, his wife of 55 years. ``She's
been through enough,'' he said. ``I owe her some consideration at
this point in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, a Democratic senator from Ohio who will retire in January
after 24 years, is expected to return to his home in the Washington
area around Thanksgiving, but he is scheduled to undergo sporadic
testing for the next six months. Sunday he said he had not
discussed ``follow-up relationships or anything like that'' with
NASA, but wanted to help promote the benefits of the space program.
He said he also planned to work with students at Ohio State
University and his alma mater, Muskingum College in Ohio, to
address the ``cynical and apathetic attitude'' he sees in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare his Discovery flight with his first trip into
space, he said: ``The first flight was the first orbital flight we
ever tried. We were just trying to find out if we could do it or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we had 83 different research projects on this one flight,
things of tremendous value,'' he said. ``They're out there on the
cutting edge of science.''
</P>
<P>
   He did note the difference in the shuttle itself, which was far
more spacious than the tiny cockpit he occupied on his first
flight.
</P>
<P>
   In a playful jab at a crewmate's reaction to weightlessness,
Glenn said, ``Chiaki had the roundest face I'd ever seen.'' Dr.
Mukai laughed at the comment and had only praise for her fellow
astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so amazed and impressed by Sen. Glenn,'' she said. ``He
encourages me quite a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by an 83-year-old reporter if there was hope ``for people
of my generation,'' Glenn said: ``There's a lot of hope. You should
run your life not by the calendar but how you feel, and what you're
interests are and ambitions. Old folks have dreams and ambitions
too, like everybody else. Don't sit on a couch someplace.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Jose Antonio Amaya Garcia has lived long
enough to survive three hurricanes, but the devastation wrought on
Central America by the gargantuan maelstrom known as Mitch took
even him by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a punishment from God,'' Amaya, an elderly carpenter,
said late last week as he searched under an avalanche for what was
left of his house. He is tiny and frail in his soiled shirt and
pants, the last clothing he owns. ``I am 73, and I've never seen a
disaster like this.''
</P>
<P>
   As the scope of the devastation became clear, many Central
Americans like Amaya were wondering what had hit them. No other
hurricane in modern history has wreaked such havoc and death in
this region, no stranger to these tempests of nature. But unlike
past storms that struck hard and moved on, this hurricane stalled
just off Honduras' north coast for four days, dumping several feet
of water on Central America even as it lost power.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for two more days, it crawled across Central America from
the Atlantic coast of the isthmus to the Pacific coast, before
turning west, raking Guatemala and El Salvador, and moving into
southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It was the rain, not the storm's winds, that did the most
damage. The torrential downpours spawned floods and avalanches that
killed more than 10,000, erased entire villages, devastated crops
and destroyed much of the infrastructure in Honduras, Guatemala, El
Salvador and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitch took a walk through all our territory,'' said Martin
Baide, a spokesman for the Honduran president's office.
</P>
<P>
   The freakish behavior of the storm is the major reason it caught
governments and people off guard. But the high death toll also owes
something to poverty and politics. Most working-class houses are
poorly built, and many impoverished people erect their homes, often
illegally but with a wink from local politicians, on marginal lands
close to rivers or clinging to unstable mountain slopes that have
been stripped of trees.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, many people did not heed government warnings on
the radio to abandon riversides and coastal regions for higher
ground. Many Hondurans remembered Hurricane Fifi in 1974 and
Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, huge storms that concentrated their fury
on the north coast of the hilly country but did not move inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the hurricanes that have come by have only touched the bay
islands and the north coast,'' said Dr. Marcio Galo, a government
physician. ``In Tegucigalpa we didn't expect such a quantity of
water would fall or would cause such damage. And we never expected
it would affect the south too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second week of October, an unremarkable atmospheric
disturbance, accompanied by thunderstorms, moved west out of the
Sahel in Africa and into the Atlantic Ocean. A hundred or so of
these tropical waves, as meteorologists call them, do the same
every summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   For a week the tropical wave that would become a hurricane
raised few alarms as it crossed the ocean, eventually reaching the
eastern Caribbean, near the Lesser Antilles, on Oct. 19. It was
just another band of thunderstorms, and nine out of 10 these waves
eventually dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see thunderstorms every day,'' said John Guiney, a
hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
``The key thing is persistence.''
</P>
<P>
   But this disturbance did persist, and it grew stronger as it
moved into the warm waters of the central Caribbean, where
sea-surface temperatures are well above the 80-degree mark
necessary to generate a hurricane. Over the next two days, it
sucked up moisture and heat and its winds began to rise.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21 scientists at the Miami center determined that the
pinwheel-shaped storm had become a tropical depression, as baby
hurricanes are known, and they dubbed it Mitch, in accordance with
their alphabetical list. It was 360 miles due south of Kingston,
Jamaica, moving northward.
</P>
<P>
   By the next afternoon, the hurricane's winds had risen to about
45 miles an hour, and it was classified a tropical storm. But it
still offered no clue to U.S. Air Force scientists who flew over it
in a specially outfitted C-130 cargo plane of what it would become.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really wasn't much of a center,'' recalled Maj. Rich
Harter, a meteorologist on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The night of Oct. 22 and through the next day, everything
changed. The storm exploded in size and ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   By Oct. 24 it was a full-blown hurricane with 90 mile-an-hour
winds, about 200 miles south-southwest of Kingston and inching
north at seven miles an hour. Though the storm was far out at sea,
torrential rains hit Costa Rica, causing floods that killed seven
people.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba and Jamaica began preparing for the impact, but on Oct. 25
the storm veered westward and ambled menacingly toward the Yucatan
Peninsula. People in Belize and Mexico braced for the worst. Dozens
of foreign journalists traveled to the resort city of Cancun,
Mexico, to cover the storm.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, Oct. 26, the hurricane had became a true monster,
with winds of 180 miles an hour, moving west. Although the eye of
the storm was 100 miles north of the Honduran coast, heavy rains
began falling across Central America. The barometric pressure at
the center _ a standard measure of intensity _ fell to 905
millibars, tying it with Camille in 1969 for the fourth-strongest
Atlantic hurricane on record.
</P>
<P>
   To meteorologists, it was beautiful, a true marvel of nature.
The Air Force reservists who flew into it, members of a crew based
in Biloxi. Miss., called the Hurricane Hunters, saw a perfect
bowl-shaped mass of clouds around a clear center, with circular
tiers like a football arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all in awe,'' said Guiney, in Miami. ``This was the
atmosphere at its worst in terms of its impact on man.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, nature's caprice intervened once more, in the form of a
high-pressure system north of the hurricane. These east-west winds
deflected the hurricane and steered it west before slackening and
leaving the storm drifting aimlessly off the Honduran coast, often
hovering over one spot in the ocean, churning up cold water from
deeper in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of a Honduran island, Guanaja, had to take cover
on the afternoon of Monday, Oct. 26. They spent a hellish three
days as the storm meandered. Vacationers in the resort at Posada
del Sol described days of listening to a shrieking wind outside
their cement compound, like a freight train or jet engine. Many of
the island's 5,000 residents waited out the storm in a protected
canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Pagoada, 48, a land surveyor, weathered the storm with 12
other people inside a fishing trawler pulled up on a beach behind a
seawall. Although the group had food and water, he said, they
nearly lost their composure by the third day of screaming winds and
high surf pounding the wall. ``We didn't know if the sea was going
to bury us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane destroyed most houses on the island, tore boats
from their docks and knocked out all power and telephones. Flowers
and greenery were blown away, leaving a barren landscape, with only
tree trunks protruding from denuded hills, Pagoada said. Six people
were killed. ``It was just luck, luck, simple luck that I
survived,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Thursday, Oct. 29, the hurricane hit the hilly
north coast of Honduras, near Trujillo. Its winds slackened to 60
miles an hour, downgrading it to a garden-variety tropical storm.
But it produced enormous downpours throughout the region. Harter,
of the Hurricane Hunters, said flying through the storm at that
point ``was like being in a shaky car wash for about six hours.''
</P>
<P>
   As it wandered across Honduras over the next 48 hours, the storm
dumped as much as two feet of rain a day in some locations,
according to unofficial estimates. The rivers and creeks lacing
Honduras' mountainous countryside quickly swelled to several times
their normal size, flooding entire towns and neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In the north, the floods destroyed vast banana plantations
belonging to American companies and damaged coffee crops. Countless
families were stranded on rooftops, surrounded by water. Countless
others drowned as they struggled to find higher ground.
Communications were knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, the Choluteca River had put many parts of
the capital, Tegucigalpa, under water. Factories, hospitals,
prisons and several neighborhoods were swept away, along with
livestock and an unknown number of people. People living next to
the river abandoned houses and sought shelter on higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went by in the river,'' said Alejandro Isaguire, a
35-year-old farm worker. ``Cattle, cars, tires, buses,
refrigerators. It was scary. It made me pray to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday and in the early hours of Saturday, the true horrors
began. Across Honduras, landslides and avalanches buried whole
villages and destroyed dozens of poor neighborhoods in major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Zelaya Gomez, 73, was asleep in his bed with his wife when
his house was destroyed in a landslide that took the lives of at
least 13 people, including his daughter and granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear the noise because I was sleeping,'' he said.
``But when I woke, I felt that the walls were falling in. I grabbed
my wife and we left our room and went into the corridor. There was
this enormous crash.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple made it out of the wreck, only to find most
neighbors' houses had slid into a river below or collapsed in an
avalanche. With the earth still moving under his feet and the rain
continuing to fall, Zelaya tried desperately to pull friends and
relatives from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later there was another rumbling from the
mountainside. The survivors fled just before a second landslide
took everything left of the homes down into the river below.
</P>
<P>
   Some riverside communities, like Morolica in southern Honduras,
were entirely washed away. The floods destroyed dozens of shrimp
farms and melon plantations in the south. Scores of bridges were
knocked out, along with power and telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no place was harder hit than Casita Volcano, in
northwestern Nicaragua, near the town of Posoltega and close to the
border with Honduras. The incessant rains filled the volcano's
crater with water, creating a lake. On Friday afternoon, the
crater's wall gave way, burying about 14 villages in mud and
killing at least 1,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like a desert littered with buried bodies,'' said the
mayor of Posoltega, Felicita Zeledon.
</P>
<P>
   News of the catastrophes was slow to emerge. By Saturday
morning, Oct. 31, communications systems were crippled and all the
major roads impassable in Honduras and much of Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the storm was not yet finished. Unwinding and slowing
down, Mitch moved west across Honduras on Saturday, then raked
through Guatemala and El Salvador on Sunday, finally losing power
that afternoon as it entered Mexico, near Tapachula.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as skies cleared somewhat, the scale of the disaster
became apparent. ``We have before us a panorama of death,
desolation and ruin throughout the entire country,'' the Honduran
president, Carlos Flores Facusse, told his stunned nation in an
address that evening.
</P>
<P>
   La Ceiba, in the north, was flooded and cut off by downed
bridges. The second-largest city and economic hub, San Pedro Sula,
was under a meter of water and its airport was badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The road linking the capital to San Pedro Sula and the Caribbean
port at Cortes was cut, as was the road from the capital to the
Pacific Coast. Much of downtown Choluteca, the economic engine of
the south, had been buried in mud. Government officials say
Honduras has lost most of its coffee and banana crops, worth about
$500 million, and about 70 percent of the year's grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tragic what has happened to us,'' said Marco Polo
Michiletti, the deputy minister for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Central America, hundreds of towns found themselves
cut off, unable to get shipments of food or medicine and without
clean water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are completely incommunicado,'' said Juan Francisco
Alvarez, mayor of Soledad, when a Mexican helicopter arrived with a
small shipment of food last week. His community lost 14 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of our roads are damaged,'' he said, wearily
ticking off the town's woes. ``All the bridges are out. There is no
electricity. There are no telephones. We are rationing food.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, the U.S Air Force began search-and-rescue
helicopter operations from Palmerola, about 30 miles northwest of
the capital, plucking more than 670 people from roofs and trees
over the next three days. More than 600,000 homeless people were
crammed into schools, churches and other temporary shelters.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, more help arrived. Mexico sent helicopters, cargo
planes, troops trained in rescue missions and 700 tons of food.
Japan pledged to repair two crucial bridges. The United States
followed suit, pledging $70 million to help rebuild Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   As the week wore on, Tegucigalpa grew tense. Prices rose and
food disappeared rapidly from grocery shelves. Hundreds of cars
lined up at gasoline stations, where armed guards kept order. The
government instituted a nightime curfew and banned the drinking of
alcohol to combat looting. Desperate people dug through the muddy
rubble of former stores, looking for canned goods.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday the main highway linking Tegucigalpa to Port Cortes
was reopened after engineers, working 24 hours a day, filled in the
gaping ravine left when water washed away a culvert. Trucks
carrying fuel and food began reaching the capital.
</P>
<P>
   As the waters receded, more and more bodies were discovered.
Although the bodies of most of the 6,400 people the government
estimates were killed in Honduras may never be found, the hurricane
appears to have been the Atlantic's deadliest in two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa, only 20 bodies have been recovered. Hundreds
have been reported missing, and are presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge number of people are buried,'' the city coroner, Dr.
Lucy Marrder, said. ``There are entire settlements that are buried
and they haven't recovered the bodies.''

STRATEGIES FOR RESPONDING TO IRAQ ARE DISCUSSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Clinton administration once again considers
using force against Iraq, the Pentagon has drafted separate plans
for a sharp, swift strike that could begin at any time, and a
larger, more punishing assault that would require sending more
forces to the region, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton met for two hours Sunday with his senior
national security aides at the presidential retreat at Camp David,
Md., to discuss strategies for responding to the new defiance by
Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, of the U.N. weapon inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Officials emphasized that Clinton had not yet decided to use
force in the latest confrontation with Saddam and that the plans
could change.
</P>
<P>
   But with no 11th-hour diplomatic initiative in sight and with
frustration over Iraq growing not only within the administration
but among allies in Europe and the Persian Gulf, the possibility of
a strike has loomed larger than at any point since the showdown
last winter with Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Either of the two plans now under consideration could cause
significant damage to Saddam's bases of power, including Iraq's
military and special police and factories or other sites suspected
of producing chemical and biological weapons, the officials said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   They declined to discuss the planning in greater detail.
</P>
<P>
   The swift strike has the advantage of speed and surprise. The
United States could launch the strikes with the forces already in
the Persian Gulf, including warplanes aboard the carrier Dwight D.
Eisenhower and seven other Navy vessels that can fire Tomahawk
cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The larger strike could do more damage, the officials said, but
would require Clinton to activate air and naval forces based in the
United States. Those forces, already on call in case of a crisis in
the region, could arrive in the Gulf region within 96 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade-off is speed vs. power,'' said one official familiar
with the planning.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting Sunday with his national security aides,
which took place at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md.,
Clinton asked for a review of all the diplomatic and military
options on the table, and told his advisers to report back to him
``over the next several days,'' said David Leavy, the spokesman for
the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some important questions he wanted to get some more
information on,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no decisions at the meeting, Leavy said. In
attendance were Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Secretary of
Defense William Cohen; the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Gen. Henry Shelton; the national security adviser, Sandy Berger;
and the director of central intelligence, George Tenet.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's meeting came on the heels of diplomatic missions by
Clinton's aides. On Friday Cohen completed a whirlwind tour of nine
Arab states, where he gauged anti-Iraqi sentiments. He won no
public backing for military action, but officials said he received
private pledges of support from allies whose territory or air space
might be needed for strikes. Berger met with his French and British
counterparts outside Paris on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patience among all the allies is frayed, badly frayed,''
an official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not set a deadline for Iraq to reverse its
decision to end all cooperation with UNSCOM, the U.N. commission
overseeing the dismantling of Iraq's weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials also said they had not decided whether
to issue an ultimatum before acting. One official said the
administration did not foresee a new diplomatic appeal to Iraq,
like the one the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, made in
February to avert a U.S.-led strike.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration had refused to discuss any timetable
for action, there are external factors that could affect decisions
in the days ahead. A significant one is the president's schedule.
He plans to leave the United States on Friday for a nine-day trip
to Asia.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An overriding question facing the administration is what to do
after a strike. While the Pentagon's planners believe even the
smaller option could heavily damage targets dear to Saddam, a
strike could well mean the end of the seven-year effort by U.N.
inspectors to ferret out Iraq's ballistic missile and chemical and
biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have also warned that even a larger strike is
not likely to topple Saddam, nor is it any guarantee of eliminating
Iraqi weapons of terror.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, the Iraqi government showed no signs of backing
down. Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, said Iraq would not
resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors until the Security
Council agreed to review the sanctions imposed in 1991 after the
Persian Gulf war. The trade minister, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said
Iraq had nothing to fear from attacks, since the sanctions were
already causing suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not kill in a military strike more than they are
killing with sanctions every day,'' The Associated Press quoted him
saying.

TWO HAD SCORES TO SETTLE WITH ISRAELIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANATA, West Bank _ On a warm, sunny morning last Friday, at the
time he usually left for work at his family's produce store,
Youssef Sughayer said goodbye to his grandmother for the last time
and rode off to his death.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives say that the 21-year-old Palestinian from this village
near Jerusalem showed no sign that he was heading for a suicide
mission with his brother-in-law as part of a secret cell of Islamic
Holy War. Their car-bomb blew apart two hours later in a Jerusalem
market, killing both men and wounding 24 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't grieve for me,'' he wrote in a farewell note, according
to relatives who found it later. ``If you cry, cry with happiness
that I'm a martyr. Don't serve bitter coffee, serve sweets. I'm
going to Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   At the family's stone house outside Jerusalem on Sunday,
visitors paying condolence calls were served sweet juice, not
coffee, as Sughayer's relatives tried to make sense of what he had
done.
</P>
<P>
   The young man, once an ace student, had come of age in Israeli
prisons. Jailed for a year at age 15 for stoning Israeli cars
during the riots of the Palestinian uprising, he was imprisoned
again at 17, that time for three-and-a-half years for similar
offenses and affiliation with Islamic Holy War.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said he was an impressionable teen-ager, influenced by
Islamic militants with whom he was jailed. Sughayer came out of
prison more devout, and hardened by mistreatment at the hands of
the Israelis, relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   His cellmates taught him the doctrine of holy war and about the
glories of martyrdom, said an older brother, Samih Sughayer. ``They
sowed it in his heart,'' he said. ``He wanted to be a martyr in the
cause of God.''
</P>
<P>
   But that reality, suddenly so clear Sunday, was not so apparent
when Sughayer was freed seven months ago. ``He seemed normal,''
said his brother. ``He went to work at the grocery store, he
finished his high school classes and he wanted to enroll in the
university. He was supposed to take a driving test in a few days.
If he was planning something, we didn't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   He would stay up late at night after work, studying the Koran
and praying, but he showed no outward signs of rage toward Israel.
``He would joke about things and say that whatever happens is God's
will,'' said a brother-in-law, who insisted on anonymity. ``He was
an easygoing guy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Sughayer bought a battered red Fiat and parked it
near his house. When someone at home asked about the car he said
nothing, and family members assumed it was one of the stolen
vehicles often found here.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning he left with the car, meeting his
brother-in-law and old jail buddy, Suleiman Tahayneh, who came from
his village near the West Bank town of Jenin.
</P>
<P>
   Tahayneh had his own score to settle with the Israelis. His leg
had been amputated after he was shot in a confrontation with
Israeli troops during the uprising, his relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiat was loaded with explosives, and the two men drove to
the market. That evening, when concerned members of the Sughayer
family gathered to await news of their missing relative, a man
arrived and told them that he had sold his car to Youssef the
previous day. It was a red Fiat, the same car they had seen near
the house, and the same type of car that news reports said had
exploded in the marketplace. At midnight, Israeli security forces
raided the house and interrogated family members. The last, grim
pieces of the puzzle fell into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to the last minute on Thursday night we were talking
together,'' said Sughayer's oldest brother, Ali, who worked with
him past midnight at the produce store. ``He asked me about someone
who had moved his hardware shop to another village, about how he
was doing. Earlier we ate together, and we talked about giving
charity to the poor. He wasn't nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had plans for the future,'' Ali continued. ``Maybe the
people in his group convinced him to do this, and he could not
refuse. We did not expect this from him.''

COMMENTARY: NEW GOP LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1920 presidential campaign, the Democratic ticket was
James Cox and young Franklin Roosevelt. The Latinesque call to vox
populi, the voice of the people, was in this doggerel:
</P>
<P>
   Cox and Roosevelt/ Roosevelt and Cox;/ You tell 'em, populi,/
you got the vox.
</P>
<P>
   That Cox didn't make it. Neither did the new one: Rep. Chris Cox
of Southern California, who for one brief shining moment was the
dark horse candidate to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is a figure I vainly urged to step down ever since his
cockamamie book deal. He belatedly got the voters' message and did
the right thing; liberals and Big Labor will miss their favorite
punching bag the way hard-line hawks miss Brezhnev.
</P>
<P>
   That was revealed in the Democratic leader Dick Gephardt's
embittered late hit about ``the damage that was wrought on this
institution'' by the man whose job he wanted. It was left to the
Atone Ranger in the White House to graciously bid farewell to a
``worthy adversary.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost certain to be the new voice of House Republican people is
Bob Livingston, who had the moxie and foresight to first challenge
the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The current Appropriations baron is not the stiff he seems to be
on television. At a recent charity roast (I was the roastee), he
whipped out a harmonica and stunned the crowd with an updated
rendition of ``Oh Susannah.'' If a solid, dependable insider were
the new face the GOP leadership needed, Livingston would be a
natural.
</P>
<P>
   What he will need to prove, however, is that he is not merely
``not Newt.'' In the apportioning of power, he will also have to be
sensitive to geographical balance: the notion of a man from
Louisiana joining Mississippi's Trent Lott in the congressional
leadership places too much faith in the Land of Lotteries, Casinos,
Riverboat Gambling and High Moral Dudgeon.
</P>
<P>
   But as this is written (during the ``fluff dry'' part of the
news cycle), that Congressional Delta Force is wrapping up the
speakership. House chairmen successfully leaned on members to
``re-up'' _ to freshen old commitments to the Livingston they know
_ rather than turn to a comer before his time has come.
</P>
<P>
   That exhibited characteristic supercaution. Take a quick look at
the challenger who so quickly folded: Cox was a White House counsel
in the Reagan years from California, the biggest state, now a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Clinton White House and desperate
for Republican hope. Chosen to head the Select Committee
investigating the Asia connection to fund-raising and espionage, he
impressed even endangered Democrats with a low-key, fair-minded
approach. His classified report is due on Jan. 2; we'll get a
cleared version a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Cox is the sort of personality the GOP requires as one of its
spokesmen in the long year before the presidential candidate takes
over: reasonable, intellectually able to marshal arguments on tax
reduction. What did he get in return for not making a fight for the
speakership? His Republican Policy Committee will probably get a
larger staff. That's not much, but when national security becomes
an issue, he'll have a stronger voice in the upcoming missile
defense debate.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, the putative speaker, is not someone Democrats will
be able to demonize or roll at session's end, as they did Gingrich.
He is probably better positioned than anyone to wheel and deal with
Democrats inside the House. Will he be a memorable speaker,
effective in achieving conservative legislation with the Senate,
thereby helping presidential candidates in 2000 keep the House in
Republican hands? Hope for surprises, but don't expect miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Below the speakership, the election of leaders next week should
offer Republicans a chance to make a new start. Why isn't Jennifer
Dunn more ambitious? Why not elect the telegenic and principled
J.C. Watts and Steve Largent to leadership positions?
</P>
<P>
   The infusion of new energy near the top will be Speaker-apparent
Livingston's first major test. This week, Republican voters should
tell him, through their representatives in Congress, that a
reshuffle of old faces is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   If you want new hands at the helm with constructive,
conservative ideas, then tell 'em, populi. You got the vox.

SUPPORT FOR LIVINGSTON REPRESENTS MOVE TOWARD PRAGMATISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ind., S.C.)  (Eds: 2nd take will move by 9 p.m.) 
(mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four years after a class of fervent, conservative
anti-politicians rode into the House majority with Newt Gingrich,
many members of the radical Republican class of '94 are throwing
their support behind Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., a signal that
they are ready for more pragmatic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Their backing marks a significant shift in emphasis. For
although Livingston considers himself a staunch conservative, his
ascension as the front-runner in the speaker's race in many ways
represents the demise of anti-establishment impulses in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, is whether any Republican will be able
to manage the House with only a razor-thin six-vote majority. Even
this past year, when the Republicans had five additional votes,
they were paralyzed in trying to balance between social
conservatives and the party's business wing, between fiscal
conservatives and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston, a 21-year veteran of the House who rose to
chairman of the all-important Appropriations Committee, has shown
he may not feel the same needs as Gingrich to placate his party's
most raucously ideological wing.
</P>
<P>
   As Appropriations Committee chairman, he has been a vociferous
critic of the attempts by conservatives to attach controversial
riders to spending bills as a method to force through their social
policies. And he is openly running as the kind of mainstream,
deal-making, pragmatic politician that the conservative rebels once
might have abhorred.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ``This Week'' Sunday, Livingston pre-emptively
challenged the conservative commentator George Will, anticipating
questions before they were asked and showing impatience with calls
for ideological purity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forefathers wrote a Constitution that gave us the
opportunity to settle our differences by compromise,'' Livingston
said. ``Not by dictate. If I were George Will, I could say how the
world should be run. But unfortunately, with a margin of only six
votes in this coming Congress, I've got to work with people who
don't believe the same way I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich always had mixed loyalties. He too had once been a
backbencher who fought the party establishment, so he at least
understood the fervor of the rebel class. But in the last few weeks
before he decided to step down, he railed against the very
conservatives he brought into power. He denounced them on the House
floor as the ``perfectionist caucus'' and he spoke bitterly of
``cannibalism'' in the party as he announced that he would resign.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a class of '94 member who
is head of the House's conservative caucus, which has 40 or more
members, is openly crusading against Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the Louisiana Republican ``an old-style pork caucus
kind of guy'' who would lead House Republicans back into the
minority.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston has also been getting some surprising support
from others among the one-time rebels. Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.,
one of the firebrands who tried to topple Gingrich in 1997, has
come out unequivocally for Livingston, as have a number of other
members of his class.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' Sunday, spoke
admiringly of Livingston's courage in taking on Gingrich, and
forcing him to step down. ``Bob Livingston has told me to my face I
was full of it a couple of times and nobody else has done that,''
Graham said.``And I admire and respect that.''

LAST PLACE TO FIRST PLACE TO NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Eleven months ago, the New York Giants danced
and celebrated on the Texas Stadium field. Champions of the storied
National Football Conference East, the Giants were brandishing a
new-found supremacy, a display that hinted at a shift in the
balance of power within the division.
</P>
<P>
   It has turned out to be a very brief reign.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday at Texas Stadium, there was no frolic in the Giants.
Unceremoniously, the defense of their NFC East championship all but
ended in a workmanlike 16-6 victory by the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Nine games into the 1998 season, the Giants have lost six times
_ more losses than they had last year. With seven games to go, a
Giants season that dawned with great expectations has dissolved
into an audition for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Giants played one of their more consistent games,
when it was over, all that remained was the nagging notion that
their effort was too little too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's discouraging, because I thought we'd use the first half
of the season to position ourselves and maybe stockpile some
wins,'' Giants quarterback Danny Kanell said. ``Maybe we got caught
up in it a little bit and thought things were going to come easy.
But they didn't. The hole kept getting bigger and bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Giants have yet to climb out. They are only two
victories ahead of Washington, which means the Giants have gone
from last place in 1996 to first place in 1997 to nearly last place
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With three division losses and a formidable remaining schedule,
they are eliminated from the playoff chase in every way except
mathematically.
</P>
<P>
   As Giants coach Jim Fassel said: ``Realistically, today's game
puts us out of it. I'm not going to kid you.''
</P>
<P>
   There was hope for a while on Sunday that the Giants were
mounting a last charge, a final swipe at making something of their
season. Late in the first half, with a first down at the Dallas
1-yard line, the Giants seemed destined to take a lead on the
Cowboys (6-3).
</P>
<P>
   But in a fitting sequence for a failed season, the Giants did
not score a touchdown and never truly recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The key play on the goal line was a second-down, 7-yard sack of
Kanell, after a first-down run did not produce a touchdown. Fassel
had called a pass intended for tight end Al Pupunu.
</P>
<P>
   It was a new play, installed to take advantage of an
overaggressive Cowboys defense. In Friday's practice, the Giants
had run the play no fewer than three times, once to be sure that a
blitz up the middle was properly picked up.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the blitz came from the back side, or left side, of
the formation. Pupunu, who lined up on the right side, was supposed
to disengage from his defender at the line and drift into the right
side of the end zone. Running back Gary Brown was the only other
option, also on the right side. And Kanell's attention was focused
entirely on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   From the left, Dallas' Darren Woodson ran toward Kanell
unabated. Pupunu was bottled up at the line, lost in the goal-line
maze of bodies. Before Kanell could consider a pass to Brown,
Woodson decked him. Two plays later, the Giants kicked a 23-yard
field goal to tie the score, 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, whose offense has been criticized for its conservatism,
did not consider a pass on the goal line a significant risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been very good on the goal line against the run,'' he
said. ``And if you're going to pass on the goal line, your best
opportunity is to do it before third down. If you've run it twice
and been stopped, trying to throw it on third down won't fool
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As if motivated by the same reasoning, the Cowboys scored the
game's only touchdown in the fourth quarter on a second-down,
1-yard pass from Troy Aikman to tight end Eric Bjornson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a good call,'' Kanell said of the play on
which he was sacked. ``It just went wrong too fast. It happened too
quick. I wasn't supposed to even worry about anything from the back
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' failure to get into the end zone overshadowed a
productive day offensively. Their offensive line, often denigrated,
played ably, leading the team to a season-high 159 yards rushing.
Brown ran for 119 yards on only 15 carries, averaging 7.9 yards.
Kanell was much more decisive than he had been in last week's loss
to Washington, throwing the football downfield often and completing
12 of 24 passes for 139 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, the worst team in the National Football League in
third-down efficiency, even converted six of 13 third-down plays
into first downs.
</P>
<P>
   But as Brown said, ``If you don't put the ball in the end zone,
it doesn't matter how many yards you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Following their retreat at the goal line at the conclusion of
the first half, the Giants' first possession of the second half
could have been a rallying point. And the Giants did appear to be
on their way to something when Kanell connected with Chris Calloway
for a 23-yard pass into Cowboys territory early in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Calloway fumbled after his catch, and Dallas recovered. It
was the only turnover of the game. Soon the Cowboys, who dominated
the rest of the game, had a 9-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' fourth-quarter touchdown sealed the victory. The key
play in the Cowboys' scoring drive came on a third-and-3 when
Aikman, who completed 11 of 12 passes in the second half, passed to
Ernie Mills for 27 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Mills fell to the Giants 1-yard line after making the catch. On
the play, Giants free safety Tito Wooten appeared close enough to
knock the ball away from Mills, or deliver a blow that would have
made a reception unlikely. Wooten did neither, awkwardly jumping
past Mills but not colliding with him.
</P>
<P>
   Wooten, whose play has significantly regressed from last season,
when he was one of the Giants' top defensive backs, made a similar
misplay two months ago when the Cowboys routed the Giants at Giants
Stadium.

Fassel said. ``That's the kind of game it was. The team tried hard
and we did some things better. But that's what it was.

LIVINGSTON TAKES CAUTIOUS STANCE ON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: References in 11th and 13th grafs to Rep. Lindsey Graham
appearing on both ``Meet the Press'' and ``Face The Nation'' are

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The front-runner to be the next speaker of the
House said on Sunday that lawmakers should consider public
sentiment that President Clinton has not committed impeachable
offenses, even as a House panel prepared to begin impeachment
hearings on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, the leading candidate to
replace Speaker Newt Gingrich, said he would wait for the
recommendations of the House Judiciary Committee and its chairman,
Henry Hyde of Illinois, before passing judgment. But Livingston
also said public opinion needs to be factored into the final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have certainly indicated in the polls that
they don't see it as an impeachable or dismissible offense, and
that would have to be considered in the political arena,''
Livingston said on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But still in all, we cannot simply disregard the fact that
there are other people in our society, in the military and in
various other walks of life, as CEO's or principals of schools, who
have been likewise charged and have lost their jobs,'' Livingston
said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if last Tuesday's elections, which brought Democrats
surprising victories, were a referendum on impeachment that cleared
Clinton, Livingston hedged his bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know if he's home free or not,'' he said. ``But
I would have to say that the president has still to answer to the
American people for the charges, and the charges are that he lied,
and that he lied under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's comments took on particular relevance as the House
moved to select its new leaders, because if the Judiciary Committee
approves articles of impeachment against Clinton, the speaker will
oversee the debate on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats and a growing number of Republicans say the
likelihood of this lame-duck House impeaching Clinton is
diminishing by the day. And impeachment in the next Congress would
be even more problematic, with the Republicans' majority pared to
just six seats.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a Judiciary subcommittee will hear from 19
historians, constitutional scholars and former Justice Department
officials on what constitutes an impeachable offense. The
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, whose scathing 445-page report
ignited the impeachment inquiry, is scheduled to testify on Nov.
19, the same day House Republicans are likely to vote by secret
ballot to pick their choice for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   As the Judiciary Committee moves to center stage, an influential
Republican on the panel, Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina,
seemed to hint on Sunday that he believed lying alone might not be
an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a high crime or misdemeanor, given the context of what
occurred, there's a sense of proportionality that has to come to
bear,'' Graham said on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every felony doesn't allow you to get the death penalty,'' he
said. ``Every high crime and misdemeanor may not result in
impeachment or should result in impeachment. You have to have a
sense of proportionality, but you've got to stand up for the rule
of law. ''
</P>
<P>
   On the CBS News program ``Face the Nation,'' Graham said he was
prepared to vote for an article of impeachment on the grounds of
perjury. But he seemed to suggest that a possible alternative
punishment might be in order.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's views are important because he is one of a group of 10
moderate Republicans and Democrats who are open to some sort of
alternative punishment, including censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is just about sex with an intern, and being caught off
guard, and making false statements, but not really having a
criminal heart about it, then that's one thing,'' he said. ``But if
it's really about grand jury perjury, then we've got to say, given
the context of that situation, is the political death penalty
warranted? The political death penalty is impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Rep. Charles
Schumer of New York, who was elected to the Senate last Tuesday,
said censure would be an appropriate penalty. ``I don't think the
president should go away without any punishment,'' Schumer said on
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer predicted that neither the Judiciary Committee nor the
full House would vote to impeach Clinton. ``They're going to figure
out a way to wriggle out of this,''he said.

A SOUL MAN LOST IN AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTHa  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a leased Nissan Pathfinder, Steve Rushin took 36 CDs, a set
of golf clubs and a dozen foul cigars that could be converted to
road flares and turned left out of Bloomington, Minn., one day.
</P>
<P>
   The Sports Illustrated writer had decided he needed to a) try to
forget the fact he was about to turn 30, and b) rediscover what
this country's obsession with sports was all about so he could
write a travelogue.
</P>
<P>
   The result, called ``Road Swing: One Fan's Journey into the Soul
of American Sports'' ($22.95, Doubleday, 245 pages), might have
curbed his premature midlife crisis, but it left a few inconclusive
dead ends with the latter issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rushin's nationwide detour takes him through 23,658 miles of
interstates and dirt roads; he hits all but four of the contiguous
United States. He skips Florida because it was being ravaged by
hurricanes, and West Virginia, Utah and North Dakota ``on the
grounds that they were West Virginia, Utah and North Dakota,
respectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he stops, examines and rambles a bit about how and
why he ended up at these strange-but-true places.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jim Thorpe, Pa., where the great Native American Indian
athlete's remains ended up because the city said it would name
itself after him.
</P>
<P>
   Or Matfield Green, Kan., where the 1931 plane crash that took
the life of Knute Rockne is marked by a stone plaque behind a
rest-stop Hardee's.
</P>
<P>
   Or even Southern California, where Rushin takes in a Dodgers
game, has a late-night snack with Jerry Reuss and discusses the
pronunciation of his name (rhymes with ``flushin' '') with Ducks
winger Steve Rucchin (rhymes with ``smoochin' '') _ and then hears
a Channel 4 sportscaster (has to be Carlos Del Valle) butcher the
latter as ``Roo-shun.''
</P>
<P>
   Each stop seems to be for a certain purpose on Rushin's
scattered itinerary. It just seems like since he's been to many of
these places before, there's not much magic about them. Not even
Anaheim. Too often, he gets caught up in rehashing a piece he once
did for SI _ which, incidentally, also got some mileage out of the
book by excerpting it in a recent issue.
</P>
<P>
   By chapters, it's a fun read. In total, the conclusion that
road-sage Rushin draws from all this _ that the phrase ``American
culture'' wasn't an oxymoron _ seems anticlimatic. Were we
expecting a gonzo payoff? Maybe so.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an idea: Ten years from now, Rushin can do it all again
when he nears the age of 40. Because by then, he'll pull out of
Bloomington, Minn., and have plenty of material about how the last
decade has been with a pro wrestler serving as governor in the Land
of 10,000 Flakes.
</P>
<P>
   THAT'S got to say something about the soul of America, and not
just American sports.

SPORTS COLUMN: TITLE BOWL GAME MAY HAVE A FLORIDA TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In six short days, Ohio State's Joe Germaine went from
much-hyped Heisman Trophy candidate to a quarterback only entrusted
by his coach with handing the ball off during a critical
fourth-quarter drive. In less than four hours Saturday, the
Buckeyes lost all their national title hopes when Michigan State
pulled the upset of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Now everything is a mess _ especially for those awaiting
Monday's Bowl Championships Series rankings, which promises to
match the best two teams in the nation in a true national title
game to be played at the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in seven years, the USA Today/ESPN coaches'
poll has a tie for No. 1, between Kansas State and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press news media poll was more decisive, giving
Tennessee the top spot over Kansas State. And The New York Times
computer ranking, one of three nonhuman measuring services employed
by the BCS, chose Florida State with one loss as its No. 1, with
Tennessee No. 2 and Kansas State No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Throw the votes and calculations into the BCS blender and, for
another week, college football is shaken but not yet meaningfully
stirred.
</P>
<P>
   How will the rankings from the BCS formula spew out this week?
Here's a try: 1. Tennessee, 2. Kansas State, 3. UCLA, 4. Florida,
5. Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of bedrocks of college football thinking remain
steadfast.
</P>
<P>
   First, the teams that want to play for a national title must win
big games in November. Second, an early-season loss does not
necessarily kill championship chances. Third, the Florida teams, at
least in recent history, have a lot to say about who actually is
the best team in the country. And finally, Ohio State Coach John
Cooper once more will have to sweat the Michigan game.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes blew a 24-9 lead against Michigan State, but had
the ball late in the fourth quarter when Cooper took it from
Germaine, who had come into the game off four consecutive passing
performances of 300-plus yards. Ohio State ran and ran and ran
until it ran out of room. On fourth-and-1 at the Michigan State
26-yard line with 3 minutes 33 seconds left _ and Ohio State
trailing by 28-24 _ linebacker T.J. Turner held up Joe Montgomery
at the line.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ohio State got the ball back, Germaine had less than
2 minutes left and no timeouts. Still, he passed the Buckeyes down
to the 15. On fourth down, he lofted a spiral to the left corner of
the end zone for flanker Dee Miller _ only to have it picked off by
cornerback Renaldo Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Cooper conceded the Buckeyes were out of the national
championship race and acknowledged he had a more daunting task
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a chance to win this league,'' he said of the
Big Ten Conference race. ``We need to regroup and do something we
haven't done in a while, and that's beat Michigan,'' said Cooper,
well aware of Ohio State's 1-8-1 record against Michigan over the
last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the first time in a long time, the big November games
will take place in locales like Knoxville, Tenn., and Manhattan,
Kan., between teams not usually in the title race this time of
year. On Saturday, Tennessee (8-0) takes on Arkansas, a team that
finally cracked top 10 in all the rankings after being kept out
despite being one of only four unbeaten teams in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Kansas State will face Nebraska in a game where
the roles are dramatically reversed. In recent years, the
Cornhuskers hogged the spotlight and the Kansas State game a meant
one more pesky challenge for them to repel. Now, Kansas State is
expected to beat a team with two losses, though the Wildcats have
not topped Nebraska in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State beat Baylor by 49-6 on Saturday, but the Wildcat
locker room rang with dissatisfied voices. Twice the No. 1 scoring
offense in the nation failed to get points from inside the Baylor
10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wake-up call for us, because we can't get stopped,''
running back Eric Hickson said. ``We got stopped today, and that's
something we've got to improve on. We've got to cut down on our
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor locker room was not happy either. In the age of
computer-heavy rankings, Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder elected to
score a touchdown on the final play. He later called it ``a bad
choice,'' but it reportedly upset his quarterback, Michael Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of one-loss teams out there that have been
accused of similar sins in the past: Florida and Florida State.
They remain in the title mix because they had the good sense to
lose early in the year _ the Gators to Tennessee and the Seminoles
to North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   Only one team is going to emerge unblemished from the
Tennessee-Arkansas game. They will most likely face each other
again in the Southeastern Conference championship game. If Kansas
State gets past Nebraska, it has a tough Missouri team the
following week and probably Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 championship
game. The polls' No. 3 team, U.C.L.A. (8-0), continues to tempt the
fates _ the Bruins needed a 61-yard touchdown pass from Cade McNown
with 21 seconds left to beat lowly Oregon State (4-6) on Saturday.
UCLA has three tough games left against Washington, Southern
California and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   So the Florida-Florida State game on Nov. 21 might ultimately
become a qualifier game for the Fiesta Bowl. Both have steadily
risen in the polls _ right or wrong, losses in September are easily
forgiven by voters. They are computer darlings because of the
strength of their schedules. Florida State's opponents are 51-27
and Florida's 42-29, both better numbers than any of the remaining
unbeatens.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are long that Kansas State, Tennessee and UCLA will all
remain unbeaten. It's dicey to bet that two of them go undefeated.
The best bet on the board is that one of the three plays the winner
of the Florida State-Florida game _ presuming the victor retains
only its one loss _ for the national title in the Fiesta Bowl at
Tempe, Ariz., on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In an ironic footnote that fits under
``the-more-we-know-the-more-we-don't know'' heading, in 1991 the
coaches' poll could not decide between Miami and Washington as its
final No. 1 team. When both won bowl games, the coaches crowned
Washington and the writers' Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference now is that a split championship will be
mostly computer-generated.

 WASHINGTON: respect that.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., a member of the same class,
started talking to a reporter of how the House needs more of an
emphasis on effective management and less on vision. He then
laughed at how he was sounding to himself like Michael Dukakis, the
failed Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., who helped push
Gingrich out the door by saying that he and seven others could
block the speaker's ultimate election on the House floor by
refusing ever to vote for him. He, too, is backing Livingston
because he admires him for taking the risk to challenge Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think courage is long overdue in the Republican
conference,'' he said. ``My hat's off to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of these Livingston supporters said they have matured
and learned that paralysis in the House does not give them an
agenda on which they can campaign. And Graham on Sunday moved
squarely and surprisingly onto ground usually considered favorable
to Democrats as he spoke on NBC of an agenda for his party. ``We
need HMO reform,'' he said. He spoke of Social Security, and he
challenged President Clinton on education policy. ``We need to
fight the federalization of your school system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he prevails as expected in the speaker's race, Livingston
could also be given a little maneuvering room by the change in the
makeup of the Republican caucus. Only 49 of the original 73 members
of the class of 1994 will be in the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Three of them are out after losing bids last week for the Senate
_ Reps. Linda Smith of Washington, John Ensign of Nevada and Mark
Neumann of Wisconsin. A fourth, Jon Christensen of Nevada, lost a
primary for his party's nomination for governor earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The incoming class of Republicans is more moderate than the
class of '94. And some supporters of Livingston also expect that he
would be more able than Gingrich, who was hated by Democrats, to
find common cause with the opposition party when needed. He has,
for example, worked quite amicably with Rep. David Obey of
Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on his committee, even when they
have had strong policy differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob is basically conservative,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y.,
``but he would be able to more easily work with conservative
Democrats and moderate Democrats and be able to cut deals that are
satisfactory to most Republicans.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's election results cheered not only Democrats but
conservationists as well. Montana voters banned the use of cyanide
leaching at open-pit gold mines, a technique lethal to rivers and
streams. Colorado and South Dakota imposed tough new restrictions
on giant hog farms, which can generate as much pollution as a small
city. New Jersey's approval of a $1 billion plan to save vanishing
farmland was one of many successful state and local initiatives
aimed at protecting open space from commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-fourths of all environmental ballot proposals
passed muster. That sends a message to Washington. Americans would
clearly like to see a more vigorous brand of environmental
stewardship in the new Congress, and will support the
administration as it grapples with unresolved and politically
difficult environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Montana's decision to clamp down on dirty mine operations _ a
remarkable gesture in a state long sympathetic to extractive
industries _ ought to encourage the Interior Department to try
again to tighten mining laws. The votes against hog farms should
encourage the Environmental Protection Agency to push ahead with
tougher clean water regulations for big agricultural operations.
</P>
<P>
   The broadest message involved open space, an issue on which Vice
President Al Gore has been increasingly vocal. An estimated 400,000
acres a year are being bulldozed for subdivisions, shopping malls
and roads, and when voters in places like New York's Suffolk County
approve a $62 million bond issue to buy open space, it is clear
that they have just about had enough.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the administration should make a vigorous
push for full financing of the Land and Water Conservation Fund,
the one federal program explicitly designed to help states and
communities preserve open space. About $900 million flows into the
fund every year from offshore oil royalties, but in the last few
years Congress has usually appropriated only one-third of that
amount for land purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the administration have also tended to favor
federal conservation projects over local projects, even though the
original statute setting up the fund mandated a 50-50 split.
Perhaps this year Washington will open its ears to what the grass
roots are saying.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 9:
</P>
<P>
   One of the candidates in Kazakhstan's presidential elections in
January claims to be clairvoyant, but anyone can predict that the
winner will be the incumbent, Nursultan Nazarbayev. Nazarbayev is a
thinly disguised dictator who stages elections he has no chance of
losing. Few Western leaders complain, because he is seen as the
guarantor of stability in an oil-rich nation.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbayev was initially one of the more democratic of the
Central Asian rulers, but since 1995 he has steadily expanded his
powers. A compliant parliament recently passed constitutional
amendments extending the presidential term from five years to seven
and lifting term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbayev has been jailing political opponents on libel charges
and last week kicked his leading opponent, former Prime Minister
Akezhan Kazhegeldin, off the ballot on a technicality. Nazarbayev
has also been shutting down the country's few independent
newspapers. Television is controlled by his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   American officials raise such issues with Nazarbayev when they
visit, and call democratic development an important American goal
in the region. But oil takes precedence, as Kazakhstan's proven oil
reserves alone come to 10 billion barrels. Nazarbayev controls
these contracts and provides stability in a region where
fundamentalist Islam is growing. He has been received warmly by
President Clinton. Kazakhstan's democratization is not a priority
for Washington, and Nazarbayev knows it.
</P>
<P>
   This is not only wrong, but also shortsighted. The absence of
accountability in Kazakhstan has allowed corruption to thrive. It
is beginning to interfere with foreign investment, as officials
have arbitrarily revoked or renegotiated contracts. Corruption is
also helping to wreck the economy. Powerful businessmen have
blocked needed economic reforms, such as bankruptcy laws.
Kazakhstan cannot pay wages or pensions on time.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects Central Asia to become a haven of democracy
overnight, but the region has built virtually no democratic
political institutions under its current leaders. Nazarbayev's
speeches promise fair elections and a free press. The West should
hold him to this, starting with the restoration of Kazhegeldin's
right to challenge him.

</P>
<P>
   To hear the politicians' postmortems, you might conclude it was
Social Security, not impeachment, the economy or anything else, on
which the midterm elections were fought. In fact, exit polls showed
that Social Security was on the minds of many voters, and that the
issue worked better for the Democrats. But there was little in the
way of informed debate on the issue from either side.
</P>
<P>
   Why? First, the potential for demagogy is high, with both
parties quite happy to accuse opponents of endangering benefits.
Second, any serious discussion might have made clear that the
government's current budget surplus is a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's budget surplus _ about which both the president and
the Republicans crowed incessantly _ was due to a big surplus in
Social Security. The rest of the budget showed a deficit of almost
$30 billion. Most of the Social Security surplus, which supposedly
goes into the Social Security Trust Fund, was spent on other
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the campaign trail, there has been a flood of
suggestions for ``fixing'' Social Security. In fact, the potential
shortfall after the baby boom retires is not nearly as great as the
one that may confront Medicare, the other entitlement program for
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Modest tax increases, slight increases in retirement age or a
decision to raise benefits by less than the rate of inflation could
go a long way toward solving the Social Security problem.
Nonetheless, there are calls to ``privatize'' the system and put
Social Security money in stocks, which in the past have generally
shown better returns than bonds over long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the arguments ignore the fact that Social Security was
never a real pension plan. It is a system that taxes working
Americans to finance payments to people who are retired or
disabled. Any plan to convert Social Security to a pension plan, in
which a worker's own taxes are put aside to pay for his or her
retirement, must take into account the need to finance payments for
those now retired or nearing retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of stock investing is based largely on the idea that by
assuming relatively high returns one can avoid tough choices. But
remember that there have been prolonged periods when stocks were
poor investments. Those periods often began when _ as is currently
the case _ stocks were trading at extraordinarily high valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Privatization advocates would have individuals own stocks
through accounts like the 401(k) plans offered by many companies.
Such plans are very attractive to Wall Street, but the fees Wall
Street would collect would come out of profits available to pay
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Will the government _ that is, the taxpayers _ be willing to
guarantee that Social Security recipients would not suffer if
stocks fell too far? If so, that would create an incentive for
those managing the funds to use risky strategies. If not, the idea
of a safety net begins to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Some propose that the government itself buy the stocks. That
could cut down on administrative costs, but would make the federal
government a major owner of American industry within only a few
years. How would it decide what companies to buy, and how would
political interference in corporate governance be avoided?
</P>
<P>
   It was good to learn after the votes were counted that both
parties thought Social Security was so important. Now we will see
if they can avoid the temptation of seeking short-term political
gains rather than constructive long-term solutions.

   The newest feature on CBS' SportsLine Fantasy Hockey site is
called the ``Enforce-O-Meter'' (http://ww3.sportsline.com/u/fantasy
/hockey/features/goon.htm). But read between the lines _ or read
that address again, sweetheart: It's a way to measure Tie Domi's
goon value against Bob Probert, Ken Baumgartner and Matt Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In fantasy leagues, as in life, that's important to know.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Enforce-O-Meter'' assigns points for penalties of an
``aggressive nature,'' so not all penalties are recorded in the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's not the quantity of the penalty minutes, it's the
quality.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a match penalty or gross misconduct is worth 25
points. A fighting major is 15. If it trickles down to getting
caught doing something sissy-like (elbowing, kneeing, slashing,
spearing, unsportsmanlike conduct or obstruction cross-checking),
it's 1 measly point.
</P>
<P>
   And you get nothing for butt-ending with the stick. Not only
that, it's just not nice.
</P>
<P>
   Through Friday's games, Toronto's Domi held an edge over
Chicago's Probert (141-134), even though Edmonton's Sean Brown (No.
3 with 121 points) has taken more overall penalties. The Kings'
Johnson and Sean O'Donnell were tied for 21st with 60 points.
</P>
<P>
   For straight-on info on which players lead the league in certain
penalties, there's another area called the ``Penalty Tracker''
(http://ww2.sportsline.com/u/fantasy/hockey/features/stat3.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille, it seems, is one of 11 players called for diving
this season. But there's a big part of the season to go.

EDITORIAL: BACK TO THE CITY'S BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Before the elections interrupted, the mayor and the City Council
were trying to resolve their differences over New York City's $34
billion budget. Despite quiet talks by staff members in the last
few months, many of those differences remain. In particular, about
$150 million, mostly to pay for city services provided by nonprofit
groups, has been on hold as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone dug in for the hissing season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the mayor and the speaker have started to meet again, and
there is hope that they can set aside all those hot words about who
should be governor and which borough should have Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, their energies are best aimed at finding ways to
provide more money for the city's foster care programs, food
deliveries to the elderly, and expanded day-care and child-care
services that have become far more crucial for the city's poor as
welfare rolls are pared back. We would also like to see the two
sides find a way to allow weekly recycling pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that remains unresolved is what to do with a
surplus that the mayor contends is not there and the city
comptroller assesses at about $1 billion. We hope a good dollop
will be used to pay down the underlying debt _ a proposal that so
far has been resisted by the mayor's side of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   This should be a moment for compromise, not for tub thumping or
legal battles. As Vallone rightly noted after his first meeting
with the mayor on Wednesday, ``the politicking is over and the
business of government is at hand.''

WIDOW AND SCHOOL BOARD CLASH OVER HER FARMLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN FEUER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANALAPAN, N.J. _ When Rosalind Selzer walks down the
double-rutted tractor path each morning toward the open fields
behind her tiny farmhouse, she sees a 28-acre plot that has been
profitably planted with soybeans, corn and flowers for nearly 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   But when officials of the local school board wade through the
burrs and crab grass here to reach the fields, they see something
utterly different: the future site of a new elementary school that
is desperately needed to house this township's rapidly growing
student population.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two years, Mrs. Selzer and the school board have been
locked in a nasty squabble over what to do with the farm where she
has lived for half a century. But that squabble took a turn against
Mrs. Selzer late last month, when a Monmouth County judge upheld
the school board's right to seize the farm and build a school on it
under the doctrine of eminent domain.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which is likely headed for appellate court, has pitted
two opposing parties with equally urgent needs. Mrs. Selzer argues
that the school board has no right to remove her from the land,
which has provided her only income since 1949. The school board has
argued that this farming town has turned into a boom town and must
have another elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has heated up just as voters across New Jersey have
approved a statewide plan to set aside $1 billion in property taxes
over the next 10 years to save nearly 1 million acres of open
space. Some of the land the state wants to preserve can be found on
tiny family farms like Mrs. Selzer's.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the dispute's small-town setting, a
misunderstanding between old acquaintances lies at the heart of it,
both Mrs. Selzer and school officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The fight, they explained, began shortly before Christmas in
1996 when Mrs. Selzer bumped into the school board's lawyer, John
Dawes, one morning in the lobby of the American Hotel in nearby
Freehold. With a neighborly nod, both sides say, Mrs. Selzer wished
the lawyer ``Happy holidays'' and asked him how he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mentioned that the school board was looking for land for
their new elementary school,'' Mrs. Selzer said. ``And I told him
I'd rather sell to a school board than a real-estate developer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the two parties agree that the conversation took place,
they differ on the meaning of Mrs. Selzer's words.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Selzer says her remark was merely idle conversation with a
man whom she has known for several years. But Dawes considered it a
good-faith offer and began steps to have the farm appraised.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the spring of 1997, as board officials walked the
land, Dawes urged Mrs. Selzer to retain a lawyer if she was,
indeed, interested in selling, said Joseph Scozzare, the district
superintendent. And as proof of that interest, Scozzare said, Mrs.
Selzer's lawyer sent a letter to the board in October 1997
rejecting the $250,000 offer made by Dawes and asking instead for
$750,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she wasn't interested in selling,'' Scozzare asked, ``why
did she send that letter?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Mrs. Selzer, the letter was sent out of fear that
the farm would be wrested from her despite her wishes, and
furthermore, she considered the price ridiculously low. It was not
a counteroffer, she said, but a desperate measure to fend off
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   But arguing that negotiations in good faith had started but
faltered, Judge Lawrence Lawson of Monmouth County Superior Court
ruled on Oct. 22 this year that a condemnation order issued by the
township in February could stand. New Jersey's eminent-domain law
allows judges to force condemnation proceedings to continue if
good-faith negotiations began but later broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Scozzare said officials resorted to legal action for only one
reason: They needed to act quickly to choose a construction site
before placing a bond-issue for a new school on the ballot for a
special election that was held in March this year. The ballot
question was approved, and now the district has nearly $30 million
for construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of finalizing a property for referendum, there's a
point of no return,'' Scozzare said. ``No one feels good at how
this thing turned out, but you cannot let these things drag on and
on for months.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sight of Mrs. Selzer, an elfin, white-haired widow,
describing how she raised three children alone on the farm after
her husband, David, died in 1968 from a farming accident could melt
the heart of even the most soulless big-city real-estate tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   She has chosen to paint this conflict as a struggle between the
modernizing element in Manalapan, whose members must deal with the
fact that the township has in recent years become largely a bedroom
community of New York City-bound commuters, and the few remaining
farmers who have managed to eke out a living here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not look like much, but I really want to keep my
farm,'' she said in an interview. ``This is still a free country,
and I have a right to live and work where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Selzer, 73, said she supports building new
schools, she questioned why officials decided to seize a farm
rather than an industrial or a commercial site.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Scozzare insisted that the Selzer plot was ideal
because it is easily accessible by a number of local highways and
has nearby sewage, gas and water connections. Furthermore, he said,
the Manalapan-Englishtown Regional School District has surged to
more than 5,200 students today from about 2,600 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lawson's ruling, a panel of three arbiters has been
established and has until Dec. 31 to determine the fair market
value of Mrs. Selzer's farm. In the meantime, Lawson said, the
opposing parties still have the opportunity to settle the matter
out of court.
</P>
<P>
   But a settlement seems increasingly less likely. Last year, the
school won the right to bar Mrs. Selzer from planting crops on her
land, so that daily farming would not interfere with its efforts to
inspect and analyze the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Mrs. Selzer lost the income she would normally
make from the farm for the entire year. While she refused to say
how much that was, she said that the crop ban has put her in a
fighting mood.

SPORTS COLUMN: GIANTS USED UP THEIR MIRACLES IN '97 
</HEADLINE>
  (With FBN-GIANTS-COWBOYS) 
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Tex. _ The Giants can relax now, with their quest for a
second straight dream season all but ended Sunday in a 10-point
loss to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   This was a good enough effort, but still a loss. After the game,
Percy Ellsworth said, ``They won, but they didn't walk over us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season the Giants celebrated winning both games from the
Cowboys by making sweeping motions with imaginary brooms after a
20-7 victory here. Many Giants assumed that Dallas was out for
revenge Sunday. Perhaps that is the point of the Giants' failed
season: They were still thinking of last season. The Cowboys were
in the here and now.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas didn't want to walk over the Giants. They wanted to win,
wanted to give Emmitt Smith the yards he needed to become the
Cowboys' all-time leading rusher. They wanted to take control of
the division and to get through the game with Troy Aikman in one
piece.
</P>
<P>
   There was too much business to take care of to think about
retribution. And retribution against whom? The Giants? A one-season
flash in the pan? A team whose playoff run is looking more and more
an aberration?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' and Giants' seasons illustrate the difference
between a team with a long view and a team with a short view.
</P>
<P>
   There is still the possibility of a Giants miracle. You heard
that word a lot in the Giants locker room after the game. More than
you would like to hear it in a contending locker room. Except that
this is no longer a contending locker room; this is a 3-6 locker
room reduced to hoping for miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still seven games left,'' Danny Kanell said. ``We
might need a miracle,'' said Kanell, who spoke of playing one game
at a time, playing for pride and respect and playing for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   In the Giants' locker room Sunday there was no consensus on
where the team goes from here, what the sixth loss of the season
meant. Are they now merely playing for pride? Playing for jobs? Are
they playing for an outside shot at a miracle?
</P>
<P>
   Chris Calloway spoke of increased scrutiny. ``Everybody's going
to be under a microscope for the last seven games,'' he said. ``Now
it's personal pressure, knowing that everybody's watching you,
seeing how you're going to react; to see if you're going to quit or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell was realistic. ``If we win the rest of our games,'' he
said, ``we still need a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Cross was optimistic. ``If we mess around and beat Green
Bay,'' he said, ``and beat a couple of teams, string together a few
victories in a row. If we win all of them we'll be 10-6 and
everyone will be asking, `How'd they get in the playoffs?'''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, people are asking that now about last year's team.
How did a team that was 10-5-1 last season and came within a point
of advancing to the National Football Conference semifinals fall to
3-6 this season?
</P>
<P>
   You don't get the sense that the Giants have fully grasped why
they are where they are. How did a team with the same players, the
same coach, the same scheme, come to this?
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are the youngest team in the National Football League
and Fassel is a second-year coach. Last year the Giants were eager
students for the new headmaster. They studied quickly. They were
like the kid who hastily sets a up new computer, skips through the
manual just enough to get the system up and running, and tosses the
manual away with a confident ``I've got it.'' But the Giants don't
get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we got caught up in our success last year, thought
things were going to come easy,'' Kanell said. ``They didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Week in, week out, the Giants keep making the sort of careless
mistakes that come from not being familiar with the manual they
tossed away. Not necessarily the penalties, but the mistakes in
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes. That's the word you hear repeatedly this season. Week
after week, the same question: ``What went wrong?'' The same
answer: ``Mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of the Giants Sunday, pointing to a silver lining, said
they had cut down on mistakes. Howard Cross scoffed. ``All you have
to do,'' he said, ``is make one.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter Sunday, the Giants trailed by 6-3, but
they had pushed the Cowboys up and down the field. Now the Giants
faced a second and goal on the Dallas 1-yard line. Instead of a big
play that resulted in a Giants touchdown, Kanell was sacked for a
7-yard loss because someone forgot to pick up a blitzing
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   In the next five weeks the Giants face three of the league's
terror teams: Green Bay, San Francisco and Denver. Talk about
needing a miracle! The Giants play three more games in November,
then four in December with nothing on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a situation where it's pretty much been
over at this point,'' Kanell said late Sunday afternoon. ``I've
always been in contention until the last game of the season. It's
frustrating.'' Returning to the miracle theme, the quarterback
added, ``Everybody's down, everybody's discouraged, but we're going
to try to fight hard and try to make a miracle happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas. The Giants are out of miracles; turns out they used them
all last season.

GOOSSEN STAKES CLAIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When promoter Dan Goossen introduced the attorney of fighter
Miguel Angel Gonzalez at a recent news conference, he described him
as ``an honest lawye . . .'' but stopped himself as the last
syllable fell out of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait, that's like saying an honest boxing promoter. There's no
such thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, !ital!there's one difference between Goossen and other
promoters. Although he was speaking in jest, he knows what he said
is true to a good extent and he's happy to admit it. With Goossen,
anything for a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   And now, there's an even greater difference: Honest, crooked or
somewhere in between, he has the sport's greatest money maker for
the immediate future, pending final signatures: Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's come a long way since the days he and his family ran
Ten Goose Boxing in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen hasn't changed at all over the years. From the start, he
rarely gave a straight answer to any question, more because he's a
born wisecracker than any proclivity to deception.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, though. Goossen, like all successful promoters,
is as shifty and as fast a talker as the most-skilled and ambitious
salesman. He'll say whatever it takes to make the sale.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement that he would be promoting Tyson is a perfect
example. He broke the news at the recent news conference even
though he knew Tyson's handlers had yet to sign off on it,
according to a spokesman for Shelly Finkel, Tyson's advisor.
</P>
<P>
   His reasoning? Perhaps he couldn't contain himself in front of
family and friends in his hometown, or perhaps it was his way of
publicly solidifying his claim on boxing's biggest prize.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he was motivated by the latter, it becomes clear that
Goossen is much more than a comedian: He's shrewd and tenacious,
which has made him a formidable figure in boxing.And his
rough-around-the-edges charm fits perfectly in a
rough-around-the-edges sport.
</P>
<P>
   At least he convinced Tyson's handlers that he's up to to the
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to be part of the best and the biggest and
certainly Tyson is that,'' Goossen said.
</P>
<P>
   All of this would've seemed ludicrous four years ago. When
Goossen closed the doors of Ten Goose in April of 1994, things
looked bleak for the San Fernando Valley's first family of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Without a lucrative television contract and enough capital
behind them, the Goossens simply couldn't compete with the top
promoters in the business. Don King and Bob Arum owned boxing and
they weren't about to sell.
</P>
<P>
   So Goossen made a clever move: He joined those he couldn't beat.
He took a job as one of Arum's top executives and learned from the
best until he was ready to venture back out on his own and the
right opportunity came along.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the right opportunity came along about 2{ years ago. He
hooked up with television executive Matt Tinley, who has a keen
sense of business, and wealthy backer Bill Daniels, Tinley's uncle
and a cable mogul willing to spend his money.
</P>
<P>
   They formed America Presents with the idea they would one day
challenge the top promoters in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cocky? Indeed. Even when referring to the worst of times,
Goossen said, ``I used to always say to my family, `All we need is
money and TV and there'd be no stopping us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there appears to be no stopping Goossen and Tinley.
</P>
<P>
   Their first coup was the signing of Olympic gold medalist David
Reid. Their !ital!biggest was last week's news, that they had
landed the big one, Tyson, reportedly for at least two fights that
promise to be profoundly lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   And this might be only the first step for Goossen and America
Presents.
</P>
<P>
   With Arum and King aging and nearing the end of their colorful
careers, promoters like Goossen are making their bids to run the
sport into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at the top of his game right now,'' said trainer Joe
Goossen, Dan's brother. ``He's in his prime in terms of a
promoter's age, in his 40s. He's paid his dues, he's built himself
from the ground up, he stayed with it, he got knocked down but kept
getting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never, ever quit. It's Danny's time.''
</P>
<P>
   He has the tools. And Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   __ No mincing words: Joe Goossen, who has trained Gabriel and
Rafael Ruelas since they were children, was unequivocal when
speaking about his fighters' futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're officially retired,'' he said. ``. . . There was a lot
of happiness, a lot of love, a lot of hard work, a lot of
accomplishments. No one has anything to hang their heads about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out to accomplish something, to win a world
championship, and we did it even though it seemed out of reach when
they were 11, 12. We got over obstacles, over injuries and realized
our goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very content. It was a hell of a run.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Goossen didn't preclude the possibility one or
both might return some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a burning desire, if something was rekindled, if
an extraordinary feeling overtook one of them and they came to me
and said they wanted to fight again, I would consider it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I anticipating that, though? No.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Keeping up with Jones: WBC light heavyweight champion Roy
Jones Jr. has had his problems against left-handers. Specifically,
Montell Griffin gave him fits before Jones hit the challenger when
he was down and lost his only fight.
</P>
<P>
   However, he destroyed Griffin in the rematch and should do the
same to left-handed Otis Grant when the two meet Saturday night in
Connecticut on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a native of Jamaica, is a good boxer but is not in Jones'
class and has little power.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the card, Shane Mosley defends his IBF lightweight title
against James Leija.
</P>
<P>
   That fight is a mismatch. It'll be Oscar De La Hoya all over
again for Leija, who is not as quick, skilled or strong as the
champion. His only advantage will be experience, but it won't
compensate for other deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: In a great matchup that has fans foaming at
the mouth, strawweight titleholders Ricardo Lopez and Rosendo
Alvarez will fight again on Friday in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   In their first bout, the little guys fought to a technical draw
after the bout was stopped because of an accidental head butt in
the seventh round. Before that it was a war, in which Lopez was
knocked down. . . .
</P>
<P>
   There is talk Lance Whitaker of Granada Hills might face
contender Michael Grant on the undercard of Mike Tyson's
anticipated comeback on Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Although heavyweight Whitaker is a fine prospect and physically
the two giants match up well, Grant is too much too soon. He's a
solid step ahead in his development. Whitaker should fight a
marginal contender first.

 &HT;    German, Portilla injuries may be serious
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Injury update
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons suffered two injuries to key players that could be
serious. WR Jammi German sprained a knee in punt coverage and will
have an MRI today to determine the severity. It looks like there is
damage to the medial collateral ligament, an injury similar to the
one sidelining wide receiver Tim Dwight and cornerback Ronnie
Bradford. That could leave the team with just three healthy
receivers, so a roster move is likely unless German or Dwight can
play. Rookie Jose Portilla also sprained a knee in the second
quarter, leaving the Falcons with no backup offensive tackle. The
severity of his injury will be known today. The rest of the injury
report: CB Elijah Williams (knee), S Chris Bayne (hamstring), FB
Bob Christian (shoulder), WR Todd Kinchen (ankle), T Bob Whitfield
(elbow), LB Keith Brooking (thigh muscle), RB Gary Downs (shoulder
burner).
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead
</P>
<P>
   First place in the NFC West will be at stake next Sunday when
the San Francisco (X-X) comes to Atlanta to play the Falcons in the
Georgia Dome. The 49ers lead the all-time series 40-22-1. The
Falcons last beat San Francisco on Dec. 24, 1995, when a 28-27
victory in Atlanta secured a wildcard spot. Last year in the Dome,
the Falcons lost 35-27. The key play was an 82-yard screen pass
from San Francisco QB Steve Young to RB Terry Kirby. That took the
ball to the Atlanta 1 early in the fourth quarter, and former 49ers
FB William Floyd scored on the next play for a 35-21 victory.
Earlier this season, the 49ers took a 31-7 halftime lead, and
defeated Atlanta 31-20 in San Francisco.

 &HT;    It's fun again for Mathis
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Terance Mathis has witnessed games like
Sunday's many times in his five years with the Falcons. From the
other side. So excuse him if he's just a bit giddy about the
ascension of the team that has grown with him. Or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis uttered the word ``fun'' often following the Falcons'
41-10 shellacking of the New England Patriots, something that had
another translation previously. As in: ``That was no fun out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``fun'' is the definitive term for what has taken place in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot with this team,'' he said after
catching eight passes for 117 yards. ``And this, right now, feels
good. We're having fun. I have fun every time I step onto the
field. But I haven't been able to say that often about 53 guys
collectively enjoying the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That Mathis is enjoying things is a source of pride to coach Dan
Reeves. Mathis' leadership has been valuable to the team's rise,
and it is not lost on Reeves, who was quick to praise Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about Terance Mathis,'' Reeves said. ``He's
one guy who never complains, never says a word and never gets any
credit. ... He typifies what this team is about. He doesn't want
any credit. He just wants to be a part of a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   And, lo and behold, the 7-2 Falcons are just that with San
Francisco coming to the Georgia Dome on Sunday. It is a big-time
game in Atlanta, something Mathis covets.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what's best about this (win over the Patriots)?''
he asked. ``We've got the 49ers coming in next week and we didn't
overlook this game. The key is to take it one journey at a time,
one day at a time, one game at a time. It's just been so satisfying
to watch how hard the guys work and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis did more than catch the ball. That would have been enough
of a contribution, considering that three of his catches produced
first downs for the Falcons. But the 5-foot-10, 185-pound veteran
also was called on to be a downfield blocker in the running game
against safety Lawyer Milloy, among others. Mathis said he goes
into games with blocking as his first priority, not receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blocking is my job,'' he said. ``With my size, people don't
expect me to block linebackers or safeties. But that's my role. I'm
happy when I get an opportunity to catch the ball. I'd like to
catch it all the time. But we're winning and I know my role. And
when you win, it's fun.

 &HT;    Defensive plan works to perfection
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Much of the Patriots' offense rides on the arm
of quarterback Drew Bledsoe, so it's interesting that the Falcons'
defensive goal Sunday was to minimize the New England running game.
The thinking: If the Pats couldn't run the ball, they'd rely too
heavily on Bledsoe, who has shown a propensity for shakiness in the
face of a persistent rush.
</P>
<P>
   If there wasn't a blueprint on how to defend New England, the
Falcons certainly authored one in shutting down the eighth-rated
offense in the NFL. It was a display that was almost too good to
believe, even though the Patriots did not have standout receiver
Terry Glenn and fullback Tony Carter, among others, who are
injured.
</P>
<P>
   How good was the Falcons' defense? Let us count the ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ It allowed just 18 yards rushing on 14 carries, the lowest
output allowed in the franchise's history.
</P>
<P>
   _ It sacked Bledsoe six times, mostly with a fierce pass rush
from the linemen. Chuck Smith had 2 1/2 sacks, Lester Archambeau 2
and Travis Hall, playing just a few series after missing two games
with an injured knee, added another. Shane Dronett was credited
with half a sack.
</P>
<P>
   _ It created three turnovers, two on sacks of Bledsoe and a
Eugene Robinson game-ending interception.
</P>
<P>
   _ It had perhaps the game's biggest play, when Archambeau forced
a Bledsoe fumble and Smith recovered and ran 71 yards for a
touchdown. It was fourth-and-2 from the Falcons' 13, and instead of
the Patriots scoring to cut into a 21-3 margin, it was suddenly
28-3. That's when many of the Patriots' fans headed home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team was crippled with their best receiver (Glenn) out,''
Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said. ``With him in
there, it's a different deal. But our guys executed great. It was
our best defensive performance of the year. I don't recall any
lapses. We've given up too many big plays in the past. But this
time we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And it all started with stopping the run. The Pats' longest run
from scrimmage, by former Georgia player Robert Edwards, was for 8
yards. After the Falcons established that they would not give up
rushing yardage and the offense produced a 14-0 lead, the pressure
fell to Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   It was just what the Falcons wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a true pocket quarterback, and if you give him time,
he'll pick you apart,'' safety Eugene Robinson said. ``But our
defensive line put pressure on him, and then they have to keep in
(tight end) Ben Coates to block, which takes away a big weapon for
them. So we played everything to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta took advantage of the limited presence of Hall, whose
return solidified the middle of the defensive front. Rookie
linebacker Keith Brooking had his first career interception. The
linebackers and secondary were effective in coverage and in
delivery bone-jarring hits, including Cornelius Bennett's
plastering of unsuspecting Sedrick Shaw on a pass play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just some great individual efforts on defense,'' Archambeau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Robinson: ``We got some guys who can play. We've got some
of the best-kept secrets in the NFL.

 &HT;    Wake-up calls await dreamers
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The anticipation began just after Ohio State's
stunning 28-24 loss to Michigan State on Saturday. Early Sunday,
Tennessee and its fans got their wish as the Volunteers were chosen
No. 1 in the polls for the first time since November 1956, when a
guy named Johnny Majors was the tailback.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers (8-0) share No. 1 with Kansas State in the USA
Today/ESPN coaches poll and are alone on top in The Associated
Press poll. If Tennessee can win out, beginning with No. 10
Arkansas (8-0) on Saturday, the Vols should get a chance to play
for their first national title since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer sounded a cautionary
note.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's special to be considered in that mix, but there is so
much football left to be played,'' Fulmer said. . ``There is still
a lot of football to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, that is just a coaching cliche. In this case, Fulmer
is absolutely right. Here a quick look at the teams still in the
hunt for the national championship and the work they have left:
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE (8-0): After the Arkansas game, which will be
televised on CBS, it's Kentucky at home on Nov. 21 and the season
finale at Vanderbilt. Remember that the Vols must still win two of
the three to take the SEC East. Chances are they will have to play
Arkansas again in the SEC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS STATE (9-0): The Wildcats want respect. Saturday, they'll
get that chance as No. 11 Nebraska (8-2) comes calling for the
biggest game ever played in Manhattan, Kan. Nebraska has won 29
consecutive games in the series. Even if Kansas State wins this
one, it still has to play at Missouri on Nov. 21 and in the Big 12
championship game, probably against No. 6 Texas A&AMP;M (9-1).
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (8-0): The Bruins dodged a bullet for the second
consecutive week as a blown coverage by Oregon State allowed UCLA
to win 41-34. They go to Washington this week, host Southern
California on Nov. 21, and then travel to Miami on Dec. 5. With
their defense (or lack of it), I don't see how the Bruins can stay
unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA (8-1)/FLORIDA STATE (9-1): These teams are bracketed
together for a reason. Both have easy games this week (South
Carolina and Wake Forest, respectively) and will then meet in
Tallahassee on Nov. 21. The winner could jump into the national
championship picture if two of the three unbeatens stumble.
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN (9-0): The Badgers have rolled against an easy
schedule. Now we'll find out if they are the real deal as they
finish at Michigan this week and at home against Penn State.
Michigan may feel some effects of its big win over Penn State. But
the Wolverines can still go to the Rose Bowl if they win out.
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS (8-0): After Saturday's 34-0 win over Mississippi, it's
time folks started taking the Razorbacks seriously. Beat Tennessee,
and Arkansas has a chance to jump into the national championship
picture as it will be favored in its last two games with
Mississippi State and LSU.
</P>
<P>
   Just thinking
</P>
<P>
   Bad news for Florida fans: Running back Terry Jackson is not
expected back for the Florida State game because of his severe
ankle sprain. That won't make the trip to Tallahassee any easier.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Michigan pounded Penn State 27-0 earlier in the day, we
knew John Cooper and Ohio State would start getting tight about
their game with the Wolverines on Nov. 21. I didn't know the
Buckeyes would get so tight they would lose to Michigan State.
Don't be surprised if Cooper hangs it up after this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1987, Bill Curry was getting ready to take his first
Alabama team to LSU. He stood up before the team and began to talk
about how important the game was and what they would need to do to
win. A lineman in the back of the room raised his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry coach,'' he said. ``Tide don't lose in Baton
Rouge.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the heroics of quarterback Andrew Zow, who threw two
touchdown passes in the last 2:24, Alabama still hasn't lost at LSU
since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville at TD club
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss coach Tommy Tuberville will be the featured speaker at
today's meeting of the Atlanta Touchdown Club, set for the Cobb
Galleria Centre. Lunch begins at noon followed by remarks from
Tuberville. For information call 770-953-3200.

 &HT;    Taking control, scoring early were key to Falcons' win
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WHAT WENT RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons took control of both lines of scrimmage early and
never let go, scoring touchdowns on three of their first four
possessions to lead 21-3 early in the second quarter. The Patriots
couldn't run (18 rushing yards), and the Falcons could, with Jamal
Anderson gaining 104 yards. Chris Chandler was effective passing,
completing 15 of 22 for 240 yards. And the defense scored for the
fourth time this season, when end Chuck Smith returned a fumble by
Pats quarterback Drew Bledsoe 71 yards for a touchdown and a 28-3
lead in the second quarter. The Falcons dominated the clock for the
seventh time this season, holding the ball for 34:30 to the Pats'
25:30. And the Falcons won the turnover battle, 5-2. Three of the
New England turnovers set up 17 of Falcons points.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WENT WRONG
</P>
<P>
   Knee injuries to backup wide receiver Jammi German, who had two
tackles on punt returns, and backup tackle Jose Portilla could be
serious enough that neither might be available next week against
the 49ers. Portilla is the only reserve tackle, and the absence of
German and Tim Dwight, already out with a knee injury, could leave
just three receivers. ... A field-goal attempt by Morten Andersen
was blocked at the end of the first half when the ball was kicked
low.
</P>
<P>
   FLYING HIGH
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Chuck Smith had 2.5 sacks, forced a fumble,
returned a fumble 71 yards for a touchdown and was in on five
tackles. ... Wide receiver Terance Mathis caught eight passes for
117 yards. ... For the second game in a row, the offensive line
allowed just one sack, and that came when Chandler scrambled out of
bounds instead of throwing the ball away. ... Defensive lineman
Lester Archambeau had four tackles, two sacks, and forced the
fumble that Smith returned for a score. ... Linebacker Cornelius
Bennett continued to play at a Pro Bowl level. He led the team with
nine tackles. ... Linebacker Jessie Tuggle had seven tackles. ...
Free safetyEugene Robinson, who has played much better the past
four games than in the first five, had seven tackles, two passes
defensed, an interception on the final play of the game and
consecutive big hits in the third quarter. ... Punter Dan
Stryzinkski, who struggled with a 37-yard average during the first
five games, averaged better than 40 yards for the fourth straight
game, kicking three times for a 44.3-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   FLYING LOW
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, four para-gliders swooped into the stadium. It
was not a good idea. The first three landed near midfield. The
fourth one, however, fell short; a female parachutist with a huge
American flag barely cleared the stands and the fans. Meanwhile,
the weights beneath the flag clubbed spectators before she landed
face down just outside the end zone. For Patriots fans, a sign of
things to come.
</P>
<P>
   BEST HIT(S)
</P>
<P>
   Safety Eugene Robinson had huge hits on consecutive
third-quarter plays, but both receivers held on to the passes. The
grand prize goes to Bennett, who blasted Pats running back Sedrick
Shaw in the fourth quarter on a short pass over the middle. The
ball arrived a split second before Bennett, but he separated Shaw
from the ball in violent fashion.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PLAY
</P>
<P>
   Gotta be Smith's fumble return. Archambeau hit Bledsoe from
behind and got a piece of the ball in the process. New England
receiver Shawn Jefferson was gaining fast, but Travis Hall, in his
first game in three weeks, threw the key block. Hall, by the way,
was in for about 12-15 plays and had a sack.
</P>
<P>
   WORST PLAY
</P>
<P>
   Take your pick from either one of Anderson's attempted passes.
In the first quarter, he took a toss sweep left, and under serious
pressure ended up wobbling the ball away out of bounds. In the
fourth quarter, he took a backward pass from Chandler, and again
under pressure, stopped and threw deep in the general direction of
Mathis. Good thing New England's Law didn't intercept.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD CALL
</P>
<P>
   It sounds simple, but the 4-yard off-tackle run by Anderson in
the middle of the third quarter was a thing of beauty. That's
because in today's NFL, almost everybody throws on third-and-3.
When you have a 5-foot-11, 237-pound back running like Anderson,
though, you've got options.
</P>
<P>
   BAD CALL
</P>
<P>
   On the play after the Falcons confused Bledsoe with a zone blitz
and rookie Brooking intercepted the pass in the third quarter,
Chandler tried to throw a 12-yard out to Tony Martin. But Law, who
is playing as well as any cornerback in the league, jumped the
route easily, getting his second interception of the game and
NFL-leading seventh of the season. Given that the Falcons led 31-3
at the time, the play was made worse by the decision to throw it.
``That was the worst thing I did all day,'' coach Dan Reeves said.

 &HT;    Falcons take Patriots' breath away
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In years past, the sight of Chuck Smith
sucking oxygen on the sidelines would have been a bad sign for the
Atlanta Falcons. But this year is nothing like years past.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sunday's vision of Smith with the little green mask on
his face in the second quarter at Foxboro Stadium was symbolic of
very good times. He needed air because he'd just returned a fumble
recovery 71 yards for a touchdown to give the Falcons a 28-3 lead
that, in truth, sucked the life out of the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's play was the ultimate highlight in an afternoon full of
highlights for the Falcons, who defeated the Patriots 41-10 to win
for the 13th time in 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave Atlanta a 7-2 record for the first time ever.
The Falcons have scored more than 30 points in five of the last six
games and allowed only one sack in each of the past two games.
Jamal Anderson has rushed for more than 100 yards in six of the
past seven games. The defense allowed a franchise-low 18 rushing
yards Sunday and tied a season high with six sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Next Sunday, the Georgia Dome should be sold out, when the
Falcons play the San Francisco 49ers (7-2) for sole possession of
first place in the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   None of these facts are misprints.
</P>
<P>
   All of it is amazing.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough, in fact, to have Smith gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired, man,'' said Smith, who picked up a Drew Bledsoe
fumble that was caused by tackle Lester Archambeau and followed
through with the fourth-longest fumble return in Falcons history.
``I'm built for 5- to 10-yard bursts. The worst thing about it was
I had a dance ready, but I was too tired to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight week, the Falcons dominated early,
scoring on its first two possessions to go ahead 14-0, and on three
of its first four to lead 21-3.
</P>
<P>
   On Atlanta's second offensive play, quarterback Chris Chandler
(15-of-22, 240 yards, two touchdowns, two interceptions) threw a
screen pass to fullback Bob Christian, who took advantage of a
block by pulling left guard Calvin Collins and went 39 yards down
the sideline to the New England 1.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, Anderson (32 carries, 104 yards, two
touchdowns) went up the middle, and Atlanta led 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   One play later, Smith and defensive tackle Shane Dronett sacked
Bledsoe, forcing him to fumble, and defensive end John Burrough
recovered at the Pats' 16. Four plays later, after a critical
8-yard slant pass to Terance Mathis (eight catches, 117 yards) that
converted a third-and-8 into a first down, tight end O.J. Santiago
beat New England strong safety Lawyer Milloy for a 7-yard
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago, who had another 22-yard touchdown reception in the
fourth quarter, did the dance for 59,790 fans that Smith could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 'The dirty bird,' `` he explained. ``I got to give credit
to Jamal for creating the dance, but I came up with the name.
</P>
<P>
   ``You raise the roof first (with palms facing the sky), cock
your wings (with thumbs in armpits), and then start flapping 'em.
We're the dirty birds, man. We're trying to get something going in
Atlanta, get some excitement going.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty more.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler had a pass tipped and intercepted a short while later,
but the Patriots (5-4), who averaged 1.3 yards per rush and had
just 223 yards of total offense despite bringing the NFL's No. 8
offense into the game, did little with it. They managed 4 yards,
and settled for a 40-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta countered with a seven-play, 74-yard drive, capped off
by Anderson's run around left end, when he stiff-armed Pats middle
linebacker Ted Johnson to the ground. Anderson held the ball aloft
the last few yards, and Atlanta led 21-3 lead with 13:05 left in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a butt-whipping,'' said Patriots coach Pete
Carroll, who watched as three of his team's five turnovers resulted
in 17 Atlanta points. ``(The Falcons) played a great football game
. . . did everything they came to do, and we couldn't do anything
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' last chance came in the middle of the second
quarter, when they drove 56 yards to the Atlanta 13. The key play
was a 43-yard completion to Tony Simmons, who beat Falcons
cornerback Michael Booker.
</P>
<P>
   But Archambeau ended those hopes, crushing Bledsoe on
fourth-and-two from the Atlanta 13, and sending Smith to the races.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great win for us, on the road, with everybody
questioning whether we had played anybody,'' said Atlanta coach Dan
Reeves. ``That's what makes it fun, makes this game so special when
you get around a group of young men like this bunch that works so
hard and you see them reap some of the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if we won this game, regardless of what the 49ers did,
we could go into next week playing for first place. That's the kind
of games you want to be in a position to play.''

 &HT;    Doubts are fading to gray
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Doubt if you will. Doubt if you must. Doubt
while you still can.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, the Atlanta Falcons would fret over being denied what
they considered their just due. (That time was ...oh, a couple of
weeks ago.) Today more pressing issues are at hand. Like a division
title. Like the playoffs. Like how it is to ride a wave
unprecedented in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 30 years we haven't had much success,'' Chuck Smith said.
``Let 'Frisco and Green Bay worry about what kind of teams they're
beating. We don't care. We'll play a college team. We just need to
win..''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much the kind of team the Falcons beat Sunday _ New
England was a Super Bowl participant two seasons ago, a playoff
qualifier three of the past four seasons _ that was startling. What
amazed was how un-amazing it all seemed. The Falcons led by 14 not
six minutes in, by 25 in the second quarter, by 31 at the end.
There was nothing fluky about it. They were that much better.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jessie Tuggle, who doesn't traffic in empty words: ``We had
it under control from the first snap.''
</P>
<P>
   The flinty Bill Parcells, under whom these Patriots rose to
prominence, holds that teams prove themselves on the road. The
Falcons proved Sunday that they could come north and send a slew of
hardy New Englanders home early. By the time the third quarter
ended, exiting traffic was bumper-to-bumper on Highway 1. For
Patriots backers, there was nothing left to see. The Falcons were
as convincing as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people were saying we hadn't arrived,'' Cornelius
Bennett said. ``If today isn't a sign of arrival, I don't know what
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Four times an AFC champion, Bennett has been part of such
rousing road victories. On this day he welcomed 40-some new members
to the club. ``Guys were saying to me, `Biscuit, we know you've
been through this. So this is how it feels.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is how it feels: To have sacked the heralded Drew Bledsoe
five times and induced him to fumble twice; to have held the rookie
Robert Edwards to 1.1yard per carry; to have outflanked and
outslugged the Patriots defense; to have won 41-10 on a day when
Vegas figured you'd lose. This is how it feels, Bennett said: ``The
nicks and bumps don't hurt as much; your wife treats you nicer; you
go into restaurants and get a better seat. It's good for the
psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   It is because Bennett has won such games that his value
transcends tackles and assists. ``You don't know how your team is
going to mesh,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``But you like to have guys
like Eugene (Robinson) and Cornelius, who've been there before. The
guys who are playing with them can see they're not in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing awesome in Foxboro Stadium this day was the
visiting team. The Falcons believed they could win and won going
away. Doubt if you will. Doubt if you must. But time for doubting
is fast disappearing. How many ways are there to misconstrue 7-2?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've earned the right to be where we are,'' Reeves said.
``People keep talking about the number of games our opponents have
won, but they'd have won seven more if we hadn't beaten them.

LIVINGSTON GAINS STRENGTH IN EFFORT TO SUCCEED GINGRICH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Representative Bob Livingston widened his lead
Sunday in the race to succeed House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the
Louisiana conservative broke from Gingrich's hard-line stance on
President Clinton's sex scandal, opening the door to resolving the
crisis short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, in his first public comments on Clinton's woes since
Gingrich fell from power last week, said lawmakers need to weigh
the public's apparent opposition to impeachment in deciding how to
conclude the inquiry into the president's alleged coverup of his
sexual affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who insisted Congress should not be swayed by public
opinion in the impeachment case, lost his job in part because of
anger among many House Republicans who said his fervor to promote
the presidential scandal backfired in last week's midterm
elections. House Republicans unexpectedly lost five seats, trimming
their majority to six seats.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who secured another key endorsement Sunday and
asserted he will have amassed enough votes by tomorrow to win the
speaker's race, said he will vote for impeachment ``if the evidence
is there.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of the House Judiciary Committee's first
impeachment hearing Monday, Livingston said in a network television
interview: ``I think the American people have certainly indicated
in the polls that they don't see it as an impeachable or
dismissible offense, and that would have to be considered in the
political arena.''
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable twist of circumstances, the hearing Monday, into
what the standard should be for removing Clinton from office, will
unfold amid a frenzied scramble for Gingrich's job and the posts
held by nearly all his top lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich had hoped the fallout from Clinton's scandal would
boost the GOP's majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee,
was seen Sunday as repudiating Gingrich's strategy. Asked on ABC's
``This Week With Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts'' about the
public's apparent disgust with the impeachment process, he said,
``Obviously they have decided that we didn't do a good enough
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat who serves on
the Judiciary Committee, said Livingston's comments ``really come
as no surprise following the Republicans' Election Day debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership tried to sway public opinion against
the president, and the public isn't biting,'' Meehan said. ``It's
now clear that the process is going to grind to a halt if going
forward means the Republicans are going to get hurt politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's lone challenger for the speaker's job,
Representative Christopher Cox of California, did not address how
to resolve the sensitive impeachment question, saying he awaits a
recommendation from the Judiciary Committee. ``There's no
alternative to the present inquiry,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   The race for speaker and the other GOP posts will be decided
Nov. 18 in a meeting of the 223 Republicans who will be sworn in as
members of the 106th Congress in January.
</P>
<P>
   With the winner needing 112 votes, Livingston said he has
secured commitments from more than 100 members and expects to top
112 by tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who is chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee,
said he is backed by at least 90 members and is continuing to gain
momentum. But by later in the day Sunday, Cox was rethinking his
candidacy, the Washington Post quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who won a key endorsement Saturday from Majority
Whip Tom DeLay, received another boost Sunday when Representative
Jim Talent of Missouri joined the Livingston team.
</P>
<P>
   Talent, who is chairman of the Small Business Committee and a
popular member of the freshman class of 1994 that gave Republicans
a majority in the House, is the only lawmaker other than Livingston
and Cox who had expressed serious interest in running for
Gingrich's job.
</P>
<P>
   In declining to challenge Livingston, Talent said, ``I am
looking forward to working under his leadership and am grateful to
all those who encouraged me and offered me support.''
</P>
<P>
   An emboldened Livingston said, ``I will be the next speaker, I
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who visited his ailing mother on her birthday Sunday
in Mechanicsburg, Pa., has played no role in the race to succeed
him. ``The next Congress is the next Congress,'' he told repoters.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he will discuss his plans tonight in Washington in
a speech to GOPAC, the Republican fund-raising group he once
headed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House Republicans across the country were fielding
calls from Gingrich's beleaguered leadership team and the
candidates to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   With DeLay the only House GOP leader to elude a challenge,
Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas campaigned feverishly against
Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma, a member of the National
Football League Hall of Fame who accused Armey of contributing to
``a leadership failure'' that produced legislative ``train wrecks''
in the last two congressional sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Monday A remaining mystery in the leadership contests is whether
supporters of Judiciary Chairman Henry J. Hyde of Illinois will
draft him for the speaker's race, as some have said they would.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hyde has said he would accept a draft, he was busy
Sunday preparing for Monday's hearing, at which 18 constitutional
scholars will testify on the standards for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The list of scholars includes Griffin Bell, who was attorney
general under President Jimmy Carter; the Rev. Robert Drinan, a
Georgetown University law professor and former congressman from
Massachusetts; Arthur M. Schlesinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
historian; and Laurence Tribe, a constitutional scholar and Harvard
University law professor.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe said Sunday he will testify that Clinton's misdeeds do not
meet the traditional standards for impeachment, which include
abusing presidential powers, attempting to subvert the government,
and failing to carry out the functions of his office.

 &HT;    Hart must go overseas to defend his title in '99
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASELTON, Ga. _ Dudley Hart would love nothing more in 1999
than to defend the Subaru Sarazen World Open championship he
captured Sunday at Chateau Elan. Trouble is, he doesn't know when
or where the tournament will be held. He isn't even sure of which
continent.
</P>
<P>
   The Sarazen is moving overseas as a European Tour event next
year, with Barcelona, Spain, the most likely site, possibly in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a shame that it's leaving here,'' Hart said. ``I'd
love to defend, but I don't know where's it's going to be on the
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Elan owner Don Panoz expects details of the new Sarazen
event to be finalized by early December.
</P>
<P>
   Nobilo: First to worst
</P>
<P>
   Two-time Sarazen champion Frank Nobilo of New Zealand had a
mixed week. On Tuesday he was chosen to the International team for
the President's Cup in Australia next month. On Sunday he shot a
closing 81 at the Legends Course, finishing last among the 56
players who made the cut, at 19-over 306. It was Nobilo's only
score in the 80s in 25 U.S. events this year. ``Sometimes you need
a blowout to get back on the road again,'' Nobilo said. ``It's
probably as bad as I've been for a while, but you can't run from
the fire.'' ...Hart won an American Junior Golf Association event
at Horseshoe Bend in Roswell as a 17-year-old in 1986. He joined
Mark Calcavecchia as ex-Florida Gators to have won the Sarazen....
Scotland's Andrew Coltart shot a 31 on the back nine and tied for
fifthMiguel Angel Jimenez.... Argentina's Ricardo Gonzalez tied for
seventh at 280 after a Sunday 73 and earned the biggest check of
his career ($60,000). ...Defending champion Mark Calcavecchia (76)
tied for 26th.
</P>
<P>
   Envious Andrade
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Billy Andrade, who shot a 75 to tie for 45th, made
just five birdies in four days and shot 9-over 297. He was
surprised by others' low scores. ``I don't think this is that easy
of a golf course,'' Andrade said.... Stewart Cink, of Smyrna, tied
for 20th with a final-round 74, earning $20,000.... American John
Huston, a captain's pick to the U.S. President's Cup team, finally
started to feel comfortable with Legends Course and showed it with
a 7-under 65 for fourth place. ``This course is a little difficult
to get the feel of the shots because you always seem to have those
uphill lies,'' Huston said. ...Germany's Bernhard Langer, who
closed with 68 for third, birdied two of his first three holes, but
at seven back for 54 holes never got excited about overtaking Hart
or runner-up Bob Tway. ``I needed something like a course record to
have any hope,'' Langer said.... Tournament honoree Gene Sarazen,
96, was presented a commemorative plaque, commissioned by Subaru,
after Hart's victory. It cited Sarazen's ``many contributions to
this great game, not only as a player, but as the world's
ambassador of golf.

 &HT;    Hart finishes Sarazen task
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASELTON, Ga. _ Considering Dudley Hart's weekend experience
that just concluded at charming Chateau Elan, his chances for a
pleasant honeymoon appear to be more than promising.
</P>
<P>
   Added to his resume Sunday was a four-shot victory in the Subaru
Sarazen World Open over Bob Tway. Added to his bank account was a
$360,000 check that will serve as decent spending money in pricey,
picturesque Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, beginning today.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Suzanne Hart, Dudley's wife of three months, is the real
winner. ``I think she's at the mall right now,'' he said. ``I think
that money is already spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Outdueling Tway in the the final installment of the Sarazen at
the Legends Course, Hart managed the second victory of his pro
career, adding it to his qualification event into the Sarazen, the
1996 Canadian Open title. That it came in the Sarazen, with the
trophy handed to him by the 96-year-old man himself, brought a warm
feeling to an otherwise damp day.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the Sarazen means a great deal,'' said the 30-year-old
Hart, a resident of West Palm Beach, Fla. ``He's one of the
all-time great players, and to win a tournament with his name on
it, is very special. I feel very honored to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Hart not prevailed, he might forever have lamented about
wasting a 10-under-par 62 the day before, tying the course and
tournament record.
</P>
<P>
   For the two weekend days, Hart shot 13-under par. His 3-under 69
Sunday made for a 72-hole total of 16-under 272.
</P>
<P>
   Tway slipped to a 2-over 74 for 12-under 276 and, despite a
$210,000 check for second place, left the property feeling as gray
as the day. Stumbling his worst on the fourth hole with a double
bogey, Tway trailed by four shots with nine to play after a
front-side 38, failing to make a recovery while Hart made most of
the right moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play very well today,'' Tway said. ``The thing that
really disappoints me is that on the front side I three-putted
three times _ once for a double bogey. You can't win a golf
tournament doing stuff like that. ... Dudley played a very nice
round. He did exactly what you need to do on the last day.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hart, it was yet more evidence of a player having risen to a
higher maturity level.
</P>
<P>
   Once tabbed the ``Mini-Volcano'' for his outbursts, Hart was a
study in level-headedness this week. After making a bogey at the
10th hole by trying a risky draw on the downhill par-5, Hart played
1-under for the next eight holes and coasted home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple of lapses, but I feel very good with the way I
handled myself and the way I thought through this round,'' Hart
said. ``I played some smart shots when I needed to and I hit some
good iron shots in there close. I didn't hole as many putts as I
did yesterday, but I don't think I could expect to make as many as
I did yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Bernhard Langer closed with a 68 for third at
11-under, earning $124,000. John Huston shot the day's low round, a
65, and rallied to finish fourth at 10-under, pocketing $80,000.

 &HT;    LJ Racing bid far from finished
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the turning of the leaves, NASCAR's competition
turns to the season of addition and subtraction, when the makeup of
teams and driving jobs are uncertain and the future of sponsorships
has not been decided.
</P>
<P>
   But don't start counting out Little Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Falk, owner of the the un-sponsored No. 91 Little Joe's
Chevrolet Monte Carlo, says he'll be back, in some status, next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody keeps coming up wanting to know if this is the last
race for LJ Racing,'' Falk said before Sunday's NAPA 500 at Atlanta
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely going to be racing next year,'' Falk said.
``Whether we're racing a limited schedule or whatever, we will be
racing and we will be in Daytona read to kick butt. We've got three
real good prospects for a sponsor and they're looking at us this
weekend. I'm sure something's going to work out. Plenty of people
want to drive the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk lost his driver, Kevin Lepage, to the Jack Roush-owned No.
16 Ford in the middle of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bodine qualified the 91 car 20th for Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   Busch ride for Skinner
</P>
<P>
   Mike Skinner, driver of the No. 31 Chevrolet for Richard
Childress, announced Sunday he'll drive a dozen races in the Busch
Grand National series next year in a new car for Emerald
Performance group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did was talk to Richard,'' Skinner said. ``I
said, 'I've got an opportunity to run some Busch races next year.
What do you think?' When I told him who it was and the type of cars
they've had out there, I didn't need to tell him any more. He
already knew these guys had put front-running cars on the race
track before. He said, 'yeah, go for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, the 1997 Winston Cup rookie of the year, has been in
the 31 car for two years and five races in 1996. A year earlier,
was the inaugural Craftsman Truck Series champion.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Moroso dies
</P>
<P>
   Dick Moroso, owner of Moroso Performance Parts, a long-time
supplier to race teams, died Saturday at his Madison, Wisc., home.
He also owned the track track in West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Moroso's son, Robbie, the 1989 NASCAR Busch series champion and
1990 Winston Cup rookie of the year, was killed in September, 1990,
in an auto accident near Mooresville, N.C., following the race that
same day at North Wilkesboro Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The track guest-list
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that was one of the Rolling Stones rolling through the
garage area before Sunday's race. Chuck Leavell, who lives south of
Macon, was the guest of the sponsor of Saturday's Busch race.
Chubby Checker, king of the twist, was at the track earlier in the
week. But Shania Twain was nowhere in sight. Sunday's guest list
also included NFL hall of fame running back Jim Brown, Braves coach
Ned Yost and several Braves players.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham top Person
</P>
<P>
   Ray Evernham, crew chief for Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon's
No. 24 Chevy, has been named Person of the Year by Winston Cup
Illustrated magazine. Gordon and Darrell Waltrip shared the award
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham is credited with putting together the team behind
Gordon's three Winston Cup titles the past four years. He also
helped to raise awareness of bone marrow donations to fight
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Swat teams invade track
</P>
<P>
   How do you entertain 100,000 people waiting for rain to stop
before a stock car race? At Atlanta Motor Speedway, you stage a
mock invasion. The Fort McPherson Military Police Special Reaction
Team landed in a helicopter in the track infield, rifles at the
read. A couple of loud explosions went off. New enlistments and
officers then paraded around the track in hummers. It was all part
of a Veterans Day Salute and ``aren't-you-glad-you-enlisted''
ceremony.

 &HT;    Slow death drives NAPA 500's end
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here at the 24 Hours of Hampton, a mere anticlimax
became a full-blown natural calamity.
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR Winston Cup season did not end with any of the usual
flourishes at the Atlanta Motor Speedway Sunday. This NAPA 500
traditionally is the time when a points champion is paraded around
the property and the race winner gets a head start on his misplaced
enthusiasm for next season. Instead of such a clean finish, we were
treated to a slow death by water torture.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have argued that Winston Cup racing has been a bore in
1998 take note: Not racing is even duller. After the first five or
six hours, watching a track dry begins to lose its allure.
</P>
<P>
   How awful could it have been, you wonder? Wasn't anything more
than a little water on the track, right? Just picture100,000 and
more wet race fans.
</P>
<P>
   The March race here was delayed a day by rain, and now this. An
entire local racing season was dedicated to replenishing the water
table. Whoever had the plastic poncho concession now has several
offshore accounts as well as a chalet in Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the meaning had been leeched from the race when Jeff
Gordon wrapped up his points championship a week earlier. Then, the
weather took care of whatever residual suspense may have survived.
The day became the dramatic equivalent of a nine-hour school play.
</P>
<P>
   By the second rain delay, it was becoming a race against time.
Could they get this race in before Dale Jarrett's gall bladder
exploded?
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who has an appointment with a surgeon this week, was
involved in that gripping race for third place in the points
standings. Having toughed out gallstones, Jarrett really did
deserve show money. When racecars did roam the track during the
afternoon, Jarrett's was running out front.
</P>
<P>
   The most glorious moment of the day was the first two-hour and
38-minute rain delay, when, because of a quirk in pitting strategy,
57-year-old Dave Marcis was in second place. ''Probably the longest
I've ever been in second place,'' the shoestring racer joked from
outside his hauler.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, his last Winston Cup victory came 17 years ago at
Richmond -- that when the race leader spun out on a slick track and
the race was called on account of rain. The weather has been his
only ally out here.
</P>
<P>
   The NAPA 500 was but the 13th race that Marcis qualified for
this year, but he refuses to let go. ''It's either racin', fishin'
or huntin'. I enjoy the sport too much to quit,'' he says. At least
he shone through the gloom for a fleeting moment.
</P>
<P>
   Marcis actually led when the cars returned to the track under a
yellow flag, John Andretti ducking back into the pits in front of
him. Just behind, Brett Bodine chaffed while Marcis enjoyed his
time up front. He wanted the old man out of the way before the rain
started again, so that he might lead a lap and get some bonus
Winston Cup points. Bodine came here 26th in the points standings.
They pay only down to 25th place (a $35,000 bonus).
</P>
<P>
   Marcis eventually did pit and Bodine got his lap on the lead,
but not soon enough to please him. ''(Marcis) is a guy who depends
on a lot of favors to survive. To me, he used up a favor there,''
Bodine grumped.
</P>
<P>
   The petty complaints of a driver who is the Baltimore Ravens of
NASCAR will just have to pass for controversy. Sorry, that's the
best I could do with the materials at hand.

 &HT;    Thrill, drama drive women's interest in racing
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ricky (CQ) Grimwood got up at 4:45 a.m. Sunday to get
to Atlanta Motor Speedway by 6:30 a.m. The gates wouldn't open for
another 90 minutes and the race wasn't scheduled to start for six
hours, but that didn't matter to the 46-year-old florist from
California.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun rose pink through thick clouds, she cruised the big
souvenir trucks parked outside the track. She shopped for T-shirts
from the Cartoon Network, one of the big sponsors, for her two
granddaughters. She searched for some NASCAR shoelaces for herself,
because her feet were about the only body part not covered with
something related to racing. She wore a leather NASCAR jacket with
12 racing pins over her black racing T-shirt, and blue metal
circles with the name of her favorite driver, Rusty Wallace,
dangled from her earlobes.
</P>
<P>
   Grimwood discovered Wallace a decade ago after tuning to racing
when she and her husband got tired of watching football. She picked
Wallace for his looks _ ``He's not hard on the eyes at all,'' she
said with a grin _ and ``down to earth'' personality. She considers
it sheer luck that she moved into a house on Miller Drive,
reflecting the beer company that is Wallace's main sponsor. She
found a black cat with gold eyes, the same colors as Wallace's old
car, and naturally named the pet after him. A full-size cutout of
Wallace is in her bedroom, and for Mother's Day, she got an
aluminum punchout of car number 2 to hang on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they fire those puppies up, and the green flag drops, you
can feel it from your nose to your toes, and it'll make your hair
stand on end,'' Grimwood said, speaking faster as the excitement
rose in her voice. ``It used to be an old boys club, but now it's
not. A lot of women love stock car racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of fans like her, from all over the country, attended
Sunday's NAPA 500. Mothers strolled their baby daughters through
the soggy infield; girlfriends ducked under the bleachers with
their boyfriends; wives shopped for souvenirs with their husbands.
Women account for almost 40 percent of NASCAR fans, which means
that among the estimated 160,000 fans Sunday, about 61,000 were
female. They made up about 2.3 million of the 6.2 million fans who
watched races in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of ice skating, women spectators haven't outnumbered men
in any pro sport. Their interest in NASCAR, however, surprises
anyone who connects cars and racing with grease, noise and pin-up
girls. Today, female fans are drawn to stock cars for the same
thing men are: the thrill and drama of 200 mph speed, the strategy
of racing 500 miles or so and the personalities of the drivers.
Women also are attracted by the family-oriented reputation NASCAR
has built during its 50-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock car racing has grown up now, and that's a good thing,''
said ticket manager Frances Goss, 60, one of the highest-ranking
women at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   She's worked there since 1965, when women weren't allowed in the
pits because they were considered bad luck -- so was eating
peanuts. During the races, the infield was a rowdy place where just
about anything happened in the back of a pickup truck, and when the
race ended, the winner took a lap with a beauty queen. The
racetrack was not a place where many women felt comfortable, even
in the company of a husband or boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   But when the first race was televised in 1979, the sport started
to clean itself up, said Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's director of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   And throughout the sport's history, the drivers were always
friendly, and that drew many women who were more interested in who
was behind the wheel than what was under the hood. Known as
probably the most accessible of pro athletes, drivers have always
talked openly and often about their wives and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's no whining about salaries'' said Grimwood. ``You
won't find a driver on cocaine, beating up his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   During the years, brothers and sons entered the sport, creating
dynasties like the Earnhardts, Pettys, Bodines and Labontes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've passed down family values and given their kids the
right direction, and I like that,'' said Paula Smith-Lane, 45, a
nurse practitioner and mother of five from Pennsylvania who won a
trip to the NAPA 500 through a NASCAR online trivia contest. She
showed off her 1 1/2-inch long nails that she had painted
carefully, half in a checkerboard and half red, with a tiny ``3''
on each to honor of her favorite driver, Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, NASCAR began actively promoting that family
image, and women helped fuel the sport's growth from from regional
entertainment into a national phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never told a driver to take their kid on stage or put
their wife in the car, because the family is already there,''
Triplett added. ``We didn't have to rack our brains to come up with
that. It was right in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The drivers' personalities take more of the stage now than the
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, fans would tell you about the difference between
Fords and Chevrolets,'' Goss said. ``I've not heard that as much as
in the past. I think the entertainment factor has come into racing
more than the competition between vehicles, and that's why the
female aspect has come on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Goins-Byrnes, director of NASCAR programs for the sports
agency IMG, observed the growth of female fans during her 11 years
in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any athlete or industry that wants to build female base should
present that personal side,'' she said. ``Females usually connect
with athletes because of their human interest side, not because of
their statistics and how many races they've won. Our athletes do a
great job of opening their personal lives to fans.''
</P>
<P>
   With more women in the stands, tracks and sponsors started to
take notice. When Atlanta Motorway Speedway underwent a $30 million
renovation last year, twice as many women's restrooms were added
than mens'.
</P>
<P>
   And look no further than the cars themselves to see the female
influence in the sport. Because companies recognize that women
usually control household spending, the ads aren't just motor oil
and spark plugs and chewing tobacco anymore. Johnny Benson's Ford
Taurus features Cheerios on the hood, Gatorade on the side,
PopSecret on the back quarter panel, Gold Medal tucked behind the
rear window and Hamburger Helper near the fender.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not just marketing to dads now, but they're marketing
to moms, too,'' said Sarona Winfrey, public relations manager for
Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Female spectators have helped make stock car fans the most loyal
of any sport. NASCAR research found that 72 percent of fans would
buy a product just because it sponsors a car, and that number is
greater than any other pro sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask females why they use Tide, because of racing
involvement,'' Goss said, referring to Ricky Rudd's neon orange car
with the detergent on the hood. ``They love racing and they support
it to make sure it continues.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR also promotes the races as a weekend destination that
appeals to women with families, Triplett said. Unlike other sports
that are over in a few hours, Winston Cup races start with Friday
qualifying, feature a support race on Saturday and then the main
event Sunday. Many families camp all weekend in the infield and
enjoy the entire lineup. There's even a playground there now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can sit back and take 100 percent credit in
turning this into a family sport,'' Triplett added, ``but we can
take 100 percent of the credit for keeping it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But the machismo hasn't disappeared completely. ``Real Racers
Don't Need Viagra,'' was one of the printable slogans sold on a
series of T-shirts aimed at male fans. These were far outnumbered
by all the memorabilia marketed to women.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items were checkerboard bikinis, NASCAR aerobics
shoes, a leather Jeff Gordon purse and a camouflage-trimmed
nightshirt with Dale Earnhardt's signature across the chest. For
little girls, there was NASCAR Barbie -- ``I Love Buckshot Jones''
-- woven friendship bracelets and a tiny cheerleader outfit with
Rudd's name on the megaphone. For the home, there were windchimes
with tiny race cars, a NASCAR windsock and a string of Mark Martin
Christmas lights made up of 20 glowing red 6's.
</P>
<P>
   Grimwood and her husband planned to spend $2,000 for their week
in Atlanta, just as they had the two years before. Before leaving
Tuesday, she planned to beg local stores and restaurants for their
NASCAR banners. After this season-ending race, they would spend the
winter watching videos of 1998 races ``to get us to Daytona'' in
February, when the 1999 season begins.
</P>
<P>
   For her, the evolution of stock car racing's relationship with
women fans will be complete when the announcer has to revise that
classic start to each event: ``Gentlemen, Start Your Engines.''
There's never been a consistent female driver in Winston Cup races,
the sport's most competitive level.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think it takes muscles, power and testosterone, but
it's just skill, agility and training,'' she said. ``Sex isn't an
issue. Skill is. Skill, and respect for the car.''

SMITH RUNS BEYOND DORSETT  
 `WE STOPPED BELIEVING'  
 AIKMAN PLAYS ON 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Emmitt Smith, the Dallas Cowboys running back, Sunday became the
Cowboys' career-leading rusher, passing Tony Dorsett's total of
12,036 yards. Smith ran for 163 yards on 29 carries against the
Giants, his biggest rushing day in three years. He increased his
career rushing total to 12,105 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is the eighth National Football League player to rush
for more than 12,000 yards, has 53 regular-season games with 100 or
more yards rushing. Seven have been against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also caught his 400th career pass, which put him fourth on
the Cowboys' career list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new offense has helped not only me but lots of players,''
Smith said. ``It was good to have a change so that defenses can't
anticipate what's coming. I wanted to set the record at home, at
Texas Stadium, because this is where the dream started.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `We Stopped Believing'
</P>
<P>
   Giants players and coaches insisted they would continue to be
motivated, even though their hopes of qualifying for the playoffs
are small.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a job that so many people would love to have,''
defensive end Michael Strahan said. ``And that is what excites me _
playing football.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan, who missed all but two plays last week with back
spasms, did not start Sunday's game but played often, especially in
passing situations. Of the Giants' troubles this year, Strahan
said: ``This year's team is no different than last year's team. But
at some point, we stopped believing that and have lost faith in
ourselves. And you've got to have faith because that's what helps
you hang on to some games.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aikman Plays On
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman hit his right hand on a helmet
in the first half and received a nasty gash on his index finger.
Aikman left the game for an X-ray; when no fracture was revealed,
he returned in the second half to complete 11 of 12 passes.
</P>
<P>
   The kick returners, Deion Sanders on punts and Kevin Mathis on
kickoffs, gave the Cowboys good field position throughout the game.
Sanders returned three punts for 56 yards, including one for 31
yards. He also had a 39-yard return negated by a penalty. Mathis
returned three kickoffs for 101 yards, including one for 42 yards.

TESTAVERDE WINS DUEL AS THE JETS BRING FLUTIE TO HIS KNEES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It began with the fanfare of a Sunset
Boulevard East, with two aging stars from another era in their
comeback saga.
</P>
<P>
   By game's end Sunday, with the Meadowlands crowd chanting,
``Vinny! Vinny!'' it was Vinny Testaverde who waved and hugged
teammates, bathed in applause, while Doug Flutie was on his knees,
symbolically closing out a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have gone beyond merely being surprising to being taken
seriously as they captured their fourth straight victory, a
decisive, resourceful 34-12 defeat of the Bills. The victory
positioned the Jets, with a 6-3 record, in a first-place tie with
the Miami Dolphins in the American Conference East. The Bills, who
came in with a five-game winning streak, dropped to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 20 years, the Jets are 4-0 in their
division and have a four-game winning streak for only the second
time since 1986. They had not beaten the perennial powerhouse Bills
this decisively since 1985. The Bills had won six straight and 11
of their last 12 meetings here.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, who will be 35 years old on Friday, remembers being
in first place before, ``once, with Cleveland,'' in his 12-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   This victory needed several gritty stands by the defense during
a first half in which the Jets' offense stumbled, losing the ball
three times. Yet, all that the Bills got out of it was 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   The defense held until the offense cranked up. And when it did,
it was not on the ground. A struggling Curtis Martin was rested for
two series in the second quarter and had a 54-yard day on 21
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde wound up with three touchdown tosses, shrugging off
an interception on the very first play of the game. He is 6-0 as a
Jets starter, and his gaudy figures include 15 touchdowns but only
three interceptions. He was very good Sunday in completing 22 of 31
passes for 258 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Flutie had not known defeat in his second
incarnation in the National Football League, having led Buffalo to
three straight victories as a starter. This was the first time,
though, that the Bills failed to score a touchdown with Flutie
leading them, including parts of two games he came in as a
reliever. Their scoring Sunday was four field goals from Steve
Christie.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were curious about this 5-foot-9-inch phenomenon who
captured the 1984 Heisman Trophy, two years before Testaverde won
his. At a meeting of the Jets' defense on Saturday night, one of
the coaches brought in a box of Flutie Flakes. Perhaps it helped
the defense know just what it was dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good five years since I've had to deal with this
kind of beating,'' said Flutie, who spent the previous eight years
in the Canadian Football League. He was 12 for 30 for 154 yards,
with 2 interceptions, and he was sacked twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team,'' said Coach Bill Parcells, barely allowing a
few grins in the locker room, ``now you're in first place, and
everyone's going to be looking for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde was not even looking for Keyshawn Johnson to get the
Jets on the scoreboard when they were trailing by 3-0 late in the
opening quarter. But it was Johnson he found.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the fifth guy I was going to, actually,'' Testaverde
said. ``Keith Byars was headed out, Fred Baxter up the middle, Kyle
Brady in the flat, and a running back over the middle. I went back
over that process pretty quickly. And I saw Keyshawn waving his
arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde then drilled a 25-yard touchdown pass to Johnson in
what was one of the wide receiver's finest performances. The
numbers _ seven receptions for 95 yards _ were not his best, but
the receptions he produced were worth a highlight film.
</P>
<P>
   The defense kept the Jets in contention during an awkward first
half in which the offense committed three turnovers and the special
teams produced two stumbling plays to set up Buffalo field goals.
Yet, the Jets led by 13-9, thanks largely to big plays by Johnson
and Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde connected with seven receivers in the first two
quarters. But his opening pass, meant for Johnson, was deflected
and intercepted by a diving Sam Cowart at the Jets' 38. The defense
held, negating the error.
</P>
<P>
   The very first punt as a Jet by John Kidd _ picked up last week
to replace the faltering Brian Hansen _ traveled only 34 yards. It
allowed the Bills to launch a drive ending in Christie's 40-yard
field goal for the 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde and Johnson came right back, converting a
third-and-10 and then, from the Bills' 25, collaborating on the
touchdown to put the Jets ahead by 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   The kickoff was returned 29 yards by the Bills' Kevin Williams,
setting up another field-goal by Christie, from 37 yards in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The game could have slipped away from the Jets as Jerald Sowell,
giving a breather to an ineffective Martin (his opening-half
statistics were merely 20 yards on nine carries), fumbled the ball
away twice. His second one was converted to a third Christie field
goal to propel the Bills to a 9-7 edge. Testaverde, though, led a
drive that resulted in a 41-yard field goal by John Hall with 27
seconds remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Not content to run out the clock, the Bills tried to get close
enough for at least a field goal as they started from their 20. But
Flutie's second pass was intercepted by Otis Smith, his first
interception of the year. Testaverde immediately connected with
Dedric Ward on a 25-yard sideline play, setting up a 43-yard field
goal by Hall for the 13-9 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets quickly went to work in the third quarter. Ward,
returning punts because Leon Johnson was sidelined with a knee
injury, produced the season's longest return for the Jets. His
20-yarder gave Testaverde the ball only 38 yards out. Two plays
later, Testaverde and Ward hooked up on a 36-yard scoring play on
which two defenders were fooled and far behind the receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills responded with a drive that yielded Christie's fourth
field goal, a 21-yard boot.
</P>
<P>
   On a fourth-quarter drive, the Jets made a gutsy call on a
fourth-and-6 at the Bills' 35. Testaverde hit Johnson with a 6-yard
pass and eventually produced a 12-yard touchdown pass to Wayne
Chrebet for a 27-12 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then Flutie was picked off by Ray Mickens at midfield, and this
time the Jets insistently used Martin. The Jets even took points
off the scoreboard after a field goal by Hall. The Bills ran into
the kicker, giving the Jets a first down at the 16. Martin
eventually ran in from the 6 to bring the crowd to its feet, but
not to head for the exits.

WENDELL CHINO, 74, PRESIDENT OF NEW MEXICO TRIBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.M.)  (lb) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wendell Chino, the longtime president of the Mescalero Apache
Nation who helped to lift his tribe from tar-paper-shack poverty
with his persuasive style of ``red capitalism,'' died on Wednesday
at the Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center in California. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Chino had suffered from a heart ailment and collapsed while
walking on a treadmill at a health clinic in Santa Monica, said
Catherine Bedell, a spokeswoman for the Mescalero Apache tribe of
New Mexico. Chino was revived but later died of a second heart
attack, she said.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a century of federal policies that ranged from
extermination to assimilation, Indian nations began in the 1960s to
gain a greater degree of self-determination. The movement began in
earnest with men like Chino, the president of his tribe for 34
years, who demanded that the federal government honor the treaties
it made with Indian nations regarding the use of the land and its
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took stances that affected Indians not only on his
reservation, but all over the country,'' said Roy Bernal, chairman
of the All Indian Pueblo Council and a member of the Taos Pueblo
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scheme of the 20th century, it has been said that
Wendell Chino was a Martin Luther King or a Malcolm X of Indian
Country,'' Bernal said. ``He was truly a modern warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-'60s, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs had
significant control over the Mescalero reservation, 200 miles south
of Albuquerque, N.M. The agency oversaw everything from mining to
lumber to grazing contracts on the reservation, which is home to
4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   As those contracts expired, Chino did not renew them, instead
creating lumber and cattle companies controlled by the impoverished
tribe.
</P>
<P>
   With Chino's guidance, the Mescalero Apache Nation built a ski
resort, the Inn of the Mountain Gods, Casino Apache, a timber mill
and a metal fabrication plant, as well as Indian schools, a
hospital and a health center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, during a court battle in which Chino was attempting to
secure sole control of Mescalero Apache natural resources, he
described the problem: ``The white man has raped this land and now
he wastes the 6 million acres of Indian land in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Chino believed Indian people should make decisions about Indian
land, a notion he described as ``red capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Chino's positions could also be unpopular: He split with New
Mexico Indian leaders last year, refusing to honor a
gambling-revenue-sharing agreement with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not recognize the state as a legitimate entity,''
Bernal said. ``He would only deal with the federal government,
nation to nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Chino also created a split within the Mescalero community when
he invited nuclear power companies to bury their radioactive waste
on tribal land in the early 1990s. The tribe rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``His friends were few,'' said James Toulouse, an Albuquerque
lawyer who considers himself part of that small circle. ``But folks
listened to what he had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Even presidents did not escape Chino's wrath. He once lambasted
President Jimmy Carter in 1978 for what Chino called the
president's lack of attention to the economic and political
problems of the American Indian.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jimmy Carter has time enough to worry about human rights in
Latin America and poverty in Africa, he should find some time to
visit American Indians,'' Chino said.
</P>
<P>
   Chino, described at times as a benevolent dictator, held tightly
to the reins of Mescalero affairs while he traveled the world as a
spokesman for Indian issues and served as the president of the
National Congress of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Dec. 25, 1923, on the reservation, Chino was educated in
the Santa Fe Indian School System. He attended Central College in
Pella, Iowa, and the Cook Christian Training School in Phoenix. He
was an ordained minister in the Dutch Reformed Church and a
graduate of Western Theological Seminary in Holland, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Rita, and son, Mark, both of
Mescalero.

DONATO EXPECTS TO FEEL AT HOME WITH ISLANDERS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ While the New York Islanders' acquisition of Ted
Donato from the Boston Bruins on Saturday was not the big one their
fans have eagerly been awaiting, it was a move that could
significantly improve an offense that has struggled at times.
</P>
<P>
   Donato, a three-time 20-goal scorer, joined his new teammates in
Toronto for an afternoon practice Sunday and was expected to play
against the Maple Leafs on Monday night. Mike Milbury, the
Islanders' coach and general manager, said on Saturday that Donato,
a speedy 29-year-old left wing, will flank center Robert Reichel on
the second line. Donato's arrival probably means a reduction in
playing time for wings Mariusz Czerkawski and Jason Dawe, who have
been struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Donato, who will make slightly more than $1 million this season,
knew his days as a Bruin were numbered. Still, he was shocked when,
after the Bruins played on Saturday, he was told he had been dealt
for Ken Belanger, the enforcer. Donato was leaving the town where
he was born and raised, where he refined his skills at Harvard and
spent all of his seven seasons in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a surprise,'' said the 5-foot-10-inch, 183-pound
Donato, who figures to see time on power play and penalty-killing
units. ``But I guess part of me knew it was coming. It was a
strange feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm looking forward to playing for the Islanders. It
will be a good opportunity for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato was off to a fine start last season before being derailed
by a three-game suspension for a slash to the face of Islander
defenseman Rich Pilon. After the suspension, Donato never again
found his groove. His playing time was reduced, and it did not
increase this season. He has been ineffective (1 goal and 3 assists
in 13 games) in limited ice time so far and became expendable when
the Bruins re-signed Anson Carter last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Donato apologized to Pilon by telephone the day after the
incident last season. He said Pilon was more understanding than
expected. The two talked briefly at practice Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Donato's shift to Long Island will be a homecoming for his wife,
Jeannine, who is from West Islip, N.Y. ``If anything could make it
easier, it's because she's from Long Island,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donato also has many friends on Long Island. He has already
played on teams with some of his new teammates: Czerkawski, Bryan
Smolinski and Barry Richter in Boston, Scott Lachance and Joe Sacco
on the U. S. Olympic team, and Bryan Berard on the U. S. world
championship team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence that I can go out and help this team
offensively and defensively,'' Donato said.

METS' GM TAKES LEAVE AFTER ADMITTING AFFAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ Two weeks after the Mike Piazza signing triggered
what they expected to be a productive off season, the New York Mets
announced Sunday that General Manager Steve Phillips was taking a
leave of absence to deal with an allegation of sexual harassment as
well as the repercussions of a series of extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   During Phillips' leave, Frank Cashen, who was the team's general
manager from 1980 through 1991 and a mentor for Phillips, will
serve as the interim general manager. Cashen takes over at a
particularly difficult time of year for someone who has not been
actively involved in baseball operations, when clubs begin to sign
free agents and initiate talks with other teams about possible
trades.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, 35, was not present on the first day of the annual
general managers meetings here. Instead, he issued a statement
regarding a threatened lawsuit against him alleging that he
sexually harassed a woman who formerly worked for the Mets at their
St. Lucie, Fla., complex.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Howard, the Mets' senior vice president for business
affairs, said that the Mets investigated the allegation and found
that there was a consensual sexual relationship between Phillips
and the woman, but no basis for the allegation of sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``After learning of the threatened allegation,'' Phillips, the
father of two young sons, said in the statement, ``I have had
numerous conversations with my wife and the ownership of the Mets
about this and other consensual sexual relationships I have had
during my marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he had begun ``extensive personal counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said the threat of a lawsuit ``brought to light some
personal problems Steve has, and he's addressing them in
counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashen, speaking at a news conference at the Ritz-Carlton hotel,
said: ``I talked to Steve this morning, and he's going to put some
things on paper and I'll talk to him about those. I'm going to try
to expand and extend Steve's work rather than put my imprint on
this club as being a Frank Cashen-type club.''
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the situation was marked by the presence at the
hotel earlier Sunday of the Mets' co-owners, Fred Wilpon and Nelson
Doubleday. They did not attend the news conference. In the past,
the owners have abhorred the kind of behavior Phillips admitted to.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Phillips was not being fired, in light of the owners'
views, Howard said: ``The ownership's position is Steve's behavior,
as he has admitted it, is inappropriate and from their standpoint
is not acceptable. By the same token, Steve has been very
forthcoming in admitting the problem and has immediately sought
personal counseling to address the issue and to focus on preserving
his family situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is this is an unfounded claim. While it does address
personal issues and family issues, it is not disabling because of
Steve's remorse and his immediate action to address the problem and
get himself in position where he can come back as a full,
functioning executive. Our view is Steve, like the rest of us, is
human and makes mistakes. He's recognized that and has taken steps
to address the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegation against Phillips, Howard said, was brought to the
Mets' attention a week and a half ago by the lawyer for the woman,
whom Howard declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've investigated those allegations,'' said Howard, who also
is the club's chief in-house counsel, ``and we are confident there
is no basis to the allegations and there are no facts to support
any claim for sexual harassment. Steve admits to having had a brief
consensual relationship with this woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, Howard added, have a ``very strong policy prohibiting
sexual harassment.'' Although Phillips did not tell the Mets
initially about the matter, the official said, ``Steve was very
forthcoming to explain to us the facts of the relationship.'' At
the same time, Howard said, Phillips informed the club's owners
about the other relationships he had.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Phillips said his conversations with his wife
and the Mets' owners were ``extremely painful,'' adding, ``I
apologized for making some incredibly bad judgments, for the deep
pain I have caused my family and for the embarrassment I have
caused the Mets' organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said the club could not estimate how long Phillips' leave
would last. ``It will be as long as Steve feels he needs to address
his family and personal matters,'' Howard said. ``We're hopeful
that it will be relatively short, but that remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said that even if a lawsuit was filed, he did not expect
that it would have any effect on Phillips' return.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Phillips began his baseball career as an infielder in the Mets'
minor league system. In 1990 he became the team's administrative
assistant for scouting and minor league operations, then became
minor league director the next year. The club named him assistant
general manager in September 1995, and in July 1997 he was
appointed general manager when Joe McIlvaine was fired.
</P>
<P>
   He is the third-youngest general manager in the major leagues;
only Brian Cashman of the Yankees and Randy Smith of Detroit are
younger. He and his wife, Marni, have two children, Brett, 3, and
Ryan, who will be 6 next month.
</P>
<P>
   Cashen, 68, has been a vice president and consultant since he
stepped down as general manager after the 1991 season.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming interim general manager, Cashen said, ``is not
something I would have chose to do.'' He said the first he knew of
what was happening occurred Saturday morning as he prepared to pay
golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday,'' Cashen
said. ``They asked me if I would do an enormous favor for the
organization. I said certainly, anything I can do I will do. Then
they told me what the favor was and I was crestfallen about Steve.
Once I got over that, I thought if I could do something to help
him, it could help him with his recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashen said he expected to talk with Phillips about club matters
twice a week. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: HOW THE JETS' DEFENSE TURNED FLUTIE FLAKES SOGGY
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-NYT  (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In a philosophical moment last week,
Bryan Cox, the New York Jets' no longer inflammable linebacker, was
discussing Doug Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some quarterbacks look like Tarzan and play like Cheetah,''
Cox said. ``Flutie looks like Cheetah and plays like Tarzan.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the 5-foot-9-inch quarterback had played like Tarzan in
guiding the Bills to five consecutive victories. But Sunday the
Jets' defense turned Flutie into Tarzan's pal. After having
generated 14 touchdowns this season, Flutie could put only four
field goals on the scoreboard in the Jets' 34-12 rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been five years since I got my tail kicked like this,''
Flutie said, alluding to a Canadian Football League game. ``Their
four linebackers and four defensive backs gave me trouble. That was
the only thing we had not seen them do. That was not in our
study.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning four straight for a 6-3 record that shares first
place in the Eastern Division with the Miami Dolphins, this Jets
team has now won three big games _ at New England, in Kansas City
and Sunday's domination of the Bills. That's what good teams do.
That's what contenders for the Super Bowl XXXIII playoffs do.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets are careful not to gloat. Not even with a visit
next Sunday to Indianapolis, where the Colts are 1-8.
</P>
<P>
   While dissecting Sunday's triumph, Coach Bill Parcells talked
about how the Colts are ``going to have a lot to say about who wins
this decision.'' Almost to a man, his players were parroting the
coach's warning. They talked about the Colts game as if land mines
had already been planted in the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that is their memory of losing to the Rams in St.
Louis, a game they apparently assumed they would win.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, it might have been the taste of Flutie Flakes,
suddenly the breakfast of champions in Buffalo, that nourished the
Jets' defense. During their Saturday night meeting a box of the
quarterback's cereal somehow appeared. Now, in their quiet locker
room, the defensive backs were talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tasted them,'' cornerback Otis Smith said. ``They were
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all wanted to see what they tasted like,'' safety Chris
Hayes said. ``Maybe a little too sugary, but pretty good. I'm glad
he's got his own box. He deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, that's a trap question; when we go up there,'' cornerback
Marcus Coleman said, alluding to the Dec. 19 rematch, ``they're
going to use that against us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is always warning his Jets to be careful of ``trap''
questions because a careless answer could wind up on an opponents'
bulletin board. But if the Jets contain Flutie in Rich Stadium as
effectively as they did Sunday, the Bills will need more than a
careless answer to a trap question.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Bills will need to find a way to escape the trap
set for Flutie by Bill Belichick, the Jets' assistant head coach
and defensive guru.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just tried a few little different things,'' Parcells said.
``Not run by him, not jump in the air. James Farrior stayed on him
some of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Bills had third down, the Jets' defense was
particularly efficient. Out of 12 third-down situations, Flutie
converted only two, a sad 17 percent compared to the Jets' 63
percent. Those two were a 9-yard pass that led to the Bills' 3-0
lead and a 36-yard pass en route to their final field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to keep Flutie inside the pocket as much as
possible,'' Cox said. ``Keep him from running around. And Farrior
sort of played safety for us back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Against man-to-man coverage, Flutie completed only 12 of 30
passes for 154 yards. He was intercepted twice, by Smith and Ray
Mickens, and sacked twice, by Cox and Mo Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't worry about what our offense has done,'' said Smith,
alluding to Vinny Testaverde's early interception and two Gerald
Sowell fumbles in the second quarter. ``Wherever the ball is, we go
out there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Flutie's theatrics, the Bills had been averaging
134 rushing yards a game during their 5-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we held them to 48 yards rushing,'' Cox said. ``Shutting
them down like that took away their play-action plays. That was
important because Flutie is deadly. They give him the ball, he can
go anyplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickens praised Belichick the way the two-time Super Bowl
champion Giants did when Belichick was Parcells' defensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets everybody looking at the whole game,'' Mickens said.
``Instead of just looking at the pass receiver you're supposed to
cover when they line up, he wants you to look at the fullback, at
the other wide receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this season, the Bills used four wide
receivers on offense. ``We didn't even practice against that,''
Mickens said, ``but we adjusted to it.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the pass-rushers got near Flutie, they were careful not
to jump up, which would allow Flutie to dart pass them, and not to
run past him. ``The worst place in football,'' defensive end Rick
Lyle said, ``is behind the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the worst place in football is in the depths of your
division, which is where the Jets often have been. But these are
different Jets.

NORTHRIDGE NOT IN POSTSEASON YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge's win was nice for the
school, great for the program, but contrary to popular belief,
beating Portland State doesn't put the Matadors in the playoffs.
Not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 32-28 victory against Portland State vaulted the
Matadors into first place in the Big Sky Conference and put them in
prime position to pounce on their first Division I-AA playoff
berth.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't secure an invitation, despite what everyone seemed
to be saying afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the two losses and it was kind of down for us, but now
that we're back winning again, everybody's confidence level is up
and we're getting ready for the playoffs now,'' CSUN quarterback
Marcus Brady said. ``... But we can't overlook these last two
teams. We have to come out with these two wins to get a higher seed
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose these two games, we might even not make it to the
playoffs, so we have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Correct.
</P>
<P>
   A playoff berth can be all but secured with wins at Southwest
Missouri State and Idaho State. Anything short of that means
leaving it up to the selection committee. And before playoff plans
are made, there's a simple question that needs to be asked: Does
anyone remember Sacramento State?
</P>
<P>
   Let's set the scene. CSUN had just defeated Montana in what was
being called the biggest, grandest win in program history. Six
fumbles against Sacramento State later and it was a quiet, morbid
bus ride home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, that week (of practice before Sacramento
State) is going to be a rascal for those guys next year,'' CSUN
coach Ron Ponciano said. ``It could be no co-anything if we would
have just played like we're capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotcha, coach. Thanks for the piece of levity.
</P>
<P>
   So expect Ponciano to be metaphorically slapping his players
back into reality during the next few days so they, too, can
remember the Sacramento State affair. Of course, Ponciano will
never forget that loss because it was personal. He's from that part
of the state and had friends and family and neighbors and everyone
else at the 35-21 debacle a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach will get us right back in it,'' CSUN defensive lineman
Shawnbay Jones said. ``There's a lot of people looking forward to
the playoffs because that's big for the school and all, but I think
we'll be able to focus on the practice field.''
</P>
<P>
   So back to this week. Well, next week, really. And the following
week.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of wins doesn't guarantee CSUN (6-3, 5-2 Big Sky) a spot
in the 16-team playoff, but you have to like the Matadors chances.
Since the playoff format was expanded to its current size in 1986,
the runner-up in the Big Sky has gone every year.
</P>
<P>
   By winning at Idaho State, the Matadors would be co-champions of
the league. But Montana State (6-3, 4-2) owns the head-to-head
tiebreaker with the Matadors, and the Bobcats have the right to
grab the Big Sky's automatic bid.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, which leads the Bobcats and Montana (6-3, 4-2) by a
half-game, hold the tie-breaker advantage with the Grizzlies by
virtue of the aforementioned win. And Montana and Montana State
play in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also importance where Southwest Missouri State is
concerned. While it is a nonconference game, there would be
questions as to whether the NCAA selection committee would take the
Matadors with only seven wins.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if CSUN should beat Southwest Missouri State. The
Bears, who play in the Gateway Conference, are 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we only take one, we could be in trouble,'' Ponciano said.
``That's why the Southwest Missouri game is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. A playoff spot wasn't clinched against Portland State,
just the right to continue playing for one. &UR; !dlim! &LR; !end! &QL;

H IS FOR HIKE TO 33 CENTS ON A FIRST-CLASS POSTAGE STAMP
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 2nd graf for clarification about price of stamp)  (ms) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To ease customers into the new postal rates that take effect
Jan. 10, the U.S. Postal Service will start Monday to flood the
country with its new H for Hat stamp _ 14,692,520,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps, which were printed during the last several years
before the new basic 33-cent rate was approved, picture Uncle Sam's
hat and the words ``USA H First-Class Rate,'' but do not show any
value, although they will cost 33 cents. They are part of a series
printed in advance for other rate increases, with A, B, C and D
picturing only letters, followed by E for Earth, F for Flower and G
for Old Glory.
</P>
<P>
   The last rate increase, to 32 cents from 29, took place on Jan.
1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service is also releasing a nondenominated stamp on
Tuesday, which is worth 1 cent and pictures a rooster weather vane,
to use with any 32-cent stamps that customers have left over on
Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Not all postal rates will rise in January. The cost of
additional ounces for heavier letters will fall 1 cent, to 22
cents, so the cost of a 2-ounce letter will remain 55 cents and the
cost of a 3-ounce letter drops to 77 cents, from 78.
</P>
<P>
   That means new 22-cent and 77-cent stamps, picturing Uncle Sam
and Mary Breckinridge, respectively. Breckinridge was the founder
of the Frontier Nursing Service in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The basic Priority Mail rate rises to $3.20 from $3 (with
another stamp to be issued Tuesday, showing a space-shuttle
landing), and Express Mail goes to $11.75 from $10.75 (with still
another stamp, showing a shuttle piggybacked on a transporter
plane, but not until Nov. 19).

ELLIOTT HOLDS HIS GROUND AGAINST SMITH
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: FBN-JETS-BILLS, FBN-JETS-DEFENSE) 
 (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There was no question that New York Jets
offensive lineman Jumbo Elliott was trying to set the tone early in
his matchup against Bruce Smith, the future Hall of Fame defensive
end for the Buffalo Bills. In the first quarter, Elliott jammed the
flat part of his right hand into Smith's face so hard, Smith's head
snapped back like a Pez dispenser. Greetings, Mr. Smith, and
welcome to the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Had Smith not had a face-mask, he would have needed dental work.
Not that anyone should feel bad for Smith, because later in the
quarter he returned the favor, smacking Elliott in the head with a
swift right hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came over and apologized,'' Smith said of Elliott. ``And I
did it back to him and then apologized. It was due courtesy to a
good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said: ``Bruce said he apologized? That's funny. Well,
he's such a great player, he can say whatever he wants. He's
getting better with age.''
</P>
<P>
   Who won the battle of the punches? It was a draw. Who won the
battle of two of the best linemen in football in a classic,
hard-fought battle? Decision, Elliott, whose solid play at left
tackle against Smith at right defensive end was one of the main
reasons the Jets beat the Bills, 34-12, and are now tied with Miami
for first place in the American Football Conference East.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott had assistance, of course, from his fellow offensive
linemen, who would occasionally slide over to help Elliott with a
double team. Try to single block Smith constantly, and sooner or
later he will send your quarterback to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave Bruce so many different looks,'' said fullback Keith
Byars. ``Single team, double team, triple team; we tried to keep
him off-balance. As long as Bruce Smith is in this league, he will
be double-teamed.''
</P>
<P>
   The times he was not, Elliott used his massive frame as a
roadblock. Great players. Classic battle.
</P>
<P>
   They have done it before.
</P>
<P>
   While the focus of the game was on the glitz, on Heisman Trophy
winners and Flutie Flakes, the game always comes down to the play
in the trenches. In the case of Elliott and Smith, they know each
other well, and Elliott always plays well against him. But while
the two men have faced each other often, they have gone against
each other in big games just twice. This game was the second.
</P>
<P>
   The first was almost 10 years ago. It was Super Bowl XXV in
January 1991, and Elliott, in just his second season with the
Giants, was coming off an impressive two-game stretch in which he
had shut down pass rushers Richard Dent of Chicago and Charles
Haley of San Francisco. Then came the Super Bowl against the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Smith thought he would destroy Elliott. Then, there was no
reason to doubt him. Smith was the best defensive lineman in
football _ and he was not shy about saying so. Yet it would be the
quiet Elliott who would shut down Smith. Without Elliott's play,
the Giants would not have won that game.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to this afternoon, and the same thing can be said.
Smith has been a terror against the Jets, sacking the team's
quarterbacks 29{ times in his career, the most sacks for Smith
against any club. Ken O'Brien, Neil O'Donnell, Tony Eason, Browning
Nagle, Boomer Esiason, Frank Reich, Glenn Foley, Bubby Brister,
Jack Trudeau, Jeff Blake and Troy Taylor have all looked across the
line, seen the muscular Smith and checked their insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde did not need Allstate. Only twice did the Jets
quarterback, unlike his predecessors, actually feel Smith breathing
down his back. Elliott and the rest of the Jets' line protected
Testaverde as if he was on the endangered species list, holding
Smith to one sack, which he got late in the game when it was out of
hand. Smith had four tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw more double teams than I saw all year,'' Smith said.
``It shows a great deal of respect they have for me, I guess. But
the bottom line is, I have to beat two men.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, always humble, did nothing but praise Smith, wanting to
deflect attention from himself, which is hard for a 300-pound left
tackle to do. There were at least 15 times when Elliott and Smith
were matched up one-on-one, and Smith beat Elliott only once. Those
are results any offensive lineman would take.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott was also effective blocking Smith on running plays. In
the third quarter, on second down and 2, Elliott pushed Smith
several yards down the line of scrimmage, clearing the way for
running back Curtis Martin to pick up 3 yards and the first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't say I played well against him,'' Elliott said.
``He'll get riled up for the next time we play them.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late. The word is already out. Elliott may be one of the few
tackles who can actually slow the 300-pound Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Jumbo played great, he really did,'' Byars said. ``Jumbo
is so humble, he would never say that. But there is no question he
gave Bruce all he could handle.''

LOUIS DANIEL, 77, WHO POPULARIZED FRENCH DINING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Louis Daniel, who tried to bring the food and
atmosphere of the best bistros of Paris to Le Chambertin, the
classic French restaurant he operated for many years in Manhattan,
died at his home in Phoenicia on Oct. 29. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   He had been suffering from cancer for many years, said his wife,
Margaret Gibson Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel was born in Brittany, France, and made his way to Paris
as a teen-ager. He worked in various restaurants there until 1942,
when, during the German occupation of the city, he was taken
prisoner and sent to Germany to work in the materiel plants.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he returned to Paris and the restaurant business,
working at, among other places, the brasserie across the Seine from
the police headquarters that the author Georges Simenon used as the
Brasserie Dauphine, a canteen for the fictional Inspector Maigret.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Daniel joined a group of his colleagues and went to
Bermuda to help reopen the Castle Harbour Hotel, which had been
closed during the war. Soon after, Daniel moved on to New York,
working in the small French restaurants that proliferated in the
postwar years. He became a U.S. citizen in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, after eight years at Les Pyrenees, a
well-known West Side restaurant, he opened Le Chambertin, at 348
West 46th St., insisting that its decor and menu reflect the better
bistros of his youth. The waiters and cooks were French, and the
menu was classic. Daniel was no more interested in nouvelle cuisine
than he was in modern decor.
</P>
<P>
   In one respect he was well ahead of his time. He spent his
weekends at his home on the Esopus River in Phoenicia, in the
Catskills, an area that was then, and to some extent still is,
known as the French Catskills. Each Sunday night, or Monday
morning, Daniel piled his station wagon high with fresh produce
from his meticulously managed four-acre garden, the better to serve
his clientele on 46th Street during the week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, he closed Le Chambertin, worn out, he said, from the
effort involved in maintaining an old-fashioned French restaurant
in a rapidly modernizing New York. When he announced that he
planned to become a wine salesman, his colleagues in the restaurant
world were skeptical. They predicted that his old friends,
restaurant owners and bartenders, would become tight-fisted when he
came calling with his wine list.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he became a successful salesman for the House of
Burgundy, an importer specializing in French wines, winning
customers in New York and in the Hudson Valley, where in later
years he spent more and more of his time.
</P>
<P>
   As illness slowed his pace in the late 1980s, he spent part of
the year in Florida, but as an avid outdoorsman, he continued to
hunt and fish in the Catskills whenever he could.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife of 35 years, he is survived by a sister and
several nieces and nephews, all of whom live in France.

MIDWESTERN HOSPITALITY NO COMFORT TO PIRATES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Sooner or later, Seton Hall will find a defense
it can score against. What defense that is, though, remains to be
seen, as the Pirates were done in by both man-to-man and zone sets
in this weekend's National Association of Basketball Coaches
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Valparaiso, a power in the Mid-Continent Conference, used a 2-3
zone to stymie Seton Hall and leave the RCA Dome with a 64-54
victory Sunday night. Saturday, host Indiana whipped the Pirates,
83-69, with a stifling man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking the Pirates lost to the gutsy Bryce Drew-led
group that threw a monkey wrench into last year's National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, forget about it. Drew
was drafted by the Houston Rockets and three other starters
graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, after dropping South Carolina, 67-61, on Saturday,
Valparaiso left here with a 2-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall (0-2) might have lost more than a game it should have
won. With 5 minutes 27 seconds remaining, shooting guard Rimas
Kaukenas left with a left knee injury after Valparaiso's
6-foot-11-inch center Zoran Viskovic fell on his leg. Kaukenas, a
6-4 junior from Lithuania, had been Seton Hall's main offensive
weapon, scoring 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Though they never got going on offense, the Pirates were in
position to win with four minutes to play after freshman Ty Shine
stripped Valparaiso's Jared Nuness of the ball and took it in for a
layup to pull Seton Hall to within one, 51-50. The Pirates fell
behind by 53-50 on a basket by Ivan Vujic, but moments later, with
a chance to tie or get as close as a point, Shine missed two
3-pointers. Less than 10 seconds later, Nuness drilled a 3-pointer
from the top of the key to put Valparaiso up by 56-50 and all but
end the Pirates' hopes with 2:14 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Crusaders' balance _ five players scored from 8 to 13 points
_ contrasted Seton Hall's one-man show. Only Duane Jordan joined
Kaukenas in double figures, with 10 points. For the second straight
game, the all-Big East point guard Shaheen Holloway scored only 6
points, 10 fewer than his career average. Milo Stovall led
Valparaiso with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Seton Hall had a chance to set the tone and put away
the Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   Applying the type of oppressive man-to-man pressure that Indiana
forced on them Saturday, the Pirates took away everything
Valparaiso attempted to do on offense. Smothering the ball-handlers
and cutting off passing lanes, they made life miserable for the
slow-footed Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   During a seven-minute stretch early in the half, Valparaiso
turned the ball over on six of seven possessions. Pirates players
twice stripped Crusaders of the ball, and four times, Valparaiso
players simply gave it away by dribbling off their feet, traveling
or throwing the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, Seton Hall failed to capitalize, building
just a 12-8 lead while the Crusaders struggled to get into their
offense. Saunders and Kaukenas hit a few 3-pointers, and the
Pirates scored a couple of fast-break baskets, but other than that,
their offense was as dead as their defense was alive.
</P>
<P>
   A day after nationally ranked Indiana shut them down, the
Pirates were rendered ineffective by Valparaiso's 2-3 zone. With
the 6-10 freshman Charles Manga and the 6-6 senior Jordan failing
to establish a presence inside, Seton Hall was forced to launch
bombs from the perimeter. A poor outside-shooting team, the Pirates
made only 8 of 26 first-half shots (30.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The longer Seton Hall went without taking control of the
Crusaders' miscues, the more confident Valparaiso grew. Suddenly,
midway through the first half, the Crusaders' fear vanished. They
began setting stronger picks and showing more patience and
eventually surged ahead. Using a 13-5 run, Valparaiso turned a
14-11 deficit at the 10:20 mark into a 24-19 lead a minute before
the break.
</P>
<P>
   With most of their jumpers clanging off the back of the rim, the
Pirates went into the locker room trailing, 26-22. The deficit
would have been worse were it not for Kaukenas, who proved to be
the only Pirate with an outside touch in making 4 of 7 shots
(including 2 of 3 3-pointers) for 12 points.

WILL DEFENSE BE UCLA'S UNDOING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You watch UCLA struggle against Cal and conclude
the Bears are pretty good. Then Arizona State slaps them for 55
points without J.R. Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   You see UCLA survive Stanford and think the Cardinal is
improving. Then USC shows otherwise without R. Jay Soward.
</P>
<P>
   You watch UCLA escape Oregon State and think the Beavers are
underrated. Then you remember Arizona dominated them three weeks
ago in Corvallis.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Bruins (8-0, 6-0) playing that poorly? Or are they, as
coaches and player claim, ``bringing out the best in their
opponents''? They're undefeated and probably will be ranked No. 2
in the Bowl Championship Series poll released today. Yet they're
one pass (Oregon State) and two fumbles (Oregon, Stanford) from
being out of the top 25.
</P>
<P>
   They've spent so much time on the edge _ and survived each
experience _ they're addicted to it. They operate at peak
efficiency when there's no choice. Sometimes the sense of urgency
lasts four quarters (Arizona). Sometimes it lasts a few minutes
(Stanford, Oregon State).
</P>
<P>
   It's as dangerous as it is unavoidable for a team with just six
senior starters and a slew of first- and second-year players in
crucial positions. Prolonged winning streaks create complacency in
any team, and the Bruins haven't lost in 14 months. Young, confused
defenses find ways to make lesser opponents competitive, and UCLA's
defense seems younger and more confused each week.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Toledo believes offense wins and defense keeps you
from losing. There's considerable supporting evidence, at least in
the NFL, where the best teams (Denver, Minnesota, Green Bay and San
Francisco) also have the best offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA plays by a different rule: one regular-season
defeat, especially in November, and you're done. Eventually, every
offense stumbles. Kansas State scored 16 against Colorado but held
the Buffaloes to nine. Meanwhile, Ohio State didn't score an
offensive touchdown in the second half against Michigan State, and
its defense wasted a 24-9 lead. The Buckeyes are done.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti has shuffled his
strategy and roster several times already; expect more changes.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ryan Roques has not played well in recent weeks and
might lose his job to former starter Marques Anderson, the Bruins'
most gifted cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive line is staggering. End Pete Holland plays the run
but not the pass; Travor Turner plays the pass but not the run.
Starting nose guard Micah Webb has been ineffective. Perhaps it's
time for talented freshman Ken Kocher to join the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The pass rush is sporadic, leaving the vulnerable cornerbacks in
single coverage a second too long. While it probably makes Aliotti
cringe _ he's a man-to-man man _ the zone was effective Saturday
and merits further implementation.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's grueling stretch run begins Saturday in Seattle against
the shaken Huskies. Like Stanford, they have no running game and
use four-receiver sets to spread the defense. It should be a
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 finale, most likely, will not. Count UCLA's attack
and USC's defense as a wash: Both are the best in the Pac-10. But
the Trojans' offense is better than UCLA's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins might survive another week, and they might look good
doing it. The Huskies are finally feeling the probation noose. But
unless UCLA's defense makes a radical recovery, an 18-game winning
streak and a seven-game losing streak will end Nov. 21 in the Rose
Bowl. &QL; 
REPORT CARD &QL; 
Game: 8 &QL; 
Result: UCLA 41, Oregon State 34 &QL; 
Record: 8-0 &QL; 
This week's GPA: 2.15 &QL; 
Cumulative GPA: 2.93 &QL; 
Quarterback: Now THAT was a Heisman-caliber game from Cade McNown:
four touchdowns, 436 total yards and flawless execution in the
fourth quarter. Grade: A &QL; 
Running backs: Running backs? What running backs? Aside from
DeShaun Foster's touchdown run, didn't notice them. Apologies to
Keyshawn, but give McNown the ball. Grade: C- &QL; 
Receivers: Doesn't get any better than Brian Poli-Dixon's nine
catches, Danny Farmer's two touchdowns, contributions from the
tight ends, and of course, Brad Melsby's clutch catch. Grade: A+ &QL; 
Offensive line: Bruins had trouble with Oregon State's speed, but
pass protection was solid and holding penalties disappeared. The
big test comes this week, though. Grade: B &QL; 
Defensive line: The maligned line turned Jason Dandridge into Ricky
Williams, yielded 168 rushing yards and got a sprinkle of pass
pressure. Kenyon Coleman has become a one-man unit. Grade: D &QL; 
Linebackers: Ryan Nece was active and effective, but that's about
it. See: backs, running. Grade: D &QL; 
Defensive backs: Jason Bell played well _ OK, better _ but Ryan
Roques did not and Marques Anderson again struggled with the slant.
Larry Atkins blew an interception. Grade: C- &QL; 
Special Teams: Chris Sailer's field goal and his handling of a poor
snap were the only things special about this unit. Horrific kickoff
coverage, reminiscent of 1996 woes. Grade: D- &QL; 
Coaching: Good: trick play, throwing deep with 20 seconds left, and
zone defense. Bad: no timeout before OSU's final touchdown. Worse:
kicking to Tim Alexander. Grade: C

JET OFFENSIVE PACKAGE SURPRISES BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: FBN-JETS-BILLS, FBN-JETS-JUMBO) 
 (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In football jargon, it is called 11
Personnel. It is an offensive package complete with three wide
receivers and a tight end.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets employed this package early in the third
quarter Sunday. It was used on the play that separated the Jets
from the Buffalo Bills, that made a 13-9 game a 20-9 game. Tricky
11 Personnel was used on Vinny Testaverde's 36-yard touchdown pass
to Dedric Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the package and play were similar to those the Jets
ran for a Testaverde-to-Ward 43-yard score four games ago that
insured the victory over New England. Ward running free down the
right sideline. Testaverde tossing a high, arcing spiral. Ward
sprinting underneath, so fast, past the last line of defense.
Similar play from similar field position. Finishing, too, in a
similar spot, in the right, front corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the new wrinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Ward lined up in the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Two Jets receivers were aligned wide left and the tight end was
aligned at the right end of the offensive line. Ward was in the
backfield instead of aligned wide right, the way it went in New
England. He was in what is called I-Under, a step or two to the
right and in front of the tailback, Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was sneaky,'' said Buffalo safety Kurt Schulz, a
seven-year veteran. ``It looked like a two-back set and then Ward
comes out of there in motion and we were stuck. We had no
cornerback over there. The safety had to take that action.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo safety was Henry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to leave my responsibility inside the hash mark, float
to the outside, but then I also saw action by the tight end,''
Jones said. ``That made me hesitate. And as fast as that guy Ward
is, he was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bills cornerback Thomas Smith said: ``That play took Henry out.
And then there was no one to cover for Henry.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Bruce Smith concluded: ``Whatever the defense is
called and whatever we do, just play the defense. Get people
covered.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what Bills Coach Wade Phillips meant when he said his
team ``let things happen.'' What happened was a 34-12 Jets' victory
that did several things. Among them, it dropped Buffalo's record to
5-4, snapped its six-game winning streak against the Jets and
dropped the Bills into third place _ behind the Jets and Miami _ in
the American Conference East division race.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game in which Buffalo allowed the Jets to dictate
matters on the field and on the sidelines and in the press box with
the coaches making the play calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took it to us,'' said Doug Flutie, Buffalo's big-play
quarterback of late who could only amount 154 passing yards and no
touchdowns. He was intercepted twice. The Jets made sure he did not
beat them with his legs, either: He ran three times for only 2
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's backbreaking play and the tricky 11 Personnel employed
was set up by a first half of opportunities wasted by the Bills. If
Buffalo had taken three gifts _ three Jets turnovers in the first
22 minutes _ and had been as imaginative, creative and as effective
as the Jets would later be, the game might have been quite
different.
</P>
<P>
   On the game's first play, Testaverde was intercepted at the
Jets' 38. The Buffalo offense took over, gained 2 yards and punted.
With 10 minutes 47 seconds left in the second quarter, Buffalo
forced a Jets' fumble at their 37. Buffalo lost 1 yard and punted.
With 6:57 left in the second quarter, Buffalo forced another
fumble, this time at the Jets' 49. The Bills got a field goal out
of that one. Three turnovers, all in Jets' territory, turned into
one field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, with 4:51 left before halftime, Buffalo led by 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   With 27 seconds left, the Jets led by 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 seconds left, Flutie was intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   With no time left, the Jets made a field goal and it was 13-9.
</P>
<P>
   Missed opportunities for Buffalo and then a momentum-swinging
play just before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I think the difference came,'' Flutie said. ``We
had our opportunities and we didn't take advantage of it. That put
us in a tough position late in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It put the Bills under pressure to perform when the Jets waltzed
out in the second half and were cute and tricky and good and tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played a cat-and-mouse game when they had to, but they
played plenty of physical football, too,'' Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big game, a big moment, and the Bills blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole game was off,'' Phillips said. ``We need to look at
ourselves. We didn't come after them.''
</P>
<P>
   They let things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Why the hesitancy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a struggle,'' Flutie said. ``It's not a lot of fun
when you lose. I'll keep swinging and letting it fly. I don't
accept losing very easily. I had a rough day. We had a rough day.
We are going to bounce back from this. You don't take anything from
a loss. You get aggravated and frustrated. We think we can match up
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Sunday. The Jets won the matchups, upstairs and downstairs.
That turned this game into a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get another chance,'' Bruce Smith said of the
Jets-at-Buffalo rematch on Dec. 19, one game before the end of the
regular season. ``We'll have to make sure then that it counts for
something.''

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   There were two things I always wanted as a child _ a
three-wheeler and shoes that squeaked. I remember how my classmates
had shoes that squeaked as they walked, and I never knew what
caused it, but I liked the sound. I would walk through puddles of
water hoping that would do the trick, but it never did.
</P>
<P>
   I always loved any toy that had wheels, and it was a thrill when
my superintendent's son let me ride his tricycle. My parents were
poor, so I just dreamed about owning one. I never got the squeaky
shoes or the tricycle.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I wore my Nike shoes, and as I was walking to the
trash room, I heard them squeak. I couldn't believe it. After all
these years, I finally had a pair of shoes that squeaked.

   Edward Levine was playing a word game with Lily, his 9-year-old
daughter. The game covers a variety of subjects and requires each
player to come up with a word or phrase beginning with a particular
letter. In one round, the letter was H and the category was
``action words.'' Where else but New York would Lily have responded
with ``Hail a cab!''

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   My 21-year-old daughter graduated from college in May and headed
to Europe for a planned three-month vacation. Six weeks later, she
was notified about a potential job in New York and deemed it such a
great opportunity that she returned immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Switching into her ``take charge mode,'' she bought a new suit
for the interview, had her hair styled, called her references in
advance and left me wondering if this was really my child. She got
the job, and in record time moved back into her dad's apartment in
Manhattan, reorganized her room there and went to work at a
prestigious media organization.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, we were discussing the nuts and bolts of her
new life, and I offered her one of my favorite and extremely hardy
plants for her room. ``No,'' she replied. ``I'm not ready for that
level of commitment.''

   When her daughters were 5 and 7, Linda Weil attended a lecture
by a psychologist. The message she took home was that life was
filled with choices, and that a parent's job was to present the
choices on a regular basis as training for adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, as the girls were dressing, Ms. Weil asked if
they wanted pancakes or waffles. There were a few short ``I don't
care'' shrugs, but Ms. Weil was determined to make them choose. She
kept repeating the question. Finally, one of the girls looked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been something at last night's lecture,'' her
daughter said. ``Please don't go to any more of them.''

   The panhandler near Rockefeller Center wasn't doing too badly,

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Last week, my wife took our 10-week-old son for his first subway
ride. Everyone said that he would sleep through the whole ride. He
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He started screaming as soon as they sat down. Instead of
leaving the car or rolling their eyes, the other passengers gave
advice. One woman suggested turning him around in his harness
(didn't work), a Russian woman came over and bounced him around and
sang (worked for about 40 seconds), and a guy offered what seemed
to be a lot of sympathetic advice (my wife couldn't hear it over
the screaming). Then he gave her a package of earplugs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a homeless man, who gave his ``Ladiesanjennulmun may I
please have yer attention'' speech, even though it was completely
drowned out by the screaming, came over and said ``Don't cry baby!
Jesus loves you! Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!''
</P>
<P>
   My son stopped crying immediately. The whole car burst out
laughing. He slept for the rest of the afternoon.

<P>
   She won't know right from wrong,

<P>
   And when she comes my way
</P>
<P>
   I'll do my best to make her play.
</P>
<P>
   She'll look at me and purr,
</P>
<P>
   I'll understand
</P>
<P>
   That when I play with her
</P>
<P>
   She'll bite my hand.
</P>

A little later, as he drove up with his books and was unloading
them, a passer-by spotted them, offered him more money and within
the proverbial New York minute was carrying away the set.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, the wheeler-dealer buyer returned. This
time he entered the store, but not to make a purchase. He demanded
satisfaction, he said. The set was incomplete. Bass suggested he
hang a shingle out on the curb.

ANGELS SAID TO SURPASS $72 MILLION FOR MO VAUGHN
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. While the Anaheim Angels, with an offer to Mo
Vaughn, have shown that huge contracts will be available for the
elite free agents this winter, those contracts will not be
forthcoming from one team that had been expected to be a player in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, a lawyer familiar with the team's plans said Sunday,
have offered Vaughn, the Boston Red Sox first baseman for the past
seven and a half seasons, a six-year contract for more than $12
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   That offer would indicate that Bernie Williams, most likely the
New York Yankees' former center fielder, can expect to receive
offers upward of $12 million a year, but no such offer will come
from the Colorado Rockies, who had been interested in Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the top center fielder on the market, but no one knows
where this thing's going in dollars and cents,'' Bob Gebhard, the
Rockies' general manager, said Sunday on the first day of the
general managers' meetings. ``I had a certain amount of dollars I
was going to spend, but I wasn't going to wait forever and then
maybe not get him. This way we think we can patch up three or four
spots that we want to improve as opposed to just one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies instead re-signed their own center fielder, Darryl
Hamilton, last Thursday to a three-year, $10.5 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We signed him to play,'' Gebhard said. ``He's our center
fielder. We're out of the center-field hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies also had been expected to pursue Kevin Brown for
their pitching staff, but late Saturday night they signed a less
expensive free-agent pitcher, Brian Bohanon.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon, a 30-year-old left-hander, whom the New York Mets
traded to Los Angeles this past season for Hideo Nomo, agreed to a
three-year, $9 million contract. The Rockies plan to put him in
their starting rotation with Darryl Kile, Pedro Astacio, John
Thomson and Jamie Wright.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the Rockies' interest in Brown, who with Randy
Johnson is the most attractive pitcher on the free-agent market?
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Boras,'' Gebhard said, referring to Brown's agent,
``told me two days ago they definitely want six years, and we don't
have the appetite for six years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had hoped to re-sign Bohanon, but the Rockies moved
quickly and decisively, said Alan Hendricks, the pitcher's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of activity on Bohanon,'' Hendricks said. ``If
I was willing to have done two guaranteed years and a third-year
option, I could have had as many as 18 offers out of 30 teams. But
when I said I wanted three guaranteed years, we had six
proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies won the race despite the specter of pitching at
Coors Field, a hitters' park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any pitcher who says he doesn't have concern pitching there
would be a liar,'' Hendricks said. ``I think every National League
pitcher has concern. But he's accepted the challenge. If he was
going to be worried about it, there were plenty of other offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon, whose 1998 salary of $350,000 had been the highest of
his six-year major league career, had a 7-11 record and a 2.67
earned run average in 18 starts and 21 relief appearances with the
Mets and the Dodgers.  &QL;

WALTER GEORGE BERL, 81, CHEMIST AND EXPERT ON RAM-JET FUEL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 BY WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter George Berl, a chemist whose research included
high-energy ram-jet fuels and international firefighting programs,
died on Oct. 24 while vacationing in Durango, Colo. He was 81 and
lived in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said a spokesman for Johns Hopkins
University. Berl retired in 1994 from the university's Applied
Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Berl, who edited a number of technical publications in his
field, was born in Vienna. He earned a bachelor's degree in
chemical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in
1937, a master's degree in chemistry at Harvard University in 1939
and a doctorate in physical chemistry from what is now Carnegie
Mellon University in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Berl conducted research and taught at Carnegie Mellon until
1945, when he joined the staff of the Applied Physics Laboratory.
In 1956 he was appointed to the principal professional staff, the
institution's highest staff designation.
</P>
<P>
   He oversaw a program examining how fire starts and progresses,
and studied energy-related combustion phenomena. His expertise
helped to plan strategy for extinguishing oil well fires in Kuwait
after the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Berl was the author of numerous articles, a consultant to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and editor-in-chief of the Johns
Hopkins Applied Technology Digest. He held patents for a catalytic
igniter for ram-jets and a method for bonding oxidizer particles in
the manufacture of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Berl is survived by his wife, Shirley Anne Hargraves; a
daughter, Kathleen Victorino of Bethesda; a brother, Herbert of
Washington; a stepdaughter, Cynthia Tobin of Blue Hill, Maine, and
a stepson, Richard Hargraves of Durango, Colo. His earlier marriage
to Ruth Gilman ended in divorce.

VICTORIES BY VETERANS AND TEENS CAP NATIONAL

   NEW YORK _ No more sleeping in stalls for the humans who
performed valet duties for the 200 horses, certified prima donnas
regardless of sex, who turned Madison Square Garden into a
glorified barn for the duration of the 115th National Horse Show.
No more dancing and prancing beneath the spotlights for the 20
horses from the New York City Police mounted unit who were sprung
from their day jobs directing traffic and keeping order in the Big
Apple and allowed to explore their inner artist at this event.
</P>
<P>
   Amid retirement ceremonies for a much-traveled mare; coronation
ceremonies for two young riders whose careers have just begun; a
dressage exhibition by a duo with 21st-century skills, Anky van
Grunsven of the Netherlands atop the Nureyev of horses, Bonfire,
and a $50,000 grand prix that only extreme daredevils had a prayer
of conquering, the National concluded its four-day stint at the
Garden on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The $50,000 Budweiser Grand Prix, the splashy jump-fest that
boasted the highest fences of the week and served as the
competition's grand finale, attracted 21 international entrants. It
was decided by a timed three-horse jump-off in which Peter Leone
and Crown Royale Legato, who soared over eight obstacles in 37.10
seconds, prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to the U.S. Equestrian Team's Eric Hasbrouck
on Miss Fio, and their effort established the American team, which
had trailed France heading into this final class, as the National's
leading international team for the fifth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   For the 38-year-old Leone, resplendent in a violet jacket that
matched the Garden's box seats, the victory reprised his blue
ribbon performance in this prestigious grand prix in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely was a worthwhile win,'' said Leone, who praised
the quality of the course and of the competition he faced.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with a rooster call for the 72 junior riders who
qualified for the ASPCA Maclay Championships. They were up at dawn
to complete the braiding and polishing of their well-groomed
mounts, and then they funneled into the Garden for the strenuous
tests designed by a couple of veteran equestrians, Hap Hansen and
Michael Matz.
</P>
<P>
   Only 16 of the young riders were selected for the championship
round, which featured 13 obstacles and a complex combination of
step-work that included approaches to fences at a trot, canter,
counter-canter and hand gallop as well as the request to come to a
dead halt in the center of the ring midway through the jump course.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, by acclamation, was 18-year-old Erynn Ballard of
Hornby, Ontario, who intends to turn professional in 1999. ``I just
knew everything was going to fall into the place,'' Ballard said
after her jitter-free performance.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve champion was Avery Dimmig of Ridgemont, N.C., on
Taramount.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-place finisher last year in her only prior Maclay
appearance, Ballard, whose grandfather, Bob, was a captain of the
Canadian Equestrian team, is the second Canadian to win this
prestigious title, the other being Laura Tidball in 1980. Something
of a pro already, Ballard flew in from her riding duties on her
home turf at Toronto's Royal Agricultural Winter Festival, jumped
aboard Bennington, a 10-year-old Dutch-bred gelding, and stood in
second place over all after the morning elimination rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard's trainer, Missy Clark, could not recall whether this
was the fourth or fifth Maclay winner to benefit from her tutelage,
but she was very clear on her strategy: ``Get the right horse with
the right kid at the right moment.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Good Hands junior championship for saddleseat riders went to
a 17-year-old American, Tom Pettry of Richmond, Ill., riding the
13-year-old Saddlebred High Expectations. Pettry, who began riding
when he was just 2 years old, was fifth in the class last year and
said he intends to be studying psychology at the University of
Arizona by this time next year. The Good Hands runner-up was Erin
Sembler of Seminole, Fla., on Another Lover. ``Interesting name,
interesting horse,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the teen-age winners of the Maclay and Good
Hands, both of whom had more competitions in store on their
immediate calendars, a 22-year-old pony, Kiss Me Not, retired in
style with a blanket of flowers and a sentimental sendoff that was
a small-scale version of the Cigar bash of 1996, the year the
National returned to the Garden after seven years at the
Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   A shyer specimen than Cigar, Kiss Me Not balked when the
spotlight was trained on her, but bright lights come with the
territory here, said Jeremy Bouwer, a groom who ministered to the
Saddlebred entries, including Another Lover, from the DeLovely
Farm, Inc. of Rockport, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Ensconced at the Garden with eight horses since early Wednesday
morning, Bouwer, who aspires to be a trainer, spent several stints
doing night duty in a stall adjacent to his charges and admitted he
was ready to head home. ``The lights stayed on 24 hours a day,''
said Bouwer, who found out firsthand that ``this is the city that
never sleeps.''

INJURY AND SUSPENSION PROVE COSTLY TO DEVILS

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The New Jersey Devils awoke Sunday from the high
of Saturday's fourth victory in five road games to find two of
their most productive players unavailable to improve that record
against the Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who tried to compensate by playing gamely, lost
their cohesion and the game, 3-1, before 11,514 at the Ice Palace.
That left them with a 7-5 record and broke a four-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were without Bobby Holik, the center who was
suspended by the National Hockey League pending a hearing Tuesday
in New York for slew-footing _ taking a player's legs out from
under him with a sweeping leg movement _ in Saturday's 4-3 victory
over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Scratched from the lineup with a painful bruised sternum was the
wing Dave Andreychuk. He was injured late in the Florida game and
his condition did not improve markedly by the start of the
Lightning game.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, a recent National Hockey League doormat and Devils'
prey, was giddy about reaching .500 _ at 6-6-2 _ for the first time
in 91 games, since Oct. 10, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Playing without Andreychuk and Holik would be like the Yankees
trying to win without Bernie Williams and Tino Martinez, according
to Ken Daneyko, the veteran Devils defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their absences definitely hurt us,'' Daneyko said. ``Dave is
off to his best start in years and Bobby is always tough. Under the
circumstances, it would have been nice to get out of here with a
point. But they got a lucky goal and then we were playing
catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Holik, suspended for the first time in his career, did not have
much to say about the incident involving a Florida defenseman, Paul
Laus. He was penalized for high-sticking although replays showed
Holik used his right leg to drop Laus, who crashed into the boards
and was motionless for more than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely was no intention of hurting him,'' said
Holik, whose consecutive-games streak was halted at 191. ``I didn't
even know who he was. It happened so fast. I better not say
anything before Tuesday, because I might end up deeper than I
already am.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk, the Devils' top scorer, said only two minutes
remained when he was hit in the corner by an unidentified Panther.
``I put my arm up and that's when he got me,'' Andreychuk said.
``It's still pretty sore, but I don't think I'll be out long.''
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of two of his main offensive threats, Devils Coach
Robbie Ftorek did some significant line-switching against Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   He tinkered with a combination of Patrick Elias, Brendan
Morrison and Petr Sykora, which he had abandoned early in the
season for being quick but small.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, that line gave the Devils their only source of offense.
With New Jersey trailing by 1-0 in the second period, Morrison
seized a loose puck along the left boards and pushed it toward the
Lightning net. He made a perfectly timed cross-ice pass to Sykora,
who shot from 10 feet to tie the score at 7 minutes 17 seconds of
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Elias had been on a line with with Holik and
Randy McKay. Sunday, McKay played alongside Jason Arnott and Vadim
Sharifijanov.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bob Carpenter, usually a center, spent the whole game at
left wing, a position he had not played in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' he said. ``It's much easier to go from center to
left wing than it is to go from left wing to center.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning forged ahead to stay early in the final period.
Sykora thought he had control of the puck near the net, but Michal
Sykora _ no relation _ swooped in from behind and hit the Devil
player's stick, knocking the puck by goalie Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprised me a little,'' Brodeur said.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay added an open-net goal with 53 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way the guys played,'' Ftorek said. ``I just didn't
like the result.'' &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: IMBROGLIO FOR `FIGARO' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a long tradition of conductors and opera
houses catering to the whims of prima donnas. The tradition
continues at the Metropolitan Opera, where Cecilia Bartoli, a
singer of sensational popularity and, consequently, clout, is
performing Susanna in the Met's new production of Mozart's ``Nozze
di Figaro.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the production, by the British director Jonathan
Miller, was in rehearsal for more than four weeks, Ms. Bartoli
showed up late, according to one person with ties to the
production, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, though an
official from the Met's press office countered that Ms. Bartoli was
at the Met and in rehearsal for ``at least a week'' before opening
night on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. Bartoli's strongly expressed desire to perform
Susanna using two alternate arias, composed by Mozart, in place of
the familiar arias from the original 1786 Vienna production.
Evidently she insisted that her contract stipulate that she had the
right to sing them, at least in some performances.
</P>
<P>
   The Met's artistic director, James Levine, agreed, apparently
annoying Miller, who had staged the two arias with the original
music and refused at first to stage the substitutes, finding them
inferior.
</P>
<P>
   Met audiences, or at least those with access to tickets for more
than one performance, have the chance to compare the arias. On
opening night, when most critics were there to review, Ms. Bartoli
sang the traditional arias. But for the Tuesday and Saturday
performances of last week, she sang the substitutes, and she will
do so once more on Wednesday night. These three performances are
being videotaped for a later broadcast on public television.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain amount of musicological interest, and a large
degree of novelty, in Ms. Bartoli's decision. But artistically, it
is hard to see the merits in using the later versions, and easy to
understand Miller's apparent dismay.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Susanna was created by the English soprano Nancy
Storace. But three years later, in 1789, when the opera was revived
in Vienna, the Susanna, Adriana Ferrarese del Bene, expressed
dissatisfaction with her character's arias. She was a poor comic
actress, but a technically skillful singer with a wide range and
effective coloratura, and she wanted music that would show off her
agility. Mozart, though unhappy about the matter, was a pragmatic
professional. So he complied.
</P>
<P>
   In the original score, Susanna's first aria, ``Venite
inginocchiatevi,'' comes in Act II, when she attempts to dress up
the page boy Cherubino as a woman, in order to ensnare the Count in
a scheme to expose him as a philanderer. It's charming, witty music
that shows Susanna's clever, playful side, a comedic stroke with a
genial tune.
</P>
<P>
   The second aria is the great ``Deh vieni non tardar,'' in Act
IV. Here, for a moment, the madcap complications of the plot stop,
and Susanna, who has just married, sings a poignant, reflective,
lyrically blissful aria about how much she anticipates her first
night with her beloved.
</P>
<P>
   The confused Figaro, who is hiding, thinks she is singing about
the Count; but Susanna, who knows Figaro is watching her and wants
to teach him a lesson for his distrust, is really singing about her
new husband.
</P>
<P>
   Both substitutes are frivolous works. But they are star turns
that stop the show and call attention to Susanna, which is
seemingly why Ms. Bartoli chose to sing them, and that is certainly
the effect they had.
</P>
<P>
   The aria in place of Act II's ``Venite inginocchiatevi'' is a
strophic arietta, like a song in verses, ``Un moto di gioia,'' a
little ditty of a number, and not at all inspired. Susanna is still
involved with dressing Cherubino up, but the text is filled with
generalities about the difficulty of the task at hand, and the
stress of get-back schemes in general.
</P>
<P>
   Performing it on Saturday night, Ms. Bartoli soon wandered away
from the page boy, sung by Susanne Mentzer, more or less addressed
the audience and left Renee Fleming, who was a sublime Countess,
with not much to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Act IV substitute was the more distressing choice, however.
The original, ``Deh vieni non tardar,'' is utterly moving, a
miracle of an aria, while ``Al desio,'' the rondo that replaces it,
is an unabashed display piece. It begins reflectively, with a
simple melody, but soon evolves into a frilly, trilly, filigreed
thing, like Rossini at his most bumptious.
</P>
<P>
   The text is embarrassing, with Susanna almost panting with
sexual anticipation (``My heart can no longer resist'' and ``Take
pity on my pain''). Ms. Bartoli took center stage and unleashed
volleys of coloratura brilliance, as Bryn Terfel, the wonderful
Figaro, just watched, frozen in his hiding place. Ms. Bartoli sang
the arias with her trademark luscious dark tone, perky energy and
textual incisiveness. But the sublime moment of musical beauty and
psychological ambiguity that comes from the original aria was gone.
And her use of these arias has to be viewed in the context of her
overall performance, which is, as many critics have stated,
comically over the top, attention-grabbing and at times hysterical.
Her Susanna could have stepped right out of Rossini's
``Cenerentola.''
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent performances, Ms. Bartoli, according to the Met,
will resume singing the original arias. But the taped broadcast
will have the substitutes. The Met has used alternative arias in
other Mozart operas, most recently ``Cosi Fan Tutte.'' It is hard
to imagine Levine making a very compelling argument for these
particular substitutes, other than his desire to accommodate Ms.
Bartoli.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart knew the feeling; of the substitute arias he had
composed, he wrote, ``The little aria I have made for Ferrarese I
believe will please, if she is capable of singing in an artless
manner, which very much doubt.'' This is a somewhat vague phrase,
but by ``artless'' I think Mozart meant not displaying artifice.
</P>
<P>
   But what about accommodating Ms. Fleming, Terfel and Ms.
Mentzer, who have to adjust while Ms. Bartoli grabs center stage?
And what about Miller?
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Volpe, the general manager, knows how to stand up to
singers, but he usually defers on artistic matters to Levine, who,
in this case, like musicians before him, even the composer,
deferred to his diva.

PIRATES OF THE CD-ROM 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - PIRACY   By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
D etective Marcus Frank was working the special-investigations unit
when he got the tip about an attempted counterfeiting.
<P>
   He responded to the scene, a print shop in the Orange County
town of Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   There, he picked up a trail that led him and his partner,
Detective Tommy Rackleff, into a seamy underworld involving
international smuggling, money laundering, back-alley deals and
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   After months of stakeouts and talking to confidential
informants, Frank and Rackleff arrested 11 suspects, recovered more
than $3 million worth of illegal booty and disrupted an elaborate
distribution network that stretched from California to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But these weren't vicious drug dealers or gun smugglers. Frank
had run into software pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perceived by criminal enterprises as a much safer
crime to commit,'' Frank said. ``There's an incredible amount of
money these people are making doing this kind of stuff, and the
feeling is, a lot of it is not getting investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an estimated four of every 10 business-software
applications in use worldwide last year were pirated, costing the
software industry $11.4 billion a year in lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Westminster case, made public this summer after federal
indictments were filed, illustrates how police and private
investigators hired by software companies themselves have stepped
up their campaign to crack down on software pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Microsoft Corp. and Autodesk Inc., frequent
targets of software counterfeiters, have even assembled their own
enforcement teams, including former police officers, to go after
pirates. Microsoft alone has a team of 100 chasing software pirates
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software piracy is not a violent crime. There is no blood
splattered; there are no bodies; it's not sexy,'' said a
software-piracy investigator for San Rafael's Autodesk Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a financial crime, and people aren't interested in
hearing about it. But it impacts the industry, and it impacts how
much software costs to everybody,'' said the investigator, who
didn't want to be identified for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Another software investigator, who only would speak anonymously,
said pirates typically manufacture counterfeit software in Southern
California and make Northern California a major distribution point.
</P>
<P>
   Pirated software ends up at flea markets, loaded in new or used
computers, and at smaller software stores. It also can be
distributed through mail-order catalogs and advertised on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Software Alliance, an industry watchdog group whose
members include Microsoft, Autodesk, Adobe Systems Inc. and Lotus
Development Inc., hopes to spotlight the problem through political
lobbying, advertising and churning out statistics that bring the
problem home to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; One BSA study concluded pointed out  &LR; that California lost
18,900 jobs and $2.5 billion in wages and tax revenues due to
piracy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The BSA and a sister organization, the Software Publishers
Association, both based in Washington D.C., estimate that 27
percent of the software in use in the United States _ and 90
percent in parts of Asia and Eastern Europe _ was obtained
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all of our efforts to educate and enforce, there's
still a big problem out there. It's not just a problem with pirates
going around selling software at flea markets or making it
available on the Internet. It's a mainstream problem,'' said Bob
Kruger, the BSA's vice president for enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest pirates are not gangsters or flea-market hustlers &UR; ,
 &LR; but businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The BSA and individual software-makers are receiving an
increasing number of tips on their anti-piracy hotlines, typically
from disgruntled employees looking for a way to get back at their
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Some corporate pirates mistakenly install programs on more
computers than they've bought licenses for, while others
intentionally make and use illegal copies.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Boulton, director of Autodesk's Piracy Prevention
Department, said that for every copy of her company's AutoCAD
professional design program sold, investigators are finding seven
illegal copies in use. One reason is the high price of AutoCAD,
which costs $3,750 per user.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a court order, we get a federal marshal, we go in, pull
everyone away from their computers and go through each machine in
the business checking hard drives against records for what's
supposed to be there,'' Boulton said. ``In many cases, we're
finding 20 or more'' illegal copies at a single company.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Autodesk announced a settlement with General
Precision Inc., a Valencia environmental-control-systems
manufacturer. Autodesk sued GPI after it discovered 20 illegal
copies of AutoCAD during a raid at the company. GPI agreed to pay
Autodesk $120,000 in fines plus the cost of new software.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In five years, the BSA has collected more than $30 million in
fines from the likes of Budget Rent-a-Car and the Los Angeles
Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pay their taxes, they obey occupational health and safety
acts, but they have a blind spot when it comes to software
copyright compliance,'' Kruger said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft in particular has become more aggressive in going
after corporate pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the Redmond, Wash., software company announced
lawsuits against seven Texas firms, alleging infringement of
Microsoft copyrights after investigations by the company and law
enforcement agencies turned up counterfeit copies of Windows 95 and
Office Professional 97 at swap meets in the Dallas and Houston
areas.
</P>
<P>
   And in the past two months, Microsoft has sued a dozen computer
firms and stores in Southern California, North Carolina and Arizona
for distributing illegal software.
</P>
<P>
   In most of those cases, Microsoft alleged that resellers loaded
illegal copies of software into computers they sold, a process
known as hard-drive loading.
</P>
<P>
   Some targets say Microsoft is overzealous. Ron Carroll and
Katherine Everett, who own a used-computer franchise in Charlotte,
N.C., were sued by Microsoft for allegedly loading a laptop with a
counterfeit Office 97 program for a Microsoft investigator posing
as a customer.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Summa, a Charlotte attorney representing the married couple,
said his clients didn't know the software was counterfeit.
</P>
<P>
   Summa complained that he was working on a settlement with
Microsoft but believes Microsoft publicized its suit last month to
coincide with anti-piracy ads the BSA was running in local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kruger said the BSA and software companies are only trying
to protect what rightfully belongs to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out there to be cowboys,'' Kruger said. ``A lot of
people associate what we're doing with picking on people. We are
victims of a rather serious problem that threatens to undermine an
important industry.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Microsoft also helped Westminster police Detective Frank crack
the counterfeit ring.
</P>
<P>
   Frank didn't think that he would run into the underworld when he
received the original citizen's tip in May 1997, forwarded from
Microsoft's anti-piracy hotline, that someone was trying to print
copies of a Windows 95 manual at a Westminster print shop.
</P>
<P>
   Frank went in with a search warrant and uncovered evidence that
two other shops were printing manuals. The investigators for
Frank's small, 105-officer Westminster police department kept
following the leads and were able to penetrate the lower five
levels of an eight-level organization designed to keep other levels
secret even if one level was exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The counterfeiting would take place in different locations:
Microsoft software was duplicated on CD-ROM replicating machines in
one spot, and some 16,000 operating manuals were copied at print
shops in Westminster and Garden Grove. Fake registration cards and
certificates of authenticity were produced in another location.
</P>
<P>
   The packages then were assembled, shrink-wrapped and sold in
small retail outlets, but they also were shipped to countries like
Australia, Canada, England and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Potential buyers sometimes would have to bring an empty truck to
a parking lot and turn the keys over to the software pirates, who
would drive the truck to another location, pick up the goods and
return them to the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Police also recovered lists with ``hundreds'' of customers,
Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to a narcotics operation, ``there were a lot of
hand-to-hand buys, lots of cash, lots of moving around, rental
houses, changing drivers,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Police confiscated about $3 million worth of counterfeit
software during a raid at one house. Dummy bank accounts and shell
companies hid paper trails, but Frank said police had information
that ``people at the highest portions of the organization were
shipping a half-million dollars a month to banks in Taiwan and the
People's Republic of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said the counterfeiting was part of a Chinese syndicate
but also involved Laotian and Vietnamese immigrants. The
investigation is still open, but so far, 11 people have been
convicted on federal counterfeiting charges stemming from the case,
Frank said. Federal indictments also were returned against three
other people who are believed to be somewhere in Asia, Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Investigators have on rare occasions encountered dangerous
situations in software piracy cases. In 1995, investigators joining
police looking into a case of counterfeit Microsoft software raided
a home that had an AK-47 rifle and plastic explosives, said
Microsoft attorney Anne Murphy, who heads that company's
anti-piracy unit.
</P>
<P>
   Other investigations have turned up smaller operations. ``We did
one this year in Indianapolis where an individual was
counterfeiting software and selling it at the Indiana state
fairgrounds,'' the Autodesk investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   In a case cracked in 1995, a Southern California man sold
pirated Autodesk AutoCAD for as low as $500 by advertising in free
newspapers or selling at convenience store parking lots. The man
once made a deal out of the back of his old Honda at a shopping
center in Corte Madera.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk kept track because some of the customers would try to
register the software, which carried the same registration code,
only to learn that it was counterfeit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did they think they were buying?'' the Autodesk
investigator said. ``Autodesk does not sell products through flea
markets or auctions or 7-Eleven parking lots.''
</P>
<P>
   Pirates who advertise their wares on the Internet also pose a
problem, and some software companies have investigators who
constantly are scouring the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a case right now that is driving us to
distraction,'' said Sandra Boulton, Autodesk's director of piracy
prevention. In this case, a pirate in Russia selling through the
Web seems to appear ``everywhere'' but may be difficult to
prosecute because intellectual-property-rights laws aren't as
strong there, she said.

   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentloes reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly large
difference between Florida State (no. 1) and Tennessee (2), and a
much smaller difference between Tennessee (2) and Kansas State (3).

   NEW YORK _ In late July, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani began shutting
down strip clubs, and over the next month, the Dow Jones industrial
average plunged 1,500 points. In September, a court ruling gave
some clubs a partial reprieve, whereupon the market began to
recover. Last Wednesday, a strip club won another round in court,
and the Dow surged 250 points the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Mere coincidences? The mayor apparently thinks so, since he is
continuing his dangerous crusade. But the stripper-Dow connection
is all too obvious to those versed in the scientific literature of
endocrinology. The market plummeted in August _ and will plummet
again if Giuliani prevails _ because of a testosterone drought.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon was demonstrated by Emory University researchers
who studied the closest scientific approximation of New York's
financial district: a group of rhesus monkeys competing for status
in a confined space. When one male defeated another in a contest
over a female, the testosterone level rose in the winner and fell
dramatically in the loser, who would subsequently cower in the
winner's presence.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a quick cure if, when the winner was not around,
the loser got a glimpse of a sexually receptive female monkey. His
testosterone level promptly rose. It surged even though he had no
chance of having sex because he was in a cage looking out at an
unobtainable female _ the closest scientific approximation of a guy
looking at a stripper.
</P>
<P>
   ``One implication of the study,'' explained Dr. Kim Wallen, a
psychologist at Emory's Yerkes Primate Center, ``is that strip bars
are popular because male losers can retreat there to raise their
testosterone levels.''
</P>
<P>
   This finding has vital economic implications because
testosterone promotes feelings of well-being and helps people
concentrate on tasks. Although it is popularly blamed for causing
dangerous aggression, like the ``roid rage'' said to afflict
athletes on steroids, scientists say this is largely a myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testosterone doesn't make guys go out raping and pillaging,''
Dr. Wallen said. ``It generally makes them feel self-confident and
ready to take on the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes them feel like Mark McGwire, who did so much for the
St. Louis economy while raising his testosterone with pills. Think
of him losing his concentration and confidence, or of those
cowering monkeys, and you see the risks of the mayor's crackdown.
When Wall Street's masters of the universe lose focus and turn
skittish, they bring down the Dow and the rest of the city's
economy. When they're cowering, how can realty agents hope to sell
them two-bedroom apartments for seven figures?
</P>
<P>
   Wallen declined to speculate on the stripper-Dow connection _ he
has his academic reputation to consider _ but he noted that this
might be a good time for women to get ahead on Wall Street. Their
levels of testosterone are more stable than men's, which is one
reason they do not need to go to strip clubs after a bad day in the
market. Male losers are in a bind, though, especially the recently
laid-off Wall Streeters who need a boost of testosterone to find a
new job.
</P>
<P>
   Some strip clubs are staying open by putting bikinis on their
dancers, but customers are unhappy, which jibes with the results of
another study of primate behavior. In this experiment with baboons,
researchers found that the male voyeurs were highly selective and a
bit simple-minded.
</P>
<P>
   The baboon voyeurs did not respond to just any female. The
female baboon had to appear to be in heat, which the researchers
simulated by attaching a red plastic mold to her rear. As with men
at a strip club, it took a crude illusion of sexual receptivity to
jolt their endocrine systems.
</P>
<P>
   If clothes on a dancer ruin that illusion, where can male losers
get a boost of testosterone? The only quick alternative suggested
by the primate research is to win a fight with another man. ``New
Yorkers,'' Wallen said, ``might want to consider which is socially
preferable, a place where guys go to look at naked women, or a
place where they go to beat up other guys?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a perilous choice, as Giuliani's own role model
demonstrated with tragic consequences. The last time a righteous
mayor crusaded to close down strip joints, New York endured a long
testosterone drought known as the Great Depression, and it took a
world war to get the economy moving again. Fiorello H. La Guardia
thought those were just coincidences, too.

Lights! Camera! Browsing?
<P>
   Don't look now, but the Internet is becoming as influential in
Tinseltown as Siskel &AMP; Ebert, Pauline Kael and Janet Maslin all
spliced into one.
</P>
<P>
   It is playing a leading role in the way movies are packaged,
previewed and hyped.
</P>
<P>
   Movie studios have always attempted to control the flow of
information about movies before they're released. By carefully
leaking tidbits to hand-picked reporters, studios could build up a
crescendo of interest in their projects designed to peak just as
the film premieres.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of relying on outside media to get their story
right, they can leak it themselves onto their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Lucasfilm Ltd. in San Rafael have crafted the
perfect publicity machine for hyping its highly anticipated prequel
to the sci-fi epic ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   In late September, the splashy site ( &LR; www.starwars.com &LR; )
revealed the name of the new movie, ``Star Wars: Episode I: The
Phantom Menace,'' and its release date, May 21, 1999. A video diary
documents the making of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable that ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas,
given his penchant for privacy and his love of technology, is the
biggest movie mogul exploiter of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many Web sites and speculation about `Star
Wars,''' Lucasfilm spokeswoman Lynne Hale said. ``Sometimes, our
fans don't know what's true. This is the authoritative place for
details about all of the `Star Wars' installments and a way to keep
in touch with our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Gus Van Zant Jr.'s remake of the Alfred Hitchcock classic
``Psycho'' doesn't enjoy as much media interest as ``Star Wars,''
so Universal Studios is employing a different online tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it became the first studio to debut promotional
trailers on computer screens instead of movie screens. The
90-second collage of video clips and sound bites, available at
 &LR; www.psychomovies.com &LR; , is a stunning promotional ad for the
feature, set to debut December 4.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Internet also has spawned a new breed of gossip
columnists hell-bent on breaking any piece of entertainment news,
however insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't It Cool News'' ( &LR; www.aint-it-cool-news.com &LR; ) is the
``Drudge Report'' of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Run by Harry Knowles, the site leaks casting choices, script
passages and secret screening results about Hollywood's biggest
movies-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles, a twentysomething college dropout from Austin, Texas,
started the site in February 1996 after a back injury left him
bedridden for months.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles was the first to report that, based on early screenings,
the movie ``Titanic'' might not sink. He's had repeated scoops on
the new Star Wars movie and a rumored Indiana Jones picture.
</P>
<P>
   Based on early screenings, he also predicted (correctly) that
``Soldier'' and ``The Postman'' would be box-office
disappointments. His reaction to a rough cut of the
soon-to-be-released ``A Bug's Life'': ``A charming film, a likable
film. I just don't love it.'' Knowles' site, which attracts more
than 500,000 viewers a day, has begat sequels, including Dark
Horizons ( &LR; www.darkhorizons.com &LR; ), which posted excerpts of the
``Halloween H20'' script, and ZENtertainment
( &LR; www.zentertainment.com &LR; ), which counts details of new Doors and
Superman movies among its scoops.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Jordan, proprietor of ZENtertainment, said he sees his job
as ``news informer, not spoiler of secrets.'' The 25-year-old Santa
Clarita (Los Angeles County) resident also has a job in marketing
at New Line Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   _Site of the week: And you thought Rex Reed  &LR; was &LR;  curmudgeonly?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cranky ( &LR; www.mrcranky.com &LR; ) has one bad attitude, but one
fun movie site. Instead of stars, its scathing reviews bestow
bombs, ranging from 1 (``almost tolerable'') to 4 (``as good as a
poke in the eye with a sharp stick'').
</P>
<P>
   A stick of dynamite is reserved for cinematic endeavors ``so
godawful that it ruptured the very fabric of space and time with
the sheer overpowering force of its mediocrity,'' according to Hans
Bjordahl, the Boulder, Colo., co-creator of Mr. Cranky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Avengers,'' was the latest film to receive the dubious
dynamite award.

 CHRON - RICE  
 DONNA RICE SAYS NO EXCUSES FOR NET PORN  &HT;     By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Donna Rice Hughes spends a lot of her time leading reporters and
legislators through the Internet's red-light district.
<P>
   From a hotel room in St. Louis, where she is promoting her new
book, ``Kids Online,'' Rice Hughes took this reporter on a tour of
some of the Web's smuttiest sites, all of &LR;  ones which are freely
accessible to minors.
</P>
<P>
   The images are jarring _ one Web site depicts women in sexual
positions with snakes and horses; most are too lurid to describe in
print. One reporter threw up after ``surfing'' the Net's
netherworld with her, Rice Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice Hughes calls this ``porno stash'' her most effective weapon
in her quest to shield children from cybersmut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't airbrushed stuff you find in Playboy. It is
hard-core pornography of bestiality, pedophiles and violence,''
said Rice Hughes, who is vice president of marketing for Enough is
Enough, an anti-obscenity organization in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Donna Rice was something of a household name when she
was captured in what she calls ``the old lap photo'' _ photographed
on the knee of Gary Hart, a married presidential candidate, aboard
a Caribbean yacht named Monkey Business. Hart, then a U.S. senator,
saw his campaign self-destruct after Rice, then a Miami model, was
caught spending the night in his townhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Rice Hughes, 40, is a nationally recognized leader in the
battle against online pornography. As one Beltway sage wryly
observed, lawmakers now court her for support, not romance. And
she, not Hart, speaks before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donna Rice Hughes has been on the forefront of the battle to
make the Internet safe for our children,'' said Senator Dan Coats,
R-Ind., another crusader against online porn.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, head of America Online, calls Rice Hughes ``a
tireless advocate for children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a key voice in the debate over how we best build this
new medium and make it a safe place for families,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rice Hughes is a major force behind a new law that would
require commercial cybersmut peddlers to establish age-verification
systems to keep out minors.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Online Protection Act, part of a $500 billion
spending package signed last month by President Clinton, levies
criminal penalties of up to $50,000 in fines and six months in jail
on commercial Web sites that allow anyone under 18 access to
pornographic material deemed ``harmful to minors.'' In addition, it
mandates that commercial sex sites require a credit card or
personal ID number to ensure that only adults can access them. If
not, the sites must pay state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Rice Hughes and her supporters want the same laws
that protect kids from print pornography extended to the
Internet, &UR;  &LR; without infringing the First Amendment privileges of
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most minors are more computer-literate than adults,'' said
Rice Hughes, who is stepmother to two children, now 17 and 20.
``They have free and easy access to deviant stuff their parents
couldn't find in an XXX-rated book store.''
</P>
<P>
   By her own admission, Rice Hughes might seem an unlikely person
to wage war against smut.
</P>
<P>
   After the Hart imbroglio, she served briefly as a spokeswoman
for ``No Excuses'' jeans and then ``went underground'' for seven
years _ in Los Angeles and later in McLean, Va. She eschewed
interviews and kiss-and-tell book offers as she pieced together her
life.
</P>
<P>
   Her carefully cultivated Southern perfectionism _ Bible-reading
Christian, biology major at the University of South Carolina, Phi
Beta Kappa, head college cheerleader, pharmaceutical sales rep,
model, actress (small parts in ``Dallas'' and ``Miami Vice'') _ had
been obliterated by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donna was hunted and frantic at the time; everything she ever
wanted was or had been stripped away from her,'' said Mary Doremus,
who with her husband and two children lived with Rice from 1988
until 1992. ``She struggled through excruciating pain those four
years and eventually fought to become a major success. Donna's
story is about redemption.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came in 1993, when she married Jack Hughes, a
high-tech consultant, and met Dee Jepsen, then-president of Enough
is Enough.
</P>
<P>
   Although few people at that time had heard of the Internet,
Jepsen already saw it as a major new distributor of pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Jepsen talked to Rice about the ``rape myth,'' a belief held by
some that women who say no to a sexual advance really mean yes.
Jepsen, and others, believe that pornography is a major contributor
to the rape myth.
</P>
<P>
   Jepsen's views clicked with Rice, who said she had been
date-raped by a friend in college and believed that incident led to
her ``destructive'' relationships with Hart and others, including
musician Don Henley and Prince Albert of Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1994, Rice Hughes went to work for Jepsen. At first,
``it seemed like the opposite of everything I wanted to do,
especially after coming from a sexually stigmatized past,'' Rice
Hughes said. But she became passionate about the work because she
said she didn't want other women to go through what she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed by her demeanor and intelligence,'' Jepsen
said of Rice Hughes. ``It seemed an unlikely match because of her
background. But this woman seemed to have pulled herself
together,'' said Jepsen, who is married to former Senator Lee
Jepsen, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Rice Hughes made her public re-emergence. At a news
conference in a U.S. Senate building, she addressed a phalanx of
reporters about the dangers of Internet porn.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a conservative suit, ponytail and glasses, she went
largely unrecognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only got a few `didn't-you-used-to-be?' looks,'' Hughes
said. ``I guess they expected someone with long, flowing hair
wearing a red bathing suit.''
</P>
<P>
   But her appearance sparked a loud debate about kids and online
porn.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Rice Hughes estimates that she has given 1,400
interviews and hundreds of cybersmut tours. Her book, ``Kids
Online,'' was published in September.
</P>
<P>
   Her efforts helped drum up support for former Nebraska Senator
James Exon's bill on pornography, the genesis of the 1996
Communications Decency Act.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the CDA  &LR; act
unconstitutional last year, Rice Hughes played an instrumental role
in framing its legislative sequel, the Child Online Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   COPA ``is not going to obliterate pornography on the Web,'' she
concedes, ``but it holds those who are profitable, the operators of
commercial porn sites, responsible for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   That rankles many, who consider Rice Hughes' intentions
honorable but unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier
Foundation, and &UR;  &LR; Electronic Privacy Information Center &UR;  &LR; filed a
lawsuit last month in federal court in Philadelphia, alleging that
the bill stifles the free exchange of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threshold for harmful-to-minor standards has to be my
computer, not the federal government,'' said Representative
Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach. ``Dumbing the Internet down so it
is suitable for my 5-year-old is not the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the divisive issue, Cox and others have a healthy
respect for Rice Hughes. ``She is a good spokeswoman who knows the
topic and has been deeply committed for a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has kind words for Rice
Hughes. ``The most civil, nice person I've ever talked to who was
anti-pornography,'' he told the Washington Times during a recent
interview.

 CHRON - RICE SIDE  
 RICE'S ADVICE TO MONICA LEWINSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY JON SWARTZ &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even though they've never met, Donna Rice Hughes and Monica
Lewinsky have much in common.
</P>
<P>
   Both were whipsawed by political sex scandals and then deluged
with interview requests and offers to cash in on their notoriety.
And both largely shunned the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Rice Hughes, who weathered her media onslaught by going
underground for seven years, said she would ``certainly have a lot
of private advice'' for the former White House intern ``if she
sought it out and wanted an empathetic ear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell anyone in her position to consider the long-term
consequences and take the high road of dignity and integrity,''
said Rice Hughes, who turned down $1 million for a Playboy
interview (sans nude photos), an ABC-TV movie of the week and news
and acting jobs from CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some told their stories and chose celebrity. That was their
choice,'' she said. ``If you want to make a lot of money and soothe
your pain in that way, that's fine. It just wasn't my choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was important to me was to have long-term credibility and
not cash in,'' she said. ``The hardest path is just saying no.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice Hughes &UR;  &LR; received a five-figure sum as spokeswoman for ``No
Excuses'' jeans shortly after the 1987 scandal with Senator Gary
Hart. (She has never said whether or not she slept with the former
presidential candidate.)
</P>
<P>
   She calls two interviews she did with ABC's Barbara Walters in
1987 as among the best decisions she made. ``It was the perfect
forum to show people who I really am,'' she said. ``I can't thank
Barbara enough for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Lewinsky reportedly is close to reaching a deal to
be interviewed by Walters on ABC's ``20/20'' news program.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Lewinsky decides to do, she at least will have the
option of learning from others' mistakes, according to Rice Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems I had was that no one had been in my shoes
before,'' she said. ``No one understood the choices. I was a
pioneer, I guess.''

 &HT;    GOP split puts inquiry in question
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The warm-up act for President Clinton's impeachment
inquiry begins today at a time when House Republicans are in
disarray over the departure of Speaker Newt Gingrich and Democrats
are scrambling to take advantage of a headless adversary.
</P>
<P>
   A Judiciary subcommittee will hear legal scholars testify on the
history of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans jockeying for position in the new leadership circle
have been using the proceedings as a bargaining chip to win votes
among the 223 House Republicans. But they face a nettlesome issue:
How to handle an impeachment process, opposed by much of the
public, that they started and can't seem to stop?
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr said Gingrich's departure would
not stop the impeachment train and the inquiry would continue. ``We
have an obligation to present this clearly and consistently, not to
just throw it on the table and walk away from it,'' said Barr, a
member of the House Judiciary Committee. That panel must determine
whether Clinton lied, obstructed justice or tampered with witnesses
in concealing his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, trying to end hearings that could remove the
president, see Gingrich's departure as an opportunity to push for
an expeditious end to the impeachment quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public simply won't countenance a presidential coup d'etat
led by men with the blood of Newt Gingrich on their hands,'' said
Jim Jordan, spokesman for Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.
``In significant part, Gingrich's overthrow was caused by
recognition in the Republican caucus that the leadership had badly
misgauged public opinion on impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   And against this partisan backdrop looms the possibility that
Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr would send over a
second referral to the House Judiciary Committee, delivering new
evidence of impeachable crimes from his four-year investigation of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, it would almost certainly prolong the
committee's inquiry past Illinois Republican Chairman Henry Hyde's
Dec. 31 deadline and push the proceedings into the next congress,
which convenes in January. If Starr's office does not refer new
charges, Hyde said he would seek a vote on articles of impeachment
and then request a full House vote by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gingrich as the sitting speaker would be the one to
call the House back into session. Under this scenario, his last act
would be to preside over a floor vote on action against a president
whose career has teetered as often as his own.
</P>
<P>
   At today's hearing of the constitutional subcommittee of the
full committee, Atlanta attorney Griffin Bell will be among the 19
legal scholars testifying about the history of impeachment. The
panel will address what constitutes an impeachable crime.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars, split down party lines, are expected to bring
history and context to a process that has been marked by bitter
partisan rancor.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, an attorney at King &AMP; Spaulding, will testify that ``an
impeachment inquiry should be used rarely, and when it is used, it
should be limited to indictable crimes that relate to a president's
ability to carry out his duties effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared remarks, Bell notes that fewer than 20
impeachment attempts have occurred since the ratification of the
Constitution, with the vast majority having been brought against
federal judges. Only two have been brought against a president and
no president has ever been removed.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell, who was attorney general in President Carter's
administration, also wrote ``a president cannot faithfully execute
the laws if he himself is breaking them. Since this is such a
fundamental concept, an impeaching body might well limit itself to
inquiring into allegations of conduct that clearly constitutes a
high crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without this limitation on the inquiry, the process could be
viewed as politically driven and arguably outside the bounds of the
Constitution,'' Bell wrote. ``Congress should be at pains to spare
the nation a debate over partisanship in assessing the validity of
charges involving felonious conduct by the president.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of 400 legal scholars issued a report Friday saying the
case against Clinton falls short of proving the president committed
impeachable crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Low Bloch, one of today's witnesses and an organizer of
the report, said lowering the threshold for impeachment would
weaken the institution of the presidency. ``If the president could
be removed for any conduct of which Congress disapproved, this
fundamental element of our democracy _ the president's independence
from Congress _ would be destroyed,'' stated a letter to the House
Republican and Democratic leaders signed by Bloch and other legal
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida Republican Charles Canady, the chairman of the
subcommittee, disagrees with Bloch's assessment of what is an
impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main purpose of the impeachment power is to
preserve the rule of law,'' Canady said. ``If a president commits
perjury or obstructs justice he has attacked the rule of law and
has violated his oath and is guilty of an impeachable offense ...
based on the evidence we have now, there is a strong case that the
president is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice as
well.''

 &HT;    Fight to fill Gingrich's job begins
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Henry Farber
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The void created by House Speaker Newt Gingrich's departure
sparked a high-stakes power struggle Sunday for the top posts in
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   With rumors flying about possible successors to Gingrich,
lawmakers took to Sunday TV talk shows to unveil their candidacies
and campaign for speaker, majority leader and conference committee
chairman. A leading contender to replace Gingrich is Louisiana
Republican Bob Livingston, whom Gingrich hand-picked over more
senior members to chair the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his longtime friendship with Gingrich, Livingston struck
a decidedly anti-Gingrich theme on ABC's ``This Week with Sam
Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   Contending Congress under Gingrich took too many holidays and
did not pass enough legislation, Livingston said, ``I'm running as
a leader and as a manager, and I intend to change that and make
sure we never make that mistake again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to do under my speakership, if my friends will
elect me speaker, is not only articulate the message, but to
provide the legislative machinery that it takes to back it up and
put it through Congress and write it into law,'' said Livingston,
vowing to work with House Democrats to achieve his goal.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said he has 100 commitments for his speakership, 12
shy of a majority within the 223-member Republican caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Far removed from the political maneuvering he set into motion,
Gingrich visited his ailing mother in Mechanicsburg, Pa. Sunday.
Talking to reporters before he went in, Gingrich said he has given
no thought to running for president and will discuss his political
future Monday night in Washington at a meeting of GOPAC, the
Republican fund-raising group he once headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next couple of years I want to be an active citizen in
public life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News poll released Sunday showed two-to-one popular
support for Gingrich's departure. Respondents were nearly unanimous
for reducing partisanship in Congress. Overall, 58 percent
disapproved of how Gingrich handled his job. The telephone poll of
503 adults was conducted Nov. 7 and had a margin of error of 4.5
points.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gingrich's congressional seat, which represents much of
metro Atlanta's northside suburbs, at least two candidates wasted
no time announcing their candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Hatfield, a Republican health care executive who received
2 percent of the vote in the July primary race for governor, and
Gary ``Bats'' Pelphrey, a Democratic lawyer who took 31 percent
against Gingrich on Tuesday, said Sunday they will join the long
list of candidates expected to announce.
</P>
<P>
   State school board Chairman Johnny Isakson, regarded as a
leading Republican contender for the seat, was in California over
the weekend, but Hatfield said Isakson told him he will announce
early this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield added that many potential candidates are waiting for
Gingrich to submit a resignation letter to Gov. Zell Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans who are considered possible contenders include
unsuccessful lieutenant governor candidates Chuck Clay and Clint
Day, state Rep. Mitch Kaye, Cobb commission Chairman Bill Byrne,
former Christian Coalition leader Jerry Keen and former Gingrich
aide John McCallum, who was defeated in the race for secretary of
state last week by Cathy Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible Democratic candidates include former U.S. Rep.
Buddy Darden and Michael Coles, who lost Tuesday in a race against
U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the strongest challenge to Livingston for the
speaker's post comes from California Republican Chris Cox, the
party's policy committee chairman and head of the on-going
investigation into whether national security was placed at risk
when high tech information was transferred to China.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who more than Livingston appeals to the party's social
conservatives, said on CBS's ``Face the Nation'' the race for
speaker is ``about policy over politics.'' He advocates overhauling
the GOP legislative agenda, saying it has failed to muster enough
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just about who is going to be the next speaker of
the House, it's about the direction of the country,'' Cox said. As
Republicans vie for leadership posts, the Democrats are sitting in
the background in a noticeably quiet fashion. In fact, with all of
the intraparty squabbling over who will take over, the Democrats
have been able to portray themselves as the party of comity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans decide who their leaders are, we don't, I
don't,'' said Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) ``What I
want is for us to work together, in the House, to solve the
people's problems . . . to solve the problems that people really
worry about, healthcare, education, social security.''

 CHRON - DIGITAL BAY  
 FOR LONGTIME PROGRAMMER, EVERYTHING OLD BECOMES NEW AGAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY TOM ABATE &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Peter Harris started programming computers when Harry Truman was in
the White House. After nearly 50 years as a code-warrior, Harris
still bangs out new programs every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes say I'm America's senior programmer because I
don't think a lot of people from back then are still programming,''
said Harris, 68, who began as a key-punch operator in college.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Harris is president of ADPAC Corp., a downtown San
Francisco firm that sells software to fix the Year 2000 problem on
mainframe computers.
</P>
<P>
   As has been widely reported, when the first computer code was
written in the 1950s, programmers used two digits representing the
year in order to save space. This programming shortcut was never
changed. Now, with 2000 just around the corner, corporations are
scrambling to find and fix the date lines  &LR; dates in the computer
code, lest their programs conclude that ``00'' refers to 1900 and
wreak all sorts of havoc on humankind.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, this glitch has extended Harris' career. After
taking a back seat to the PC whiz kids, old programmers like him
suddenly are back in demand _ to fix the problems they helped
create.
</P>
<P>
   Harris sells a program that performs a search-and-replace
function on mainframe programs, looking for two-digit dates and
helping correct them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course you might think that business can last a year or two,
but what then? Harris, who founded ADPAC in 1963, already is
scoping out new opportunities. Mergers, for instance, provide
fertile ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these banks and financial institutions have combined, and
suddenly, they realize all their code has just three digits for
branch offices when they have thousands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a great job for Harris' search-and-replace tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies have 50 years' of investment in some of these
programs, and they'll still be around 50 years from now,'' said
Harris, who is grooming successors to take over when he finally
writes his last line of code.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've got a few years left,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MOUSEKETEERS:As long as we're looking back, it was 30 years ago
that Doug Engelbart and his colleagues at the Stanford Research
Institute first showed off the mouse and other innovations that
would change computing.
</P>
<P>
   On December 9, Engelbart will be honored at a daylong public
symposium at Stanford University's Memorial Auditorium. The event,
organized by Paul Saffo, with the Institute for the Future in Menlo
Park, will raise money to help build Stanford's Silicon Valley
Archives.
</P>
<P>
   The archive, which already has Engelbart's research papers along
with files from the early days of Apple Computer Inc., is trying to
create a central repository for documents that scholars and
historians could use to study Silicon Valley. For tickets and other
information, visit http:// &LR; unrev.stanford.edu/. &LR;

   SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW:Digital artists from the United
States, Europe and Asia will flock to San Francisco this week for
the Invision Awards. Sponsored by New Media Magazine, the awards
will honor the best Web sites, animations, CD-ROMs and other
digital creations.
</P>
<P>
   The event kicks off with a Wednesday night reception at the
Museum of Modern Art, hosted by curator David Ross. About 1,000
people are expected at Thursday night's awards dinner at the Argent
(formerly the ANA) Hotel. If you haven't gotten an invitation but
would like to see what digital art is all about, event organizer
Hal Josephson said the Argent will open its Playland Galley for a
free public showing Friday from 3 to 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   PECKING ORDER:This irrelevant news just in: John Chambers, chief
executive of Cisco Systems, has edged out Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates as tech's top titan in Upside Magazine's new Elite 100 list.
</P>
<P>
   But the real shocker is: There are only 98 people in the list
because Steve Jobs is considered so awesome that he rates three
separate mentions: once as the fifth-ranked titan, once as top
hardware leader, and a third time as top dog in digital
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Of course lists like this are arbitrary and meaningless _
unless you happen to be on or off. Thus, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison
finds himself no longer among the titans as he was last year, while
Philippe Kahn, who flamed out with Borland International, finds
himself lauded as a software guru for founding Starfish Software,
then selling it to Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Not even pundits are spared these comparisons, as Walter
Mossberg, personal technology columnist for the Wall Street
Journal, is supplanted by New York Times reporter John Markoff as
top prognosticator. Meanwhile, yours truly draws not even an
honorable mention. Maybe I should phone Larry and see if he wants
to go out and tie one on together!

 CHRON - NTI  
 NEUROBIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN LIFE-OR-DEATH FIGHT TO FIND CASH
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY TOM ABATE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Neurobiological Technologies Inc. is nearly as sick as the
patients it would like to serve.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech company has raised _ and spent _ nearly $33 million
and has been delisted by the Nasdaq for having weak cash reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Now burning its last two months of operating capital, it needs
$6 million to complete clinical trials on a drug called Memantine
that shows promise of relieving nervous disorders associated with
AIDS and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   CEO Paul Freiman, an industry veteran who took over last May,
admitted that NTI is a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an 11-year-old company that has a track record of
failure,'' said Freiman, who nevertheless hopes some angel
investor, healthy biotech firm or pharmaceutical giant will provide
the cash to keep NTI alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of biotech companies rolling in cash who have
only a concept,'' Freiman said. ``We have two promising late-stage
trials, including the only possible treatment for AIDS-related
dementia.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Roberts, a biotech investment banker with Warburg
Dillon Read in New York, cautioned that only one in five drugs in
late clinical trials ever make it to market.
</P>
<P>
   Added Julia Gregory, biotech specialist at Punk Ziegel &AMP; Co.:
``There are a lot of sick companies out there. Some of them need to
go out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   But NTI's life-or-death struggle will take on a special drama
Thursday. AIDS activists are expected to attend its annual
shareholders meeting in San Francisco to urge that whatever happens
to the company, some way should be found to continue the clinical
trials on using Memantine to treat AIDS dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Jacobson, who heads the Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Unit
at UCSF-San Francisco General Hospital, said about 90 people with
AIDS dementia currently are being given Memantine to see if the
drug alleviates the conditions of near senility that can afflict
some AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a promising mechanism, but it's too early to tell,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Price, a professor of neurology at the University of
California at San Francisco, also is associated with the Memantine
trials. He said researchers don't know what causes AIDS dementia or
how many people with HIV will become afflicted with dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Price said there also is debate about whether the dementia will
be cured by the so-called AIDS cocktails that have been successful
in suppressing the life-threating symptoms of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   One school of thought says treating the virus will prevent the
dementia, while another school says a second pill is needed to
solely treat the dementia, Price said.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, because no one can say which theory is correct,
Price said the Memantine trials should continue. He isn't sure what
would happen if NTI runs out of cash before the scientists deliver
their answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the company were to go out of business and the trial would
prove successful, you'd have something that would be tantalizing
but would have no commercial outfit to see it through,'' Price
said.
</P>
<P>
   If NTI does go belly up, it will have only itself to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1987 by former UCSF psychiatry professor Enoch
Callaway, the company raised money to investigate treatments for
neurological disorders. The company went public in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But most of its early research proved fruitless. It was not
until 1995 that NTI even began work with the Memantine compound on
which it now pins its hopes. Last spring, when its cash fell below
the Nasdaq minimum, the company was delisted.
</P>
<P>
   Freiman, who took over shortly thereafter, cut the staff from 22
to 11. He focused all the company's cash on Memantine, which also
is being tested as a pain reliever for diabetics who get unbearable
nerve tinglings, a condition called diabetic neuropathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 800,000 patients in the United States,'' Freiman
said. ``It's a marketing man's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Robbins-Roth, an analyst with BioVenture Consulting in
San Mateo, said Freiman is well regarded in the industry. As an
executive of Syntex Corp., he played an instrumental role in that
company's $5 billion sale to Roche Holdings. As former chairman of
the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association, he has contacts to
the cash-rich drug companies that could step in to rescue NTI.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done some remarkable rebuilding, but it's a tough
situation,'' said Robbins-Roth. ``He's trying to rescue the company
in a down market. It would be a shame if they didn't make it
because it's the patients who lose.''

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last year, USC quietly got Oregon State to make a
slight change in the 1998 schedule. The Trojans convinced the
Beavers to move their game up from Nov. 14 to Sept. 19. It made
sense to Oregon State, because it meant the Beavers wouldn't have
to play UCLA and USC back to back.
</P>
<P>
   It made even more sense to the Trojans. They would get a
much-needed weekend off before playing archrivals UCLA and Notre
Dame, teams they haven't swept since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Little could they imagine how propitious the schedule change
turned out to be. It not only gives wide receiver R. Jay Soward a
chance to rest his severely sprained ankle, it gives the rest of
the team a chance to, uh, well, rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (7-3, 5-2) are certainly ready for a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road,'' linebacker David Gibson said. ``We've
been playing since August.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though USC might be playing better than it has all season,
it could use a minivacation to ease the physical and emotional
strain. Following Saturday's 34-9 victory over Stanford, for the
first time, the Trojans were able to erase some of the sting of the
two tough losses to California and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two (conference) losses we took are still lingering in
the back of my head,'' wide receiver Billy Miller said. ``But it's
a little further back there now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a small exhale but not too long of one.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if the Trojans had not blown a 21-point lead to Cal, or
been able to make two short field goals in their 17-13 loss to
Oregon. Next week's city championship would be a matchup of two
top-10 teams. But even without that added feature, there's enough
motivation for USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go in there and destroy their whole season,''
cornerback Daylon McCutcheon said. ``That's what rivalry football
is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, he'll gladly take the bye. ``It's going to give us a
chance. A little extra time to prepare for them,'' McCutcheon said.
</P>
<P>
   The focus this week will no doubt be on Soward's ankle. Which
means something must be going right for the Trojans. The defense
has been dominating the past four games, allowing just 12.5 points.
And the offense seems to have stepped up a notch since freshman
Carson Palmer was given the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   As for Soward, he joked Saturday that he briefly used a pair of
crutches to make UCLA think he wouldn't be ready for the game, but
his availability is a real concern. It's fairly certain that for
this revival of USC's enthusiasm to sustain itself, the Trojans
need a healthy Soward.
</P>
<P>
   ``With R. Jay out, that takes our deep threat out,'' Palmer
said. ``It makes short passes difficult, because defensive backs
won't back up as much on the receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett eluded to that immediately after the
Stanford game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is to get the team (Soward?) healthy and
fresh and ready to play UCLA,'' Hackett said. ``Our focus is very
simple and it's four letters: UCLA. We're ready to do something the
last two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if Hackett works on some more psychological
material for next week. He already created a stir several weeks ago
when he said Oregon was the best team in the Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The remark was completely ignored by the Trojan players but
immediately brought a reaction in Westwood, and it wouldn't be
surprising if Hackett dropped another verbal bomb to create a
distraction. &QL; 
REPORT CARD &QL; 
GAME: 10 &QL; 
RESULT: USC 34, Stanford 9 &QL; 
RECORD: 7-3, 5-2
</P>
<P>
   THIS WEEK'S GPA: 3.38 &QL; 
CUMULATIVE GPA: 2.68 &QL; 
QUARTERBACKS: Carson Palmer completed 19 of 26 passes, with several
drops by receivers. It's time to take the reigns off the kid.
Grade: A- &QL; 
RUNNING BACKS: Here's the new policy. Chad Morton skips practice
during the week and just shows up for games. It sure seems a better
way to keep him healthy. Grade: B &QL; 
RECEIVERS: When R. Jay Soward went down, Larry Parker and Billy
Miller picked up the slack. But the Trojans lack a deep threat
without Soward in the game. Grade: B+ &QL; 
OFFENSIVE LINE: Maybe, just maybe, they really are improving. But
is it enough to make a difference in season-ending games with UCLA
and Notre Dame? Grade: B+ &QL; 
DEFENSIVE LINE: Aaron Williams forced a fumble, recovered two
others and scored a touchdown. He also helped the defensive line
drive quarterback Todd Husak crazy with pressure. Perhaps the best
game of season from the front four. Grade: A &QL; 
LINEBACKERS: Stanford ran and passed away from Chris Claiborne, but
Zeke Moreno (11 tackles) and David Gibson (eight) were just as
frustrating to the Cardinal. Grade: A &QL; 
DEFENSIVE BACKSd sslotTroy Walters was a nonfactor, as the Trojans'
secondary put in a superlative effort, limiting Husak to 138 yards
passing. Grade: A &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS: Adam Abrams got back on track, but the punting was
average, and a personal foul for roughing the punter kept
Stanford's only TD drive alive. Grade: C+ &QL; 
COACHING: The defensive coaches are the unsung heroes of the
season. At least the offense is improving. News flash: The Trojans
committed 10 more penalties. Grade: B

hundreds of towns are finding themselves cut off, unable to get
shipments of food or medicine and without clean water. With many
reservoirs fouled by runoff and dead animals throughout Honduras,
residents of the capital wait for water distributed by a local
hotel. (Suzanne DeChillo/New York Times Photo)

HURRICANE-CHRONOLOGY-2, 11-08 -- In Tegucigalpa, two missionaries,
Kolby Oswald from Idaho and David Hague from Utah, help to clean
out mud-swept homes. As the scope of the devastation from Hurricane
Mitch becomes clear, many Central Americans are wondering what has
hit them. No other hurricane in modern history has wreaked such
havoc and death in this region, no stranger to these tempests of
nature. (Suzanne DeChillo/New York Times Photo)

HURRICANE-CHRONOLOGY-1, 11-08 -- Along the Choluteca River, firemen
drag four newly found bodies to shore. Hundreds of Hondurans are
still missing after Hurricane Mitch stalled just off Honduras'
north coast for four days, dumping several feet of water on Central
America even as the storm lost power. No other hurricane in modern
history has wreaked such havoc and death in this region, no
stranger to these tempests of nature. (Suzanne DeChillo/New York

   (NYT3) LHASA, Tibet -- Nov. 08, 1998 -- TIBET-LAMA, 11-08 -- On
an old stone stairway outside the Potala Palace, the empty fortress
where the Dalai Lama once presided over Tibet, Chanchup Lhamo, 76,
navigates her way down a long procession of steps after coming to
pray. ``I always come carrying the hope that I will live long
enough to see the Dalai Lama here again,'' says Mrs. Lhamo. ``But I
am getting old, and now I am afraid I may never get the chance.''

-- A mouthful of antiqued balsamic vinegar, left, seems to give
nothing but pleasure at the Slow Food Festival in Turin. A glass of
wine, right, produces a quizzical glance. Slow Food's Salone del
Gusto, a five-day food fair, was begun by a group of leftist
intellectuals disenchanted by politics and disgusted by the
fast-food trend, and has in the last few years become fashionable
in Italy and throughout Europe. (James Hill/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT1) TURIN, Italy -- Nov. 08, 1998 -- ITALY-SLOWFOOD-1, 11-08
-- At the Slow Food Festival in Turin, cooks get ready to dish out
a Swabian dinner. Close to 100,000 people are expected to attend
Slow Food's Salone del Gusto, a five-day food fair, drawing
epicures dedicated to the languorous enjoyment of slowly prepared
regional delicacies. Slow Food, was begun by a group of leftist
intellectuals disenchanted by politics and disgusted by the
fast-food trend, and has in the last few years become fashionable
in Italy and throughout Europe. (James Hill/New York Times Photo)

   COUNTRY: Often called the Roof of the World, Tibet is more than
twice the size of France, and has large deposits of gold, copper
and radioactive ores.
</P>
<P>
   POPULATION: 2.4 million in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, which
does not cover the whole of the Tibetan plateau. All told, there
are 7 million Tibetans in China.
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY: A powerful kingdom for centuries, Tibet was ruled by a
Dalai Lama from the 17th century, but fell partly under Chinese
sway from 1720 until 1911, when Tibetans reasserted their
independence. After the Communists took power in China in 1949,
Tibet became a ``national autonomous region'' of China in 1951. The
Chinese suppressed a revolt in 1959, during which the current Dalai
Lama escaped to India. In 1965, the Tibetan Autonomous Region was
formally established. During the Cultural Revolution, thousands of
Tibetan monasteries were destroyed. The ban on the Tibetans'
religion was lifted in 1978, but they continue to chafe at Chinese
rule.

FIJI'S WIN MAKES AMENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Fiji gave jockey Kent Desormeaux, trainer Neil
Drysdale and owner Prince Fahd Salman of Saudi Arabia an impressive
victory Sunday at Santa Anita in the Yellow Ribbon Stakes,
sometimes referred to as the eighth Breeders' Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   Does that make up for the three men's narrow defeats in the real
Breeders' Cup races the day before at Churchill Downs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Abso!ital!lutely!off!,'' Drysdale crowed after Fiji rallied
from seventh to a two-length victory in the $500,000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, an English-bred 4-year-old who is 6 for 7 this year,
probably sewed up an Eclipse Award as the nation's top filly or
mare on turf, a division that will be represented on the Breeders'
Cup card for the first time in 1999. She was heavily favored Sunday
and paid $3.60.
</P>
<P>
   See You Soon was disqualified from second to fourth _ in a
debatable call _ for cutting off Pomona in the stretch.
Front-runner Sonja's Faith was moved up to second. Pomona was
placed third.
</P>
<P>
   The 1\-mile race was clocked in 2:25.23 on a course labeled
``good'' after overnight rain, making this the slowest Yellow
Ribbon ever.
</P>
<P>
   At the Breeders' Cup, Drysdale's Hawksley Hill and Labeeb ran
second and third to Da Hoss in the Mile, and Gold Land, owned by
Salman, ran a strong fourth to Reraise in the Sprint. Desormeaux
rode Excellent Meeting to a close second to Silverbulletday in the
Juvenile Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   __Track sale?: Santa Anita officials declined comment on Frank
Stronach's statement Saturday that he expects to complete the
purchase of Santa Anita by mid-December. Stronach, a Canadian
auto-parts magnate, spoke in Louisville, Ky., after Awesome Again,
a horse he bred and owns, won the Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Meditrust Inc. has been trying to sell Santa Anita. Stronach and
Churchill Downs were considered the most likely buyers after bids
by Hollywood Park and horse owner B. Wayne Hughes were reported to
have been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: The Oak Tree Racing Association meet ends today with
Neil Drysdale and Kent Desormeaux seeking their fourth stakes win
together with Plus in the Louis R. Rowan Handicap.... Hollywood
Park opens a 31-day season Wednesday at 12:30 p.m.... Bob Baffert,
the runaway training leader, goes into the last day with 19
winners, matching the Oak Tree record he already shared with Mike
Mitchell.... Alex Solis clinched his second Oak Tree riding title
in three years. He has 28 winners, Laffit Pincay 22.... Fermo
Cambianica of the Long Beach Press-Telegram defeated Jeff Siegel in
the finals of Santa Anita's Fans' Forum handicapping contest.

N.J. TOWN'S CHARM DRAWS AD MAKERS AND COMPLAINTS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTCLAIR, N.J. _ This town is so picture perfect, the houses
have booking agents.
</P>
<P>
   That is one sign of how often advertising agencies have sent
film crews here, looking for the shaded streets, putting-green
lawns and perfect homes that shout upper-middle-class suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   They have settled on a few choice neighborhoods in this town of
38,000, where the gracious old homes evoke Rockwell or Gatsby and
provide ideal backdrops for selling everything from minivans to
Grey Poupon.
</P>
<P>
   Town officials and many residents see all this as burnishing
Montclair's glossy image, and have greeted the crews _ who pay
handsomely for the privilege to shoot _ with open arms, a
streamlined permit system and a can-do approach to solving
logistical problems.
</P>
<P>
   But others are not impressed. They complain that as the number
of film projects increases _ with their hordes of technicians and
actors, their trucks, R.V.'s, loud and smelly generators and huge
spotlights that seek to improve on daylight at a steady 5,200
degrees Kelvin _ the lines in Montclair between residential and
commercial, genteel and crass, are becoming blurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't move here to be in the middle of Universal Studios,''
said Chris Howley. ``They think it is prestigious to have a
million-dollar home and rent it out like this for commercials? I
don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few blocks away, Betty Hudson said it was ``terrific''
that advertisers found the houses so picturesque that they paid
homeowners $2,000 a day to film in one. She said she had rented out
her house at least a dozen times in the last four years for
commercial shoots.
</P>
<P>
   As a former vice president for corporate communications with NBC
who is married to Boyd Matson, host of the syndicated television
show ``National Geographic,'' Ms. Hudson concedes she and her
family are more accustomed to the rigors of filming than many
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it also brings a lot of money into the community,'' she
said. ``I don't call it being star struck. I call it taking
appropriate pride.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, town officials have scheduled a public hearing to
review the town's nearly year-old regulations on filming and to
discuss whether any changes need to be made before January. The
current law, which allows a homeowner to get a permit for a film
production at least three times a year _ and up to 10 times a year
if neighbors and the township manager agree _ is a revision of a
1985 law that came to be viewed as too lax. That law replaced a
hands-off approach that also became untenable as filming increased.
</P>
<P>
   Although feature films are occasionally shot on location in
Montclair _ ``The Devil's Own'' and ``One True Thing'' are two
recent examples _ nearly all the film projects in the area are
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, location shootings for commercials across the country
increased 8 percent over 1996, said Dave Perry, chairman of the
production committee of the American Association of Advertising
Agencies. Montclair, along with Fort Lee, N.J., and New Rochelle,
N.Y., are among the more ``film-friendly'' towns near Manhattan
that Perry said were benefiting from this increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that Montclair gets a lot of business is that its
old homes have large rooms, high ceilings and big doorways,'' Perry
said, noting how important it was for production companies to be
able to squeeze lights, cameras and lots of people into a room.''
</P>
<P>
   A paradox behind this, however, is that the esthetic distinction
that draws film crews to Montclair _ its homes' varied and
interestingly shingled facades and grand porches, their Victorian
wallpaper and elaborate moldings _ often is nowhere to be seen in
the finished commercials. The details are left on the cutting room
floor or are shown so fleetingly that they are unrecognizable, and
what actually ends up on TV renders Montclair as Anyplace, U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   The town has seen a clear increase in the number of permits
issued for filming. There were 54 permits and the equivalent of 118
filming days in 1996, and 55 permits and 121 filming days last
year. This year, 76 permits have already been issued, resulting so
far in 127 filming days. By this accounting, a single day could
represent as many as four filming days if four film crews were
working at different locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've invaded my community and turned it into a business
district,'' said Monica Abbott, who has become one of the more
active opponents of the filming and wants to see it banned
altogether. ``It's making the streets dangerous, and somebody is
going to get hit, and that will be a great Kodak moment,'' she
said.

A WAVE OF NEW WAVES TO SIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Mercer Island (Wash.) High coach Ed Pepple said
it was a coup for Pepperdine. Pepple's star pupil, 6-foot-3 guard
Josh Fisher, selected the Waves over the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast Conference over the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll put pressure on whomever's ahead of him for playing
time,'' Pepple said. ``Josh was leaning toward Washington and
(Pepperdine coach) Lorenzo (Romar) knew that but said he was
willing to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday, the first day a high school senior can sign a
national letter of intent to attend a university on a basketball
scholarshp, Fisher will do just that.
</P>
<P>
   He's one of four high school seniors expected to sign with the
Waves, joining point guard Kevin Bradley of Irvine Valley College,
big man Tyler Brown of Bellarmine Prep in Tacoma and center Greg
Ethington of Gilbert High in Pheonix.
</P>
<P>
   Romar can't comment on high school seniors until he receives the
national letter of intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Fisher) is a perfect fit for Pepperdine,'' Pepple
said. ``The small school will be good for him. He's very good with
the ball. I don't think he's going to be primarily a point, but he
can handle the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fierce competitor, dedicated kind of guy. He's an
excellent citizen and he lives in the gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher averaged 13 points per game for a 26-4 Mercer Island team
as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Romar has been after Bradley since the coach arrived
in Malibu three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Romar recruited Bradley out of Crenshaw High, but the 6-foot,
175-pounder never made it to Pepperdine because his SAT score
wasn't up to NCAA standards.
</P>
<P>
   So Bradley went to Shoreline Community College in _ where else,
Washington _ last season before transferring to Irvine Valley in
the fall. Even though he's a point guard, the complaint about
Bradley is he doesn't shoot enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to make everyone on my team look good,'' Bradley said.
``I love passing the ball. I can be open and have a shot and I'd
pass the ball. I'd rather have everyone else score than score
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bradley averaged 20 points and nine assists last season
at Shoreline, but he missed Los Angeles and wanted to come home.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, he's a very good open-court player,'' Irvine
Valley coach Jerry Hernandez said. ``Once he learns how to run sets
and play better defense, he'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   __ In action: Pepperdine, which went 17-10 last season, hosts
the Taiwanese National Team in an exhibition at 3 p.m. on Tuesday.
The Waves open the season Saturday at home against UC-Santa Barbara
at 5 p.m. &QL;

DOMINATING DEFENSE LIFTS WEAK OFFENSE, ERICKSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dennis Erickson had just finished his final post-game
interview, where he had said all the things you would expect after
his team had avoided falling below .500 by dominating its perennial
nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   As he made his way through the locker room at the Kingdome,
Erickson paused briefly to state the obvious, but previously
unspoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was obviously as big a game as I've been involved in
here,'' the Seahawks' fourth-year coach offered Sunday. ``And it is
the biggest win.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more to the Seahawks' 24-12 victory for Erickson than
beating the Kansas City Chiefs for the first time after seven
straight losses. This game also went beyond getting to 5-4 and
remaining in the playoff race, at least mathematically.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's embarrassing loss to the Oakland Raiders,
Erickson's future was the subject of newspaper columns and calls to
sports-talk radio shows. On Wednesday, the team held a players-only
meeting, usually an indication of just how bad things are. On the
CBS pre-game show Sunday, it was said that the loss to the Raiders
had sealed Erickson's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the worst week of my life,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   The victory guaranteed this week will be better.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine, Erickson was asked, what would have happened if
the Seahawks had lost to the Chiefs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even think about that,'' he said. ``I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   But the importance of winning this game was evident in
Erickson's body language. He was more animated than ever in leading
the team out of the tunnel before the game, clapping his hands and
slapping palms with the players. And when linebacker Darrin Smith
returned an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to
push the Seahawks' lead to 24-6, Erickson sprinted, gyrated,
whirled and eventually leaped down the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ugly win _ with a combined 30 penalties and only 202
yards of Seahawk offense _ but few have been more beautiful in
Erickson's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team follows the lead of their coach, so when he's fired
up it does nothing but help us feed off that and get us going,''
said linebacker Chad Brown, who was even more active on the field
than Erickson was along the sideline. ``It was a great thing to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention a rare thing to see. The Chiefs' domination of
the Seahawks pre-dates Erickson and most of the players on this
team. The Chiefs had won 14 of the previous 15 meetings between
these two.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, it was the Chiefs who played like the Seahawks had in so
many of their losses to Kansas City. They looked ill-prepared and
made uncharacteristic mistakes in every phase of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring problem was penalties _ a club-record 17 for
152 wrong-way yards. There also are were turnovers _ three
interceptions and a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was shocked by the outcome, Chiefs coach Marty
Schottenheimer sounded like Erickson has after past games in this
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that shocked would be the right word,'' the
Chiefs' usually unflappable coach said. ``Deeply disappointed,
frankly. ... Right now, we are not a very good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Chiefs are 4-5 and have lost four straight for
the first time since 1988, the year before Schottenheimer took
over.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks seemed to enjoy the Chiefs' misfortune as much as
they did their own good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   So did the third straight sold-out crowd at the Kingdome, which
seemed to bounce from boisterous to bored during the 3-hour,
17-minute melee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't beat them, we beat them,'' said defensive end
Michael Sinclair, who called the players-only meeting and then
emphasized walking the walk after talking the talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've dominated, but we've done it in spurts,'' Sinclair said
of the defensive effort this season. ``Today, I thought we came out
and just flat dominated the entire game. That's what's satisfying
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense scored once, on Smith's 26-yard return of an Elvis
Grbac pass. The defense set up another TD, on cornerback Shawn
Springs' interception and 22-yard return to the Chiefs' 6-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   The defense kept the Chiefs out of the end zone until backup
quarterback Rich Gannon finally plowed in from the 1 with 3 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense came to play,'' said running back Ricky Watters,
who scored on a pair of 1-yard runs and finished with 105 yards.
``They did a great job and kept us in the ball game. They gave us a
chance in the end to close the deal. They ended up closing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the offense didn't keep up its end of the deal. The
Seahawks had just 108 yards passing, as Warren Moon completed 12 of
20 passes, threw two interceptions and had a third nullified by a
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks finished with 155 yards less than the Chiefs; and
ran just 54 plays, compared to 74 for the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, it wasn't very good,'' Erickson said. ``We didn't
have much productivity. Obviously, we'll look at that tomorrow and
see what our problem is and fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, indeed. Last night was meant for enjoying the events
that had just transpired, and also for savoring those that won't
this week.

CULTURE NOTEBOOK: JONATHAN MILLER, ENFANT TERRIBLE, EXERCISES
RESTRAINT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The focus of Jonathan Miller's attention in his new book, ``On
Reflection'' (Yale University Press), is light. That is, luster and
gleam and splendor, shimmers and surfaces and deformations, windows
and mirrors and water: light as it comes to us off the surface of
objects and is captured in pigment and image. The glint in the eyes
of Durer's ``Self-Portrait'' is not just a reflection but a
revelation of an inner world; the glassy flare that blurs an image
on the wall in Velasquez's ``Las Meninas'' tells us it is a mirror,
reflecting figures standing where we stand, looking.
</P>
<P>
   The book is actually a catalog of an exhibition that opened
earlier this fall at the National Gallery of London, but it came to
mind recently while watching Miller's new production of ``Le Nozze
di Figaro'' at the Metropolitan Opera. It wasn't that the
production itself was full of mirrors or played extravagantly with
image and light and distortion. Miller was even self-effacing here,
letting the staging reflect Mozart and his librettist, Da Ponte,
without too many distracting glints of his own persona. If he was
holding up a glass to the opera, he was trying to make sure it had
as few curves and swirls as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's restraint was so startling because he has a reputation
for experimenting with operas' settings and styles _ setting
``Rigoletto'' in Little Italy of the 1950s or ``Tosca'' in Fascist
Italy or ``The Magic Flute'' in a World War I-era hotel. One of his
most powerful productions at the Metropolitan, Debussy's ``Pelleas
et Melisande,'' replaced the opera's mythic kingdom and forest with
a decaying 20th-century mansion on which Atget photographs were
projected. It turned the composer's symbolist fantasy into a
melancholic evocation of ruin.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, in fact, a joke was making the rounds about Miller,
who has an M.D. degree. He finds himself in a hospital, conducting
an extremely delicate medical procedure. ``It's not working,'' he
calls out. ``Quick! Move it to the 18th century.'' Whereupon the
operating theater and its participants are decked out in
appropriate classical style.
</P>
<P>
   There can also be an enfant terrible aspect to Miller's
brilliance. In an interview in The Guardian in September, for
example, the director reiterated his attack on the Met's stagings
for being ``35 years out of date.'' He referred to Covent Garden as
a ``wife kennel, a place where businessmen dump their wives in
order to keep them quiet.'' Opera stars, he has said, can be
``horrible Jurassic Park dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are indeed a few relics of provocation in this
``Figaro'': isn't it a cliche by now to indicate the end of the
idea of nobility by showing the Count's mansion needing a coat of
paint or being rakishly tilted in the finale? But these relics are
minimal, (as are infrequent signs of characters not reacting to
what they are hearing). So how do we account for the kind of
elegant restraint Miller brought to this opera? He is almost always
acute at imagining character and choreographing intricate
ensembles. But this time there was something else going on, marked
by its absence, not its presence. It was as if Miller was aiming
more at reflection than at interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what brings us back to Miller's recent foray into
curatorship. In his almost cartographic survey of reflection in the
visual arts, he examines how paint suggests reflective surfaces,
why the eyes of a portrait seem to follow us around a room, why
mirrors are said to reverse right and left but not up and down. How
mirrors have been associated with vanity as well as with
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   But the recurring implication is that through acts of reflection
and portraying reflection, we come to know ourselves and the world.
Reflection provides a form of knowledge, which is why the word has
also come to describe the very activity of thought.
</P>
<P>
   We reflect on something only by stepping outside it, by starting
to see it from another perspective, one that is not fully our own.
Unreflective experience is immediate; and it provides sensation.
Reflective experience is mediated, rational, partly analytical. It
distances us from an object. It shows us its setting and makes us
aware of its contours. It unveils what had been taken for granted.
It also shows that there are multiple perspectives, many ways of
seeing and knowing.
</P>
<P>
   And isn't this what we see in ``Figaro''? Much is often made of
the political content of this opera, the ways in which the old
order is undercut by the new, nobility undermined by notions of
equality. But this is also an opera that is about knowledge and
bafflement.
</P>
<P>
   Its characters hear and see and think they learn: Cherubino
overhears the Count pressuring Susanna; the Count overhears Basilio
spreading rumors about the Countess; Susanna overhears the Count
blaming the Countess; the Count overhears Susanna proclaiming
victory; Figaro believes he has caught Susanna with the Count; the
Count believes he has caught Figaro with the Countess.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest sequence in the opera, the finale of the second
act, is saturated with delusion and revelation. Who is in the
Countess' closet? Who has jumped from the window? What are the
contents of the dropped paper? Who arranged for a nocturnal
rendezvous? There are almost as many answers as there are
characters.
</P>
<P>
   This is all latent in Beaumarchais' play, but Mozart's music,
with its phantasmagoric series of dances, manages to stand outside
the goings-on, commenting upon them with a haunting mixture of
sympathy and superior knowledge. The second act finale marks each
revelation with a change in key, rhythm and tempo, so one feels
each shock; but the sequence is also delicate, playful, pulsing,
hinting that all is not yet known. Until the opera's conclusion, no
character is granted complete knowledge. Each character suffers
because of misjudgments, believing something true based solely on
the evidence of eyes or ears.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes and ears, though, are the instruments of illusion. It is
mind and character that matter. This is an opera that almost
defines the nature of the Enlightenment. It is about the illusion
of appearance and the difficulties of knowledge. And it is about
how knowledge grows out of imagining the world from another
position, through another perspective. The truth is not in the
details, but in the summation of details. It lies outside
individual experience. It is the product of reflection.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps, for Miller, who celebrates light and reflection in
all their incarnations, that was enough: simply to step outside the
frame and point to what Mozart had already made poignantly
transparent.

 &HT;    Gordon blows past field to win NAPA 500
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ Jeff Gordon put the exclamation point to his
Winston Cup championship season Sunday night, blowing away the
competition with a dramatic rush with 19 laps remaining to win the
NAPA 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gordon's 13th victory of the season, tying a modern-era
record set by Richard Petty in 1975. He had won NASCAR's points
title last weekend at Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   With the stands more than half empty at 11 p.m., Gordon came
from fifth place to pass Mike Skinner, Todd Bodine, Dale Earnhardt
and Ken Schrader for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 160,000 fans has arrived for the scheduled 12:40
p.m. start. More than half were not around for the finish after
more than six hours of rain delays.
</P>
<P>
   The start of Sunday's race was halted almost as soon as it
started. Dale Jarrett took over from pole-winner Kenny Irwin and
moved quickly through the field, building a 2.3-second lead by lap
32.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the first of several rain showers on lap 37, bringing
out the first caution, which became a red flag as the rain
intensified. It halted action for two hours and 38 minutes. The
restart came at 4:35, under caution to help the drying process on
the top groove.
</P>
<P>
   It had no impact. Rain squall after rain squall blew in from the
west, bringing the field onto pit road on lap 59 at 5 p.m. There,
Rusty Wallace, Mark Martin, Dale Jarrett, Dale Earnhardt and Jeff
Burton met to discuss their options -- to race tonight or wait for
another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's run tonight and make some history,'' Earnhardt said, of
the first Cup cars to run under the lights at Atlanta Motor
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only concern about running tonight was water seepage from
the track,'' Jarrett said. ``Certainly the lights are somewhat a
concern, but they had a race here under the lights, so it looks
like it's lit well enough. I would say that it would probably be
better for the fans and everyone if we could get it in.''
</P>
<P>
   The race was delayed four hours, and restarted on lap 77 with a
bang, literally. As the field came down pit road to top off for
gas, four cars collided , but with no major damage.
</P>
<P>
   Once the race was restarted on lap 85, Gordon ran to a six-car
lead over Ward Burton and Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if we started back tonight, the track would make
everybody tight,'' said Richard Childress, team owner of the cars
of Dale Earnhardt and Mike Skinner. ``The light situation shouldn't
matter because we run under the lights at Charlotte and Daytona. I
think it's only fair for all these fans who sat up there in the
rain, and the ones who couldn't come back Monday that we try
everything to get it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Mike Helton, NASCAR's vice president of competition,
expressed reluctancy in resuming under the lights since the teams
hadn't practiced under those conditions here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is this garage wants to finish this thing,'' said
Larry McReynolds, crew chief for Mike Skinner. ``There are a lot of
things on the line here. The manufacturer's championship is up for
grabs and several teams still are in the running for top 10
finishes in the (Winston Cup) points championship.''

EXPRESS BUS SERVICE MAY REPLACE DOOMED SUBWAYS IN LOS ANGELES

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- As the Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority continues to break its tradition of
building subways, the agency's top managers now want to try a
network of 300 to 400 ``gold standard'' buses that would speed
commuters along 16 express routes.
</P>
<P>
   These gold buses would be specially equipped to override red
lights, and they would be larger than average -- possibly hinged,
double-bus units. On average, MTA buses stop every quarter mile;
these would stop at one-mile intervals.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA board is scheduled to consider the plan today and Nov.
19, as part of its efforts to improve transit service in geographic
areas that no longer have a hope of getting a subway.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lave, a professor of economics at the Institute of
Transportation Studies at the University of California, Irvine,
said the MTA would be on the right track if it focused on buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People repeatedly discover express buses are better for them
than light rail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In developing the rapid bus proposal, planners studied bus
systems in Houston, Ottawa and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with some MTA board members vexed by the subway's
apparent demise and others wedded to light rail, the fate of rapid
buses isn't at all certain.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan endorsed the proposal last
month, noting buses serve the vast preponderance of the county's
``transit-dependent'' residents -- those who don't have
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina isn't ready to buy
the rapid bus proposal, said aide Miguel Santana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tons of questions,'' he said. ``Is the rapid bus in
fact rapid? How much faster than a regular bus? How would it affect
congestion on the streets?''
</P>
<P>
   If the MTA management is recommending this network as an
enhancement of the existing bus system, that's fine, Santana said.
But if it's meant to replace the subway extension once intended for
East Los Angeles, Molina won't agree to it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lave, however, light rail can never serve
significant numbers of riders because it isn't convenient enough.
The MTA's three rail lines combined, including the subway, account
for less than 10 percent of all daily trips on MTA transit,
transportation officials said, while buses account for more than 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lave said, cities change over time -- business
centers shift, for example -- but rail remains fixed in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about what the MTA is experimenting with is
it's easy to change,'' he said of the rapid-bus system.
</P>
<P>
   The bus plan could cost about $200 million, starting with a $60
million tryout on three routes that would take about a year to 18
months to set up and at least another year to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't fully demonstrated,'' said consultant Douglas
Carter with Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton, which developed the proposal
with the MTA. ``We need to see what works best in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial runs on three yet-to-be-determined routes -- one in
the San Fernando Valley, one in East Los Angeles and one in the
Mid-City area west of downtown -- could each include slightly
different variables to test different options, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one trial route could have traffic signals set to
change green when the rapid buses are scheduled to arrive at the
intersections.
</P>
<P>
   Buses on another trial route could have transmitters that
actually prolong green lights or speed up the change from red to
green to cut down on the time the rapid buses must wait at
intersections.
</P>
<P>
   This technology has worked in Baltimore on one bus route for
about two years, said Frank Fulton, a spokesman for the Mass
Transit Authority of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the MTA's rapid buses would also be long, two-car buses
that are flexible in the middle, capable of carrying up to 75
riders compared to a regular bus load of 45 passengers. Carter
recommended the rapid buses be painted gold to symbolize a gold
standard of service.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever works best, some sort of rapid bus system makes sense,
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a pretty small investment we can go county-end to
county-end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid bus system as now proposed would run mostly on major
surface streets, such as the San Fernando Valley's Ventura
Boulevard, said James de la Loza, the MTA's executive officer in
charge of regional transportation planning and development.
</P>
<P>
   The buses would stop every mile or so instead of every
quarter-mile like most buses, he said. By cutting down the number
of stops ``you've increased the ability of these buses to move
quickly,'' de la Loza said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 routes recommended, including four in the valley, are
based on existing lines ``where the ridership is now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MTA board member Larry Zarian, a Glendale, Calif., city
councilman, said he won't oppose the rapid bus proposal but the
county needs a more diversified mass transit system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just awfully sexy for all of us to say buses,'' Zarian
said. ``My concern is, we should not be building $250
million-a-mile subways but we're not going to solve our
transportation problems with buses alone. There are many people who
are not going to take buses.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarian wants to examine a type of rail transit called diesel
multiple unit, which involves a coupled pair of cars with each car
powered by two engines and two transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   They could run on existing unused tracks, including along the
San Fernando Valley's Chandler Boulevard, to which the MTA owns the
right of way, he said. Putting a line in operation between downtown
and the Burbank Airport would cost only $60 million including the
cars, Zarian said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's King County has taken several steps toward the same
goal.
</P>
<P>
   It has developed more than 40 free park-and-ride lots, the
largest holding up to 1,000 cars, where passengers can catch
freeway fliers to major hubs, said Paul Toliver, the county's
director of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   A new program in the suburbs requires people to catch a
community bus to a transit center where they can switch to freeway
fliers. This is better than sending buses directly downtown, for
example, from each suburban community, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Toliver also believes old-fashioned service will draw urban
professionals onto his buses: clean vehicles and friendly,
well-groomed drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started listening to people,'' he said. ``And that's the
secret.''

EMMITT SMITH REACHES MILESTONE IN COWBOYS' VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ This was not the typical Dallas Cowboys
dominance of an NFC East team. The run defense made New York Giants
running back Gary Brown look like Jim Brown. Troy Aikman's
effectiveness was limited early because of a lacerated right
finger.
</P>
<P>
   But they still managed a double-digit victory against the
hapless Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith ran for 163 yards to become the Cowboys' all-time
leading rusher. And, buoyed by a special-teams unit that kept the
game on the visitor's half of the field for much of the afternoon,
the defense and Aikman shook off some early hurdles to turn a tie
game at the half into a 16-6 triumph Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud of the way our guys hung in there and
fought,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``It was a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (6-3) improved their division record to 5-0, and
completed a season sweep of the Giants. With the Arizona Cardinals
29-27 victory against the Washington Redskins, the Cowboys'
division lead remains at one game going into Arizona on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The division title could be wrapped up before the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``You seldom become a championship football team without getting
on one good streak,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith gave his club a chance at that streak Sunday. Behind a
banged-up offensive line, Smith juked and overpowered the Giants
for his eighth-best rushing day as a pro, and his best in two
seasons. With 9:56 remaining in the second quarter, he broke Tony
Dorsett's club record of 12,036 yards with a 32-yard run off right
tackle. His family members, who'd flown in from Florida, were among
the 64,316 people at Texas Stadium who gave Smith a standing
ovation with the announcement of his achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to (break the record) at home, here at Texas Stadium
because that's where the dream started,'' said Smith, who now
stands at 12,105 career rushing yards. ``It happened so early that
I was like, `Wow, we gotta continue playing the game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the rare Cowboys highlights of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had reduced wide receiver Michael Irvin's
effectiveness with double-teaming. He would finish with just three
receptions for 23 yards. The series before Smith's record-breaking
run, Aikman had cut his finger when he banged his hand on a helmet.
He could not even grip the ball, much less throw strikes. He missed
the last series of the first half to get an X-ray, which showed no
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd broken it. I had problems gripping the ball,
getting a feel for it, and throwing with velocity,'' said Aikman,
whose offense managed two first-half field goals despite starting
four of its first five offensive drives at their own 40 or better.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense, meanwhile, was having problems of its own.
Defensive coordinator Dave Campo tried to force Giants quarterback
Danny Kanell into mistakes by calling zone blitzes. The strategy
worked on Kanell, who finished with 139 yards passing and was
sacked three times. But at times, the Giants countered the blitz by
running Brown, who popped free for carries of 34 and 38 yards, and
wound up with 119 yards on just 15 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got caught,'' strong safety Darren Woodson said, ``in some
zones that let them get the long runs, but we never gave them a
touchdown. That was important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys completed their second consecutive game without
allowing a touchdown. Woodson had two sacks, including one which
set back a second-quarter Giants drive that had advanced to the
Cowboys' 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell threw relentlessly at hard-luck cornerback Kevin Smith
all day, but he responded with his best game of the season,
knocking down several passes, and forcing a fumble that ended
another Giants drive into Cowboys territory in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Aikman said his finger was starting to feel better. He
laid in a 32-yard pass for Ernie Mills that set up the go-ahead
field goal with 2:18 remaining in the third quarter. On the next
drive he completed passes to six different wide receivers, with a
two-yard scoring toss to Eric Bjornson sealing the Cowboys'
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman finished 16-of-23 for 161 yards, after going 5-of-11 for
29 yards in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had tough times getting what we wanted offensively,'' said
Aikman. ``But today, unlike a year ago, we made plays down the
stretch to win.''
