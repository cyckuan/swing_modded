SMU jars Rice's run of success
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DALLAS _ Nearly nothing worked right for Rice on Saturday as its
ongoing drama for a Western Athletic Conference championship and
its first bowl berth since 1961 took a wayward turn when SMU
manhandled the Owls 27-2.
</P>
<P>
   Four Rice players were injured in the game. Key penalties killed
drives. Rice lost a fumble and an interception. And the Owls failed
to score a touchdown for the third game this season. Even Rice's
points came from the Mustangs when a prospective SMU punt was
snapped out of the end zone for a safety before 16,272 in the
Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The loss also snapped Rice's five-game win streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it rained, it poured,'' said coach Ken Hatfield, using
the wet weather as an allegory for the way things unfolded for the
Owls.
</P>
<P>
   But hope is not lost even with such a bad feeling in their
collective guts, coaches and players pointed out after the loss.
Rice (5-4, 4-1 in WAC play) still retains at least a share of first
place, pending the outcome of Hawaii (3-1) in its late Saturday
game against TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pessimistic side of me says we played terrible
(Saturday),'' Rice left guard Neal Gray said. ``The optimistic side
says that we are still in the driver's seat. Regardless of what
happened today, we still have to have a big road win to win the
league. If we win our next two games, then we are still in first
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if Rice can win at Fresno State on Saturday, then the
Owls could still be on the road for the postseason. With a win at
Fresno, if Rice then can beat Texas-El Paso on Nov. 11, the Owls
are guaranteed at least a tie for the WAC championship.
</P>
<P>
   But lose either game over the next two weeks, and Saturday's
poorly played game at SMU may come to be known as the humiliating
beginning of the end of this year's championship hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely did not help ourselves out a lot,'' Rice right
tackle Aaron Sandoval said. ``But we're still in the fight. The
season is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   The game resembled the contest two years ago against SMU in the
Cotton Bowl when Rice was beaten 24-6. Rice players said they were
not ready to play two years ago, but thought they played hard this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1997, quarterback Ramon Flanigan ran wild against the
Owls. On Saturday, quarterback Josh McCown did the damage through
the air. McCown was 18 of 25 passing for 197 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But what the statistics don't show was how the SMU offensive
line was able to protect McCown all day long, allowing the
quarterback to pick and choose his targets. On the first TD of the
game, McCown saw receiver Damond Blueitt covered in the back of the
end zone, motioned to where he was going to throw the ball and then
watched with a fist in the air as Blueitt pulled in the scoring
toss to give SMU a 6-0 lead with 13:41 remaining in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely my best performance, I would say,'' McCown
said. ``It was the best team performance. The guys played great and
made my job easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Added SMU coach Mike Cavan: ``This football team has been
through a lot of adversity. We're 2-2 in the league, and we've
finally got something to hang our hat on.''
</P>
<P>
   The game started poorly for Rice, even though the Owls were able
to save some face. On the game's opening drive, SMU rolled to the
Rice 12 before attempting a 29-yard field goal. But linebacker Dan
Dawson blocked the kick, which was recovered on the Rice three. The
Owls drove to the SMU 32 before Scott Grimes had the distance but
missed a 49-yard field goal try wide left.
</P>
<P>
   McCown then threw two touchdown passes in the second quarter, as
the Mustangs were able to take a 13-2 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   On the second scoring drive, McCown scrambled for a 14-yard gain
and then completed a 25-yard pass to the Rice four.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterback found a lot of seams in our defense,''
Hatfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs' third score was aided by a personal foul on Rice
defensive tackle Judd Smith on third-and-17 when McCown had rushed
for only eight yards. Three plays later, Rodnick Phillips scored on
a two-yard run to up SMU's lead to 20-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield thought the call on Smith was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called Judd for hitting and was just trying to get off
the guy,'' Hatfield said. ``I thought that was a real tough play.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a moot issue on Rice's next possession. On
fourth-and-four from the Rice 38, SMU's Luke Johnson reached over a
blocker and blocked a punt by Travis Hale. Roy Coats followed the
bouncing ball and returned it 14 yards for the score to give SMU a
27-2 lead and the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody now has at least one loss,'' Hatfield said, ``and we
are still in the hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   But being in the hunt should feel a lot better than this.

Woods in Tour Championship lead as emotional week nears end
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Heaven wept at Champions Golf Club on Saturday, which gave the day
something in common with everything and everybody else this week.
</P>
<P>
   But as the drizzle and occasional downpour slackened, it was
clear the healing process has begun on the PGA Tour. Closure?
That's not an accurate word. Not yet. Maybe never, some players
said.
</P>
<P>
   But certainly the mood has changed ever so slightly at the Tour
Championship. Golf still doesn't matter much to the participants.
Payne Stewart's death remains front and center. Friday's trip to
Orlando for the memorial service turned out to be therapeutic in a
way because the players got to see just how Tracey Stewart and her
kids are coping. Their strength has filtered to others.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they came back to the Cypress Creek Course, dodged
raindrops during much of the morning and afternoon, and ended the
day knowing another bit of normalcy had returned: Tiger Woods was
dominating.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at the end of a long, draining, emotional week, somebody
will be handed the crystal trophy for winning the Tour
Championship. If it isn't Woods, it will be a shock to everybody.
He has won 10 consecutive tournaments in which he has led or been
tied for the lead going into the final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do win, it will be a nice thing to feel, obviously,''
Woods said. ``But I don't think I will feel quite as high, just
because of what's happened this week.''
</P>
<P>
   For 27 holes Saturday, Woods seemed to focus about as well as
anybody could. With fears about the injury he suffered when hitting
a rock Thursday proving unfounded (Woods didn't need treatment on
his neck or arm before Saturday's play), he started the day one
stroke behind Davis Love III. Woods drew even after playing nine
holes to finish the second round, then slowly pulled away from the
field in the thirtyphoonish,'' Woods said. ``Granted, today was
tough, condition-wise. But nothing compared to (Friday). Today
(Saturday) was a lot easier to go through than yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to deal with. But we're all getting
through on our own. My mind was a lot more at ease than it was any
time during this week because it was nice to finally put an end to
it and have some kind of resolve and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Move on? It still will be some time before the PGA Tour as a
whole can move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was still hard out there because I couldn't stop thinking
about yesterday (Friday),'' Nick Price said. ``I couldn't stop
thinking about those kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through the motions this week. It's hard to have
any kind of feeling toward our games. And even if you're the guy
who wins, it will be a week you remember not for winning. But
you'll remember it for Payne's death.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tom Lehman said: ``It's very difficult to get guys on the
tour to agree about anything. But this week, you've seen all guys
agree on something _ that everybody hurts out here and we're all in
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day to day out here, guys have problems. We have marital
problems or our kids are sick. Sometimes athletes are put on
pedestals, but we're human beings. We have problems and we have
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like people think we can play through the sorrow.
But we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman said in his mind, the tragedy will not diminish any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus in life should be on people,'' he said. ``In that
regard, I hope we never get over this. I want us to learn from this
and focus on the people who make up the tour, not the tour
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Phil Mickelson: ``I think we're going to feel awkward for a
year, at least. I mean, what happens when he's not there to defend
at the AT&AMP;T? And certainly the U.S. Open is going to be difficult.
We're going to have to continue living and dealing with Payne's
passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do think this day was easier since we had a chance to
see the family and pay our respects to Payne. And seeing Tracey
talk the way she did, I thought she was incredible. The way she
spoke, she showed a lot of strength. I was awfully impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Though birdies continued to fly around Champions, the energy
just wasn't in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was a little better, but it still stings,
obviously,'' David Duval said. ``I think going to Orlando helped,
but I don't want to say there was any closure. You kind of come to
terms with it. And we all saw Tracey, who was a lot stronger than I
could have been and I dare say a lot of other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best statement the players could make _ to be
there for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, they just hope to wrap up a week that was a lot tougher off
the course than on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority this week wasn't a golf tournament,'' Sutton
said. ``I don't mean that in a demeaning way to the fans in Houston
or to the Southern Company or to anyone. But we just had a big loss
to our golfing community and it's tough to get past that.''

Outcome secondary as pros compete in wake of tragedy
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton, the defending champion, shot a 64 and didn't even
realize it.
</P>
<P>
   A 64. Nope, it didn't register.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I added (my score) up,'' Sutton said, ``I thought,
`Really?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Tour Championship resumed in rain and wind Saturday _ and a
fog of lingering, numbing grief. They held a golf tournament, a
big, money-laden golf tournament, and while everybody came, nobody
much cared.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you spectators didn't realize it because the typically
high quality of shot-making in no way reflected the magnitude of
the distraction under which 29 of the world's greatest players are
laboring.
</P>
<P>
   Although they worked hard all year to earn the right to be here,
to divvy up another $5 million for a four-day stroll in the lovely
northwest Houston woods, it seems to mean little to them after that
doomed Learjet fell out of the sky Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They're performing, in effect, on muscle memory and an innate
professionalism. This is what they do so they're doing it, as
brilliantly as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Still, let's be honest. It doesn't mean diddly. Tiger Woods,
back on track to become a living immortal, might be 13 strokes
under par and topping the leader board, but the sound you hear
coming from within the PGA Tour's family is that of one hand
clapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it all comes down to it,'' Tom Lehman said, ``we're all
thinking about Payne.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing for Payne,'' said Shell Houston Open winner
Stuart Appleby, whose experience with personal tragedy _ he lost
his wife, Renay, in a bizarre traffic accident in July 1998 _ makes
him an unwitting expert on the subject. ``The tournament it's like,
`Big deal. Who cares?'''
</P>
<P>
   Payne. Pain. These lousy, stinking lessons in perspective always
hurt, don't they?
</P>
<P>
   In Orlando on Friday, the PGA's elite paid their final respects
to one of their number, Payne Stewart, a fine, funny, endearing
fellow who also happened to be the reigning U.S. Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they had to go back to work. They had to forget about
Stewart's two kids and his widow, Tracey. They had to forget about
the blackened scar in a South Dakota field.
</P>
<P>
   They had to forget about the questions for which there are never
any answers.
</P>
<P>
   Forget? Forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority of the week wasn't a golf tournament,'' Sutton
said. ``I don't mean that to demean the golf fans of Houston, but
we suffered a huge loss to our golfing community and it's just
tough to get around that.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Lehman, who so beautifully eulogized Stewart at Champions
Golf Club in the misty early morning Thursday: ``There's no way it
can be a normal week, no matter who wins. But everybody does his
best and whoever comes out on top handled the situation best.''
</P>
<P>
   Through 54 holes _ 27 Thursday, 27 Saturday _ Woods appears a
lock to be that man. Figures. Before Stewart died, turning golf's
tidy little world upside down, he was tearing up the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger merely going through the motions equates to some
remarkable golf.
</P>
<P>
   How did he do it Saturday, shaving seven more strokes off par
under absolutely diabolical circumstances, emotionally and
meteorologically?
</P>
<P>
   Easy. As dreadful as Saturday would be on each count, it was a
walk in the park and a day at the beach compared with Friday's
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was tough out there, conditions-wise,'' Woods said.
``But nothing compares to yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tracey grabbed his hand after the memorial service, he
admitted he ``lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started bawling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tracey's toughness got Tiger back on track, and reminded him
how easy smacking a golf ball straight and true is compared to
other matters we must, like it or not, occasionally confront.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to hear her voice and to hear her understanding of the
whole magnitude of the situation,'' he said, ``put everybody's mind
at ease. Seeing Tracey up there talking and speaking from the
heart, I mean, that is incredible. If she can have that kind of
strength, then we should be able to do it easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks die every day. Most, like Payne and Kim Perrot before him,
don't deserve to, but they're anonymous so hardly anybody pays
their passing any mind.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was a unique human being only for his ability to beat a
golf course into submission, a skill that allowed him to earn our
adulation and millions of dollars in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Thus he at least leaves his family in good financial stead. As
for his peers, he leaves them sadder yet, it appears, a bit wiser
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perry, who stands second to Woods at 10-under par,
admitted: (Payne) is going to change a lot of people's lives
because of what happened. I know he's going to change mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf is important, to be sure. It's fun and it pays well. But,
all things considered, it's hardly that important, is it?

A&AMP;M reasserts itself at OSU's expense
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COLLEGE STATION _ All week, the Texas A&AMP;M seniors heard how they
had failed to fill the leadership void created when key players
like Dat Nguyen, Dan Campbell and Rich Coady graduated from last
season's Big 12 Conference championship team.
</P>
<P>
   The defense heard how it had become a wretched version of the
Wrecking Crew, allowing 552 yards and 51 points in an embarrassing
loss last week at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   There were questions to the offense about the lack of a running
game, a season-long enigma for a team that once lived on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of soul-searching, the Aggies (6-2, 3-2 in Big 12)
came up with some resounding answers Saturday. They beat Oklahoma
State 21-3 to stay alive in the Big 12 South race and put at least
a temporary halt to the slings and arrows they had endured.
</P>
<P>
   Senior quarterback Randy McCown, playing despite a separated
left (non-throwing) shoulder, showed the kind of leadership that
was perceived to be lacking. McCown was 20 of 29 for 242 yards and
two touchdowns, both going to roommate Matt Bumgardner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked like a totally different team,'' McCown said. ``We
pulled together like never before. We really didn't have any other
choice. We're not losers here; we never give up. There was some
pain (in his shoulder), but all I had to do was look in these guys'
(his teammates') eyes, and I couldn't let them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have broken my back and not cared. It means a lot to
me to see everybody come together like we did (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   Aggies coach R.C. Slocum, who posted the 100th win of his
11-year career, said he told the seniors this week that someone
needed to fill the leadership void.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to them a bunch about how we won last year, but we
had seven guys leave this team and go on to play in the NFL,''
Slocum said. ``They were making plays on the field and also giving
us leadership. But they're gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a lot of emphasis this week on the fact that it's this
year, this team, this group of seniors. We had to have someone step
up this year. And we had some guys step up and come through.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened on both sides of the ball. The Aggies rushed for 152
yards on 44 attempts, hardly earth-shattering numbers, but 133 of
those yards came on 30 carries in the second half. Eric Bernard had
70 of his 80 yards in the second half, when the Aggies took command
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first quarter, the Aggies had an 89-yard drive
during the second quarter and went up 7-0 on a 11-yard pass from
McCown to Bumgardner. McCown passed for 60 yards on the drive, so
the ground game still wasn't turning heads.
</P>
<P>
   On the first three plays of the second half, however, Bernard
gained 40 yards on runs of 15, 16 and nine yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to gear it up,'' Bernard said. ``We've been
struggling all year running the ball, but we finally came together.
The line did a great job, and the backs went out and ran hard.''
</P>
<P>
   On consecutive drives in the second half, the Aggies marched 79
yards on 14 plays to lead 14-0 with 2:29 left in the third quarter
and then put the game away with a 69-yard, 10-play drive to make it
21-3 with 8:59 to play.
</P>
<P>
   McCown set up a one-yard touchdown run by D'Andre Hardeman in
the third quarter by throwing 25 yards to Bumgardner to the
Oklahoma State one. On the final score, McCown and Bumgardner
teamed up on a 14-yard TD pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think (the scouting report) said anything about him
(Bumgardner),'' Oklahoma State linebacker Jack Golden said. ``But
it will next week.''
</P>
<P>
   During the two drives, the Aggies were eight-of-eight on
third-down plays, with McCown converting five passes to keep the
drives alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed (Saturday) what a tough guy he is,'' said Bumgardner
of McCown. ``We talked (Friday night) a lot about what this game
meant to us. I had a feeling Randy was going to come out and have a
game like this one.''
</P>
<P>
   On defense, the Aggies did a 180-degree turnaround from the week
before. After the 51-point debacle in Oklahoma, Texas A&AMP;M did not
allow the Cowboys past the Aggies' 17.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise, Oklahoma State went with freshman quarterback
B.J. Tiger in place of Tony Lindsay, who had a sore shoulder and
missed his fifth game due to injury. Tiger was 15-for-21 for 154
yards passing and scrambled for 39 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of emotion came out (Saturday),'' A&AMP;M linebacker Brian
Gamble said. ``We made some big plays early and then everybody
started making big plays. Every team has its setbacks. We just
happened to have a really big setback. But we responded to it, and
we got back to playing our style of game.''
</P>
<P>
   From offense to defense to leadership, it was the sort of game
the Aggies had anticipated every week this season. The timing was
impeccable, coming on the heels of last week's head-scratching loss
and before a trip to Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a pride game for us,'' fullback Ja'Mar Toombs said.
``We had our pride taken away from us last week. (Saturday), we got
our feet back on the ground. We showed what we can do when we put
our minds to it.''

Tech endures another turn for the worse
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By W.H. STICKNEY JR. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COLUMBIA, Mo. _ Spike Dykes' maiden voyage into Missouri's Faurot
Field as coach at Texas Tech found the Red Raiders lost at sea like
they've been on several occasions during a roller-coaster 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to throttle tailback Zain Gilmore and thus thwart the
ball-control offense of the Tigers, the Red Raiders were blown out
of the water 34-7 Saturday and lost their share of first place in
the Big 12 Conference's South Division.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Dykes was left to wonder when, or if, his club will
ever enjoy smooth sailing as the season nears an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played so good at times; we've played over our heads
sometimes,'' said Dykes. ``And we've played underachieving at other
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is frustrating. And it all starts at the top. I've had a
hard read getting the guys to play at the same level, with the same
kind of intensity, week after week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, the buck stops here, because that's where it all
starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping Gilmore was almost impossible for the Red Raiders, who
fell to 4-4 overall and 4-2 in the Big 12, one game behind South
leader Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, a 6-1, 220-pound sophomore, celebrated his 20th
birthday by running for career highs of 165 yards and three
touchdowns on a school-record 45 carries as the Tigers reached .500
(4-4) and recorded their first league triumph in five tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just came out and played a better football game than we
did,'' said Tech defensive tackle Kris Kocurek. ``They ran the ball
on us, and that's usually what we like (opponents) to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just out-executed us today. We had a lot of penalties,
they ran the ball better than we did, and our defense was on the
field way too long. That will cost you the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri held the ball for 41 minutes, 42 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Tech had almost as many yards in penalties (13 penalties, 109
yards) as it did total offense (54 plays, 169 yards).
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' only points came on an 86-yard fumble return for a
touchdown by free safety Kevin Curtis in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   With Gilmore running the ball effectively and quarterback Jim
Dougherty throwing an occasional pass, the Tigers played keep-away
and didn't allow Rob Peters and the Raiders offense on the field
for the first 8:07 of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tech didn't get its initial first down until 1:15 remained in
the first half and went three-plays-and-out on nine of its first 10
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   At intermission, Missouri led 20-7. Tech's offense had been on
the field for just 25 plays, and 11 of those snaps came during the
final 1:28 of the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long day at Faurot Field,'' said Dykes. ``And it was
a shame, because this was a game we had to win.''
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon when Peters was sacked six times and threw a
pair of interceptions and everything that could go wrong seemed to
for Tech, the most detrimental occurrence happened just before the
end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were ahead 20-7, thanks to field goals of 41 and 30
yards by Brad Hammerich, a one-yard scoring run by Gilmore and a
two-yard touchdown run by Dougherty.
</P>
<P>
   But Peters, on the strength of a 24-yard completion to fullback
Sammy Morris, moved the Raiders from their 32 to the one-yard line
of the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   On second-and-goal and with less than 10 seconds remaining in
the half, a Peters pass was tipped into the air by Cedric Harden
and intercepted by linebacker Pat Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right before the half was the key to the ballgame,'' said
Dykes. ``If we score right before the half, it makes it a totally
different game. I think we go in with our head up instead of our
head down. The way you go into the locker room at the half is
awfully important, because of the momentum. Them stopping us right
there on the goal line like they did _ they went in juiced up, and
we were not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech hosts Iowa State next Saturday, plays at Texas on Nov. 13,
then closes at home against Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win all three of those games, we can still be in that
(Big 12) championship game,'' said Kocurek.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will give Texas and Oklahoma two losses (actually three
for OU) just like us. And hopefully, some people can knock some
people off, which we didn't want to have to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the way we've got to look at it now.''

East Carolina zaps mistake-prone UH
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
On a day of missed chances for both teams, No. 17-ranked East
Carolina cashed in more than the University of Houston and handed
the Cougars a 19-3 Conference USA setback Saturday at Robertson
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing their best start since going 11-1 in 1991, the
Pirates (7-1) blocked two UH field goals and managed to offset a
sizable difference in offensive yardage with timely defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bitter loss to swallow,'' said UH coach Kim Helton after the
Cougars suffered five turnovers plus 117 yards in penalties that
were a factor in their converting just three of 16 third-down
plays.
</P>
<P>
   UH's 140-yard margin in total offense (363 yards to 223) meant
nothing in the end, especially after Anthony Adams' 55-yard
interception return off Jason McKinley with 5:07 to play ended the
scoring. The Pirates remained in contention for the C-USA title at
3-1, while the Cougars dropped to 4-4 overall and 1-3 in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to absorb five turnovers, the Cougars' most since a 31-7
loss to Texas A&AMP;M in 1995, proved too much of a burden for an
offense that also damaged itself with several holding and
illegal-block penalties and that lost a fumble at the Pirates' 22
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ECU loaded up to control the Cougars' running game (19th
nationally) and held Ketric Sanford, who entered with three
consecutive 100-yard rushing games, to 72 yards on 20 carries.
Sanford is now 36 yards shy of breaking Chuck Weatherspoon's school
career record of 3,247.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had nine guys in the box to stop our running game, but we
still had our opportunities,'' Sanford said. ``We just didn't take
advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pirates coach Steve Logan agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stopping Sanford was huge,'' Logan said. ``It was a tremendous
effort on our part. He is as good a running back as there is in our
conference and one of the best in the country. For us to hold him
below his average was a testament to what (defensive coordinator)
Tim Rose is doing on that side of the ball. Coming in, everyone
knew who No. 7 (Sanford) was.''
</P>
<P>
   ECU quarterback David Garrard more than lived up to the Cougars'
pre-game worries with a single second-quarter play that led to the
Pirates' second TD. Seemingly trapped by a cluster of Cougars
behind the line, Garrard shoveled a pass to Jamie Wilson for a
26-yard gain to the UH 11. Garrard scored untouched on the next
play, a sprintout left in which a diving defender missed him and
Garrard found a clear lane to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bunch of guys around his legs, but we didn't hit him
around the waist and drop him,'' UH linebacker Wayne Rogers said of
Garrard.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the 6-3, 235-pound Garrard, Cougars defensive tackle
Adriano Belli said: ``He's a big, strong guy with legs like a
defensive lineman.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Bayes, the nation's leading punter, also had a hand, or
foot, in that score with his wind-aided 78-yard punt past safety
KeyKowa Bell that led to a 31-yard edge for the Pirates in field
position as they started from midfield. Bayes averaged 49.2 yards
on three punts but also had two extra-point kicks blocked. Bayes
was replacing injured kicker Kevin Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Devone Claybrooks and Norris McCleary blocked field-goal tries
of 31 and 33 yards by UH's Mike Clark. The Pirates also were
penalized 11 times for 107 yards, including one infraction that
nullified Kevin Stokes' 81-yard TD punt return.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of UH bright spots. Orlando Iglesias'
career-high 12 receptions from McKinley for 130 yards proved to be
the Cougars' major weapon, and Mike Green averaged 9.0 yards per
carry (8-for-72, including a 34-yard run, UH's longest gain of the
day). Defensively, UH limited the Pirates to 88 yards in the final
three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gratifying victory,'' said Logan, ``because they had
a tough defense that really shut us down in the second half. No one
had any offense, but our defense just happened to be better than
theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers thought he was victimized on an official's decision. An
incomplete pass was ruled after Rogers ran an apparent fumble in
for what would have been a 25-yard TD that pulled the Cougars
within 13-10 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the TV screen (on the scoreboard), and it looked
like a fumble,'' Rogers said. ``But that wasn't the way the
official saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrard (12-of-23 for 156 yards with three interceptions) sent
the Pirates ahead to stay in the first quarter with his 36-yard
scoring pass to Stokes just 91 seconds after Clark's 35-yard field
goal had given UH its only lead.
</P>
<P>
   Said Logan: ``We found a different way to win today, which is
usually the case with winning teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Concluded UH's Belli: ``As well as our defense played today,
theirs played better. We felt we let the offense down last week (in
a 39-33 loss at Louisville). It was a horrible feeling.''

Florida's Brown life of Cocktail Party
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ He seemed a little offended at the
insinuation. He'd been at practice and at all the games, and he
couldn't quite understand why everyone was wondering where he'd
been these past few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna be there,'' Alex Brown said. ``I'm doing my job,
even if I'm not always making the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Florida defensive end did both, and the question
of his recent whereabouts came up only because of the timing. His
2{ sacks, interception and presence all over the field were the
blitzing embodiment of the fifth-ranked Gators' 30-14 win over No.
10 Georgia. When it was done, though, Brown insisted it was just a
coincidence that this was his best game since a five-sack,
one-interception performance in the huge September win over
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Florida defensive coordinator Jon Hoke isn't so sure. Asked why
Brown seems to shine when the stage lights are brightest, Hoke
chalked it up to ``the magnitude of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I can really tell you,'' Hoke said. ``I just think
it's the magnitude of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   This one was pretty big, by anyone's standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators and Bulldogs arrived at ``The World's Biggest Outdoor
Cocktail Party'' with just one loss each in the Southeastern
Conference Eastern Division. The winner would have the inside track
for the SEC championship game, not to mention keeping alive chances
of advancing to the Sugar Bowl and a shot at the national title.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was a two-touchdown underDawg but harbored hopes that
versatile quarterback Quincy Carter could poke enough holes in the
Florida defense to pull off the upset. He appeared capable of just
that early on, too, but Brown and the Gators defense took over on a
rainy afternoon at Alltel Stadium, keeping the Bulldogs at bay
until a pair of late touchdowns settled the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words to describe the second half,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there are numbers. Georgia (6-2) produced just 53 yards
after the break, 32 rushing, 21 by the pass. Carter, under
increasingly heavy pressure as the running game disappeared,
completed only two of 13 second-half passes and was intercepted
once.
</P>
<P>
   With that sort of dominance, even a go-for-broke type like Steve
Spurrier could play the conservative game. Florida (7-1) attempted
only nine passes in the second half as it nursed a two-point lead
from the middle of the second quarter until the middle of the
fourth. In the fourth quarter alone, the Gators outrushed the
Bulldogs 102 yards to two.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're playing defense like we were today, I can put it on
the ground like that,'' said Spurrier, who won his 100th game at
his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   That run defense was no big surprise, since the Gators led the
nation with an average yield of 49.1 yards per game. The shock was
the second-half shutdown of a Georgia passing game that entered the
game averaging a respectable 243.9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The rain had a little bit to do with that, of course, though the
deluge slackened for much of the third and early fourth quarters.
When push came to shove, Florida simply did more of the pushing and
shoving against a team that felt it could hold its own in the mano
a mano stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought they'd be able to hold us to that amount of
yardage,'' Bulldogs coach Jim Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to what was to come, the game started at a furious
pace. Florida took the opening kick and went 84 yards, scoring on
an 11-yard pass from Doug Johnson (17-of-32 for 234 yards and a
touchdown, with two interceptions) to Travis Taylor. Georgia needed
just 38 seconds to even thing up, however, with a 46-yard run by
Patrick Pass setting up Carter's three-yard keeper with 10:22 left
in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   Then the skies opened, and each team grew more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators retook the lead on a 40-yard Jeff Chandler field goal
near the end of the quarter, but the Bulldogs responded with an
81-yard, 13-play possession. It ended with a 16-yard run by Carter,
who took an option left, cut back to the middle and sprinted in for
the score with 10:47 remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   That would be about it for the Georgia offense, and the lead it
had produced would not last long.
</P>
<P>
   Converting a fourth-and-two gamble from its 36, Florida went on
to get a 26-yard Johnson-to-Erron Kinney pass to the two before
Robert Gillespie's two-yard run put the Gators back on top for
good. A botched snap cost Florida the extra point, but the Gators
still nursed the 16-14 lead into the half and through the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the meager output, the Bulldogs had their chances. After
bottling Florida up deep in its end, Georgia took over after the
punt at the Gators' 34, but Brown sacked Carter on a third-down
play. Another exchange early in the fourth quarter set the Bulldogs
up at the Florida 30, but running back Jasper Sanks fumbled on a
second-down try from the Gators' 16, denying Georgia a shot at a
go-ahead field goal with just under 13 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   An interception at the Georgia 20 kept the Bulldogs within
striking distance, but again they couldn't move, and Florida
finally pulled away on Bo Carroll's 30-yard touchdown run with 7:43
left.
</P>
<P>
   Another Brown sack resulted in a fumble that set up a two-yard
keeper by Johnson just a minute later. Brown then added an
exclamation point when he dropped into coverage and intercepted
Carter with just over five minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, it was like, `The rings are on the
table,''' Brown said. ``It was just up to us. We knew if they
couldn't score, they couldn't win. And they couldn't score.''
</P>
<P>
   Not with Alex Brown showing up again. If the pattern holds,
Vanderbilt and South Carolina won't have to worry about him the
next few weeks, but Florida State might want to start making plans
now.

MCCAIN'S TEMPER IS LEGITIMATE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain has staked much of his claim to the
presidency on his character: his status as war hero; his service to
his country; his commitment to a cause, his country, bigger than
himself.
</P>
<P>
   These are legitimate claims to support by McCain, and worthy of
voter attention and consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other aspects of McCain's character, less
flattering, also worthy of voter attention and consideration. These
aspects were unfortunately on display last week, both through the
experiences of Gov. Jane Hull as related to the ``New York Times,''
and McCain's reaction to her revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Hull told the ``Times'' that McCain's temper is ``something that
John has to keep control of'' and that her relationship with McCain
was ``not particularly warm.'' According to the ``Times,'' Hull
pretended to hold a telephone receiver several inches from her ear
when describing how she had handled McCain's displays of temper at
her.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's experience is hardly unique. Many Arizonans active in
policymaking have been the victim of McCain's volcanic temper and
his practice of surrounding himself with aides and allies who
regard politics, in the words of his paid Arizona chairman, state
House Speaker Jeff Groscost, as a ``blood sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbing was McCain's reaction to Hull's simple
expression of truth. He noted his propensity for passion but
insisted that he doesn't ``insult anybody or fly off the handle or
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, quite simply, hogwash.
</P>
<P>
   McCain often insults people and flies off the handle. This
newspaper has chronicled just some of these unfortunate
exhibitions. There was the time McCain blew up publicly at a Jewish
man at the Camelback Inn who objected to McCain's reference to
``Christian'' compassion for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   There have been the many times McCain has called reporters
``liars'' and ``idiots'' when they have had the audacity to ask him
unpleasant, but pertinent, questions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain once engaged in an elevator shouting match with Sen. Carl
Levin of Michigan over the John Tower hearings, and he publicly
abused Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama. He seemed to take special
glee several years ago in dressing down former Arizona Gov. Rose
Mofford and Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson during their separate visits
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain went beyond simply denying reality. He said, in
essence, that Hull was ordered to attack him by front-runner George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty obvious, as we've closed in the polls . .
. that the memo came out from the Bush campaign to start attacking
John McCain,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   This is, sadly, not an untypical McCain remark: unfounded,
sarcastic and condescending. It demeans Hull as an independent
political actor, and pretty well validates rather than refutes her
description of their relationship and his treatment of her.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is running dangerously close to sanctimony in his bid for
the presidency, depicting himself as the last honorable politician
in America. He has enjoyed a fawning national press. But perhaps
the ``Times'' article is the first step toward presenting more than
a one-dimensional view of McCain. The ``Wall Street Journal''
followed up with a column, reprinted on these pages Friday,
documenting McCain's often-testy relationships in his home state,
titled ``Arizona's unfavorite son.''
</P>
<P>
   If McCain is truly a serious contender for the presidency, it is
time the rest of the nation learned about the John McCain we know
in Arizona. There is much there to admire. After all, we have
supported McCain in his past runs for office.
</P>
<P>
   But the presidency is different. There is also reason to
seriously question whether McCain has the temperament, and the
political approach and skills, we want in the next president of the
United States. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; BECH AT BAY: A Quasi-Novel &LR;  By John Updike. Fawcett/Ballantine,
$12. The third, and probably the last, installment in the author's
long-running series featuring the Jewish anti-Updike continues to
satirize the writing life and corporate publishing, though the
changing world has left the aging hero nostalgic and generally at
sea. ``The sentimental, unreal universe of Bech is ... vital to
Updike's literary sensibility,'' James Shapiro wrote in The New
York Times Book Review in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SEEKERS: The Story of Man's Continuing Quest to Understand
His World &LR;  By Daniel J. Boorstin. Vintage, $14. This synoptic tour
of Western religion and philosophy by a former librarian of
Congress and Pulitzer Prize-winning scholar is the concluding
volume of an ambitious trilogy that includes a history of Western
science, ``The Discoverers,'' and of Western art, ``The Creators.''
There's bound to be much to quibble with in this sweeping, secular
overview (written by a liberal humanist), but ``Boorstin reminds us
what intellectual history on the grand scale looks like,'' Michael
Lind wrote last year. He ``has a memory for quotation as
comprehensive as that of any Renaissance humanist.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AMSTERDAM &LR;  By Ian McEwan. Anchor, $12. This comic morality tale
describes the comeuppances of two self-important Londoners, a
composer and a newspaper editor, whose friendship unravels after
the funeral of a woman with whom they both had an affair. With its
viselike plot and cruel wit, the novel ``is a well-oiled machine''
that is ``entertaining in the mode of earlier nasty British
satirists like Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis,'' William H.
Pritchard wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE CHILD IN TIME &LR;  ($14), an
earlier novel by McEwan about a children's book writer who is
emotionally devastated when his 3-year-old daughter disappears
during a trip to the supermarket. In 1987 the reviewer Rebecca
Goldstein admired the story's ``psychological reality: the
beautifully realized relationships, the tracing of the many-layered
love between father and child, husband and wife.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURBULENT SOULS: A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family &LR; 
By Stephen J. Dubner. Bard/Avon, $12.50. A former editor and writer
at The Times Magazine chronicles his parents' spiritual journey
from Judaism to Catholicism and his own reverse course as an adult.
The result is an ``intense, acutely observed and ... exigent
memoir,'' Jonathan Wilson wrote last year.

<P>
   &UR; THE MIDDLEMAN: And Other Stories &LR;  By Bharati Mukherjee. Grove
Press, $12. The immigrants in these tales, whether from Vietnam,
Italy or India, aren't tired, huddled or even poor. ```The
Middleman' is a consummated romance with the American language,''
Jonathan Raban wrote in 1988. ``It is also a romance with America
itself, its infinitely possible geography, its license, sexiness
and violence.''

<P>
   &UR; WE DIE ALONE &LR;  By David Howarth. Lyons, $14.95. In 1943, a
Norwegian commando named Jan Baalsrud escaped a Nazi ambush and
fled overland from Norway to neutral Sweden, eluding his pursuers
while surviving frostbite, snow blindness and many other hardships.
This illustrated account of his ordeal ``is high adventure told
with overpowering simplicity and drama,'' Herbert Mitgang wrote in
The New York Times Book Review in 1955.

<P>
   &UR; RESERVATION ROAD &LR;  By John Burnham Schwartz. Vintage
Contemporaries, $13. This novel explores the aftershocks of a
10-year-old boy's hit-and-run death, particularly on the delusional
driver and on the child's father, a gentle professor racked by
guilt and bent on revenge. ``Reflective, character-driven as it is,
`Reservation Road' reads like a thriller, swift and complete,'' Kit
Reed wrote last year.

<P>
   &UR; FASHIONABLE NONSENSE: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of
Science &LR;  By Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont. Picador USA, $14. Two
physicists issue a broadside against the misuse of science by
postmodern theorists and a defense of scientific realism against
its relativist enemies. ``Sokal and Bricmont have done reason a
modest service by exposing a species of intellectual quackery,''
Jim Holt wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MEANING OF IT ALL: Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist &LR; , by
Richard P. Feynman (Helix/Perseus, $13), is a collection of three
1963 lectures in which a Nobel laureate in physics expounds on the
relationship among science, religion and society. ``There's some
splendid stuff here,'' Timothy Ferris wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EDITH WHARTON: An Extraordinary Life &LR;  By Eleanor Dwight.
Abrams, $19.95. With more than 300 period photographs and
illustrations, this biography illuminates the writer's life and
travels, from the gardens of Italy to the cottages of Newport. It
``does much more than take readers touring: It also evokes the
special quality of attention with which Wharton met the world,''
Angeline Goreau wrote in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CLEFT: And Other Odd Tales &LR;  By Gahan Wilson. Tor/Tom
Doherty, $14.95. These meticulously eccentric stories feature
lonely frogs, vengeful sea gulls and murderous cats _ and those are
just the animal characters. Last year the reviewer Andrea Higbie
said that the author's unnervingly funny drawings ``are definitely
the icing on this devil's food cake of a book.''

Stockton's FG boosts Texas 44-41
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AMES, Iowa _ The notion that Texas' most recent games against rival
Oklahoma and national power Nebraska would hurt the Longhorns
against Iowa State proved to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Longhorns said, those mettle-testing wins turned
out to be what helped them the most against the upstart Cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   Despite accomplishing its goal of avoiding a letdown, Texas
found itself in a shootout with Iowa State that was decided on the
game's final play.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Stockton provided the game-winning points with an 18-yard
field goal as time expired to lift the Longhorns to a 44-41 victory
before a noisy crowd of 37,218 at Jack Trice Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton's kick capped a nine-play, 71-yard drive that began
with just over three minutes left in the game after a Darren Davis
one-yard run that tied the game at 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping we would score the touchdown, but that's what I'm
there for,'' Stockton said. ``I have to make kicks like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the junior from Katy Taylor's third field goal to win a
game in two years of kicking for the Longhorns, but the game would
not have come down to Stockton's kicker if Texas' defense _
actually, the secondary _ had played better.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas quarterback Major Applewhite was superb (30-of-40
for 345 yards, two touchdowns), Iowa State quarterback Sage
Rosenfels had a spectacular day, connecting on huge plays against a
ragged Longhorns secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfels posted a career-best 291 yards passing on only 11
completions, repeatedly burning Texas with long passes against
man-to-man coverage. Iowa State had six pass plays _ to five
different receivers _ go for 28 or more yards, and two others of
20-plus yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize to our fans and also apologize to our coaches, we
just have to go out there and get then job done,'' said Texas
cornerback Joe Walker, who was victimized for a 59-yard touchdown
in the second quarter, the longest score against the Longhorns this
year. ``As a secondary, we just have to go out there and make those
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had good coverage but didn't finish the thing off. That's
what you have to do as a cornerback _ you have to finish the play.
You can never hold back. As far as the secondary, we're not happy
with our performance, but we have to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory and Texas Tech's 34-7 loss at Missouri, Texas
(7-2, 4-1) took over sole possession of first place in the Big 12
South Division. Iowa State dropped to 4-4 overall and 0-4 in
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was behind 20-10 late in the second quarter, making this
the third consecutive game the Longhorns rallied from an early
double-digit deficit to win. Longhorns offensive coordinator Greg
Brown said the come-from-behind victories over Oklahoma and
Nebraska helped his team remain calm in a tough situation on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get down and respond positively, it's like
putting a CD in the bank,'' Brown said. ``It's there drawing
interest, and you can call on it when you need it.''
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind early, the Longhorns outscored the Cyclones
31-7 and appeared to be in control of the game before poor
special-teams play, which has been inconsistent all season, came
back to haunt the Longhorns once again.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had trouble slowing kick returner J.J. Moses in the first
half but began the second half like it had figured out what was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns pinned the Cyclones inside their 15-yard line
twice in the third period and even got a score when Maurice Gordon
tagged Moses at the 11, forcing a fumble that Beau Trahan scooped
up a returned for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But after Texas jumped ahead 41-27 on a Stockton 35-yard field
goal with 9:33 left in to play, Moses, who had 270 all-purpose
yards and 175 yards on kickoff returns, took the ensuing kickoff
two yards deep in his own end zone, danced around until he saw some
running room and darted 80 yards to the UT 20.
</P>
<P>
   An interference penalty moved the ball to the 10 and, two plays
later, Ennis Haywood, a sophomore from Dallas Carter, ran it in
from seven yards to move the Cyclones to within a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State forced Texas to punt and took over at its 34 with
5:50 left.
</P>
<P>
   Three Davis (21 carries for 67 yards) runs and a 15-yard penalty
for having too many men on the field moved the Cyclones into
Longhorns territory.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfels then went after his favorite target, completing a
34-yard pass to Michael Brantley against Walker to the one, setting
up Davis' second touchdown to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   But all that did was give Texas the ball with more than three
minutes remaining and a full complement of timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give Major Applewhite three minutes, 20 seconds, and three
timeouts to win the football game, and just about every time we've
seen (that situation) he's responded,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite wasted little time in getting the game-winning drive
under way. The sophomore hit Ryan Nunez for a 38-yard gain on a
post route on the first play of the possession to put Texas inside
the Iowa State 35.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same play the Longhorns had run to start a drive
earlier in the game, with Applewhite connecting with Kwame Cavil
(11 receptions for 106 yards) for a 16-yard gain late in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipated before we went out there that Major would hit
Kwame again _ we told him that the safeties would probably (peel
back), but he did a great job of seeing what the safeties did when
he came out of the fake, and the ball should have gone to Ryan,''
said Davis, UT's offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   With Iowa State down to one timeout, having wasted two in the
third period, Texas turned to Hodges Mitchell, who led all rushers
with 158 yards on 33 carries. Mitchell carried the ball seven
consecutive times, almost scoring on his final attempt, to move the
ball to the Cyclones' one.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton then came on withq

TINY TOWN FIGHTING SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When big city politicians say they want to move hazardous-waste
sites to the middle of nowhere, Jeff Jordan hopes they're not
thinking about Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is fighting to save his tiny southern Arizona community
south of Coolidge, which he said is threatened by a new
hazardous-waste operation, Heritage Environmental Services, that
already is asking the state for permission to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randolph was primarily targeted simply because of the
community. It's the poorest community in Pinal County,'' Jordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   He is a building contractor and 40-year resident of Randolph,
which has a population of about 500.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and his neighbors are getting help from the Center on
Race, Poverty and the Environment, a California-based advocacy
group that helped them file a complaint with the federal
government. They claim the new hazardous-waste site violates their
civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for the state of Arizona to do the
right thing,'' said attorney Luke Cole, the center's director.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint charges that, for the first time, the state
Department of Environmental Quality used a ``fast-track''
permitting process, excluding any effective participation by
Randolph residents. It claims that issuing a permit for the site
contributes to the state's ``clear pattern of discriminatory
action.''
</P>
<P>
   State DEQ officials deny any discrimination in permitting
Heritage Environmental Services' operation or any other operation.
Deputy Director Mark Charles said that the DEQ did not expect
Heritage to request changes and expansion in its March permit so
soon and that the process will require more public meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana-based company cleans hazardous waste in seven
states. Heritage Vice President Gary Lindgren said his firm was
drawn to Randolph by an expanding Southwest economy. He said the
facility was legally zoned and has plans to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't our purpose in life to find low-income minority
communities. We're more interested in being where our customers
are,'' Lindgren said. ``We're kind of at a loss. We thought we did
a good deed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindgren said his company is cleaning up the 80-acre property,
once the site of a recycling operation. Heritage carted away tons
of trash left behind by the previous owners.
</P>
<P>
   DEQ records show, however, that Heritage received its permit
while 12 potentially contaminated areas on the site still need to
be tested and, if necessary, cleaned up. Lindgren said the company
is in the process of testing those sites.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Heritage's good deeds Lindgren pointed to was
rehabilitating a local park and playground. But the park is a patch
of weeds, crushed glass and dirt, without a tree or a bush and with
peeling play equipment and warped picnic tables. A small basketball
court has been newly paved and lighted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Coolidge City Manager John Baudek is pleased with
Heritage, and he hopes more industry follows, providing taxes and
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph is surrounded by an 11,000-acre strip owned by Mesa,
which plans to zone the area for industry.
</P>
<P>
   A half-century ago, AfricanAmericans, such as Jordan's father,
went to Coolidge looking for work in the town's cotton fields. Not
able to own land within the town limits because of their color,
Jordan's father and many minority families purchased land a few
miles south. They built homes and reared their families in the
unincorporated community that became known as Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Jordan is rearing his own family on that same acreage.
</P>
<P>
   The new hazardous-waste operation, in Jordan's view, is a
continuation of an environmental battle that neighbors waged
against a now-closed oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Heritage site was a recycling plant that residents say
also filled the air with red, smokey emissions. Despite their
protests, nothing was done about it.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and his neighbors have little faith government officials
will keep a better eye on Heritage and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are doing is erasing a lot of history,'' said
Jordan, who can't imagine people wanting to live surrounded by
heavy industry. ``We will be forced from our houses, away from the
homes our parents put up.'' &QL;

PRUETT CRASHES THE PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG PADILLA  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ The old veteran showed at California Speedway on
Saturday that he's not gone yet, while the young rookie put himself
in position to make a run at the championship in today's Marlboro
500.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Pruett, a 10-year CART veteran who will be racing on the
NASCAR Winston Cup circuit next season, posted an early qualifying
speed of 235.398 mph on a windy mid-morning run, then watched
anxiously as the rest of the field made unsuccessful attempts to
catch him.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Montoya, the series' rookie sensation, qualified third at
234.251, five positions ahead of Dario Franchitti, who leads the
points standings. Montoya, who has won a rookie-record seven races
this season, trails Franchitti by nine points in the battle for the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Max Papis, who has yet to win a race in four CART seasons,
qualified second in 234.544.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing was waiting until the end, because I really
thought Max was going to take it away from us,'' Pruett said.
``He's been running strong all weekend, he ran strong at the
Michigan race, so I was sweating bullets while he was doing his
run.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pruett, it is his second consecutive pole at Fontana. The
Sacramento native, in his first season with Arciero-Wells Racing,
was the first driver to win a pole position with a Toyota engine.
The accomplishment came one day after the three-time defending
champion Chip Ganassi Racing Team, with drivers Montoya and Jimmy
Vasser, announced it was switching from Honda to Toyota engines
beginning next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have asked me why I'm moving to Winston Cup,''
Pruett said. ``Is it because of Toyota, the team, this, that? First
and foremost, I think Toyota is going to get on top. That's the
thing I see right now. We've had some tremendous runs in the past
and we're up in front now.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya only had a little problem with how events unfolded
Saturday. He will start well ahead of Franchitti and was happy to
see that Toyota, the engine he will be switching to next season,
had an impressive performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed about missing the pole and the
championship point, but it's OK,'' Montoya said. ``My car was
perfect and there wasn't a tenth of a mile an hour left in it. When
the first guys went out, the conditions were better, then the wind
picked up and it was getting stronger all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenario wasn't the greatest for Franchitti, but he is
content knowing it could have been worse in his bid to hold off
Montoya and win his first championship in his third CART season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I couldn't be on the pole, I didn't want Juan to get it and
collect that extra point,'' Franchitti said. ``We'll be racing at
the start, but we won't be going all out. I want to stay in touch
with the leaders, but I won't be looking to lead every lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Papis is considered a driver to beat this weekend despite the
fact that he has yet to pick up his first career CART victory. He
has finished second, fourth and third in his last three races, and
in July, he dominated the U.S. 500 at Michigan Speedway, a track
similar to California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to win this race and I don't want to get in the
way for the championship with Dario and Juan,'' Papis said. ``I'm
going to run my race as hard as possible. There is no revenge
because of Michigan. It was just another event.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Papis that pointed out at the post-qualifying press
conference that the past, present and future of Toyota engines took
the top three spots for today's race.
</P>
<P>
   Papis, who races Ford engines for Team Rahal, raced Toyotas for
Arciero-Wells the past three years before being replaced by Pruett
this year. Montoya will be Toyota's highest-profile driver next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really, really amazing,'' Pruett said. ``The fact that
it's my last CART race makes it that much more meaningful for me
personally, and to be able to make history is special.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be a good omen for Toyota that it was Pruett who won
the first pole position with one of their engines. At Michigan
Speedway in 1995, Pruett was the first driver to win with Firestone
tires in the company's return to CART. Firestone now is the tire of
choice, leading to the announcement earlier this week that Goodyear
no longer will make tires for the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will ever be able to do this again,'' Pruett said of
his accomplishment with a Toyota engine. ``There's just nothing
like being first.''

FALLING STARS DISPLAY NO SPARKLE IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Although it was a day early, some of the folks in
attendance at Reunion Arena last night decided to celebrate
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   There was a guy in an Austin Powers costume, someone wearing a
Yoda mask, a big, burly, hairy guy in a woman's wig and a dress,
assorted ghosts and goblins, and even someone dressed up as Mike
Modano's grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also got into the spirit of the occasion. They came to
the party dressed as a mediocre hockey team, and lost to the Tampa
Bay Lightning, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that might not be entirely accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The paying customers can take off their masks at any time. The
Stars, though, are stuck in the role they played against the
Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   They lost for the second consecutive game, and fell to a very
average 6-5-1, last place in the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, at least, the mediocre team is the reality. The
Stanley Cup team from last year and the President's Trophy winning
squad from the past two seasons is the illusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be easy like the last couple of years,''
Stars center Mike Modano said. ``It's going to be a battle. I think
we expected it to be automatic like the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were routed by Toronto, 4-0, in their previous game.
Although the score this time was closer last night, it might have
hurt more.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs are a legitimate contender. The Lightning had
won only twice in their first nine games, and were 0-3 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this was Tampa Bay, and being at home, it hits home a
little more,'' Modano said. ``It gets to the point of being an
embarrassment factor.''
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the game that got the Cup holders back
on track. Not only were they playing a lightly regarded opponent,
but injured regulars Joe Nieuwendyk and Richard Matvichuk returned
to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk and Matvichuk played well at times, but the problems
remained. The Stars had breakdowns on defense, couldn't generate
any offense and didn't make up for their deficiencies by outworking
the other team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some people who didn't win enough one-on-ones,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``That's what the game is about. We're
going to have to win some more one-on-ones to create offensive
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Stars were playing a team that had allowed 11
goals in its previous two games and 18 in the previous four,
offensive chances were scarce.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' only goal came on a first-period power play, when
Brett Hull whistled a puck past Lighting goalie Dan Cloutier. They
managed only 23 shots, including six in the second period when a
goal could have changed the complexion of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's puck possession; it's making passes,'' Modano said. ``We
don't have possession coming over the blue line. We can't ever get
to the middle of the zone with possession.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning, on the other hand, were able to create scoring
chances against the Stars' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Lecavalier scored first when he intercepted an errant
pass by Mike Keane just outside the Stars' blue line, and with
defenseman Sergei Zubov out of position skated in alone on goalie
Eddie Belfour. He faked Belfour to the ice, and scored over his
right shoulder less than three minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's goal tied it, but the Lightning took the lead for good
with 15 seconds remaining in the first period. Chris Gratton won a
faceoff in the Stars' end, drawing the puck to Fredrik Modin who
blasted it past Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough against the struggling Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a team in transition right now,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's
going to be a struggle. It's going to be a struggle for a long
time. We're going to have to fight through it.''

<P>
   GILA RIVER INDIAN COMMUNITY _ When the nation's most prestigious
health research institute uncovered an epidemic of diabetes on this
desolate Pima Indian reservation in 1965, researchers realized they
had found the perfect living laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the adults over age 35 suffered from the
deadly disease. Though fairly isolated, they were just 40 miles
from Phoenix, and their lifestyles, though stable for centuries,
were suddenly and dramatically changing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after 34 years of research by the National Institutes of
Health, the Pima are the most studied people on the planet. They've
been weighed, poked, prodded, X-rayed and screened at a cost to
taxpayers of more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   But diabetes still rages out of control. Pimas are 12 times as
likely to die of the disease and four times as likely to have limbs
amputated because of it.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Pimas over 55 who have diabetes has skyrocketed to
80 percent from 45 percent, and every week, loved ones fill the
tribal cemeteries, mourning more victims of ``the Pima Plague.''
</P>
<P>
   Amputations and blindness are commonplace. Dialysis is a way of
life. Even children, who a generation ago were virtually
unaffected, are being diagnosed with diabetes with alarming
regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists still can't say for certain why diabetes has hit the
Pimas so hard, and there are those who fear the 11,500-member tribe
is in danger of being wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   And though the National Institutes of Health began testing
prevention measures three years ago, the question remains: Did they
do enough for the first three decades?
</P>
<P>
   The answer isn't simple, but a six-month investigation by ``The
Arizona'' ``Republic'' shows that at best, the war against diabetes
was delayed by bad timing and strategic miscalculations. At worst,
some Pimas say, they were sacrificed in the name of science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years of research for what?'' asks Franklin ``Pete''
Jackson, a community leader. ``What did we get for all of this? We
were human guinea pigs. They've just been watching diabetes take
its course, but the people here have been hoping for a cure.''
</P>
<P>
   NIH officials say they never misled the Pimas or promised them a
cure. But dozens of interviews and scores of documents show that
the agency, with its $15.6 billion tax-supported budget, made
critical decisions in the late 1970s and early 1980s that set back
the fight against diabetes by at least a decade. Now, those choices
are coming back to haunt the agency, not only in Arizona but around
the world. &QL; 
A WRONG TURN
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, the NIH decided put off prevention studies
involving the Pimas and focus the bulk of its resources on Type 1
diabetes, even though that form affects less than 10 percent of the
people with the disease. Type 1, commonly referred to as juvenile
diabetes, affects mostly Anglos. The Pimas suffer from Type 2, or
adult-onset, diabetes, which is nearing epidemic proportions among
minorities in the United States and in many Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   While NIH scientists continued to study the origins of Type 2
diabetes among the Pimas, they put off testing methods of
prevention until just three years ago. That decision forced the key
researcher on the Pima project to go to China to test Type 2
diabetes prevention methods, because the NIH would not fund that
experiment among the Pimas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Phillip Gorden, a director of the diabetes research branch
of the NIH, defends the decision, saying researchers had to seize
the scientific opportunity that was available to them at the time.
He said that the Type 1 study was more manageable and that new
technology had just become available for testing.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, critics say, that was a serious miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Broussard, director of the federal Indian Health
Services diabetes program in 1996 and 1997, said the NIH missed a
critical prevention opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were small fledgling efforts, but it was not enough for
the scale of the problem,'' she said. ``It was sort of like taking
the water hose out there for the forest fire.''
</P>
<P>
   A cure is nowhere in sight, especially not here in the Gila
River community. Nowhere in the world is diabetes more widespread
or more deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an epidemic happening,'' Broussard said. ``Can you
imagine living in a community where one out of every two adults has
diabetes . . . and to see children developing this condition?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Bennett, chief of the NIH Pima diabetes studies, said
his crew's mission has always been to decode and halt the disease.
But it took 17 years of basic science to understand enough about it
to begin testing prevention. Bennett originally estimated that the
research would take no more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   When Bennett first came to Gila River, very little was known
about what made people more vulnerable to the disease. But tribal
members became willing partners, with nearly 80 percent of the
population _ nearly 9,000 people in all _ submitting themselves to
exams, donating their blood and sharing their tragic family
histories.
</P>
<P>
   They were given glucose tolerance tests, weighed and measured,
and had their blood drawn, eyes and kidneys checked and X-rays
taken. To chart physical and biological changes showing
susceptibility to diabetes, the exams were repeated every two
years.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s Bennett's staff had figured out that obesity, a
lack of exercise and a family history of diabetes are the key risk
factors in the disease. &QL; 
`JUST A LITTLE SEED'
</P>
<P>
   By 1979, the NIH had come up with a plan to translate its
research into help for the Pimas, who live on the sprawling,
580-square-mile Gila River Reservation. The agency launched the
Tribal Chronic Illness Project in 1980 to help educate Pimas in
methods of preventing diabetes and arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   But the NIH budgeted only enough to hire two nurse
practitioners, one for arthritis and the other to deal with
diabetes. A community awareness program reached only 12 percent of
the community's population. Funding ran out in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NIH spent $150 million on the Type 1 project.
</P>
<P>
   Gorden, director of the NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases, said the Type 1 study helped reduce
the suffering of people with that form.
</P>
<P>
   Carried out from 1983 to 1993, the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial showed that intensive control of blood-sugar
levels through medication, diet and exercise can slow the onset and
advancement of eye, kidney and nerve diseases caused by Type 1
diabetes. The findings were considered a landmark. A United Kingdom
study released last fall showed that the lessons from the trial
apply to Type 2 patients as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the research didn't begin to extinguish the wildfire of
diabetes spreading among the Pimas.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mawby, the American Diabetes Association's vice
president for governmental relations, believes the agency had a
moral obligation to do more to help the Pimas.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the impact of diabetes was uncovered in the Native American
community and in the Pimas in particular, there was a
responsibility of the federal government to take more aggressive
steps to address the problem, and they haven't done that,'' Mawby
said. &QL; 
A LACK OF PREVENTION
</P>
<P>
   Well aware of the impatience of some Pima leaders with how long
the studies have gone without a solution to diabetes, Bennett and
his crew defend their studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the way diabetes is treated throughout the country
and the world is based on things that we learned with the Pima
Indians,'' said William Knowler, who oversaw the Gila River
studies. ``These studies have taught us a tremendous amount, but
they have not yet taught us how to eliminate the disease. So we
still have a way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Pima community, experts say flatly that they are not
impressed by the NIH's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ADA started looking at (medical research) funding for
diabetes in 1996, we were stunned by the abysmal state of diabetes
research at NIH,'' said Mawby, the ADA official.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the budget for the diabetes programs run by Indian
Health Services hovered at $7 million. That was supposed to cover
diabetes care for the Pimas and the other 500-plus Native American
groups in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If funding stood still, diabetes did not. Among many Native
American nations, the disease was mushrooming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone was slow to wake up to this evolving epidemic
of a disease,'' said David Nathan, a leading U.S. researcher who
participated in the NIH Type 1 study and who now leads the Type 2
prevention trial. &QL; 
GOING TO THE GRAVE
</P>
<P>
   Today, the same things that undermine the health of many
Americans, eating more processed food and exercising less, have
resulted in an alarming rate of obesity among the Pimas. It is not
unusual for Pima kindergartners to weigh more than 75 pounds or
adults to tip the scales at over 300. Scientists think the Pimas
may be predisposed to weight gain by ``thrifty'' genes developed
over generations of enduring drought cycles in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The theory goes that Pimas who survived times of famine were
those whose thrifty genes worked to store fat during times of
plenty. Now that food is amply available, the thrifty genes serve
only to bulk up bodies. Disastrously for the Pimas, obesity is a
major risk factor for diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Bennett's research team is one of dozens around the
world scrambling to identify the culprit diabetes genes.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the gene-hunting race heats up, more and more Pimas
continue to get diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Pima Gov. Mary Thomas, herself a diabetic, dreads the
possibility that diabetes will doom her tribe. She wants the Pimas
to take responsibility for their own health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shock my people by saying that if we don't get this in check
now, we'll become an extinct people 75 years from now,'' Thomas
said. &QL;

BIG ASSIST FROM FISET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Stephane Fiset has known Jocelyn Thibault since they
were goaltenders in Quebec during the 1993-94 season. But not until
Saturday's 3-1 Kings victory over the Chicago Blackhawks did Fiset
ever think there was a chance for a point against his former
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   It happened seven minutes into the second period with the
Blackhawks on the power play. Chicago was coming at Fiset, who made
the stop then lofted a long pass down ice to Chartrand, the Kings'
fourth-line right-winger, who beat Thibault for his first NHL goal.
</P>
<P>
   Chartrand said he and Fiset made eye contact as the play was
developing in the Kings end.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset said he was fighting for his life and never saw Chartrand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great play, he put it right on my stick,'' said
Chartrand, who also has two assists in his rookie season. `It was a
perfect pass. It looks like we worked that in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset and Thibault remain good friends from their brief time in
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not thinking about scoring on him,'' Fiset said.
``It's a situation where we stopped the puck and they were out of
position. They were really skating at me. That's the way they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep moving: The Kings flew out after the game and are off today
in Pittsburgh. But GM Dave Taylor will be busy.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor accompanied the team to Pittsburgh after Saturday's game
then flew this morning to Montreal for a scouting mission on two of
his top prospects _ goaltender Alexey Volkov and last year's top
pick left-winger Andrei Shefer.
</P>
<P>
   Volkov, 19, and Shefer, 18, are both Russian and playing for
Halifax in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a checkup that we do during the season to get a personal
view of what the guys are doing,'' Taylor said. ``These are playing
with a lot of talent that will help us for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Taylor will travel to Sweden for the World Junior
Championships, the top showcase for tomorrow's hockey talent. He
also will attend a tournament in Edmonton in February.
</P>
<P>
   Vaclav Nedomansky, the Kings top European scout, was
instrumental in bringing both to the club. He lives in Prague,
Czech Republic during the winter and Rancho Palos Verdes during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: Tuesday's matchup in Pittsburgh is the only game
on the trip that will be televised, and it will broadcast by ESPN.
With the time off, Kings TV announcers Bob Miller and Jim Fox took
their wives to Acapulco.

BRUINS STOP SABRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For the past week, Sergei Samsonov was subsisting on
Cream of Wheat, MetRx shakes, and mashed potatoes. The Bruin
forward was high-sticked in the face in Anaheim Oct. 24. He bit
down so hard on his tongue, he required eight stitches to close the
wound.
</P>
<P>
   As distasteful as the injury was _ no pun intended _ and as much
as he couldn't have been less excited about food, Samsonov hasn't
missed a beat. The flashy left wing scored a pair of goals (Nos. 3
and 4 of the season) as the Bruins knocked off the sloppy Buffalo
Sabres, 3-0, at the FleetCenter Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. Samsonov extended
his point streak to five games, with four goals and two assists in
that span.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout went to goalie John Grahame, the first of his NHL
career. Grahame is due to be shipped to Providence this week as
soon as Byron Dafoe is deemed fit to play.
</P>
<P>
   Grahame, who led Providence to the Calder Cup championship last
season, has been a steady and aggressive presence in the seven
games he has played this season. But with Rob Tallas having to
clear waivers and Grahame not, the Bruins' choice is clear. They
would never risk losing Tallas, especially with two expansion clubs
coming next year.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, Grahame made 26 stops on the way to his second
win of the year as the Bruins extended their winning streak to four
and their unbeaten streak to five games (4-0-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough, tough thing in my situation,'' said Grahame,
clearly distraught at the thought of a demotion. ``I'm trying to be
up here and prove that I belong to be up here. I think I played
well to this point and I think I deserve a chance to keep playing
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get sent down. It's going to be a tough few
days here to see what happens. I'm just trying to take advantage of
the opportunities I get and play well. That's all you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   As bittersweet a night as it was for Grahame, it was a banner
night for Samsonov, who has been getting his nutrition from a
blender the last week. He said part of his increased production
comes from playing alongside center Joe Thornton and right wing
Steve Heinze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm having a little bit more chances than at the
beginning of the year,'' said Samsonov. ``I can't really explain
why. Things are getting settled down right now. I'm feeling much
more comfortable with each game and I'm just trying to get used to
my partners, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite not being able to eat food in a solid state, Samsonov
said it hasn't affected his energy level. He figures in a couple of
days, he'll be able to go back to normal eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of weird,'' he said. ``I was still eating
normally, but I had no appetite because I knew it was going to
hurt. The first couple of days it hurt, but it feels much better
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres were without the services of goalie Dominik Hasek,
who severely injured his groin Friday late in Buffalo's 3-2
overtime win over Florida. Hasek is expected to be sidelined
several weeks. Martin Biron (31 saves) got the start in his stead
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins scored the game's first goal at 8:46. It was
essentially a power-play goal even though it was credited at
even-strength because it came at the exact second the penalty to
defenseman Alexei Zhitnik expired.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing P.J. Axelsson, who was positioned along the right-wing
boards, dished the puck up to defenseman Kyle McLaren at the right
point. McLaren's hard, low shot sailed into the net on Biron's
glove side.
</P>
<P>
   Just 46 seconds later, Boston made it a two-goal advantage on
Samsonov's first of the night. With right wing Rob DiMaio doing the
dirty work, Thornton set up shop behind the net. With Samsonov in
the slot, Thornton fed the puck out in front, and Samsonov rapped
it into the net, high to the glove side. Biron was so frustrated,
he fired the puck down the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Boston upped the ante in the middle period as Samsonov struck
again at 15:55. Heinze relayed a pass over to Thornton, who threw
it across the slot for Samsonov in the right circle. It was the
perfect sniper goal as Samsonov picked the right corner with a
forehander that nicked the crossbar before sailing into the net.

GRAHAME LEFT OUT AFTER SHUTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Their family has a lot less dysfunction Sunday morning
than it did 72 hours ago. The public war between Papa Harry and Big
Brother Byron is over. The nine-game winless streak at the
beginning of the season has been shoved off the mantel and replaced
with a plaque that reads ``4-0-1,'' a reference to the past five
games. And after watching the newest member of the family, Dave
Andreychuk, does anyone miss Dmitri Khristich?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Bruins just might be candidates for Family of the Year.
They beat the Sabres Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at the FleetCenter, 3-0. When
Byron Dafoe's picture was shown on the overhead scoreboard with
``He's Back'' scripted beneath it, the 16,863 fans responded with
one of their loudest ovations of the night. You could make an
argument that Saturday &UR;  &LR; night was truly the team's season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dafoe has his contract and the team is winning, you
wouldn't expect there to be dissatisfaction in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Well, unless your name happens to be John Grahame.
</P>
<P>
   This is what coach Pat Burns probably thought when Dafoe signed
a three-year contract Friday afternoon: ``Finally.'' This is what
the 24-year-old Grahame probably thought when he heard the news:
``Why didn't he hold out longer?''
</P>
<P>
   Grahame faced 26 Sabre shots Saturday &UR;  &LR; night and stopped them
all. He earned praise after the game from Burns and Dafoe. As
Grahame sat near his locker, he pointed to a fresh puck, a memento
from his first NHL shutout. It was there with two other pucks: one
from his first game and one from his first win. He knows his puck
collection will probably be suspended at three for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins can't possibly keep three goalies. Dafoe is being
paid more than $3 million a year, which is definitely not a
part-time salary. He is going to stay. Rob Tallas would have to
clear waivers before being sent to Providence, so he will probably
stay, too. Grahame does not have to clear waivers and would
probably benefit from playing in the AHL rather than sitting behind
Dafoe in the NHL. He will probably not stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the politics of the game,'' Grahame said. ``You wish
(decisions) were made on ability and how you perform but, you know,
sometimes it isn't. That's what sucks. That's the politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone tried to put things in perspective for Grahame: If he
goes to Providence, where he set an AHL record last season with 19
consecutive wins, at least he will see ice time. Wouldn't he rather
do that than sit behind one of the NHL's best goaltenders?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough question,'' Grahame said. ``(Dafoe's) obviously
the No. 1 guy. It's a tough question. I don't want to be sent down.
And no, I don't think I'd be happy sitting. That's why it's a tough
question.''
</P>
<P>
   What would you do if you were president/general manager Harry
Sinden and assistant GM Mike O'Connell? Would you try and trade
Tallas for scoring help? Or would you simply point to I-95 and tell
Grahame that's the quickest route to Rhode Island?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any mystery,'' Burns said. He followed that
up with, ``I don't think we'll keep three goaltenders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins don't have to rush into any decision. They don't play
again until Thursday when they play host to New Jersey. Anyway,
isn't talking about personnel a lot more fun than analyzing the
incentives of a contract?
</P>
<P>
   Grahame has to wonder where he will fit in Bruin history. His
father, Ron, was a goaltender for 40 games in 1977-78 (26-6-7).
Pretty good, right? Well, his father was rewarded by being traded
to Los Angeles for the rights to the eighth pick in the draft. That
pick became Ray Bourque. More than 20 years later, Ron's son
registers his first career shutout and, possibly, is asked to leave
town in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the younger Grahame, he will be leaving as the
party begins. Burns insisted the Bruins are playing the same as
they did during their nine-game streak. The difference, the coach
said, is confidence. But it's hard to hear that when a team doesn't
have any wins.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Bruins look _ and win _ like one of the best teams in
the Eastern Conference. Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, Sergei Samsonov had two
goals, Ken Belanger and Hal Gill played as if they had a
put-a-Sabre-on-his-backside quota, and Andreychuk simply starred as
himself. (Andreychuk note: Forget about objectivity. I love
watching the guy play.)
</P>
<P>
   After their chaotic start, everything seems to be tilting in the
Bruins' favor. Tallas is hurting and needs rest, while Dafoe is
rusty and needs to practice. So in the next few days, that's what
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Things aren't so neat for Grahame. He has nothing to prove in
the AHL. He won a championship there last season. He won 37
regular-season games and 15 more in the playoffs. He has nothing
against the city of Providence (``Oh, no. It's a great place to
play''). But he doesn't want to go back.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, he sat at his locker with his head down. He had
a good idea of what was coming next. It's unfair. The only solace
for Grahame is that every family has an unfair story or two.

QB CHANGE ONLY UPSIDE FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY _ USC finally found the bright side to blowing a
21-point lead. It means you scored at least three touchdowns before
you squandered them.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans never even had a lead Saturday, let alone a chance
to blow one, in a dreary 17-7 loss to California before 54,000 at
Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was USC's fourth loss in October and nearly extinguished the
Trojans' bowl hopes. Oh, and on a distracting note, the Trojans
seem on the verge of changing their starting quarterback. More on
that later.
</P>
<P>
   This loss was so devoid of emotion, it opened a flurry of hard
questions for USC coach Paul Hackett. Namely, because the Trojans
have lost four consecutive games for the first time since 1991 and
barely managed seven points against a nondescript Cal team.
</P>
<P>
   Does Hackett feel pressure on his job?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. No more than I put on myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is Hackett going to re-evaluate his coaching staff?
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the season, you always do that,'' he said.
``We've got four games left.''
</P>
<P>
   But there will be changes immediately, it appears. Hackett saw
enough of junior quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst, and replaced him
on the second drive of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst threw an interception to Cal's Deltha O'Neal, who
returned it 67 yards for a touchdown to give the Bears a 7-0 lead.
Van Raaphorst also fumbled in the first quarter, which resulted in
a missed Cal field goal, and was sacked seven times.
</P>
<P>
   John Fox came in with USC trailing 10-0 and the Trojans quickly
drove to the Cal 17, before tailback Sultan McCullough fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   On his next drive, Fox threw a 72-yard touchdown pass to Kareem
Kelly that cut the lead to 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   USC failed to score again, but it's clear Hackett is leaning
toward starting Fox next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's John's turn. It's his time,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was sure Fox would start, he added, ``We'll have to
think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was clearly pleased with most of Fox's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some real electricity I haven't seen for awhile.
John Fox ... was a part of that,'' Hackett said. ``The first ball
out of his hand was entirely different. John has a strong arm. He
moves around well.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox passed for 226 yards and his touchdown to Kelly was his
first since November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As for Van Raaphorst, he was just trying to figure out why he
was removed.
</P>
<P>
   With the Trojans trailing 7-0 at halftime, Hackett said he
decided to give Van Raaphorst one series before going with Fox. But
Van Raaphorst said Hackett told him he would sit out a series
before returning to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was playing decently,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``I
didn't know I wasn't going to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox admitted he was almost as stunned, but in a pleasant way,
that he was inserted into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was. I was prepared. But I was surprised,'' Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   USC's players were impressed by Fox's energy, even though it
only translated into seven points.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver R. Jay Soward, whose strained hamstring felt stiff
in warm-ups and missed the game, noticed the difference from the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one thing for John Fox: He's not going to let people
sack him,'' Soward said. ``He tried to make more plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The mini-quarterback controversy will probably be the topic of
the week for the Trojans. It's a whole lot better than pondering
the rest of this lost season. USC must win all four remaining games
just to be eligible for a bowl bid. But that's a rather unrealistic
goal considering the state of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to win one game,'' Hackett said. ``You drop
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we looked at the schedule, we felt we had a chance to
sweep (the final four games). Now, the sweep feels hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Van Raaphorst's interception and McCullough's fumble,
USC was also undone when tight end Antoine Harris fumbled to end a
drive in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to do too much, trying to make a big play instead
of tucking the ball away,'' Harris said. ``I'm just trying to do
too many things at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said it's a common problem among the Trojans right now as
they desperately try to end their losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's a little low, we want to win so bad, we're a
little tight,'' Harris said. ``We're overanxious to win.''

UCLA FORGES NEW EMBARRASSMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ The magic returned to the Rose Bowl on Saturday...
for about seven minutes. Then it was more of the same for
struggling, stumbling UCLA, which watched helplessly as its early
lead evaporated and Arizona rolled to a 33-7 victory before 42,612.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Bruins' third consecutive loss and their fifth in the
past six games, marking their worst stretch since dropping six
straight in the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the defeat eliminated the two-time defending
Pacific-10 champions from bowl contention before Nov. 1 _ an
ignominious development no one could have foreseen three weeks ago,
after a rousing victory over Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very depressed,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said of his
players earlier in the week. ``They're discouraged. They're not
very confident in the coaches, in the system, in their teammates
and in themselves. We've got a morale problem in that sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we've got to remain positive, and continue to try
to get better. We've got a bye (Nov. 6), so let's work hard to get
through (the Arizona game), then go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (3-6, 1-5) had no more success against Arizona than
they did against Oregon State a week ago. After two impressive
drives propelled them to a 7-0 lead, they quickly reverted to
recent form _ unable to move the ball, unable to stop their
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats own the best collection of offensive talent in the
Pac-10, and they responded to the early deficit with scores on four
of five possessions to take a 20-7 lead into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Keith Smith, a senior from Newbury Park, did most of
the damage. The Bruins were so concerned about Smith's quick feet
that they didn't blitz. That gave him plenty of time to pick apart
UCLA's porous, passive secondary, and he completed 16 of 26 passes
for 237 yards in the decisive first half.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was it? In the third quarter alone, Arizona had 187
yards offense, while UCLA had 26.
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it? The Bruins' once-daunting offense has scored two
touchdowns in the last 13 quarters.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's first drive Saturday night started well but ended poorly.
After quarterback Cory Paus hit receiver Freddie Mitchell for 19
yards deep in Arizona territory, the offense sputtered. Chris
Griffith's 25-yard field goal was blocked, and the Bruins walked
away with no points.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, UCLA forced Arizona to punt on its first
possession, and the Bruins took over at their 35. A few plays
later, Paus rolled left, waited, then found receiver Brad Melsby
wide open on the right side. The 44-yard touchdown pass gave UCLA a
7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't last long. The Wildcats responded with a nine-play,
51-yard drive that ended with Sean Keel's 31-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief (and unproductive) UCLA possession, Arizona took
control. Its touchdown drive took eight plays, consumed 2:18, and
included two long passes from Smith to receiver Bobby Wade, who was
wide open on both. Tailback Trung Canidate put the Wildcats ahead
10-7 with a 3-yard run with 1:20 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins tried running the option with reserve quarterback
Drew Bennett, but it was unsuccessful. Paus returned, and his
third-down pass was deflected. UCLA punted again.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona gained possession at its 14. It could have been the 4,
or the 1 _ it really didn't matter. The Bruins were helpless to
stop Arizona's attack. Smith found Ortege Jenkins, then Dennis
Northcutt, then Northcutt again and again.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' lead expanded to 17-7 when Smith hit tight end
Brandon Manumaleuna in the end zone. UCLA linebacker Tony White and
cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. collided with each other a few yards
away.

LAPERRIERE INSPIRES KINGS IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ You can't measure Ian Laperriere's heart on a stat
sheet, but you can understand the Kings' success by the gash over
his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere didn't get a goal in Saturday night's 3-1 victory
over the Chicago Blackhawks in front of 14,694 at the United
Center. Never got close. But when he twice took on Blackhawks
strongman Bryan McCabe for slashing Ziggy Palffy, Laperriere scored
big points with his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed that stuff like that isn't going to happen to his
team,'' said Luc Robitaille, the Kings' leading scorer. ``On
winning teams, everyone pitches in, covers the other guys. We are
so happy to have Lappy around. This is the first year he has had a
chance to play regularly. He has shown all season that he
belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' (8-3-2) improbable rise to the top of the Western
Conference is due as much to efforts like Laperriere's as it is to
Robitaille's league-tying 10 goals. The team obviously brought its
grit back on the road Saturday, where it opened the season with a
surprising 4-2-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings turned around a couple of poor games to open the
Staples Center and the victory over Chicago was their fourth
straight. And as his teammates slapped Laperriere on the back as
they dressed for their flight to Pittsburgh, it was clear why his
game was so important.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were outshot 36-22, but they kept the Blackhawks, who
were coming off an impressive victory in Detroit, scoreless on six
power-play opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, McCabe went after Palffy behind the Chicago net
midway through the third period, slashing him on the left forearm
then taking out his legs. Palffy went down hard and crashed into
the boards. He stayed down for more than a minute then limped off
the ice but did return.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere went after McCabe with several shots to the head. At
6-foot-1 and 201 pounds, Laperriere is hardly a goon, but he
certainly looked like he knew what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ziggy is our best player and I couldn't let them do that,''
Laperriere said. ``That is why I am out there. I saw what he did
and I just snapped. To keep playing the way we have, we have to
show teams like Chicago, which always plays rough, that we won't be
intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere has never scored more than eight goals in his first
four seasons with the Kings. He was shuttled between the third and
fourth lines and didn't become part of the club's regular rotation.
He scored his only goal this season during the team's worst game, a
timid 6-3 loss to Phoenix 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the coach (Andy Murray) rewards hard work,'' said
Laperriere, who has had several run-ins with Chicago in the past.
``We have regrouped since the Phoenix game and the main thing is we
are showing the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Kings already led 1-0 on a goal by Glen Murray
when Laperriere first left his mark midway through the second.
McCabe cross checked Palffy in the back and Laperriere started a
brawl that resulted in a two-minute minor for instigating, a
five-minute major for fighting and a 10-minute misconduct penalty.
</P>
<P>
   It left the Kings at a physical disadvantage, but emotionally
they were intact. With Chicago on the power play, Brad Chartrand
scored a short-handed goal on a long, floating pass from Kings
goalie Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, they made it 3-0 on Rob Blake's sixth goal
of the season, a blast from the point that beat Chicago goalie
Jocelyn Thibault. But this game was not won by goals alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stand up for your teammates, especially on the
road,'' said Fiset, who allowed only a late goal by Alexei Zhaminov
to raise his personal record to 7-3-2. ``Lappy? He had some
night.''

THINGS GET WORSE FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ The magic returned to the Rose Bowl on Saturday....
for about seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was more of the same for struggling, stumbling UCLA,
which watched helplessly as its early lead evaporated and Arizona
rolled to a 33-7 victory before 42,612 fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Bruins' third consecutive loss and their fifth in the
last six games, marking their worst stretch since dropping six

</P>
<P>
   In addition, the defeat eliminated UCLA from bowl contention
before November 1 _ an ignominious development no one could have
foreseen three weeks ago, after a rousing victory over Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real painful to see us lose like this,'' said senior
fullback Durell Price, who gave an emotional locker-room speech
following the game. ``We're better than 3-6. It's frustrating to be
a senior and not have a chance to grow up with these young guys
next year, when the tables will turn. Right now, it's just a down
period.''
</P>
<P>
   How down?
</P>
<P>
   _Arizona had nine sacks and held the Bruins to minus-31 yards
rushing, close to the school record of minus-37 against Syracuse in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   _The Bruins' once-daunting offense has scored two touchdowns in
the last 13 quarters.
</P>
<P>
   _Arizona gained 588 yards, including 307 rushing _ meaning the
Bruins have allowed 1,518 total yards in their last three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through some big, big growing pains,'' Bruins
coach Bob Toledo said. ``We're a young team, a beat-up team. It's a
difficult time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the one thing I talked to the team about is we're going to
stick together. There won't be a crack in the foundation. We're
going to continue to battle. We had some good years. Now we're
going through a tough time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (3-6, 1-5) had no more success against Arizona than
they did against Oregon State a week ago. After two impressive
drives propelled them to a 7-0 lead, they quickly reverted to
recent form _ unable to move the ball, unable to stop their
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats responded to the early deficit with scores on four
of five possessions to take a 20-7 lead into the locker room. The
margin forced UCLA to abandon its game plan (establish a running
attack) and pass on almost every down. That allowed the Wildcats'
pass rushers to gun for the quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to throw too much, and when you throw, they tee off
on you,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona quarterback Keith Smith, a senior from Newbury Park, did
most of the damage. The Bruins were so concerned about Smith's
quick feet that they didn't blitz. That gave him plenty of time to
pick apart UCLA's porous, passive secondary. With the help of a
no-huddle attack, Smith called his own plays and completed 17 of 29
passes for 281 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I call my own plays, I get real comfortable,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA jumped to its best start in three weeks when, midway
through the first quarter, quarterback Cory Paus rolled left and
found receiver Brad Melsby wide open on the right side. The 44-yard
touchdown gave UCLA a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't last long. The Wildcats responded with a nine-play,
51-yard drive that ended with Sean Keel's 31-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief (and unproductive) UCLA possession, Arizona took

included two long passes from Smith to receiver Bobby Wade, who was

Embassy 20 years ago this week (Nov. 4) is their Bunker Hill; their
Boston Tea Party. It galvanized their revolutionary fervor as they
took on the ``Den of Spies'' that had helped install and support
the brutal, dictatorial Shah. The takeover symbolized a revolution
that changed the atmosphere of the Middle East and helped create
now-familiar buzzwords like ``Islamic fundamentalism'' and
``Hezbollah.'' And, it shocked the West into realizing that
religion was still a force in world politics. (Just a year before
the revolution, Jimmy Carter called Iran ``an island of
stability.'') Today in Iran, the takeover highlights the country's
identity crisis. Any criticism of the takeover is still
controversial. But the radical fervor has long been cast aside as
most Iranians who seek a new pragmatism and freedom. (Kaplow, Cox
News Service)..

   IRAN-REFORM _ TEHRAN, Iran _ Some of those involved in the
embassy takeover, and President Mohammad Khatami, have tried to
move U.S.-Iranian relations carefully forward. The gift shop that
sold souvenirs fromn the takeover has long ago closed and many of
the former hostage takers are risking their freedom now trying to
open up the closed Iranian system that the embassy takeover helped
create. A profile of a former hostage taker. (Kaplow, Cox News

Carter presidency and led to an enormous rupture in Middle East

   WACO-MILITARY _WACO, Texas _ Images of the military's
involvement at Mount Carmel still wind through our collective
memory six years later. Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Abrams tanks
roamed the landscape outside Waco in 1993 from one edge of the TV
screen to the other. Behind the scenes, there were caches of
generators, gas masks and night vision equipment. But documents
released to Cox Newspapers under the Freedom of Information Act
show the military was for the most part a reluctant participant.
After a bitter internal struggle, it scaled back its assistance to
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as the agency prepared
to raid the Branch Davidian compound and during the siege refused
to sign off on the FBI's tear gas assault. (England, Waco

   MARATHON-SLOWS (Undated) _ The universal symbol of running has
always been the winged foot, an embodiment of the pursuit of speed.
But that emblem has begun to give way to a new symbol _ the penguin
_ that reflects a growing movement of extremely slow runners who
are changing the character of American road racing. Embracing a
kind of slow chic, this new breed of runners emphasizes fun over
achievement, rejecting the traditional asceticism of road racing
for a more relaxed, uncompetitive ethos. They have cheerfully
adopted the penguin for its girth and its waddling gait, and they
amble their way through marathons, stopping not only for a drink
but to dance or cheer or simply take in the flowers. Many members
of this new wave in running will be on display Sunday during the

<P>
   A typical day for Melanie Sawyer involves singing ``Itsy Bitsy
Spider'' a dozen times, wiping away drool from wet chins and
chasing after the occasional toddler who has had enough. Sally
Nachamkin has a full repertory of routines, and always brings her
puppets and props _ so many that when her son was a child he
thought his mother worked as a clown.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Sawyer and Ms. Nachamkin are not clowns or day-care
workers. They are baby wranglers, a strange but apt title for a job
that involves drawing the appropriate reaction from babies and
children under the age of 12 for advertising or editorial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   These days are flush times for wranglers. They make good symbols
of what has become a boom in advertising and marketing directed at
children and parents.
</P>
<P>
   An awful lot is riding on the tiny shoulders that the wranglers
try to keep in line. In advertising, a single photograph of a child
could form the center of a multimillion-dollar campaign. On the
editorial front, publications like Parents magazine say cover
photographs, typically featuring babies, help them sell millions of
copies each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every little shot could ultimately be worth millions when you
think of how much companies spend in advertising,'' said Ms.
Nachamkin, who has so much work that she has incorporated as SL
Riser Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Total advertising and marketing dollars aimed at children, from
television and print advertising to sales promotion, in-school
advertising and product placements in movies, easily exceeds $12
billion, said Dr. James U. McNeal, professor of marketing at Texas
A&AMP;M University and author of ``The Kids' Market: Myths and
Realities'' (Paramount Market Publishing, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   The market took off in the 1980s with the growth of children's
media like the Nickelodeon television network and the burgeoning
awareness that children had growing disposable incomes, McNeal
said. In addition, marketers of formerly adult-only products
started making lines just for children, like personal-care items,
designer clothes and furnishings, and consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Television advertising alone has exploded from about $100
million aimed at children in 1983 to about $1 billion in 1997,
McNeal said. And sales promotion _ which includes things like event
marketing, point-of-purchase advertising and children's clubs _ is
growing at an even faster rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enormous,'' McNeal said. ``Today, just about everyone is
marketing to kids, and it's no longer limited to what I call the
traditional playthings and sweet things. It's the nontraditional
markets, too: the hospitality industry, the auto industry, the
airline industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But so much marketing is directed at children that a group of
psychologists recently wrote to the American Psychological
Association asking it to denounce the use of psychological research
in pitching products to children. The association referred the
issue to its internal board on children, youth and family issues.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of advertising is also aimed at parents, maybe with a
cute baby as bait. Parents magazine, which is owned by Bertelsmann
AG, reports that its advertising is up this year, partly because
advertisers of trendy items like home furnishings that once
eschewed parents' magazines as unsexy are now seeing the dollar
power of parents as a market, said Sharon Summer, the publisher of
Parents magazine and Child magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of cases the idea is to persuade the parent because
the average 8- or 9-year-old doesn't just go out and buy
something,'' said Joe Mandese, editor of The Myers Report, a media
industry newsletter. ``It's really the mom and dad target.''
</P>
<P>
   A good wrangler can elicit the kind of reaction that pulls at
parents' heartstrings, the editors at Parents magazine said. Ms.
Nachamkin has so much work as a wrangler that she turns away work
and refers clients to the half-dozen other wranglers she knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's delicate work,'' Ms. Nachamkin said. ``The gift of a
wrangler is to create spontaneous reaction in a child, and that
reaction has to be a joyful one, no matter what the circumstances
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``circumstances'' are abundant. On a location shoot, it
might be rainy, or too hot or too cold. In a studio, the lighting
might break. The product could fall apart. The crew might
unexpectedly have to wait for studio time _ not a pleasant
experience when there are 2-year-olds to deal with. Then there are
the ordinary pitfalls like cranky children who did not take a nap,
teething babies, ornery toddlers and the occasional child who
throws a tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent cover shoot for Parents magazine, on which Ms.
Sawyer worked with her husband, Rudy LeCoadic, who is a
photographer, the magazine painstakingly narrowed down its choice
of 11 children from a casting call of about 200 babies. Then it
selected one picture from about 30 rolls of film taken at the
shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be incredibly special,'' Sally Lee, the editor in
chief of Parents magazine, said of a cover photograph, adding that
the magazine spends much time, energy and money to maintain its
overall quality. ``Something mediocre is never good enough for
us,'' Ms. Lee added. ``It has to be top-notch or else we'll
reshoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrangler must protect the child from any high-stakes tension
in the air. It is the wrangler's job to keep the mood upbeat,
happy, even fun. Children are especially sensitive to the
atmosphere, and feelings are contagious, Ms. Nachamkin said. One
crying baby can make for a houseful of crying babies _ and a doomed
shoot.
</P>
<P>
   This upbeat atmosphere has to be accomplished amid maybe a dozen
people on site, including a stylist, a makeup artist, a
photographer's assistant and the all-important client.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of this pressure, the wrangler is dancing, singing
and making motions above the photographer's head to get the child
to smile and look into the lens.
</P>
<P>
   Wrangling is an unusual job that requires little formal
training. Ms. Nachamkin is a former clinical social worker with a
background in theater. Ms. Sawyer, who also works as a fashion
model, has been a wrangler for two years and has no children.
</P>
<P>
   The work pays well. Ms. Nachamkin said her fees range from $450
to $800 a day, depending on the job. Ms. Nachamkin started in the
business as a stylist on the set, and now her services have
broadened to include everything from casting children to finding
stylists, set designers and hair and makeup people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Editorial work traditionally pays the lowest rates. But often
that work is more creative and can be used for a portfolio.
Catalogs, which often feature children and babies, also pay as low
as $250 a day, but the wrangler often gets a commitment of, say, 15
shooting days.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the business also requires wranglers to work with
parents, which is not always easy. Ms. Nachamkin sometimes has to
turn away gifts from parents that may be intended to curry favor
with her as a casting agent.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents are vulnerable because they have invested their own
hopes and dreams in the child's modeling career. At the Parents
magazine shoot, one mother was visibly concerned when her child had
trouble sitting still, and she apologized profusely. The
photographer took it in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some babies last just a bit; others you have forever,''
LeCoadic said, without a hint of agitation. ``If they are tired or
hungry _ that's it. That's why we have 10 or 12 babies for one
shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Nachamkin said she had sat down with many a parent to
explain the rigors of the job, for both parent and child. All
children have good and bad days, but some children are not
temperamentally suited for modeling work. It is a mistake to think
that the child featured was just the most physically beautiful of
the lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child here is beautiful,'' said Alice Calabrese, who was
with her 10-month-old twins at the Parents magazine shoot and has
two pre-teen-agers who have modeled since they were babies. ``You
don't have to be the most beautiful; you have to be the most
cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every commercial shoot has the budget for a wrangler. In
fact, on low-budget productions, Mrs. Calabrese often finds herself
on the set trying to elicit reactions from her twins. She would
much rather have a wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't want to let go, but the wranglers are great
because they know how to work with babies,'' Mrs. Calabrese said.
``And you know right away if they're good, because the babies have
to love them. It looks like an easy job, but it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is something about the term ``wrangling'' that Mrs.
Calabrese said had a way of connoting a lasso. For Ms. Nachamkin,
though, it helps define the job. Hollywood has always had some form
of wrangler, but today, art directors, photographers and others in
the advertising business are recognizing wrangling as a bona fide
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think wranglers were one of the most misunderstood crafts,''
Ms. Nachamkin said. ``People used to say, `Oh, we just need someone
to handle the kids.' But if that child isn't there to perform, that
shoot won't happen. It takes incredible energy to do the job.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scientists at a variety of elite laboratories
around the country are sharing a growing sense that they are on the
brink of a new era in digital electronics. It will usher in a world
of circuits no more than a few atoms wide, with a potential impact
on computing, in terms of speed and memory, that may be too
profound to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in July that a group of researchers at
Hewlett-Packard and the University of California at Los Angeles
reported that they had successfully fashioned rudimentary
electronic logic gates _ a basic component of computing _ that were
the thickness of a single molecule. Now other groups are preparing
to announce that they have succeeded in creating other basic
computing components at this ultramicroscopic scale, known as
molecular electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Yale and Rice Universities, for example, plan to
report in the journal Science in a few weeks that they have taken
an important step past the Hewlett-UCLA work. In the July
demonstration, the molecular gate could be made to move into open
or shut positions, but could not be switched back again. But the
Yale-Rice team says it has created molecular-scale switches that
can be repeatedly opened and shut _ a necessary step in
representing zeros and ones, the basic binary signals used in the
circuitry of digital transistors.
</P>
<P>
   And now Hewlett-Packard scientists say they have recently taken
an important step toward creating rows of conductive wires that are
less than a dozen atoms across _ a crucial part of hooking together
the molecule-sized switches that could one day result in computers
vastly faster than today's.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid sequence of breakthroughs is giving the researchers a
new sense of confidence. ``We're on the scent, and we know the fox
is out there,'' said Stan Williams, a Hewlett-Packard physicist who
is a pioneer in molecular electronics.
</P>
<P>
   According to the buzz in this research community, meanwhile,
other laboratories are making progress on a number of fronts,
working under top-secret conditions. One of these labs is said to
be working on a molecular device capable of holding random-access
memory, or RAM.
</P>
<P>
   If molecular memory devices could be constructed, they might
offer vast storage capabilities for just pennies in cost. One
near-term application might be to permanently store an entire
DVD-quality movie in a space much smaller than a conventional
semiconductor chip.
</P>
<P>
   As an applied science, molecular electronics would begin at a
minute scale far beyond the theoretical boundaries of the
conventional technology of silicon transistors.
</P>
<P>
   Today's silicon-based microelectronic devices have a minimum
size between electrical components of 0.18 micron (about
one-thousandth the thickness of a human hair) and could potentially
go as small as 0.10 micron. That would be 100-billionths of a
meter, or 100 nanometers.
</P>
<P>
   But in molecular electronics, the smallest components may be
able to shrink to one-hundredth that size _ a single nanometer. The
difference could mean chips exponentially more powerful than
anything of a comparable size today or computing devices
unimaginably tiny by contemporary standards.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rapid pace of advance has led to a palpable sense of
mission among a small group of physicists, chemists and computer
designers, who until recently were viewed as impractical dreamers
by much of the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two to five years, you will begin to see functioning
circuits which are of recognizable utility,'' said John Ellenbogen,
a molecular electronics researcher at Mitre Corp., a research
center for the military and private industry.
</P>
<P>
   Such optimism leads a number of researchers to believe that
rapidly cascading advances in molecular-scale science may soon
constitute what economists refer to as a disruptive technology _
one that changes basic industrial assumptions, just as the
transistor did in replacing the vacuum tube during the 1950s, and
as integrated circuits overtook individual transistors during the
1960s. Some molecular electronics researchers envision an entirely
new industry, perhaps within the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of such a revolution would be immense and
possibly destabilizing for the world's semiconductor industry.
Although the chip industry now believes that it sees a path at
least until 2014 for making ever-smaller solid-state silicon
devices, the cost of the manufacturing systems needed to make the
chips is enormous _ and continuing to mount with each new chip
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Today's semiconductor chips are made in multibillion-dollar
fabrication plants _ or ``fabs'' _ that use light waves to etch
successive layers of circuitry on a silicon substrate. It is an
expensive process, in part because of the high cost of creating and
maintaining the ``clean rooms'' required for avoiding contamination
by dust. But researchers in molecular electronics are optimistic
that they will be able to use much less finicky methods by creating
chemical reactions that ``self-assemble'' vast numbers of
molecular-scale circuits at infinitesimal cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should scare the pants off anyone working in silicon,''
said Mark Reed, a Yale University chemist, who is co-author of the
forthcoming Science article and co-leader of a related memory
project to be announced Dec. 6 at the International Electron Device
Meeting in Washington. ``It will be dirt cheap and it will create a
discontinuity.''
</P>
<P>
   A colleague in the field agrees. ``If you can make computers as
easily as photographic film, then a lot of companies are going to
be wondering what they're doing with their $15 billion fabs,'' said
James Heath, a UCLA chemist who is part of the Pentagon-financed
Hewlett-Packard-UCLA research team that demonstrated molecular
logic gates last summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The vision of a new industry has captured government and
corporate attention. The Clinton administration is now considering
the possibility of a National Nanotechnology Initiative as early as
next January to set up financing and help organize diverse research
activities in nanotechnology _ a range of manufacturing
technologies that begin at the scale of individual molecules.
Moreover, a number of computer and semiconductor companies, led by
Sun Microsystems and Motorola, have been quietly meeting with
scientists to discuss the formation of an industry consortium to
seek commercial applications for molecular electronics.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, researchers acknowledge that so far they have taken
only the first baby steps toward the larger challenge of building
molecular-scale computers. No one, for example, has figured out how
to interconnect billions and billions of molecular switches with
wires 11 atoms in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like we're a year before the invention of the
transistor and we're asking: `What does solid state look like?'''
said Paul Saffo, a researcher at the Institute for the Future who
has tracked the development of new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a general agreement that if such systems are to be
assembled into workable computers, it will require radically new
architectures alien to today's semiconductor-based computers.
</P>
<P>
   At Hewlett-Packard, at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Laboratory of Computer Science and at Mitre, computer
scientists are beginning to explore computer architectures that are
far more fault-tolerant than today's microelectronic computers and
whose structures resemble biological systems.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing might involve assembling trillions of circuits and
then identifying and mapping out the bad ones _ much as faulty
sectors are declared off limits in today's disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to program with what we've got,'' said James Tour,
a molecular scientist at Rice University. ``It's a very biological
approach. Everyone's brain is the same, but the pathways are all
unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the research financing in this field now comes from the
Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. ``We've built
this entire program on the idea of thinking differently,'' William
Warren, a program manager at the agency, said. ``We don't want to
be standing on the shoulders of silicon.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the recent first steps toward eventual
self-sufficiency have created such excitement in the molecular
computing research community, a group that for years had a
consistent vision but no empirical results.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us were constantly on the defensive,'' Ellenbogen, the
Mitre researcher, recalled. ``Although we believed in some rational
way this was the way to go, among ourselves we were continually
forced to reassure ourselves that we weren't crazy.''

CITIBANK, BREAKING BARRIER, WILL OPEN BRANCH IN ISRAEL

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Breaking into a long-protected local market,
Citibank Sunday became the first international bank authorized to
set up a full-service branch in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank's entry into the state-dominated local banking business
``is one of the most significant financial events in the history of
Israel,'' said Jacob Frenkel, the president of the Bank of Israel,
an outspoken advocate of the deregulation and privatization of the
Israeli banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Frenkel, who spoke at a news conference here, said competition
from Citibank should improve service at Israel's banks and press
the government to open the banks further to local and foreign
investment. Following Citibank's lead, other foreign banks have
also applied to set up branch offices in Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford I. Weill, chairman of Citigroup, the parent of Citibank,
said at the news conference that growth in Israel's high-technology
industries had persuaded the company to accelerate plans for a
full-service branch operation. ``As a company, we like to follow
where technology is going,'' he said. The ``progress being made in
the peace process'' and the expectation of increased trade ``to and
from Israel and other parts of the Middle East'' were also factors,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the new branch will deal only with corporate
customers, with a focus on cash management and trade finance. Many
Israeli companies have long gone to New York, London and elsewhere
for financing and foreign exchange transactions. Having a branch
here will allow Citibank ``to deal with local companies on a local
basis,'' Weill added.
</P>
<P>
   But Weill did not rule out a further expansion into private and
retail banking or direct investment in an Israeli bank. The
government plans to sell more of its holdings in the three biggest
Israeli banks _ Hapaolim, Leumi and the Israel Discount Bank _
which together control about three-quarters of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Though an Israeli branch of Citibank would represent only a
minor expansion for Citigroup, it should have a significant effect
on the banking business in Israel, Frenkel said. Citibank officials
agreed, saying they expect to see several competitors set up shop
here. ``We see the possibility that Israel could in this region
become an international financial center,'' said William R. Rhodes,
Citigroup's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank plans to open the new office in Tel Aviv by the middle
of next year, Weill said. Three years ago, it opened a
representative office in Tel Aviv that cannot issue loans or
conduct other business here directly. Citigroup's investment
banking subsidiary, Salomon Smith Barney, also has a representative
office in Tel Aviv.

 SAN FRANCISCO: last summer. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vision of a new industry has captured government and
corporate attention. The Clinton administration is now considering
the possibility of a National Nanotechnology Initiative as early as
next January to set up financing and help organize diverse research
activities in nanotechnology _ a range of manufacturing
technologies that begin at the scale of individual molecules.
Moreover, a number of computer and semiconductor companies, led by
Sun Microsystems and Motorola, have been quietly meeting with
scientists to discuss the formation of an industry consortium to
seek commercial applications for molecular electronics.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, researchers acknowledge that so far they have taken
only the first baby steps toward the larger challenge of building
molecular-scale computers. No one, for example, has figured out how
to interconnect billions and billions of molecular switches with
wires 11 atoms in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like we're a year before the invention of the
transistor and we're asking: `What does solid state look like?'''
said Paul Saffo, a researcher at the Institute for the Future who
has tracked the development of new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a general agreement that if such systems are to be
assembled into workable computers, it will require radically new
architectures alien to today's semiconductor-based computers.
</P>
<P>
   At Hewlett-Packard, at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Laboratory of Computer Science and at Mitre, computer
scientists are beginning to explore computer architectures that are
far more fault-tolerant than today's microelectronic computers and
whose structures resemble biological systems.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing might involve assembling trillions of circuits and
then identifying and mapping out the bad ones _ much as faulty
sectors are declared off limits in today's disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to program with what we've got,'' said James Tour,
a molecular scientist at Rice University. ``It's a very biological
approach. Everyone's brain is the same, but the pathways are all
unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the research financing in this field now comes from the
Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. ``We've built
this entire program on the idea of thinking differently,'' William
Warren, a program manager at the agency, said. ``We don't want to
be standing on the shoulders of silicon.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the recent first steps toward eventual
self-sufficiency have created such excitement in the molecular
computing research community, a group that for years had a
consistent vision but no empirical results.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us were constantly on the defensive,'' Ellenbogen, the
Mitre researcher, recalled. ``Although we believed in some rational
way this was the way to go, among ourselves we were continually
forced to reassure ourselves that we weren't crazy.''

 UNDATED: makeup people.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editorial work traditionally pays the lowest rates. But often
that work is more creative and can be used for a portfolio.
Catalogs, which often feature children and babies, also pay as low
as $250 a day, but the wrangler often gets a commitment of, say, 15
shooting days.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the business also requires wranglers to work with
parents, which is not always easy. Ms. Nachamkin sometimes has to
turn away gifts from parents that may be intended to curry favor
with her as a casting agent.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents are vulnerable because they have invested their own
hopes and dreams in the child's modeling career. At the Parents
magazine shoot, one mother was visibly concerned when her child had
trouble sitting still, and she apologized profusely. The
photographer took it in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some babies last just a bit; others you have forever,''
LeCoadic said, without a hint of agitation. ``If they are tired or
hungry _ that's it. That's why we have 10 or 12 babies for one
shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Nachamkin said she had sat down with many a parent to
explain the rigors of the job, for both parent and child. All
children have good and bad days, but some children are not
temperamentally suited for modeling work. It is a mistake to think
that the child featured was just the most physically beautiful of
the lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child here is beautiful,'' said Alice Calabrese, who was
with her 10-month-old twins at the Parents magazine shoot and has
two pre-teen-agers who have modeled since they were babies. ``You
don't have to be the most beautiful; you have to be the most
cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every commercial shoot has the budget for a wrangler. In
fact, on low-budget productions, Mrs. Calabrese often finds herself
on the set trying to elicit reactions from her twins. She would
much rather have a wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't want to let go, but the wranglers are great
because they know how to work with babies,'' Mrs. Calabrese said.
``And you know right away if they're good, because the babies have
to love them. It looks like an easy job, but it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is something about the term ``wrangling'' that Mrs.
Calabrese said had a way of connoting a lasso. For Ms. Nachamkin,
though, it helps define the job. Hollywood has always had some form
of wrangler, but today, art directors, photographers and others in
the advertising business are recognizing wrangling as a bona fide
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think wranglers were one of the most misunderstood crafts,''
Ms. Nachamkin said. ``People used to say, `Oh, we just need someone
to handle the kids.' But if that child isn't there to perform, that
shoot won't happen. It takes incredible energy to do the job.''

   NEW DELHI, India _ More than two days after a cyclone of
monstrous power churned across the Bay of Bengal into India's east
coast, as many as 1.5 million people are homeless, hundreds of
villages in one of the country's poorest states have been washed
away and tens of thousands of survivors are camping along roadways
without adequate food or water. The death toll is unknown, but
officials are guessing it is in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's 160-mph winds and merciless rains began battering
coastal areas on Friday, authorities said. Waves as high as 15 feet
rode the gales across the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Orissa remained largely cut off from the rest of
the nation, with only a few telephone lines back in operation and
platoons of military rescuers unable to reach the areas of greatest
devastation.
</P>
<P>
   Under such circumstances, death tolls are largely guesswork, but
officials now predict that thousands will be found dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are saying 3,000, but to my mind the number will be much
higher,'' R.N. Panda, a top aide to the state's chief secretary,
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, India has suffered three other cyclones of
such extraordinary intensity _ in 1977, 1989 and 1990. The 1977
storm, which cut across Andhra Pradesh, killed an estimated 10,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people are camped out on highways,
officials said. Rail lines have been uprooted. Bridges have been
swamped. In some villages, all the houses have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Debris along roadways thwarted early relief efforts, and
sustained winds made even aerial surveys of the scene impossible.
Perilous gusts forced a team of national officials aboard two
helicopters to divert their course and seek safety.
</P>
<P>
   Orissa's capital, Bhubaneshwar, remains without power. Its water
supply has been overrun. More than 100,000 slum dwellers lost their
homes in the storm, the police said. There are reports that mobs
have broken into shops and cars, often in search of food.
</P>
<P>
   Three government food warehouses have been looted, Dand Sinha,
an aide to Chief Minister Giridhar Gamang, told Reuters.
Desperation seems to be at the root. The people ``are hungry and
they have no water either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The districts of Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Khordha, Puri and
Cuttack are thought to be the hardest hit, said the chief
minister's office. About 5,000 soldiers, including engineers and
doctors, are trying to reach those and other areas. But for the
most part, they have been stymied by downed trees, washed out
bridges and continuing rains.
</P>
<P>
   In places the army has been able to reach, hundreds of people
were found awaiting help on the only dry spots available. ``Some
had to remain perched on the roofs of their houses for over 24
hours and we have just begun rescuing them,'' said Col. S. Chauhan,
according to news agency reports.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclone on Friday was the second of a one-two punch. Another
tempest hit Orissa, a state with 35 million people, earlier in the
month, and the government's response has brought criticism of its
disaster management systems.
</P>
<P>
   Subhash Gupta, joint secretary of the Indian Red Cross Society,
was quoted in the Indian press as saying that the jargon used in
warnings by government meteorologists was so ``technically
overdosed'' that ``people just do not understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people seemed to heed the warnings to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen fishing boats were caught at sea by the storm and
remain missing. Two coast guard vessels have been conducting a
search in the turbulent seas. ``The two ships have found neither
any body nor any of the boats, except for one broken vessel that
was spotted yesterday,'' I.S. Chowhan, deputy commandant of the
coast guard, said Sunday.

 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Henry Grunwald can hardly see the fragile little
horse (circa 400 B.C.) from southern Italy on an end table in his
Park Avenue apartment. He can barely discern the delicate Klimt
line drawings kept in the hallway out of direct light. He can still
enjoy the shards of ancient pottery laid out on a gleaming table,
by touching them, and the inlaid glass eye from ancient Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   But to Grunwald, the world of muted elegance in which he lives
these days is a shifting collage of blurred shapes, of light and
dark. If the light is bright and an object is large enough, he can
sometimes see it more distinctly. ``I do see a hell of a lot,''
Grunwald said. ``I don't see very clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunwald, 76, former editor in chief of Time Inc. and ambassador
to Austria, has been slowly losing his sight since 1992 because of
macular degeneration (a disease of the central retina, which picks
up the finest details of what people see). It affects 15 million
Americans and is the biggest single cause of legal blindness among
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   He has written about the experience in ``Twilight: Losing Sight,
Gaining Insight,'' which he calls ``an autobiography of my eyes,''
to be published on Wednesday by Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see a face, but I see it in a blurred way, a white
area,'' Grunwald said in an interview as a butler served coffee in
porcelain cups. ``I can hear you smiling, but I cannot see it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice becomes important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all his life, reading and writing have been Grunwald's
lifelines, he writes in ``Twilight.'' He is so accustomed to
editing that even after he retired, when he read a magazine he
couldn't resist picking up a pencil and correcting the grammar as
he went along. ``Twilight'' was written with Grunwald dictating to
an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Today he can read for brief periods with a magnifying apparatus.
But he does not read newspapers. Instead an assistant recites the
table of contents aloud, and he selects stories that are then
recorded and delivered to him the next day. He is grateful, he
said, for books on tape from the Reading for the Blind program and
the Library of Congress. He tells time with a ``talking watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling alone is still possible, he said. He can take the
shuttle to Washington by himself, reading the large print on
airport signs. He is no longer shy, he said, about stopping a
passer-by and asking for help.
</P>
<P>
   And as his eyes fail, he has become ``a visual glutton,'' he
writes in his book, for whatever sights remain to him. Gone mostly
are the details of women's faces, for instance, always a source of
``endless delight _ and mystery,'' he writes. He still goes to
museums. ``Certain pictures I can see quite well,'' he said, but he
becomes upset when he cannot make out a work. ``I often tell myself
I'll never do it again. I'm frustrated. But I calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Louise, is very visual, Grunwald said, and describes
objects for him, but that can be wearing. ``She occasionally gets
cranky, and I get cranky,'' he said. ``But in this particular
situation she has been very patient.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began, Grunwald said, on an autumn trip to Florence,
Italy. ``It was rather gloomy weather,'' he said. ``I remember
picking up a pitcher of water, and I started pouring it into the
glass.'' But he missed the glass. At first he blamed the stinginess
of his Florentine landlord for using low-wattage light bulbs. ``I
thought I better have my eyes checked.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunwald, who has worn glasses for most of his life, went to an
optician. An examination showed that the vision in his left eye was
20-400 without glasses, making him legally blind in that eye. But
the sight in his right eye was 20-30, almost normal. That eye had
been compensating for the loss in the other.
</P>
<P>
   The optician recommended that he see a doctor, who told him that
he was suffering from the most serious form of macular degeneration
and that his sight could deteriorate further.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Grunwald escaped with his family from Nazi-occupied
Europe, sleeping in fields and on roadsides. At 17 he arrived in
the United States and in his early 20s became a copy boy at Time
magazine. He was a man used to exercising authority over his own
life and the lives of others. But now came an unaccustomed
dependency. ``My instinct was to try and control as much as I
can,'' Grunwald said. ``I tried to make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of his loss hit him when he realized that he
could not see the face of his shy young granddaughter, Elizabeth
Adler, who would sometimes respond to his questions with a smile or
a nod. ``Elizabeth had to be told I couldn't see her nodding or see
her smiling,'' he said. ``She had to actually say things.''
</P>
<P>
   That was when his daughter, Lisa, a novelist and Elizabeth's
mother, realized how damaged her father's sight was. ``It was a
killer,'' Ms. Grunwald said.
</P>
<P>
   A cataract operation temporarily improved his sight, but over
the years, his vision has waxed and waned. Total blindness is not
inevitable from macular degeneration, Grunwald said. At the moment
his sight has stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   He has, he said, suffered moments of acute depression. On the
advice of his wife, he saw a doctor about it who prescribed
medication for a time. In writing ``Twilight,'' Grunwald has
followed other authors who, when confronted with an immense loss,
have written about it. And writing has been ``a kind of therapy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twilight'' is not only an autobiographical account but a
meditation on the eye itself, an organ that Darwin wrote ``to this
day gives me a cold shudder'' because of its complexity. In the
book, Grunwald gives a history of eyesight and of the eye in
religious iconography. In ancient Egypt, Sumer and Babylon, he
writes, surgeons who bungled an eye operation could have their
hands cut off; in India they had their noses cut off.
</P>
<P>
   The book is also a Proustian excavation of his own learning to
see, ``but shorter,'' Grunwald said with a laugh. Trying to
discover his earliest visual memories was a ``conscious exercise,''
he said, that he might not have performed were it not for his
illness.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As he searched his memories, he saw his yellow and white striped
nursery wallpaper in Vienna, with its Puss in Boots border. He
remembered St. Stephen's Cathedral there, ``whose huge black spire
struck me as some overpowering monster,'' and the river near his
family's summer house, with the water shimmering in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   And there were his growing love of art and his visits to Venice
with his family. He particularly loved Turner's misty landscapes of
that city. Grunwald speculates that today he sees Venice much the
way Turner saw it in his paintings and wonders if Turner himself
could have had macular degeneration, though there is no
contemporary account of it.
</P>
<P>
   Other painters too, have had weak eyesight _ Degas, for
instance, whose colors became increasingly garish as he grew older.
Monet lost his ability to distinguish colors clearly, because of
cataracts; he had an operation on one eye at 83 and painted again
with vigor.
</P>
<P>
   But Grunwald's explorations of seeing ``now exist mostly in my
recollections,'' he writes in ``Twilight.'' He is trying to write a
novel, he said. The tradition of blind or partly sighted writers
goes back at least to Homer, of course, and encompasses Milton and
more recently, Aldous Huxley and Borges. ``I hope you make it clear
I'm not comparing myself to these gentlemen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grunwald calls his attempt to write fiction ``totally off the
wall, out of my ken.'' But he is attempting a historical novel
based on two real-life women in 16th-century France _ ``a near
saint and a fake saint,'' he said. ``I'm definitely not at all sure
I can pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   His greatest frustration, Grunwald said, is ``not reading, the
inability to pick up a book.'' And then, he added with a smile,
there is ``the inability to do some serious girl-watching.''
</P>
<P>
   But all along the way, Grunwald said, humor has saved him.
``Being half-blind,'' he writes at the end of ``Twilight,'' ``is
not a bad metaphor for the human condition.''

MOTOROLA TO OFFER CHIP THAT SUPPORTS MANY CELL-PHONE STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With an eye toward the convergence of the
Internet and next-generation digital cellular networks, Motorola
plans to announce a new chip design on Monday that is meant to
support a wide range of cellular telephone standards while offering
more computer-like features.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip family is part of Motorola's effort to move its
chip production beyond supplying the company's own cell-phone
business and toward competing directly in the cellular market with
chip makers like Texas Instruments, Royal Philips Electronics and
Qualcomm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been extremely quiet. Now we want people to know we're
open for business,'' said Mario Rivas, the general manager of
Motorola's wireless subscriber systems group.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 225 million cellular telephones will be sold
worldwide, accounting for the sale of $10.7 billion worth of
semiconductors, according to researchers at International Data
Corp., a market research firm in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1999 the market has already begun to shift toward data
and Internet-related features. Earlier this year, for example,
Sprint Corp. began offering a variety of phones, made from a
variety of components, that enable Sprint subscribers to perform
rudimentary types of Web surfing. By next year, according to the
market research firm Jupiter Communications, almost half of all
wireless phones sold will have built-in Web-browsing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The new Motorola system, which will be known as the DSP56690
baseband processor, will come with both a microprocessor and a
specialized digital signal processor capable of handling a variety
of cellular telephone technical formats. Unlike Japan and Europe,
which mainly have single cellular telephone standards, the United
States remains a hodgepodge of competing cellular formats.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola said its new chips would make it possible for a
telephone designer to build a single device capable of working with
a variety of cell phone standards. But the company said it expected
the new processor's ``universal'' architecture to enable a
manufacturer to use the same basic design for a variety of phone
models that would each be intended for use with a specific
transmission format.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average consumer really doesn't travel that much,'' Rivas
said. ``He just wants his phone to work transparently.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's biggest challenge in its new strategy is finding a
way to sell its chips to companies with which it competes as a
maker of cellular handsets.
</P>
<P>
   The new chips, which will be available in volume in the first
quarter of next year, have a variety of data-oriented features,
including the ability to run Web browsers and the Java programming
language widely used on the World Wide Web, as well as allowing for
connections to display screens and the USB serial ports by which a
variety of devices can be connected to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and Europe are now advancing rapidly toward deployment of
so-called 2.5 G wireless data networks that will handle both data
and voice, but not full multimedia. The United States is farther
behind, but high-speed wireless data networks with bandwidth up to
approximately 150 kilobits will begin to become available late next
year in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this is going to be driven by the Internet,'' said
Allen Leibovitch, program manager for semiconductor research at
International Data.
</P>
<P>
   The new Motorola chip is also designed to work with the Global
Positioning Satellite receiver chips that the Federal
Communications Commission is requiring as part of future wireless
emergency 911 service.
</P>
<P>
   But cellular phone carriers are eager to develop new commercial
``location-based'' services as well. In the future, Web sites are
expected to be able to automatically tailor information to a
cellular data phone user, based on where the telephone is.

AWAITING VERDICT, MICROSOFT STARTS LOBBYING CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first part of the verdict in the Microsoft
trial is due out soon, perhaps as soon as Friday. But the Microsoft
Corp. is already looking past the legal case and lobbying the
government to pass laws that would protect the company in areas
where it is being challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   When the company distributed its annual report in September, two
million shareholders also got a letter from Robert Herbold,
Microsoft's chief operating officer, urging them to join a lobbying
effort to protect what the company calls its ``freedom to
innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   Loosely translated, that catch phrase means freedom to design
products however the company chooses _ including the freedom to
bundle other products, like a Web browser, with the Windows
operating system. The decision to build a Web browser into Windows
is a central element of the government's antitrust case against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Herbold's letter directs shareholders to the company's ``freedom
to innovate'' Web site, where visitors are informed that the
``freedom to innovate network was formed as a response to the
overwhelming amount of correspondence'' the company had received
``regarding the trial with the Justice Department and other public
policy issues.''
</P>
<P>
   With the court's findings of facts imminent, both sides in the
trial are scurrying to anticipate and manage the public relations
fallout. But Microsoft sees its lobbying effort as a long-term
political strategy that will be followed whatever the outcome of
the case.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman said the site was set up earlier this year
``as just a way to channel the thousands of people who wrote to us
about the trial.'' The spokesman added that Microsoft's leadership
had decided to send the letter to shareholders after the trial was
essentially over because the company now viewed ``freedom to
innovate'' as a broader term covering other political issues of
interest to the company, like government policies dealing with
encryption, software piracy and Internet taxation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Web site does not reflect a change of thinking in any
prominent way. The opening page complains about the trial,
including a quotation from an unnamed Web-site visitor, printed in
red italic letters, that says: ``The actions of the government
against the Microsoft Corporation are detrimental to the very
system of competition that made the U.S. a world leader in
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In an upper corner is a link to a page that lists the company's
additional concerns. (Even there, the second item reiterates the
``freedom to innovate'' theme, saying: ``The government should
continue to exercise great restraint in regulating this industry,
which has brought such remarkable advances to consumers and
benefits to the economy.'')
</P>
<P>
   But a more prominent link on the home page, labeled ``Contact
Congress,'' directs people to a page with the heading: ``Tell your
Congressional representatives and state officials where you stand
on the Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit against
Microsoft.'' There is no mention of piracy, encryption or any other
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Moving on from there, visitors are presented with an interactive
menu that allows them to send e-mail entreaties directly to members
of Congress and to their state legislators. (Nineteen states joined
the federal government's antitrust suit.)
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people have visited the Web page, the
Microsoft spokesman said, and more than 100,000 have used it to
send messages to Congress or to the company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He asserted that Microsoft had every right to lobby Congress on
issues related to the trial because ``a lot of people are
dissatisfied with the case, and there are policy implications that
come out of the case, and Congress has oversight responsibility for
the Department of Justice, right?''

   A senior congressional aide who is generally aware of lobbying
by Microsoft said the ``freedom to innovate'' campaign did not
appear to be generating a focused, coherent message. In fact, the
Web site does not offer suggested language for visitors sending
e-mails, as many similar lobbying campaigns do.
</P>
<P>
   But the spokesman said Microsoft was not promoting a specific
legislative proposal, adding: ``This really has nothing to do with
the trial; it's totally policy focused. The trial is going along on
a separate track.''
</P>
<P>
   On that track, the presiding judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, has
announced that he will issue his findings of fact in the case on a
coming Friday evening. Findings of fact are half of the judge's
reasoning that make up a verdict. They are a statement of what he
has concluded from the conflicting factual arguments the two sides
have presented in court.
</P>
<P>
   The finding might, as a hypothetical example, say that the judge
does not accept Microsoft's reasoning for tying the Web browser to
Windows. This would be a clear indication that he intends to find
against Microsoft on that charge. But a second element of the
ruling will come later. It will comprise conclusions of law, the
legal arguments and precedents justifying a conclusion. Both are
required for a sustainable verdict.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already, the company and its opponents are offering different
takes on the significance of the findings of fact.
</P>
<P>
   A group of lawyers who oppose Microsoft, working under the
umbrella of the Computer and Communications Industry Association,
held a telephone news conference on Thursday and generally
proclaimed that the public should be able to see whether the judge
intends to finds Microsoft guilty by reading his findings of fact.
That will be the case, ``despite Microsoft's efforts to distract
the analysis from the real issues in court,'' said Donald Falk, an
antitrust lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But a Microsoft lawyer had a different perspective in an
interview late last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a step toward a decision,'' he said. ``I think
there may be a lot things in the findings that are legally
irrelevant.''

`DESTROYING THE WORLD TO SAVE IT': NEW THINGS TO FEAR FROM AN OLD
TYPE OF MADMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Jay Lifton, professor of psychology and psychiatry at
John Jay College and the Graduate Center of the City University of
New York, has spent a good part of his life studying apocalyptic
evil and its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 his ``Death in Life'' explored the psychospiritual
aftereffects of the atomic bomb attacks on Japan. ``The Nazi
Doctors'' tried to answer the question of how German physicians
allowed themselves to be so morally deformed that they put their
knowledge of healing to the service of Nazi cruelty and murder.
</P>
<P>
   There are many echoes of Lifton's earlier themes in his new
book, ``Destroying the World to Save It,'' which is mostly a study
of Aum Shinrikyo, the messianic Japanese cult that carried out a
nerve-gas attack in the Tokyo subway in 1995. Lifton's subject once
again is the nature of self-justifying evil, the way in which those
who carry out acts of lunatic criminality are persuaded of the
higher good of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   But he takes this theme a step forward as he compares Aum
Shinrikyo to other cults, especially American ones like the Peoples
Temple and Heaven's Gate, to reach an alarming conclusion: that the
combination of apocalyptic, paranoid groups and readily available
weapons of mass destruction poses a dreadful new style of menace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aum's danger to the world _ and its greatest significance _
lay in its joining of megalomania to ultimate weapons,'' Lifton
writes.
</P>
<P>
   As with all of Lifton's reflections on politics and psychology,
this one has many powerful and compelling insights. And yet these
insights mingle with a certain intellectual overreaching and a
rhetorical vagueness that sap the argument of its power and
persuasiveness. There is an abstractness to Lifton's line of
analysis, the use of a lot of fancy clinical language that doesn't
quite hit the explanatory bull's-eye.
</P>
<P>
   Lifton cites various notions that he finds common to the
otherwise dissimilar cults that he studied _ their adherents' idea
that death is purifying; their paranoid belief in the existence of
evil forces that are persecuting them; their overriding need for
spiritual meaning, immortality, power. But one has the sense that
these terms are not quite up to solving the mysteries that Lifton
himself evokes.
</P>
<P>
   Lifton is best at description, and he begins with a long and
richly detailed description of Aum Shinrikyo and its charismatic,
probably schizophrenic leader, Shoko Asahara.
</P>
<P>
   As many will remember, Asahara's nerve-gas attack in the Tokyo
subway killed a dozen people, but the goal was to achieve (if that
is the word) far more than that. Asahara wanted to bring about a
mass global slaughter after which only he, the brilliant prophet,
and his followers would remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in history,'' Lifton writes, striking his
main theme, ``end-time religious fanaticism allied itself with
weapons capable of destroying the world and a group embarked on the
mad project of doing just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifton interviewed former members of Aum Shinrikyo and compiled
the information available on it to produce a portrait of the cult
and its guru that is truly hair-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Asahara was the kind of lunatic visionary who could visit the
oldest pyramid in Egypt and seriously declare not only that he had
seen it before but that ``I designed it myself a long time ago.''
Using an amalgam of Buddhist ideas, Shintoism, pseudoscience and
charisma, he was able to attract talented men and women to his
cause, including doctors and scientists.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was a reputable cardiac surgeon named Ikuo Hayashi,
who abandoned real medicine for what Lifton sensibly calls
``medicalized criminality.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Hayashi invented what he called ``new
narco,'' in which he used a sequence of thiopental injections to
produce semi-comatose states, and then used five to seven
electrical shocks followed by more thiopental to bring about memory
loss among cult members who had committed crimes for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Lifton's reporting on the Aum cult and on the distance that
otherwise intelligent people are able to travel toward the
annihilation of a genuine moral self is very good. It is when
Lifton turns to the reasons that these people lose the self in the
totalistic doctrine of the cult that his language becomes blandly
and mistily clinical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot say how much of a prior tendency toward dissociation
he brought to his pre-Aum medical career,'' Lifton writes of
Hayashi, ``but he certainly experienced in Aum a powerful fusing of
the all-encompassing answer he sought with a dissociative response
_ doubling, the formation of two selves that are morally and
functionally antithetical although part of the same psyche.'' Such
phrases somehow do not explain how a man of science could wreck
lives in the service of mumbo jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   A similar sort of nonspecific quality surrounds Lifton's
discussion of the factors in Japan that gave rise to Aum. Among
these are ``psychohistorical dislocation, a breakdown of the social
and institutional arrangements'' whose roots, in Lifton's view, are
in Japan's defeat in World War II and the experience of the atomic
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Lifton has interesting things to say about Japan here. Yet the
fact remains that Aum Shinrikyo was never more than an isolated,
ultra-fringe phenomenon in Japan, which despite its
``psychohistorical dislocation'' and its ``individual and
collective shape-shifting'' (whatever that is) is in general a
prosperous, law-abiding and stable democracy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the danger that a new form of global terrorism is upon
us, it would of course be foolish for the world's police forces not
to be on guard for the private makers of sarin or for those who
dream, as Asahara did, of obtaining nuclear weapons. He didn't
succeed, of course. In fact, he never came remotely close to
achieving his apocalyptic objectives, nor could he have done so.
</P>
<P>
   Aum and the other cults discussed in this book did shocking
things. Still, Lifton does not make the case that there is anything
especially new or more globally menacing than what the world has
faced from the troubling phenomenon of psychotic megalomania in the
past.

CONTAINING WILDFIRES  
 A MORE INTELLIGENT CAR ALARM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Brent Lee Farley is a stagehand currently working on the
Baltimore set of the new John Waters film, ``Cecil B. Demented.''
Farley could be said to take a quirky view of life, and has earned
patents for sled pants, a hand-shaped hair dryer and an inflatable
shower curtain.
 &HT;    But right now he is most enthusiastic about a patent he won
recently for a system of fighting wildfires.
 &HT;    ``I was on vacation in New Mexico, sitting in a restaurant, and
I saw smoke,'' Farley recalled enthusiastically by phone from the
noisy film set. ``It was a fire that started in an area about the
size of a baseball diamond, but it continued to go for three, four,
five days. I watched it on TV, saw the smoke out the window and
then went to watch them fight it. I saw the water they dumped. It
was breathtaking. But I also saw nothing they did had any effect.''
 &HT;    That got him thinking about the sets commonly used in theater
and film to control reality.
 &HT;    ``I'm a stagehand and I know what a 40-foot curtain looks
like,'' Farley said. ``I know that I can come to a fire scene,
build a 40-foot wall and stop that fire.''
 &HT;    Farley's patent is for a series of devices intended to contain
fires, eliminate underbrush, force fires to burn back on themselves
and spray water on flames.
 &HT;    The patent covers panels made of nonflammable material like
ceramic, thermosetting resins or sheet metal, 30 to 50 feet high
and designed to connect to form a wall. Some are free-standing,
with lower intake and upper outlet ducts connected by curved
chambers. Heat and flames are supposed to enter the lower duct and
be forced out the top one back onto the fire. Some of the panels
fold for easy storage and transportation.
 &HT;    Another device in the patent is a fire-resistant sheet that can
be wrapped around trees or structures or laid on the ground to
cover brush, fields or forest undergrowth. The sheets would be 100
yards long and 20 yards wide, with weights and a tow line, and made
of the type of asbestos fiber used in welders' aprons.
 &HT;    Farley's idea is to take his devices to the scene of a fire in a
truck or helicopter, predict which way the fire is headed, and set
up his barriers. He said he believed he could have stopped the New
Mexico fire while it was still the size of a baseball diamond.
 &HT;    ``This isn't for horrific firestorms, but for brush fires and
forest fires that start small,'' he said. ``Give me a couple of
hours and I can have 80 percent of everything covered except the
protruding trees.
 &HT;    ``It creates a barrier with no chemicals, it's re-usable, and
it's unmanned,'' he added. ``It's like a puzzle. You build the
wall, move it, build it again, and let the fire burn itself out.''
Farley and his wife, Wendy, applied for a federal grant to test
prototypes, and even faxed their idea to President Clinton. They
did not get the grant.
 &HT;    Farley pointed to fires in Florida last month. ``They had 2,300
people dig a 90-mile trench. That's a lot of manpower, and still,
100 houses burned and caused $6 million in lost property. Give me
20 people and half a million dollars worth of fireproof fabric and
let me erect my fence. How can that compare?''
 &HT;    The wildfire constraints won patent 5,944,114.

   Car Alarm Senses False Alarms
</P>
<P>
   Albert Montague has won a patent for a car alarm that anyone
living in a crowded city might appreciate _ it is designed to
eliminate false alarms that occur when a truck goes by or another
car taps a bumper.
</P>
<P>
   Montague's alarm contains an ultrasonic sensor and
microprocessor that bounces sound waves from the underside of a
parked car to the ground and back. It analyzes the waves'
direction, rate of change and duration, and compares them to a
profile of the car's parked position.
</P>
<P>
   If the car is simply nudged, the alarm will remain silent. Only
if the displacement is severe will the alarm immediately sound,
turning on a tracking and notification system that reports the
theft to police. Montague, who lives in Deal, N.J., won patent
5,929,753.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia,
announced that it was transforming a home for the elderly in
Amsterdam into a satellite museum. Now it is carrying the same idea
to London, where it plans to open a permanent exhibition space at
Somerset House, a late-18th-century mansion on The Strand.
</P>
<P>
   Somerset House is home to the Courtauld Institute of Art,
Britain's leading college of art history, and the Courtauld
Gallery, which includes a world-class collection of Impressionist
and Post-Impressionist paintings. In May, Somerset House will also
make room for the Gilbert Collection, a group of gold, silver and
micromosaics mostly from stately English houses.
</P>
<P>
   The Hermitage will occupy a suite of eight rooms, which it plans
to use for rotating exhibitions from its vast collections. The
first will be devoted to treasures of Catherine the Great,
including some of her jewels, engraved gems, furniture and
portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Assembled over more than three centuries, the Hermitage's
3-million-piece collection includes some of the world's greatest
holdings of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art, Old Master
paintings, antiquities, European and Russian decorative arts and
Oriental art, some of which are from the Russian imperial
collections. They are housed in the former Winter Palace of the
czars, where only about 5 percent of the collection can be
displayed at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was important to make our collections more
accessible and to have a permanent presence outside of Russia,''
said Mikhail Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage. Another
important goal is to raise money for the financially strapped
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Norman, who has written a history of the Hermitage,
will be the director of the Hermitage Rooms at Somerset House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to try and make it look like an extra wing of the
Hermitage that has never been seen before,'' said Ms. Norman, who
pointed out that like Somerset House, the Winter Palace is an
18th-century building.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Norman said the Hermitage planned to present exhibitions
that would rotate once a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Hermitage needs to raise about $7 million for the project,
which is being organized by a nonprofit group called the Hermitage
Development Trust. Lord Rothschild, Britain's leading arts patron,
is a trustee and perhaps the biggest promoter of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Norman said it had not been decided whether there would be
an admission charge, but the trust plans to sell exhibition
catalogs and hold fund-raising events. ``The trust is a double-edge
organization,'' Ms. Norman said. ``It is a place to organize
exhibitions, but it will also serve as a fund-raising arm of the
Hermitage.''

Embassy 20 years ago this week (Nov. 4) is their Bunker Hill; their

took on the ``Den of Spies'' that had helped install and support
the brutal, dictatorial Shah. The takeover symbolized a revolution
that changed the atmosphere of the Middle East and helped create
now-familiar buzzwords like ``Islamic fundamentalism'' and
``Hezbollah.'' And, it shocked the West into realizing that
religion was still a force in world politics. (Just a year before
the revolution, Jimmy Carter called Iran ``an island of
stability.'') Today in Iran, the takeover highlights the country's
identity crisis. Any criticism of the takeover is still

 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What began as a seemingly simple attempt to
stimulate electronic commerce by giving so-called digital
signatures the legal weight of their ink-and-paper counterparts has
erupted into a partisan political battle in Congress that opponents
fear could wipe out some basic consumer protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital signatures'' refers to various technologies including
encryption, fingerprint readers and stylus pads that are used to
verify one's identity in cyberspace to certify contracts that are
agreed to over the Internet. They are accepted as legally binding
in some states and localities, but not in all.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was originally meant to create a uniform federal
law recognizing the validity of digital signatures. But lately it
has been expanded in ways that critics say would work against
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the thousands of state and local laws that require
institutions like banks and insurance companies to keep certain
paper records and to notify customers by mail of certain
situations, including default on their credit-card debts or loans;
changes in the terms of a financial agreement, like increases in a
monthly payment; foreclosure of a home mortgage; or cancellation of
an insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation pending in both the House and the Senate,
such companies would be able to make those notifications
electronically, instead of by mail, if the contracts were made
online instead of on paper. The companies would also be relieved of
a number of paper record-keeping rules.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the measures would enable companies and their
customers to realize the full benefits and conveniences of
electronic commerce. Not only would the legislation make it easier
for consumers to complete transactions from home, they say, but it
would cut down on paper and mailing expenses, helping reduce the
shipping costs that are passed on to customers.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents fear that the proposals will allow companies to
sidestep longstanding consumer notification laws.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, they say, may not know that the fine print of their
contract eliminates the requirement for traditional notification.
Or they may simply never get crucial information if their computers
break down or they change their Internet service provider or e-mail
address _ which typically has no forwarding-address procedure as
does traditional mail.
</P>
<P>
   Or, the opponents contend, companies can include contract fine
print requiring that consumers periodically check a World Wide Web
site for updates on their agreements, a provision that many may
overlook or forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad public policy,'' said Andrew Pincus, general counsel
for the Commerce Department. ``It's also bad for the Internet. If
the online world is not safe for consumers, what does that do to
the future of electronic commerce? It goes in the tank.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department had given approval earlier this year to
a bill on validation of electronic signatures by Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The department's support came after he agreed to reduce its
scope so that the bill would be temporary, applied to the handful
of states that did not already have laws recognizing the legality
of electronic contracts. The idea was that Abraham's measure would
expire once all states adopted a uniform digital-signature standard
that has been recommended by a national group of lawmakers, state
officials and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill that Abraham tried to bring up for a vote last week
was substantially different from that compromise and included
provisions that would pre-empt a number of state and federal laws.
So Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., blocked its consideration, saying
that Abraham had reneged on a carefully drawn compromise and was
trying to pass off a substitute as the same bill that had been
supported by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation is pending in the House, introduced by Rep.
Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of State Legislatures issued a statement
last week saying that the Bliley bill ``would eviscerate consumer
protections'' and eliminate record-keeping requirements that allow
state and federal oversight agencies to do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists on both sides of the argument spent much of last week
working with legislators, trying to help settle the differences in
the House and Senate bills.
</P>
<P>
   Changes made on Friday to the House bill tried to address
consumers' concerns by adding provisions to clarify that state and
federal consumer-notification laws still applied, and that
notification requirements could be made electronically only if the
consumer had consented by using a form separate from the credit or
loan agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The revised House bill would also state that insurance
cancellation notices, home foreclosure and utility-disconnection
warnings would still have to be sent by mail.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups and the administration remain staunchly
opposed to both bills, which could go to the floor for votes this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they've made a lot of changes,'' said Margot Saunders of
the National Consumer Law Center. ``But the problem is not the
examples they have addressed. The problem is the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saunders said that exempting foreclosure notices did not get
to the underlying matter of all the warning notices that would
precede that final document _ and which would not come by regular
mail in the case of contracts that had been completed
electronically. ``The big difference between electronic information
and written information is that it costs money and takes extra
effort for consumers to receive electronic information,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Larsen is the chief executive of E-Loan, an online loan
center in California's Silicon Valley that is working with an
industry group, the Electronic Financial Services Council, to get
the legislation passed. He said he was perplexed by the
administration's opposition to the Bliley and Abraham bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly see this as an aggressive pro-consumer issue,''
Larsen said, ``because it allows online disclosure that allows
better disclosure to consumers at a lower cost.''
</P>
<P>
   He said companies were not trying to get around consumer
protection laws, but simply wanted to bring their businesses into
the electronic age.
</P>
<P>
   He said his company had processed some $2.3 billion in loans
online. Enabling more of the transaction to take place
electronically, he said, results in lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about changing any of the disclosures that
are required at the state or federal level,'' Larsen added. ``We
think all those protections are essential to consumers. We just
want to be able to deliver that electronically.''

IN-HOUSE QUESTIONS AT CONDE NAST  
 HOWARD STERN'S NEW IMAGE PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagine that the gleaming new Conde Nast building in
Times Square is a giant cocktail shaker, and rumors and speculation
are the ingredients. Put it this way: S.I. Newhouse Jr., the
chairman of Conde Nast and its parent, Advance Publications, is
mixing one mean martini.
</P>
<P>
   At play are three developments: the imminent arrival under the
Advance corporate umbrella of the Fairchild Publications magazine
empire; Newhouse's dismissal of a key ally of Conde Nast's chief
executive, Steven Florio, and the strange case of a rising star,
Vogue's publisher, Richard Beckman, who remains in his job after
injuring a female advertising executive.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leads to the question of how Newhouse will arrange
his empire and who will eventually run it.
</P>
<P>
   One person who apparently will not be in the picture is Michael
Coady, chief executive of Fairchild. This week, Advance is expected
to close its purchase of Fairchild and to announce that Coady will
resign. Patrick McCarthy, editorial director of Fairchild _
publisher of W, Women's Wear Daily and a dozen other specialty
fashion titles _ is expected to remain in his position. James
Truman will no longer be the only editorial director under the
Advance banner.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, meanwhile, had a rough time last week. On Monday, the
executive vice president for sales and marketing, Catherine
Viscardi Johnston, left the company abruptly. Although a Conde Nast
spokeswoman, Maurie Perl, said Ms. Johnston had resigned, several
Conde Nast executives said she had been dismissed by Newhouse, not
Florio, the executive to whom the task should have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   That left the impression of a shift in power away from Florio,
who counted Ms. Johnston among his closest allies, the executives
said. They said Ms. Johnston's distaste for the manner in which the
Beckman incident was handled had irked Newhouse, but that was only
partly the reason for her departure.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said only that Ms. Johnston had been a friend for 20
years and that he was sorry she was no longer with the company. Ms.
Johnston had no comment. Ms. Perl, the Conde Nast spokeswoman, said
that Florio ``was saddened by her decision to leave but that he is
making plans to announce somebody who will take on some of her
duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the issue of Beckman, the publisher of Vogue
magazine and someone whom many inside Conde Nast have considered a
possible successor to Florio. Five weeks ago, Conde Nast agreed to
pay a multimillion-dollar settlement to a Vogue advertising
executive, Carol Matthews, who accused Beckman of shoving her and
badly injuring her face at a meeting in June. Surgery followed. The
incident was settled with a figure estimated by executives at $1
million to $5 million, and Beckman was asked to seek counseling.
</P>
<P>
   But a dozen male and female Conde Nast staff members _ including
publishers, editors, assistants and public relations employees _
say they are still puzzling over the incident. Many are angry that
Beckman is still employed. Those in publishing and business
positions voiced concerns about whether the way the incident was
handled by Newhouse and Florio would deter recruitment to the
staff; those on both the editorial and publishing sides of Conde
Nast complained that the incident would cement the reputation of
Conde Nast's upper management as an old boy network where men are
promoted and few women hold positions of any strategic power.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his office, Newhouse declined to comment, referring a
phone call to Ms. Perl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been public knowledge that Richard has apologized,''
Ms. Perl said. ``We are moving forward, and Richard continues to
remain publisher of Vogue and the subject is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Beckman has his allies, and some Conde Nast staff
members believe the incident was just an expression of Beckman's
penchant for mostly innocuous, but boisterous, behavior. Emily
Davis, the Vogue editor who remains on staff and was also said to
have been shoved by Beckman in the June episode, is a supporter of
Beckman, staff members say. Ms. Perl said Ms. Davis had no comment.

   Marital Woes Threaten Radio Star's Image
</P>
<P>
   If Howard Stern could fulfill his fantasies, would he still be,
well, Howard Stern?
</P>
<P>
   Many fans and radio pundits were asking this last week after the
announcement of the end of his 21-year marriage to his wife,
Alison.
</P>
<P>
   Many radio analysts attribute Stern's success not simply to his
outrageousness but to the tension created by his his on-air tone of
promiscuity and his real-life marital fidelity. His fantasies
remain just that _ fantasies. He is Everyman (or Everyboy)
struggling to rein himself in.
</P>
<P>
   They said his new freedom could upset the chemistry of one of
the country's highest-rated radio talk shows, a trophy property for
Infinity Broadcasting, a division of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Howard was able to perform this high-wire act as a
sexual bad boy of the media is that it was always counterbalanced
by his image as an extremely decent, loyal, dedicated father and
family man, and that the on-air Howard is an act,'' said Michael
Harrison, editor of Talkers Magazine, a talk radio trade
publication. ``If people start to believe he is a lecher and that
he really is going after these women, he loses that counterbalance
and it could mean that his act sours.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern took most of last week off, and reruns were played.
Neither his publicist nor WXRK-FM, the station that broadcasts his
show in New York, returned calls requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   But his shows last Monday and Tuesday became on-air therapy
sessions. Stern candidly discussed the breakup,
town-hall-meeting-style, and sullenly took advice and taunts from
callers, including celebrities like Sandra Bernhard and Richard
Belzer, who called to sympathize but also to invite the new
bachelor out on the town.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Taylor, the editor of M Street Daily, a radio industry
newsletter, called Stern's marriage the show's ``safety valve,''
and warned that ``Howard as an available man takes us to uncharted
waters in the show's popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio is such a theater of the mind, in which our image of a
character is everything,'' Taylor said. ``Howard always had this
lustful-yet-faithful duality. His marriage gave him this protective
coating around his work life.''
</P>
<P>
   E. Alvin Davis, a consultant who coaches radio DJs on their
on-air personalities, said the separation ``fundamentally changes
the Howard Stern character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the guy who lived on the extreme edge of being married
and did things married guys wouldn't do,'' Davis said, ``yet he was
a devoted husband who stayed within the boundaries. If he's no
longer the loving husband and father he's believed to be, he has no
appeal whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Josephson, a producer of independent public radio
programs, is not so sure. One of radio's first temperamental
morning men when he began working in 1966 for WBAI, Josephson has
been called a model for Stern.

   ``Howard's show is pitched at the Joey Buttafuocos of the world
and at the shoelace salesmen who drive the Oldsmobile in from
Queens every day,'' he said. ``They're not going to care. Even if
he ran off with some stripper, I don't think it makes a bit of
difference.''

 &HT;    Wilkens juggles Hawks' lineup
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _It used to be that Lenny Wilkens' lineups were
automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith and Mookie Blaylock in the back court.
</P>
<P>
   Dikembe Mutombo in the middle and Alan Henderson _ health
permitting _ in the power slot.
</P>
<P>
   It was that Hawks foursome, plus the small forward of the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens has juggled lineups to look at new combinations and
given players chances to prove or disprove their credentials. The
starting team he used in practice Sunday is not the unit that will
start Tuesday night in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the importance of a starting lineup has diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lineup we go with (today) is one I will go with for a
while because I want to see how it works,'' Wilkens said after
Sunday's practice. ``But you may find that the really important
rotation we have is not who starts the game but who finishes.''
</P>
<P>
   For different reasons the first five is likely to be Henderson,
Mutombo, Bimbo Coles, Isaiah Rider and Chris Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo and Henderson are a given. Wilkens says his small
forward ``has been terrific. They've all looked great at times.''
But Crawford is the carryover starter from last season with
LaPhonso Ellis back on the sideline with a calf strain. Coles is
steady and often in exhibitions played brilliantly. Rider? His
coach loves him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see him play and not fully appreciate how good a
player he is _ how smart a player he is _ unless you watch him
every day and then know exactly what we're doing out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider is a player, Wilkens said, ``who makes other guys better.
He'll get you the ball and at the same time he's a scorer, OK? And
we have to have guys out there who are open to J.R., guys who put
themselves in position to take that pass and score.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider has worked with Crawford about being in position for his
passes. Already, Wilkens says Mutombo understands the benefits of
playing with Rider. ``You can see he's more ready around the
basket. When you have a guy who will penetrate and give you the
ball you better be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect Rider to have a constant green light.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy is that talented and that creative, you don't box
that up,'' Wilkens said. ``Yeah, he may take one or two shots
sometimes that he shouldn't but I tell you he's going to make most
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   And Coles should be the starter at the point on two counts: he
earned the job in October and rookie Jason Terry isn't ready for
Washington's Rod Strickland (Tuesday) and the Bucks' Sam Cassell
(Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing with Jason is don't kill his confidence and don't put
him in a situation where he's going to fail,'' Wilkens said. ``But
understand that I really like him. I think he's going to be a
terrific guard in our league for a long, long time. And, I've seen
him grow a lot just this last week of practice. But we're going to
be patient with him.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Wilkens elects to go with the above five, remember that
he's got a three-position player, Jim Jackson, in reserve along
with Roshown McLeod, Lorenzen Wright and Terry, plus Anthony
Johnson and Cal Bowdler.
</P>
<P>
   Layups
</P>
<P>
   Dion Glover took a frightening fall in practice Sunday, crashing
to the hard wood as he passed off in the lane. Glover finally
walked off after assistant trainer Pete Radulovic checked out his
repaired left knee. He came back with the knee encased in ice to
shoot free throws. . . . The Hawks have until 6 p.m. today to make
a roster move. . . . The Hawks said there were 3,500 fans in
Philips Arena for Saturday's open practice and autograph session. .
. . Coles will hold a live chat session at 7:30 tonight on
Hawks.com. . . . Mutombo and Coles were voted co-captains by their
teammates.

BUSH'S SPEECH IS FIT FOR ANY OCCASION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARGO, N.D. _ If you happened to be at the Holiday Inn here on a
recent prematurely wintry morning, you heard Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas make the self-effacing observation that his decision to marry
his wife, Laura, was probably wiser than her decision to marry him.
(Cue the laughter.)
</P>
<P>
   You heard him talk about the need to wed conservative principles
to compassionate impulses, and you heard him promise that if he is
elected president, ``I will not _ I will not _ use my office as a
mirror for public opinion.'' (Cue the applause.)
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could have heard nearly identical sentences,
from the seemingly spontaneous jokes to the obviously scripted
slogans, in Seattle two weeks earlier, or in Buffalo a week and a
half before that, or in any number of other cities that Bush has
visited since he began his pursuit of the Republican presidential
nomination in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in June.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the rote, redundant nature of political campaigns. But
Bush's unswerving adherence to a mostly unchanging script also
captures the caution, discipline and careful choreography behind
his front-running candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, changed his
stump speech in midstream. Pat Buchanan, who could become the
nominee of the Reform Party, reserves the right to say just about
anything at any time.
</P>
<P>
   But the ink on Bush's oratorical calling card has almost dried,
and it spells out, as well as any other aspect of his campaign, the
personality he wants to project, the place on the political
spectrum he wants to inhabit and the priorities he wants to set.
</P>
<P>
   That spelling has varied little from day to day, even from year
to year. There are a few notions, phrases and tics in Bush's speech
that have been around since at least 1996 or 1997, when he was in
the middle of his first term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, he talked about replacing the ethic of ``if it
feels good, do it'' with ``the responsibility era.'' Then, as now,
he touted the ``armies of compassion'' that exist in churches and
synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   Then, speaking to a statewide electorate, he appended his
exhortation that young, unmarried people not become parents by
promising _ twice in a row, for emphasis _ that the babies would
nonetheless be loved in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, speaking to a nationwide electorate, he appends the same
exhortation by promising _ twice in a row, for emphasis _ that the
babies will be loved in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are principles that were a part of my soul prior to
running and are a part of my soul now,'' Bush said in an interview.
``The basic reason for running, the basic vision, remains the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added: ``People like the speech. In my judgment, the
speech seems to connect well.''
</P>
<P>
   But not always in the ways that Bush and his advisers would
like. For example, Bush's signature riff on the definition of
compassionate conservatism and his declaration that ``prosperity
alone is simple materialism'' seldom elicit a loud applause from
Republican audiences and sometimes garner only blank stares.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with Bush's allusion to President Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I be fortunate enough to become your president,'' Bush
told a crowd of more than 500 people here, ``when I put my hand on
the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, I
will swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to
which I have been elected, so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   The ovation was thunderous, echoing the responses of other
audiences and explaining why those lines, which had been buried in
the middle of the speech in June, have been moved to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Bush campaign's stated aversion to polling, Bush's
speech reflects some research into the potential responses of
voters. Before the speech was written, Bush's advisers convened
three focus groups _ in the West, Midwest and South _ and gauged
reactions to videotaped snippets of Bush's remarks to politicians
who had visited the governor's mansion in Austin, Texas, earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with those insights and with transcripts of Bush's
speeches as governor, Bush's chief speechwriter, Michael Gerson,
spent much of May hammering out drafts, showing them to Bush and
then, with Bush's input, revising them. Gerson ultimately went
through 16 versions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some elements have remained in the speech, despite uncertain or
unenthusiastic audience reaction, because Bush wanted them there. A
few old oratorical bits that had disappeared have been added back
in because Bush had grown so natural and confident in delivering
them.
</P>
<P>
   A consistent goal was to make sure that Bush felt comfortable
with every line and that the speech did not suffocate what advisers
saw as Bush's personal warmth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be both accessible and presidential,'' Gerson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Intentionally or not, the result is a bit like a buffet, with
something for everyone: an endorsement of tax cuts for fiscal
conservatives, a denunciation of permissive hedonism for social
conservatives, a focus on education and a promise that ``no child
is left behind'' for swing voters who sometimes see Republicans as
uncaring.
</P>
<P>
   The result is also like an accordion, expanding and collapsing
to fit the mood of a crowd or the dictates of Bush's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech can go 15 minutes or it can go 45 minutes,'' Bush
said. ``In Kentucky one time, it must have been 120 degrees out
there, and I kept seeing guys' faces turn beet red, and they were
about to drop, so I hastened it for public health reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he gives it so often, and knows it so well, he can
excise a thicket of paragraphs and know exactly which tree comes
next. ``Unless I'm very tired,'' Bush said, ``I wing the speech.''
</P>
<P>
   In an agricultural state, he inserts thoughts on farming. In a
metropolitan area with many software and computer manufacturers, he
attaches some musings on high technology.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign rolls out its policy proposals, Bush
incorporates the highlights of each into his remarks, tucking them
neatly into the right line of the existing framework.
</P>
<P>
   But the big lines and peak moments almost never change. Although
Bush has a genuine gift for off-the-cuff banter away from the
microphones and a generally informal style, his formal political
career has been about staying ``on message,'' and his stump
speeches are a testament to that.
</P>
<P>
   If he comes to your city, he will say, in respect to free trade:
``It is the fearful who build walls. It is the confident who tear
them down.''
</P>
<P>
   He will tell you that ``the success of America has never been
proven by cities of gold, but by citizens of character'' and that
``failed schools create two societies: one that reads and one that
can't, one that dreams and one that doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will even treat you to what seems like a good-natured,
spur-of-the-moment aside: ``If you're for one of my erstwhile
opponents, that's OK. Just don't work too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And you will laugh. Thousands of people in scores of other
cities and towns already have.

HARRY POTTER: THE LANGUAGE OF CHILDREN OR THE VOICE OF SATAN?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y., S.C.)   (jw) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARENCE, N.Y. _ Whenever Margaret Cusack opens ``Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' her fifth-grade class at Ledgeview
Elementary in this Buffalo suburb breaks into cheers. As the
teacher pauses at chapter's end, the students beg for more. If the
bell rings, they refuse to budge.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Eric Poliner, whose parents are evangelical
Christians. When Mrs. Cusack reaches for the book on her desk, Eric
takes his cue to slip from the room. He retires to the hallway or
studies alone in the library until she stops reading _ 7, 10, 15
minutes, sometimes twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I felt kind of left out, but now I don't really
mind,'' said Eric, 10. ``I realized that it's for my own sake that
I'm not listening. There's a lot about witchcraft and evil and
spells and magic. I was taught at church that that was not good.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Harry Potter books by Scottish author J.K. Rowling
continue their dominance of the top three slots on The New York
Times' best-seller list, the same kind of scene is playing out at a
smattering of schools across the nation, with challenges to the
books filed in at least eight states in the last month. Educators
eager to seize the opportunity to develop a love for literature
among their students are tangling with a few parent protesters who
want to yank the books from libraries, or at least stop them from
being read in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   From South Carolina to California, committees are reviewing the
three Harry Potter books available in the United States, promising
parents like the Poliners a public forum for their complaints,
though no one who is a tracking the issue knows of any place that
has banned the books.
</P>
<P>
   It is confounding to many educators that, after a decade of
despair over a generation lost to video games and television, the
very books that have lured huge numbers of elementary and
middle-school children to the printed page are themselves being
denounced as dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are talking about this, there are actual
conversations going on about the books,'' said Alan Farstrup,
executive director of the International Reading Association.
``Children compete to see who can get the next one the quickest. I
just hope it spreads to other kinds of reading materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Though no well-known group or person has publicly criticized the
books, Focus on the Family, a conservative Christian organization
in Colorado, says it has received 160 phone calls and e-mails on
the matter, and some evangelical ministers have begun to preach
against Harry Potter. There are whispers about the books' being the
work of the devil, their remarkable popularity _ 5 million
hardcover and 2 million paperback books sold in the United States
so far _ evidence of satanic strength. In their formal complaints
asking school districts to remove the materials, parents argue that
because witchcraft is a religion, books about it do not belong in
public schools, and they say that Harry's flirtations with death
and disaster are troubling story lines in light of recent school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books nowadays are trying to make kids grow up fast,'' said
Elizabeth Mounce, a mother of two from Columbia, S.C., whose speech
against Harry Potter at a state school board meeting this month
vaulted her to national attention, her name landing in 49 newspaper
articles. ``They're trying to disguise things as fun and easy that
are really evil,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Krug, director of the American Library Association's
office for intellectual freedom, does not deny that the chronicles
of Harry's years at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
are all about the battle between good and evil. But she points out
that, at least so far, good triumphs, and responds to the critique
with a question: ``What book did you read? Or did you read it at
all?''
</P>
<P>
   These arguments among adults have distracted attention,
somewhat, from more curious educational quandaries: Just what is it
about Harry Potter that makes boys who hate to read drop their
Nintendo and open a book? How can parents and teachers capitalize
on the craze and keep children reading? What differentiates these
books from all the other adventure stories still sitting on library
shelves?
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the children of Clarence, a well-to-do suburb of
20,000, where faded American flags hang from telephone poles on
Main Street, and new construction is mixed with homes from the
town's founding in 1808.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you read it, the rest of your world, like reality, just
goes blank,'' said Brian Heigel, 10, who is in Eric's class at
Ledgeview. ``Sometimes you can actually picture yourself with these
characters, like transferring worlds. When you're all frustrated
one day and you just want to rest, you could just pull out Harry
Potter and just read more and more. It's kind of like being in kind
of a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Alyssa Mayer, 12, still has a stack of unopened books on her
desk from the summer reading list, but she has finished
``Sorcerer's Stone'' as well as ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of
Secrets'' and ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.'' ``It's
sort of like we're reading about ourselves,'' Alyssa explained.
``They like to do stuff like we like to do. They like to get in
trouble. They like to play games, checkers. It's just like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Megan Campanelle, 11, adds: ``You always have a picture in your
head of what's going to happen next. And then it changes.''
</P>
<P>
   In round-table discussions with 18 students in grades five
through eight, Harry Potter fans said they adored the detailed
descriptions of characters' clothing and facial expressions and
laugh at the made-up names that pervade the pages. They stay up
past their bedtimes, devouring Harry's 300-page adventures in a
day, because the chapters bleed into one another with teasing
cliffhangers, then read favorite parts over and over again, moving
beyond the plot to the larger themes of love, loyalty and
loneliness. Hogwarts, with its staircases that lead to different
destinations on Fridays, and hall portraits that chat with
passers-by, does not seem real, but the relationships formed there
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'd be a good friend because he cares about other
people,'' Bailey Pollack, 12, a seventh-grader at Clarence Middle
School, said of Harry. ``He's funny, he has sympathy, he shows his
emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Roth, who is in the eighth grade, relishes the beginning of
the second book, when Harry uses what he has learned at wizard
school to get back at his Muggle _ nonwizard _ cousin, Dudley, for
a decade of torture. ``My brother is really mean to me,'' Mike
said. ``I'd like to scare him like that and beat him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Several students said they admired Harry's courage and
determination, whether in fighting off bullies at Hogwarts or
trying to snatch the sorcerer's stone before the hated Professor
Snape got it. Samantha Inacker, an 11-year-old sixth grader, said
Harry had convinced her to practice more on the trumpet in hopes of
a better chair in the band. ``If he thinks he can do something,''
Samantha said, ``he will actually try and do it and not say it's
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents and educators say the series strikes something deep
inside children that cannot be quantified or explained, resonating
like the finest fairy tales in a way that can only be attributed to
the magic of literature. Everything the children interviewed praise
about Potter is true of other books: vivid descriptions, lots of
adventure, protagonists they can identify with. But this somehow
feels different, as though it were written by Harry himself, not
some out-of-touch adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``He acts the way we do,'' said Caitlin George, 10, who has read
``Sorcerer's Stone'' three times. ``It's not like I'm some old
English kid and I've got to stay clean while I go crackling through
the mud hunting for a tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Taylor, a 13-year-old eighth-grader who is on her second
time through the first book, said the Harry Potter craze was akin
to ``having an imaginary friend.'' Others compared it to Star Wars
or Pokemon, a full-fledged fad rather than just fodder for a book
report, and said they were spending time reading that they used to
pass playing computer games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really fun reading books that take you into a different
world,'' Megan said. ``Video games really don't. It's just like,
`Oh, I won again.'''
</P>
<P>
   The students interviewed emphatically oppose the coming
commercialization, saying they want neither Harry Potter action
figures nor a Hogwarts television show. As for the forthcoming
``Sorcerer's Stone'' movie, they sound like adult literature lovers
who are bemoaning the inevitable changes when a favorite book is
splayed on the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the book, you create it, really, how you want to see it,''
Dana explained. ``In a movie, they do the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the forbidden name of the evil witch of the series,
Ryan Horvath, 11, shrugged, saying, ``You just can't battle
Voldemort every Friday at 2 o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Students at both schools, Clarence Middle School and Ledgeview,
are aware of the debate about the books across the country, and
they are struggling to understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a book,'' said Caitlin, noting that her own Roman
Catholic church linked witchcraft to devil worship. ``How can that
harm you?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ledgeview had a different religious debate, when the
lighted ``peace tree'' out front struck a Jewish parent as a bit
too close to a celebration of Christmas for the public schools.
Eric Poliner and his parents were among those who stood up for the
tree. Andrea Rosenkranz, whose mother had opposed the tree, is one
of the few students who have questioned Eric about his problem with
Potter.
</P>
<P>
   Eric, who has spent most of the read-aloud time researching
medieval castles, said he, too, had learned a lot from Harry Potter
_ not the book, but his mother's crusade against it. Carol Poliner
has spent about 80 hours on the project, scouring the Internet for
information about witchcraft, speaking for the first time at a
school board meeting and organizing parents at her church to
protest the books in their schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're doing something in school that offends you or
something,'' Eric said, ``you can do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cusack and the Ledgeview principal, Nancy Littenberg, said
they respected the Poliners' right to pull Eric out of class but
refused to let one parent prevent, in the teacher's words, ``Johnny
and Bobby and Susie from hearing it.'' Mrs. Littenberg is on the
committee that will be reviewing the book to decide whether it is
appropriate for school libraries and classroom read-alouds, with a
decision expected sometime in November.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Mrs. Cusack finished Page 275 of the 309-page
novel, and the children were clamoring for her to continue.

TRADITIONAL `WALL' MAY GO UP AGAIN AT L.A. TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Mondays, Kathryn Downing, the publisher of The
Los Angeles Times, spends perhaps half the day closeted with her
top management team: seven business executives, the general counsel
and the newspaper's editor, Michael Parks.
</P>
<P>
   For those on the news side of the paper, which is owned by Times
Mirror Co., the business-to-news ratio seems skewed. This week, two
high-ranking editors, both speaking on condition of anonymity,
pointed out the disparity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is all alone there,'' said one of the editors. ``He
can say no'' to ideas that he thinks would compromise editorial
integrity. ``But how often can he be the only one saying no?''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of a newspaper finds the balance between the
interests of the news and business departments and sets the tone.
But in The Los Angeles Times newsroom in recent years, the correct
balance has often been a matter of debate. And last week, the
debate went public when hundreds of journalists at the paper
attended an angry staff meeting and heard their colleagues denounce
the decision to share the profits of an issue of the newspaper's
Sunday magazine with its sole subject, the new Staples Center
sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   The protest raised the question of whether Mark Willes' vision
of newspaper management _ a vision Ms. Downing had embraced _ will
continue to guide The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Willes, a former vice chairman at General Mills, became chief
executive of Times Mirror in 1995 and chairman in 1996, and served
a stint as publisher of The Times starting in 1997. He argued that
the wall between the news and business departments had to fall.
Cooperation and entrepreneurial creativity would be the watchwords
at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Ms. Downing, who succeeded Willes as publisher in
June, faced the upheaval over her approval of the entrepreneurial
creativity of the Staples arrangement. She issued an apology and on
Friday wrote a memorandum to the newsroom suggesting cooperation of
a different sort: cooperation in an effort to rebuild some sort of
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will develop, with editorial leadership, written policies
that clearly define editorial independence and integrity, and
interaction between the newsroom and the business side,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Downing also wrote that she would conduct ``special
awareness training for current and future business-side employees''
and ``spend more time with our journalists to gain a better
appreciation of their efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Because last week's upheaval focused on the core issue of
balancing news and business concerns while preserving editorial
integrity, its reverberations are likely to linger. For the Staples
Center arrangement was not the only issue to trouble editors in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign editor, Simon Li, was furious when the
representative of an advertising sales company, which was producing
an ad supplement about Brazil for The Times, posed as a Times
reporter to gain an audience with the president of the Brazilian
Senate. The Times' relationship with the company was severed
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   There was also concern about a daily editorial feature,
``Stories That Shaped the Century,'' which, the two high-ranking
editors said, had its genesis in the advertising department.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the distrust of Ms. Downing is her lack
of newspaper experience. Ms. Downing, 46, came to the business
after a career in legal publishing, beginning with a stint at Mead
Data Central, which at the time published the Lexis-Nexis database.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Lewis and Clark College and Stanford University
Law School, Ms. Downing is described by current and former
colleagues as smart and focused on Willes' goal of increasing
circulation. He called for a 50 percent increase. Ms. Downing, when
she was president of The Times and again when she became publisher,
was even more ambitious, calling for a 100 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kathryn is a determined and creative executive,'' said Richard
Harrington, the chief executive of Thomson Corp., which publishes
newspapers and specialized information services, particularly in
legal publishing. ``She started in electronic publishing, and that
is a very entrepreneurial business.''
</P>
<P>
   She spent five years at Thomson subsidiaries, three as president
of the electronic publishing unit and two as chief executive of the
Lawyers Professional Publishing division. Then she became president
of Matthew Bender, the troubled Times Mirror legal publishing unit.
After some executive shake-ups and reorganizations, the unit was
eventually sold. In March 1998, she became president of The Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, her tenure has been a time of turnaround. After a
year of lagging results, The Times' performance improved, according
to Times Mirror's statements to Wall Street. The company does not
break out the financial information for individual units, but it
said that in the second quarter it posted its first year-over-year
increase in quarterly profits after five quarters of decline.
</P>
<P>
   During these quarters, top business executives, like John
McKeon, the newspaper's senior vice president for marketing, were
pushing to find new revenue sources and new ways to compete for ads
with magazines, radio, TV and the Internet. The original engine for
this activity had been a network of general managers, one for each
section, who were supposed to collaborate on new projects. Though
that system has atrophied somewhat, business executives continue to
come to the news side with possible projects, the two high-ranking
editors said.
</P>
<P>
   The Staples deal was originally regarded internally as a coup.
In late 1998, Times executives signed a contract that made the
paper one of the center's 10 ``founding partners'' _ a kind of
corporate sponsorship. The paper agreed to give the center the
roughly $3 million in annual compensation it sought from each of
those sponsors, in return for a skybox, a luxury suite, exclusive
advertising rights within the center and other concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Times structured its payment in three parts, offering the
center cash, free or discounted advertising space and
profit-sharing from joint ventures. A few months ago, Ms. Downing
decided to use the Sunday magazine to fulfill the profit-sharing
commitment. In Friday's memorandum, she wrote, ``We will fulfill
the financial portion of our Staples Center agreement by check.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Downing, Parks and McKeon declined to be interviewed about
the issue on Friday, and four other senior vice presidents did not
return telephone calls. Willes left town Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The whirlwind of fury and anguish, particularly from reporters
and editors who worked on the section and felt betrayed, is likely
to keep business executives at the paper more conservative, some
Times editors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the walls going back up?'' asked John Arthur, the managing
editor responsible for regional editions. ``Who knows? There was
certainly a call for that in the staff meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's my experience that newspapers work best when
there is a healthy divide between editorial and advertising.''

<P>
   LIJIAGOU, China _ At first glance, Hong Mei, a willowy
12-year-old in a long floral skirt and hoop earrings, seems a
beacon of color and sophistication in this poor mountain village
where the streets, the mud homes, even the crops are the same drab
dusty brown.
</P>
<P>
   But her story is depressingly typical of poor Chinese girls:
Although nine years of education is compulsory in China, Hong Mei
has never been to school. ``Of course I'd like to go, but it's too
expensive and my mother needs my help at home,'' she quietly
explained. Her three younger brothers are all enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   School fees in Lijiagou have risen from $2.50 to $7.50 per
five-month semester in the past five years _ a huge sum in a region
where per capita income is $50 a year and the payback of literacy
seems far away. And the Hui Muslims who live here in Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, like families in much of poor rural China, have
never seen much point in educating daughters anyway.
</P>
<P>
   All told, only 20 percent of girls _ and 40 percent of boys _
are now in school in Lijiagou.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of poor rural China, economics are keeping an
increasing number of children out of the classroom. Required fees
at state schools have grown exponentially since the central
government largely stopped subsidizing primary education a decade
ago. Today education is increasingly a luxury item, purchased only
when finances allow _ and far more often for boys than for girls.
</P>
<P>
   An aggressive government campaign to achieve 100 percent
enrollment by the year 2000 has pushed attendance up in more
prosperous regions, experts say. But in a number of poor rural
areas, they add, only a fraction of children are in school.
</P>
<P>
   The government has exhorted local officials to work harder on
education and has solicited charitable donations to subsidize
schooling though Project Hope, run by the China Youth Foundation,
and the Spring Bud Project for girls, run by the Women's
Federation. Each has had success in the towns where it operates.
</P>
<P>
   Hai Minglian, a shy 10-year-old Hui girl with tattered cloth
shoes and a red thread holding back long black hair, is now in a
second-grade class, one of two organized by the Spring Bud Project,
in the village of Kaicheng, also in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
   Every day after school, she packs up her pencil stub and the
razor blade she uses as a sharpener and trudges back to the cave
her family calls home. She feeds the ox and prepares a meal for her
parents when they return from the fields. ``Without Spring Bud,''
she said, ``there is no way I could go to school.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dropout problem generally dwarfs the resources available
to combat it. There are only 48 Spring Bud classes in Guyuan
County, which includes Kaicheng, spread among 127 poor towns. Even
Project Hope, the biggest educational assistance program in the
country, sponsors only one-third of eligible children in the poor
counties where it operates.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation of five provinces and cities last month,
Peng Peiyun, deputy head of the National People's Congress,
estimated that only 2 percent of counties officially designated as
poverty areas had met state standards for education as of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Most education experts say that it is hard to know the true
magnitude of the problem, since statistics collected by the local
governments are notoriously unreliable, tweaked to meet government
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, China's most popular investigative television show,
Focus, profiled a middle school in rural Anhui province where
school officials forced 200 children who had dropped out to
masquerade as students for the annual inspection by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government campaign for universal enrollment has had two
results,'' said Yuan Fang, a researcher at the National Research
Center for the Development of Science and Technology, who has
studied the impact of Project Hope. ``The first is that the
situation in the country as a whole is improving in the last few
years. The second is that a lot of the statistics we get from local
governments are fake. In some counties we visited, leaders just
said that meeting the goal was impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Chinese primary education is based on a problematic
equation, financed almost exclusively by individual villages and
towns, which, in rural areas, often lack money.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on education to be published soon, a Communist Youth
League official in Guyuan laid out his county's dilemma: Total
revenue is less than $2 million a year, in a county with half a
million people and 408 schools. Just to pay the county's 5,000
teachers requires more than $3 million annually _ and that does not
begin to address costs like classroom supplies and building upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   And so the schools, which are not allowed to charge tuition
fees, instead assess an ever-growing list of ``miscellaneous
fees.'' In one typical school studied by Yuan, these included a
book fee, a materials fee, a substitute teaching fee, an
electricity fee, a coal fee, even a fee to raise matching funds for
a World Bank Loan.
</P>
<P>
   The fees often total $20 to $35 a year, a huge amount for
subsistence farmers. And in remote rural regions, where families
generally have two or more children, parents must choose each year
who, if anyone, goes to school.
</P>
<P>
   Kong Lanying said she believes in education but cannot always
afford to enroll her daughter, who is now 14 but _ because of her
erratic attendance _ is in the fourth grade. ``Whether she goes
depends on whether we have the money at the time,'' she said,
standing in front of the mud hut that is her home, with a tattered
quilt serving as the front door.
</P>
<P>
   The vagaries of family finances mean that many students have a
disjointed education, and a single elementary school class can
contain children aged 7 to 14.
</P>
<P>
   In Guyuan's impoverished villages, less than 60 percent of boys
and 50 percent of girls go to school, according to the report. Even
according to the latest central government statistics, 25 percent
of students in Ningxia drop out after one year and less than 50
percent finish elementary school, completing sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the conflict between subsistence and education, subsistence
is the priority and compulsory education is beyond talking about _
the goal of realizing compulsory education by the year 2000 is for
us a beautiful dream,'' said the official with Guyuan's Communist
Youth League.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even without good statistics, there is evidence that the dropout
rate is climbing.
</P>
<P>
   This month, in a front-page essay in the national newspaper
Farmer's Daily, an official from a poor prefecture in Shandong
province painted a grim picture. He said that many townships were
spending more than half their revenue to pay teachers, who were
often paid late or not at all and had to quit or take second jobs
that interfered with teaching. School fees ``exceeded the capacity
of a proportion of families,'' said the official, Li Chang.
</P>
<P>
   ``In parts of the countryside, the occurrence of students
resisting going to school or dropping out has become increasingly
serious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a township Communist Party secretary in western
Qinghai province, a sparsely populated area of nomadic herders,
recently told the Economic Information Daily that ``mobilizing
children to go to school has become the biggest headache for our
township and village cadres.''
</P>
<P>
   Herders, the official said, are unwilling to send their
children; the five secondary schools in the region have seen
attendance drop from more than 6,000 earlier in the decade to 1,170
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rising cost of education is the biggest precipitant,
researchers say. ``Children can't go to school, because their
families can't pay,'' said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
   Recent changes in China's labor market also mean that poor
farmers see fewer benefits to schooling.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, education was a reliable route for smart children
to escape the countryside _ springing from local schools to the
country's free regional universities and on to a secure government
job.
</P>
<P>
   But today, China's universities have started to charge
significant tuition fees, beyond the reach of the very poor. Also,
with China's state sector shrinking and the economy slumping, more
college graduates are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, university graduates would all get jobs,'' said
Shi Jinghuan, a researcher at Beijing Normal University, China's
most prestigious teachers' college. ``But now it's much harder. And
these rural kids don't have connections. So they don't get jobs,
and then come back to work in the fields _ which they're not good
at anyway. So, unfortunately, the parents say `Why bother?'''
</P>
<P>
   Mei-Duo-Er-Cai, a herder and local official in Qinghai, told the
Economic Information Daily that in 1997, 53 recent university
graduates returned home to her rural area, jobless. Because of
China's strict system of residency permits, graduates who do not
find employment must return to their registered homes.
</P>
<P>
   Girls bear the brunt of the hardship. The sidewalks of Beijing's
clubby Sanlitun district are dotted with school-age girls from
poorer provinces selling flowers _ often to support their brothers'
tuition. Female dropout rates are particularly high in the Muslim
minority areas, like the poor villages of southern Ningxia, where
workers in the Spring Bud program fight local biases.
</P>
<P>
   In somewhat more prosperous regions, children drop out at
slightly later ages, but the problem still exists. In one study in
Chongqing County, Sichuan province, more than 30 percent of
children ages 12 to 17 in poor areas were dropouts, and
three-quarters of the dropouts were girls.
</P>
<P>
   The preponderance of female dropouts reflects centuries-old
biases, but also practical considerations: In rural China, a
married daughter moves away to her husband's community, while a
married son remains at home to support his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Shan Xinlian, a Hui woman in Nanjiao, Ningxia, has two sons,
ages 7 and 12, in elementary school and an 8-year-old daughter in a
subsidized second-grade class for girls. Ms. Shan never went to
school _ and freely admits that her daughter probably wouldn't go
either if she had to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our village, girls are not as important,'' she said.
``School is so expensive. And what's the point of paying all that
money, since she'll belong to another family once she gets
married?''

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``MY CAT SPIT MCGEE'' &QL; 
By Willie Morris (Random House, $18.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of any cat hater, this is a major defection.
Morris was a confirmed dog man most of his life. First there was
Skip, about whom Morris wrote a book called ``My Dog Skip,'' and
then there was Pete, a carefree black lab who hung out with the
guys at the local gas station and counted Truman Capote among his
many friends before he settled down with Morris. In the last years
of his life (he died of heart failure this year), however, Willie
Morris loved a cat. Not that he went gently. When he noticed his
faltering resistence to feline company, he consulted with a friend,
the dog-loving Eudora Welty (who was no help), and with a
psychiatrist, who told him it was not unmanly to love a cat. And so
he and Spit McGee became a twosome, Morris spellbound and smitten
and companionable, Spit haughty and all-knowing and coy. This is
Morris' ode to Spit, whom he sometimes believed was his dog Skip
reincarnated. However, Spit was Spit and no one else. Do you have
to love cats to love this book? We'll be honest with you _ it
helps. A little Spit McGee goes a long way. ``This afternoon the
two of us were down by the creek sitting together in our favorite
spot,'' Morris writes. ``It was false spring again in January and
the warming sunlight fell languidly upon us. As I stroked him on
his back, once again he snuggled into my lap. `I love you, Spitty,'
I said. He extended his paw toward me.'' Pete and Skip are probably
spinning in their graves. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``CARE PACKAGES: LETTERS TO CHRISTOPHER REEVE FROM STRANGERS AND
OTHER FRIENDS'' &QL; 
By Dana Reeve (Random House, $20) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get out your hankies, folks. This is a weeper. And yet it's not
a sappy book. We thought it would be, and we opened it with
considerable reluctance. Then we got our hankies out and read to
the last letter in the pile. The people who have written to Reeve
since he was paralyzed in a riding accident four years ago _
especially the strangers _ are not overly sentimental people. They
tend to be survivors themselves, who have faced physical adversity
and come out of it reborn, if not recovered. Their messages tend
toward the challenging. Buck up. Don't let people tell you what you
can't do. Things might never be the same, but make something of the
life you have now. Never give up. Never. Dana Reeve also includes
letters from old acquaintances who knew her husband both as himself
and as Superman, and from celebrities who sent their good wishes
and encouragement. Here's a note, in its entirety, from a
7-year-old boy: ``Hope you'll come out of hospital soon. And you
can come round. Dad will help you up the stair's.'' (cq) Paul
McCartney wrote about the day he and his young son, a huge Superman
fan, traveled on the same plane with Reeve to America from London.
``You were kind enough to give him a big wave when he turned around
to look at you,'' McCartney said. ``That's the kind of thing that
means a lot to soppy old parents like us, and something we won't
forget in a hurry.'' And Katharine Hepburn typed this _ ``Let me
know if I can do anything _ My golly what a mess.'' and signed it
with a very shaky hand. It's hard not to be heartened by the
collective goodness of these people, who took time out of their
days to reach out to a man in need. ``By compiling these letters,''
Reeve says in his foreword, ``Dana is sharing with you and
reminding me of words that helped me start a new life. For that I
am deeply grateful.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BASEBALL'S 25 GREATEST MOMENTS'' &QL; 
(The Sporting News, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We showed this book to a rabid Pirates fan, who let it be known
that the editors erred deeply when they ranked Bobby Thomson's home
run against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1951 pennant race over
Pittsburgh second baseman Bill Mazeroski's homer in the last game
of the 1960 World Series. It's that kind of book _ you don't check
your allegiances at the door. Also among the Top 10: the hobbled
Kirk Gibson's home run in the opening game of the 1988 World
Series; Bill Buckner's devastating error in game six of the 1986
series; Don Larsen's perfect game for the Yankees over Brooklyn in
Game Five of the 1956 series; and ``The Catch,'' which Willie Mays
made in 1954 and has been downplayed ever since, but we think it's
just the most amazing thing, so amazing that we could watch it
forever. Our Pirates fan says the first 10 ``greatest moments'' are
fun, but after that the editors make some faulty picks and leave
themselves open to ridicule. As we said, it's that kind of book. &QL; 
``THE WAY WE LIVED THEN'' &QL; 
By Dominick Dunne (Crown, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he was 9, Dunne's aunt took him from his home in
Connecticut on a vacation in the West. Their first stop was Los
Angeles, and when they got onto the bus that toured movie stars
homes, Dunne sat next to the guide so that he wouldn't miss
anything. In truth, he knew more about the stars than the guide did
_ he was already steeped in Hollywood gossip and glamour, the
intrigue and the dirt. Years later, as a young stage manager, he
attended his first Hollywood party at the home of Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall, where he saw Judy Garland, who lived next door,
and Lana Turner, who lived next door on the other side (she walked
in late, ``looking the way you wanted Lana Turner to look''), Frank
Sinatra, Spencer Tracy and so many others. ``Before the night was
over, people jumped in the pool in their party clothes,'' he says.
``I jumped in, too. I wanted to be a part of it. I thought to
myself, `This is how I want to live.' '' He did, for a long time.
This is his memoir of life in Hollywood, with photographs from his
own scrapbooks showing the stars at leisure.  &QL;

<P>
   We showed this book to a rabid Pirates fan, who let it be known
that the editors erred deeply when they ranked Bobby Thomson's home
run against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1951 pennant race over
Pittsburgh second baseman Bill Mazeroski's homer in the last game
of the 1960 World Series. It's that kind of book _ you don't check
your allegiances at the door. Also among the Top 10: the hobbled
Kirk Gibson's home run in the opening game of the 1988 World
Series; Bill Buckner's devastating error in game six of the 1986
series; Don Larsen's perfect game for the Yankees over Brooklyn in
Game Five of the 1956 series; and ``The Catch,'' which Willie Mays
made in 1954 and has been downplayed ever since, but we think it's
just the most amazing thing, so amazing that we could watch it
forever. Our Pirates fan says the first 10 ``greatest moments'' are
fun, but after that the editors make some faulty picks and leave
themselves open to ridicule. As we said, it's that kind of book. &QL; 
``THE WAY WE LIVED THEN'' &QL; 
By Dominick Dunne (Crown, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he was 9, Dunne's aunt took him from his home in
Connecticut on a vacation in the West. Their first stop was Los
Angeles, and when they got onto the bus that toured movie stars
homes, Dunne sat next to the guide so that he wouldn't miss
anything. In truth, he knew more about the stars than the guide did
_ he was already steeped in Hollywood gossip and glamour, the
intrigue and the dirt. Years later, as a young stage manager, he
attended his first Hollywood party at the home of Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall, where he saw Judy Garland, who lived next door,
and Lana Turner, who lived next door on the other side (she walked
in late, ``looking the way you wanted Lana Turner to look''), Frank
Sinatra, Spencer Tracy and so many others. ``Before the night was
over, people jumped in the pool in their party clothes,'' he says.
``I jumped in, too. I wanted to be a part of it. I thought to
myself, `This is how I want to live.' '' He did, for a long time.
This is his memoir of life in Hollywood, with photographs from his
own scrapbooks showing the stars at leisure.  &QL;

 &HT;    O'Leary pleased with Jackets' chemistry
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Team chemistry is one of those hard to define sporting
terms. Coaches just know it's not there when they don't see it, and
they rejoice when it does present itself.
</P>
<P>
   You can count Georgia Tech's George O'Leary as one happy coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played with a lot more crispness, a lot more
sharpness and with a lot more spark,'' O'Leary said Sunday after
reviewing film of the Yellow Jackets 48-21 beating of North
Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good way to start the second half of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between leaving the field after eking out a win over
Duke two weeks ago, and taking on the Wolfpack, Tech (6-1, 4-1 ACC)
re-captured that crucial element.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and did the things we needed to do to establish
ourselves early,'' said quarterback Joe Hamilton, who had 295 total
yards and passed for three touchdowns. ``We (had) been coming out
in the second half and not finishing teams off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to come out early and execute when we needed
to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets stuffed N.C. State well enough to take a 38-14 lead
into the final quarter. O'Leary was presented with a rare
opportunity to rest Hamilton, and allow backup George Godsey to
perform with the first unit.
</P>
<P>
   Godsey, who will likely enter the spring in a battle with
freshmen Andy Hall and Brian Camp to succeed Hamilton, overcame a
slow start.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore from Tampa was 3 of 5 passing for 35 yards, and
threw an interception on his first drive. But after a sideline chat
with O'Leary, he settled down and led the Jackets to 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he did a good job,'' O'Leary said. ``He moved the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the defense, though, that really delighted the coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets allowed 410 yards, but 166 of them came on three
plays: a 70-yard TD pass on busted covera6-yard pass off a
fake punt and a late 60-yard pass against the Jackets backups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot more speed to the ball,'' said O'Leary, who
singled out strong safety Chris Young (10 tackles, two pass
breakups) and free safety Jeremy Muyres (three tackles) for their
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Lending big helping hands were linebacker Nick Rogers (seven
tackles and an interception), defensive end Felipe Claybrooks (five
tackles, including one for a loss) and cornerbacks Marvious Hester
(two PBUs) and Jamara Clark (one PBU).
</P>
<P>
   However, outside linebacker Chris Edwards re-injured his
shoulder, and is listed as day-to-day.

 &HT;    Hindus blast Baptists' ``guide''
 &HT;    By Paul Donsky
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _About 60 Hindus attended a rally Sunday at Centennial
Olympic Park to protest what they see as efforts by the Southern
Baptist Convention to denigrate Hinduism and convert Hindus.
</P>
<P>
   The issue erupted a week ago, when the Southern Baptist
Convention published a ``prayer guide'' that made reference to
Hinduism's shortcomings. Hindus took offense to the claims,
including one that said Hindus do not have the concept of sin or
personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist leaders say the prayer pamphlets are not
evangelical conversion manuals. But Hindus like Shyam Tiwari of
Duluth said they felt their religion is under attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically the pain which we feel because of the
denigration of Hindus and Hinduism by Southern Baptists,'' said
Tiwari, a software developer. ``We wanted to express our feelings
as well as to enlighten these people, if we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The protestors lined up along a street in the park and held
signs for passing motorists and walkers. One sign read ``Bigotry
and Hatred, the world can live without.'' Another: ``Truth is one.
Wise call it different.''
</P>
<P>
   They stood silently for several minutes before breaking out in
songs, one about universal brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist's booklet ``insults and maligns Hinduism and the
Hindus,'' said Dhiru Shah of Alpharetta, who helped organize the
rally. ``We believe that conversion _ it goes against the human
spirit. We believe that there is only one God, and that God is for
everybody. There's no reason to convert anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 800,000 Hindus in the word, mostly in India,
Sri Lanka and Nepal. The ancient religion holds that there is only
one supreme truth that is the cause of all existence. Hindus also
believe in reincarnation _ that individual souls pass through many
lives before attaining ``Moksha'' _ liberation from the cycle or
birth and death.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a traditional Indian dress, Manju Tiwari of Duluth
joined the protest because she wanted people to learn the truth
about Hinduism.
</P>
<P>
   What the Baptists are saying ``is not right. That's why I'm
here. What they're saying is wrong,'' she said.

 &HT;    Bradley is difficult to pigeon hole on issues
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During Senate consideration of federal subsidies to
the corn-based ethanol industry in 1994, then-senator Bill Bradley
served up the type of sound bite made for the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the ethanol industry has not drilled the ground,''
said Bradley, who had introduced legislation to phase out the
ethanol subsidy. ``They have drilled the tax code, and they have
uncovered a gusher: $1 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's stance on ethanol was typical for the New Jersey
politician. A fiscal disciplinarian, Bradley waged at times a
one-man campaign to phase out tax loopholes. His crowing
achievement in the Senate was passage of the 1986 tax cut bill,
which eliminated some $200 billion in tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Now running for the Democratic nomination for president,
candidate Bradley has taken a different stance. Bradley now favors
continuing federal subsidies to the ethanol industry, a powerful
constituency in Iowa, where the first presidential balloting will
take place. Bradley has also proposed nearly $80 billion in new
federal spending, the most of any presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Bradley is campaigning in an era of budget
surpluses, far different from the budget deficits that
characterized his three Senate terms. But observers still detect a
shift in both style and substance from Bradley's 18 years in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being more political and being more orthodox to interest
group demands or litmus tests than he was in the Senate,'' says
Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute,
representing the centrist wing of the Democratic Party. ``That's
not unprecedented, but I think that is a valid ground on which he
can be questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Having voted for pilot school voucher programs in the Senate,
Bradley now says that vouchers are not the answer to the problems
in public education.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley has been the most expansive of any candidate in
talking about race relations in America and discrimination against
gays and lesbians. His call to include sexual orientation as a
protected right under the 1964 Civil Rights Act and license all
handguns goes beyond Gore on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taken a slight left turn rhetorically,'' says Marshall
Whittmann, director of congressional relations at the Heritage
Foundation. ``I wouldn't say it's a significant left turn, but he
seems to be trying to position himself somewhat to Al Gore's
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradley is difficult to pigeon hole. In the Senate, he
was aggressive on child poverty issues, sponsoring both child care
initiatives and expansions of the earned income tax credit, a cash
rebate for the working poor. Bradley was also an early champion of
campaign finance reform and he attracted national attention when he
took to the Senate floor in 1992 to condemn Rodney King's beating
by the Los Angeles police.
</P>
<P>
   All those ideas have become central themes of Bradley's campaign
for president.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal that has drawn the most attention, and the most
criticism from Gore, is Bradley's $55 to $65 billion plan to offer
health insurance to the poor and working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, the proposal fits neatly with Bradley's Senate
record of seeking bold solutions to big, complicated problems,
reminiscent of his work on the 1986 tax bill. The proposal also
relies on the government subsidizing coverage through private
health plans, echoing the kind of public-private partnerships that
Bradley championed in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal is also a departure from Bradley's Senate
record. Although Bradley repeatedly fought to expand Medicaid
coverage for poor families, he was a sideline player during the
1994 debate over President Clinton's call for universal health
care.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ultimately committed to a plan being offered by some
moderate Republicans and centrist Democrats, only to back away from
that proposal when it weakened requirements for universal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more daring now,'' says Sen. Frank Lautenberg
(D-N.J.), who served with Bradley from the Garden State for 14
years. ``I always thought of Bill as being much more conservative.
I'm not talking politically, I'm talking about functionally....When
Bill Bradley talks about covering everybody with universal care,
well, even those words got to be dirty words in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters see his campaign themes as being natural
progressions from his Senate career. They say that Bradley has
always been willing tackle problems that other politicians left
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is tax reform cautious?'' says Marcia Aronoff, a senior
campaign aide who for 12 years served as Bradley's top Senate
staffer. ``Is it cautious to be talking about race in the Senate
when it's not a hot issue?....He's had a long history of trying to
think problems through and trying to deal with things that are
fundamentally important.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform is another example of how it is
difficult to categorize Bradley's Senate record and campaign
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was among the first members of Congress to embrace
public financing of federal elections and free television time for
candidates running for office. In the 1980s, public financing was
considered almost kooky. Today, the debate has shifted and public
financing has gained credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the case when Bradley was in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He espoused positions that were so lacking in support in the
Congress that they weren't even on the agenda, so he wasn't a
player in these debates,'' says scholar Thomas Mann of the
Brookings Institute, who believes Bradley and Gore are two of the
most similar candidates ever to run for president. ``He wasn't
actually engaged in trying to pass a law. He engaged in position
taking that had no constituency in the Congress. And that is
basically what he is doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's $10 billion plan to end child poverty, doubling
Headstart, increasing the minimum wage and expanding the earned
income tax credit, fit perhaps most closely with the issues Bradley
worked on in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a tireless spokesman on the needs of children,'' says
Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.). But Mikulski also says that Bradley
was ``usually more explicit on how he was going to pay for
things.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Bradley's presidential platform may be a
function of the changed fiscal environment in Washington. Bradley
served during an era of deficit spending and budget shortfalls, a
far cry from the trillion dollar surpluses now being projected over
the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be bolder now,'' says C. Michael Aho, an economist who
worked for Bradley in the early 1980s. ``Back then, we were talking
about what programs we could save. We were running defense.''

CALIFORNIA JUDGE RULES REPORTER CAN REFUSE TO DISCLOSE MATERIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A judge has declined to order a reporter to
provide prosecutors and defense lawyers with notes and tape
recordings of an interview with a defendant in a racially charged
murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI agent testified that the reporter told him that the
defendant, Randall Lee Rojas, had admitted committing a murder in
1995. He identified the reporter as Trish O'Kane, who writes for
Intelligence Report, a magazine of the Southern Poverty Law Center,
a civil rights group in Montgomery, Ala. Lawyers for two of Rojas'
co-defendants, Ritch Bryant and Jessica Colwell, sought the
material as evidence that their clients had no hand in the Nov. 25,
1995, beating death of a black man, Milton Walker Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing on Oct. 27, Judge Lance A. Ito of the Los Angeles
Superior Court said the interview contained ``nothing close to
being exculpatory'' for the defense. He noted the material would
assist the prosecution's case, but found the evidence was available
through other means and that there was no need to pierce
California's shield law, which essentially protects reporters from
being compelled to provide evidence to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center tracks hate groups, and
Intelligence Report covers right-wing extremists. Rojas' lawyer,
Donald Calabria, questioned how Ms. O'Kane had entered the Los
Angeles County Jail without filling out required media forms and
had interviewed his client without his knowledge. Judge Ito noted
that a Los Angeles sheriff's department investigator helped arrange
the interview and even participated, posing questions for Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Kane disclosed a portion of the interview to an FBI agent
about a month later, though her editor, Mark Potok, said in an
interview that the disclosure was inadvertent and that the
magazine's reporters do not collaborate with law enforcement
authorities.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Another very pleasant autumn day is expected from the Middle
Atlantic States to New England. Once again, fog will be gathered in
thick patches along the coast, delaying morning travel at a number
of airports. Sunshine will dominate the midday and afternoon,
raising temperatures 15 degrees above seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   A large disturbance over the Gulf states, which had become
detached from the jet stream late last week, will start to rejoin
the main steering current on Monday. Low pressure in Louisiana will
bring rain from the lower Mississippi Valley to eastern Alabama.
Tropical moisture associated with Katrina, a strengthening
depression in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, will stream into Florida
triggering heavy showers in western sections.
</P>
<P>
   A strong cold front will accelerate southeastward through the
Plains and toward the Mississippi Valley. This front will catch up
to the low in the Deep South and cause the storm to strengthen and
move swiftly toward the northeast on Tuesday. Brisk winds from the
northwest will drive very chilly air from the Dakotas to the Middle
West. Snow showers will develop in northern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous high pressure system, centered over Montana, will
control the weather in the western half of the nation. The
clockwise circulation will bring cold, moist air and snow flurries
to parts of Wyoming and Colorado. A dry and cooler air flow is
likely in the central Rockies. The West Coast will notice milder
winds from the east under mainly sunny skies, though some high
clouds will dim the sunshine in the Northwest and Southwest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Changing Times &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While turning back the clock cannot change the weather, Sunday's
shift to standard time can alter weather perceptions. Many daytime
weather trends begin at sunrise. The flood of solar energy causes
the temperature to rise abruptly. This warming sets the air into
motion, causing winds to increase. Fog starts to dissipate as the
rays of the sun penetrate the morning mist. Of course, strong
weather systems can overwhelm these daily cycles. But, on average,
as most people begin their day, the weather this week will be
windier, warmer and brighter than last week as a result of the
change in time. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a working-class New York City neighborhood, a
14-year-old girl faces a dilemma. As a student at a performing arts
school, she has just won an audition to join a singing group, but
this means going on tour, away from family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what are you gonna do?'' her best girlfriend asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know yet,'' she says. ``My mother wants me to really
think about it, so I'm trying to take my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Girlfriend: ``It wouldn't take me long to make up my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, a boy: ``Well, you're not the brightest crayon
in the box, now are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Girlfriend, glaring at him: ``I'm trying to imagine you with a
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Girl: ``I'm trying to imagine myself without you guys.''
</P>
<P>
   This scene is from the script of the pilot episode of ``Taina,''
a prime-time television series that Nickelodeon plans to try out
with its children's audience by next year.
</P>
<P>
   The cable network expects the show's universal themes, musical
numbers and focus on a teenager and her multigenerational family to
appeal not only to children but also to their parents. But
``Taina,'' whose pilot episode was shot in New York last week,
would also be an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Queens, its lead character is Puerto Rican _ the name
Taina refers to the Taino, the indigenous people of the island _
and most of the major roles are also played by Latino actors. So
rare is an all-Latino principal cast on television today that a
coalition of Hispanic groups staged a two-week boycott of the major
networks in September to protest the absence of Latinos in prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   While the ``brownout'' of ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox, and the threat
of similar protests by black and Asian-American organizations,
prompted executives and producers to hastily add minority
characters to their fall lineups, a show like ``Taina'' could not
do without a Latino cast.
</P>
<P>
   Its producer and creator, Maria Perez-Brown, 37, said she wanted
to portray the existence of a teen-age girl navigating two cultures
_ those of her traditional, three-generation Latino household and
of school and the city outside. The girl retains values from one as
she is immersed in the other.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is based on Ms. Perez-Brown's own experiences
growing up in Puerto Rico, in Brooklyn and in Hartford, and, she
said, on ``my fantasy experiences _ the kind of childhood I would
have liked to have had.'' The show has been in development for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about taking the genre, like a comedy, to capture the
Latino world,'' Ms. Perez-Brown said. ``It's not just putting
Latino faces on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon has previously presented multicultural shows and
some with predominantly black and Asian casts. But ``Taina'' is the
first among half a dozen projects with Latino themes that the cable
network is nurturing through varying stages of development. Another
is ``The Brothers Garcia,'' a Mexican-American family drama-comedy
reminiscent of ``The Wonder Years'' created by Jeff Valdez, a Los
Angeles producer of Latino English-language and bilingual programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon executives said the productions respond to the
demographic growth of Latinos in the United States _ to 31 million
people, or 11 percent of the country's population _ and the
network's commitment to reflect the world children live in
accurately. Nickelodeon creates shows for all children 2 to 11.
</P>
<P>
   Albie Hecht, Nickelodeon's president for film and television
entertainment, said the shows were a step in a new direction for
the network in both theme and appeal _ the aim is to attract not
just children but also their families. Feedback by network viewers
indicates they want more emphasis on relationships between children
and parents.
</P>
<P>
   In the adult world, the Latino experience has been central to
few shows _ ``Que Pasa, U.S.A.?,'' ``Chico and the Man.'' Now,
under criticism, some networks have announced new development
deals, including a CBS series about several generations of a
Mexican-American family by the filmmaker Gregory Nava, who directed
the film ``Selena.''
</P>
<P>
   Network executives and minority actors and writers say the low
profile of minorities in television is more a function of
indifference than racism, but Valdez said that in the case of
Latinos there was also the misconception that the audience was
already taken care of by Spanish-language television.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a myth that we only speak Spanish,'' said the
producer, who is negotiating with investors to start a cable
channel concentrating on English-speaking Latinos next year.
``We're hellbent on changing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The characters in ``Taina'' and ``The Brothers Garcia'' are
intended to defy stereotypes often seen on television. Thus they
speak with no accent except when warranted, as in the case of
Taina's grandfather, the only one in the family born in Puerto
Rico. In ``The Brothers Garcia'' the father is present and
responsible; the mother in ``Taina'' is smart, liberal and friends
with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Perez-Brown, a New York City entertainment lawyer and
television producer who runs her own production company, Dorado
Entertainment Inc., already has a successful track record with
Nickelodeon. She was executive producer and a creator of ``Gullah
Gullah Island,'' a popular Nickelodeon live-action series for
preschoolers that has run since 1994 and features a multiethnic
cast.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Perez-Brown said she originally wanted that series to be set
in Puerto Rico, but it soon became obvious that it could not be
done in English without hurting its authenticity. The show and one
of its main characters, a large yellow talking frog, was relocated
to coastal South Carolina, where the West African culture and
language, both called ``gullah,'' have survived for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Taina,'' the action revolves around Taina Morales, who
attends ``the Manhattan School of the Arts.'' She ``wants to be
Selena _ a singer, a dancer, a performer'' _ and she's relentless,
the producer said. She lives with her father, a police investigator
who runs a car service on the side; her mother, a teacher; her
7-year-old sister, and a recently widowed grandfather. Taina's aunt
seems to be always hanging around.
</P>
<P>
   Taina inhabits a hip, contemporary urban world that comes with
eclectic music _ salsa, R&AMP;B, hip-hop _ and she has three best
friends, two black and one white. Her nemesis at school is Maritza
Diaz, born to a Puerto Rican father and an African-American mother
and ``a character kids love to hate,'' Ms. Perez-Brown said. The
producer modeled it after the girl who stole her boyfriend when the
was 14.
</P>
<P>
   In selling ``Taina,'' Ms. Perez-Brown said, she tailored the
story to cater to the network's taste _ realistic characters, with
a child's point of view, who delve into issues that appeal to a
general audience of children. She said she pitched the show armed
with well-developed characters, 13 story lines (enough for a
season), research from focus groups of Latino and black teenagers
(their favorite show: ``Seinfeld'') and a business proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, here's an opportunity for you to make a bunch of
money,'' she said. ``In a way, it's giving them a model for how to
sell the series, how to promote it. How to use the music to make
records and music videos, how to take advantage of subsidiary uses
for this property. You can't assume they see the vision you have
for the show.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While excited about the project, executives of Nickelodeon,
which has invested about $600,000 on development, also want it to
maintain a broad appeal. Ms. Perez-Brown and the executives said a
large part of the give-and-take in the development process was how
to balance accurate portrayals with the need to keep both Hispanic
and non-Hispanic viewers interested. What is the right mix of
references to the Latino family? How much Spanish to include? Would
everyone get the jokes?
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we keep the authenticity while keeping everybody else
involved?'' Hecht said. ``There is a sweet spot.''
</P>
<P>
   That balancing effort was in evidence at a script reading by
cast members for the pilot episode last month. A common
teenager-parent issue _ when are children old enough to make their
own decisions? _ was given a Hispanic spin (applicable to other
ethnic groups as well) when the extended family butts in after
Taina has announced that she wants to join the touring band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, your Dad and I had a family meeting with Abuelo and
Titi Rosa,'' her mother tells her.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I wasn't included?'' Taina asks incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Perez-Brown pokes fun at Hispanic culture by challenging the
sexist lyrics of Spanish ballads. ``Write your name across my
forehead, papi chulo, so everyone will know,'' Taina's mother and
aunt sing at one point as they cook. ``I want the world to know. So
everyone will know I'm your girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that a little demeaning?'' Taina asks. ``Wanting a guy
to write his name on your forehead?''
</P>
<P>
   Kayla, her 7-year-old sister, pipes in, ``I don't want nobody
writing on my head.''
</P>
<P>
   The situations would be instantly recognizable to many Hispanic
families, including Ms. Perez-Brown's own. She drew on her
childhood with a single mother and four siblings, growing up poor
in Puerto Rico, moving to East New York in Brooklyn and to a house
in Hartford shared with aunts and cousins, then going off to Yale
University and New York University Law School and a successful
career.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Perez-Brown, who is married to a journalist and writer, said
she wrote ``Taina'' mindful of studies that show the influence of
television in shaping the attitudes and self-esteem of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This girl is going to be true to herself,'' she said of Taina.
``She's going to know who she is and not feel inferior. Nothing is
going to stop this girl from pursuing success in her own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Manolo Villaverde, 63, a Cuban-American actor
who worked in ``Que Pasa, U.S.A.?,'' the PBS series about an
immigrant Cuban family. So much time has elapsed between that
all-Latino series and his next one that Villaverde, who played the
father in ``Que Pasa, U.S.A.?, plays the grandfather in ``Taina.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lozada, 17, who plays Taina, said after the reading, ``I
know it's going to blow up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a big deal that it's in New York, that it's a
teen sitcom,'' she said. ``We've got a lot of music and now, with
Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez, with everything that's going on,
people are more into it. We have a good combination of things that
haven't been done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lozada, who is of Puerto Rican descent, has worked in
commercials, theater and ``snippets'' on television from the age of
8. ``This is my first time in a starring role and that I get to
show all my abilities at once,'' she said. ``I get to act, sing and
dance.'' And, she added, ``I get to be the Puerto Rican that I
am.''

MORE STATIONS BACK REVISED DTV STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost half of the nation's 1,600 television
stations have now expressed support for the Sinclair Broadcast
Group's campaign to revise the nation's standard for digital
television broadcasts. Among the supporters are 350 public
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Early in October, Sinclair, which owns more television stations
than any other company, filed a petition with the Federal
Communications Commission, arguing that the nation's digital
television standard was seriously flawed because receivers could
not easily pick up a watchable television signal in anything short
of ideal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of that filing, almost 300 television stations had
joined Sinclair. Now, the company announced late last week, the
number has grown to more than 750. Many have signed Sinclair's
petition, some have filed similar petitions of their own and others
have expressed support without taking any action.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair officials said they were gratified by the additional
support and expected to gain more. The company's petition asks the
FCC to revise the digital broadcasting standard, approved three
years ago, by adding a second transmission standard that is now
used in Europe. Tests run by Sinclair last summer showed that it
worked better in some circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations would be able to choose which transmission
standard they would use, and television receivers would be equipped
to receive either. The digital receivers already sold would not
work with the new standard, though it is possible that owners could
buy an add-on box that would enable them to receive the new
transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has not said what it may do with the Sinclair petition.
But the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, speaking
for the industries that oppose the petition, filed a motion to
dismiss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reopening the proceeding on a DTV standard years after its
adoption by the commission will benefit no one but the handful of
broadcasters desiring to delay the transition to digital
broadcasting,'' the motion said.

A DAY OF PRAYER MARKS REBIRTH OF EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ East Timor began its rebirth Sunday with a
huge and solemn religious procession down the waterfront road where
just hours before tanks had escorted the last departing Indonesian
soldiers to their ships.
</P>
<P>
   The city had been mostly emptied when local militias backed by
the military terrorized the population. Sunday the waterfront was
packed with thousands of people, singing hymns and offering Roman
Catholic prayers.
</P>
<P>
   At an open-air service, the celebrants broke into applause when
the Roman Catholic bishop, Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, addressed
the territory's former occupiers, saying, ``You have had 24 years
to build up East Timor but what is the result? Nonsense. Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered when he offered a hand of friendship but
added, ``With or without Indonesia, East Timor can stand alone and
can thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the first day since the invasion in 1975 that East
Timorese had gathered in the streets of a city free of Indonesian
control. ``This is our country now,'' said one of the participants,
Florentina Reis, a poet and human rights worker.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, East Timor is not yet fully theirs. It is now a
``non-self-governing territory'' administered by the United Nations
for an undetermined period of transition that could last two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
   And the weight of foreign military power was still heavy on the
streets Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The procession, honoring the feast of the Virgin Mary of Fatima,
was taking place two weeks late because the international
peacekeeping force that is now here had deemed the city not yet
secure enough on the earlier date.
</P>
<P>
   The hard work that must still be done to achieve full
independence was a theme of address by Belo, co-winner of the Nobel
Prize for Peace in 1996 for his efforts to free the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two or three years, we'll have a big party to celebrate our
independence, but only in two or three years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independence will be empty if East Timor just waits for others
to help,'' he cautioned the crowd. ``If you don't work hard you'll
be like beggars. You will be holding out your hand for help from
other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless he gave abundant thanks to those who have come to
East Timor's aid. ``Without you, we would never have survived,'' he
said, switching to English.
</P>
<P>
   The procession Sunday was the start of a period of remembrance
and reaffirmation here as East Timor struggles to recover from the
traumas of recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 200,000 people having died at the hands of the
Indonesian military, out of a population that now stands at
800,000, mourning the dead is a central ritual of national
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Souls Day here in East Timor is bigger than Christmas,''
said Father Rene Manubang, a Filipino missionary.
</P>
<P>
   Most homes throughout the territory were destroyed in the
militias' campaign of destruction, and most of the population fled
their homes or were forced into exile in a mass movement of people.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them are still trapped by the militias in encampments in
the neighboring Indonesian territory of West Timor. Most of them,
as well as many others who are still hiding in the hills of East
Timor, remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the procession began to mobilize Sunday afternoon, a
small crowd of people sat under a tree outside a refugee staging
point in central Dili _ as they do every day _ hoping that a
missing relative will suddenly appear.
</P>
<P>
   One is Teresa Perrera, a vegetable seller, whose 14-year-old son
is missing. One is Maria Freitas, whose son and daughter-in-law
have disappeared. One is Fernando dos Reis, a civil servant, who
shows people a typed list of the names of eight missing family
members.
</P>
<P>
   A girl of about 10 who waited here every day in hopes of meeting
her missing parents has stopped coming. Nobody knows why.

ALL SOME RETAILERS WANT BEFORE CHRISTMAS IS A WEB SITE THAT WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The e-commerce train is about to leave the station for the
second meaningful Internet shopping season, and when it does,
plenty of disappointed retailers will still be standing on the
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Stores like the Limited, Home Depot, Tiffany, Williams-Sonoma's
Pottery Barn, the Sports Authority and Gap's Old Navy are joining a
host of newly formed Internet companies in watching the calendar
move closer to Thanksgiving and the start of the online buying
binge. Some of those retailers are working around the clock to open
their sites within the next two weeks, but others are taking a
``wait till next year'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of reasons that some retailers will miss
this holiday season, analysts and executives say. Established
companies wary of sullying their brands with a weak Web site are
proceeding with extreme caution. Start-ups, on the other hand,
often underestimate the difficulty of building a good site and
miscalculate how long it will take. And everyone is struggling to
find enough programmers, designers, marketers and fulfillment
specialists to get the job done quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this comes down to simply believing that building a
site is an easy thing to do,'' said James McQuivey, an analyst with
Forrester Research. Part of the $10 million cost of building a
first-rate site is hiring people like developers, he said. ``But
guess what _ everybody else is, too,'' he went on. ``Some companies
have been looking for vice presidents of e-commerce all year. Then
you have to build the site, handle fulfillment, customer service
call centers, and on it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Rubin, an e-commerce consultant and chairwoman of
Shop.org, an industry trade group, said companies that handle
fulfillment and other tasks for Internet retailers ``are to this
day getting calls from people looking to get up before Christmas.''
Most of those calls are coming from those with no previous
e-commerce experience, she said. ``The ones with experience know
some of the steps,'' she added, ``and they typically started
planning their launch in the early spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it all the more puzzling that many deep-pocketed,
experienced retailers that witnessed the e-commerce surge last year
will not make it online this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jon Ricker, chief information officer of the
Limited, the company started planning the online rollout of its
brands _ including the Limited, Limited Express and Victoria's
Secret _ in mid-1997. So far, only Victoria's Secret is up and
running; neither the Limited nor Limited Express will have an
e-commerce site running this year. ``We refuse to do damage to our
brand,'' Ricker said. ``The lure of additional Christmas revenue
just isn't worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is easy to say that traditional retailers are lagging
behind because they are not yet able to operate at Internet speed,
Ricker said bigger retailers had more at stake than Internet
start-ups and were justifiably more cautious about risking their
reputations with a site that may not be ready for prime time. ``And
for a large retailer like ourselves with a global presence and
global sourcing,'' he said, ``there's a lot more to consider as you
put the model together.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, larger retail corporations with a single e-commerce
division can do justice to one brand's debut on the Web at a time,
said Shelley Nandkeolyar, vice president for e-commerce at
Williams-Sonoma. The company will introduce its site for
Williams-Sonoma (www.williams-sonoma.com) Monday, as scheduled,
Nandkeolyar said, but other company chains like Pottery Barn and,
appropriately enough, Hold Everything, will have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some hard negotiations between the brands about who
would launch when, but it made most sense to do it this way,''
Nandkeolyar said. The company started the Williams-Sonoma Wedding
and Gift Registry (www.wswedding.com) earlier this year ``to help
us learn about how to launch e-commerce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the Williams-Sonoma site is going up, and in short order
next year we'll bring the rest online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If executives like Ricker and Nandkeolyar sound less than
mortified at the prospect of leaving some of their brands on the
e-commerce shelf this year, they may have good reason, analysts
said. Despite the Web retail hyperbole, holiday sales this year
will amount to only $4 billion, according to Forrester Research.
``So I don't think the opportunity cost is huge,'' McQuivey of
Forrester said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But can you live without the confidence it inspires in Wall
Street, or in the boardroom, or the cachet it generates with
consumers who see you on the Web?'' McQuivey asked. ``I think the
opportunity costs are more intangible.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, retailers that miss the rush will also have to work
harder in the future to win customers away from stores that make
the holiday deadline and perform well. Mindful of this, executives
like Dick Sabot, chairman of Eziba.com (www.eziba.com), are
determined not to let November pass without getting started.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which will sell handmade goods from around the
world, is expected to go live within the next week _ thanks in part
to an unexpected source of pressure. ``We had to decide in August
on advertising placement,'' Sabot said, noting that recent ads in
magazines essentially committed the site to rolling out soon. ``If
it wasn't for the discipline that imposed on us, it's hard to
imagine how we would've forced ourselves to get it done. Looking
back, it was a fairly audacious thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another crucial factor in making the opening happen on time was
persuading e-commerce service providers to work with them. It was
no easy task, since fulfillment and Web site development companies
and advertising agencies were buried with work offers even in
March, when Eziba started building its site. ``We had to go in
there early and win the competition,'' Sabot said. ``And then we
had to convince them to internalize our deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Nandkeolyar of Williams-Sonoma said he had to guard against
``scope creep'' in the seven months it took to build the
Williams-Sonoma site. Six weeks ago, for instance, one member of
the site development team suggested building more content into a
section devoted to seasonal event planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we could do more, but it would require pages and
pages of programming, and that would jeopardize the launch date,''
he said. ``We couldn't get enough production, since we're in the
Bay Area and everyone's trying to launch by Nov. 1. So we'll just
have to build it out over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those that have managed to start operating on time are
often doing so quietly, in hopes of ironing out any wrinkles in the
system before the holiday deluge hits. Jim Finkelstein, president
of Luxuryfinder.com (www.luxuryfinder.com), a purveyor of the
pricey that went live late last month after eight months in
development, said he simply did not publicize the rollout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared for the rush, but we just want to make sure
we've got everything right,'' Finkelstein said. ``That's why you
try to get up a couple of months before the holidays. And that's
why it's smart for companies who couldn't launch by the fall to
wait until next year. If you want to create something that will
last, you have to go about it the right way.'' &QL;

STABILITY IS FOCUS OF LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After a recent campaign speech, Francisco
Labastida Ochoa slid behind the wheel of a Chevrolet Suburban,
roared onto a two-lane highway and accelerated to 100 miles per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   As Labastida, Mexico's leading presidential candidate, rocketed
past a line of farm trucks, his chief bodyguard was four Suburbans
back in the campaign convoy, clinging to the dashboard and shouting
to his driver to try to keep up with the boss.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida drives like a maniac. But his approach to politics is
methodical and discreet. He has served six presidents in 37 years
of public life and never rocked the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Now as he seeks the governing party's nomination, in a primary
election scheduled for Nov. 7, he is navigating with characteristic
caution. His positions on economics, drugs, relations with the
United States and other issues diverge sharply from those held by
President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet mindful that he needs the backing of the president's
supporters to win the vote that could well choose Mexico's next
president, he has portrayed himself as the candidate of stability
rather than an agent of dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest that his strategy is working. After a sluggish
start, Labastida has appeared to move out ahead of his closest
rival, Roberto Madrazo Pintado, a populist former governor who cast
himself as a maverick. But since this presidential primary is the
party's first and turnout is difficult to forecast, predicting the
winner is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   A primary victory would leave Labastida on the doorstep of the
presidency, because the opposition is divided and unlikely to
overtake the governing party's candidate in the general election on
July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he wins the primary, his biggest challenge may be
preventing a rupture in the party, the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, known by its acronym in Spanish as the PRI. The party is
bitterly split between foreign-trained economists who have
dominated Mexico's government's for years and its old-guard
politicians, who blame economic policies that have led to a drastic
erosion in living standards for the PRI's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is offering a unity program that promises something
for both sides. For the economic technocrats, he vows to keep
Mexico's deficit slender to prevent a financial crisis like those
that have followed every presidential succession since 1976. And to
the old guard, he is promising to open the domestic spending
spigot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first rule is, `Don't risk a crisis,''' Labastida said,
neatly daubing red chili on a shrimp taco during a meal aboard his
executive jet. ``But we're going to have more room to maneuver and
to spend more freely. Our government won't have to concentrate on
recovering from a devaluation. Instead we're going to be able to
build.''
</P>
<P>
   He has promised to create a million jobs a year _ double the
rate of the last three years _ by extending low-interest loans to
small and mid-sized businesses, establishing tax-free investment
zones, and especially by subsidizing the construction of low-cost
homes; he wants to triple the current rate of housing starts.
</P>
<P>
   To farmers, he has promised new subsidies for crops and a
doubling of existing subsidies for those who buy new tractors and
other equipment. Subsidies have been anathema among Zedillo's
technocrats. He has also questioned the usefulness of further
privatizations, a keystone of government policy since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal will be to generate jobs and recover social
mobility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If his approach differs dramatically from Zedillo's, Labastida
still appears to be running with the president's blessing. But how
he got it remains murky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was certainly not Zedillo's first choice,'' said Jorge
Castaneda, the author of a book detailing how modern Mexican
presidents have chosen their successors. ``They have almost nothing
in common.'' The Mexican president is limited to one six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   At 57, Labastida is 10 years older than Zedillo, and they had
never worked together before Zedillo made him his secretary of
agriculture in 1995. Early in his presidency, Zedillo seemed to be
grooming other potential successors. But after they fell victim to
crises and left the cabinet, Zedillo last year promoted Labastida
to head the powerful Interior Ministry, and a parade of PRI leaders
began to praise him as a man who could unify the party, said
Guillermo Ruiz de Teresa, Labastida's private secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida insisted that the announcement of his candidacy on May
18 came on his own initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just before I resigned, I told the president I was being
mentioned a lot as a potential candidate and that it was making my
work as interior minister difficult,'' Labastida said. ``Before
that, we'd only joked about it. `They mentioned you again,' the
president would say. Phrases like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the party establishment is backing Labastida, but the
president, as recently as last week , said he had no favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Some columnists have portrayed Labastida as a mediocre
politician who is running strong only because he is ``the official
candidate.'' He has in fact received plenty of logistical support
from state governors, leaders of PRI-controlled unions, farm
organizations and neighborhood groups. But that backing also
reflects two decades of patient spadework by Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been building this candidacy for 20 years, forging
alliances,'' said Jorge Montano, a former ambassador to the United
States who has known Labastida for many years. ``His detractors
don't understand him, because he's tough to decipher. He's not a
political elephant; he's a political cat. He has a great sense of
smell. He operates in silence. He calculates his movements
carefully. He's cautious, but he can be audacious.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida appears most eager to show audacity in law
enforcement. When he became Sinaloa's governor in 1987, the steamy
coastal state was a big drug producer. He fired hundreds of corrupt
police officers. In reprisal, gunmen assassinated several of his
aides, including a former state attorney general.  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Even his opponents acknowledge that his record contrasts with
other PRI governors, who have grown wealthy by turning a blind eye
to the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Labastida, traffickers did not have the governor's
collaboration,'' said Humberto Rice, who dealt with Governor
Labastida as the opposition mayor of Mazatlan in Sinaloa.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida likes to recall a 1990 investigation he led as
governor into the slaughter of an entire family that chanced upon
corrupt police officers unloading cocaine from an aircraft along a
Sinaloa highway. Dishonest federal prosecutors initially sought to
cover up the killings, he said. But as a result of his pressure, he
said, six federal police were tried for murder and given long
prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   What would he do as president to attack the problem? a reporter
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say there will be war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida would probably prove more assertive in behalf of
national interests on other issues of importance to both Mexico and
the United States. Unlike Zedillo, who attended Yale and speaks
English fluently, Labastida studied economics at Mexico's National
University, has never lived north of the border and speaks limited
English. He is a vigorous nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about relations with the United States, Labastida recalled
the 1847 invasion of Mexico engineered by President James K. Polk,
which brought 50,000 Mexican deaths and the loss of Mexican
territories stretching from Texas to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans still mourn the dead from that war, but that
shouldn't poison our future,'' he said. ``We need a relationship
that benefits both nations.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to widen the North American Free Trade Agreement. As
Mexico's ambassador to Portugal in 1993, he studied the half
century of negotiations that have eroded borders in Europe. ``With
Nafta, we've only touched on trade and investment flows,'' he said.
``I'd push to broaden the treaty into new areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration is one. ``We need an agreement for temporary
workers, something like we have with Canada,'' he said, referring
to an accord that allowed 7,000 Mexican agricultural workers to
work there legally this year.
</P>
<P>
   His vow to seek a better deal for migrant workers fits
Labastida's campaign slogan, ``Make Power Serve People.'' As part
of this thrust, his image makers are distributing a comic-book
biography of him entitled, ``An Exemplary Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never expose yourself to the shame of taking a single peso
dishonestly,'' his father, a country doctor, lectures young
Francisco on a page portraying his boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents have not challenged this version of events,
although there was skepticism over his recent assertion that his
personal wealth, including the value of a weekend home in Morelos
state, totals just $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know nobody believes it,'' Labastida said. ``But my
objective in life hasn't been to amass a fortune.'' He said he
relinquished most of his assets in a 1986 divorce, and a top aide
added that he is supporting a daughter born out of wedlock. His
second wife is Maria Teresa Uriarte, a distinguished Mexican
historian.
</P>
<P>
   In this campaign, in which the PRI is trying to cast off its
reputation for back-room deals and vote fraud, his campaign offers
a revisionist version of his 1986 election for governor by
portraying him as a pioneer for democracy because he ``proposed
using transparent ballot boxes'' to ensure honesty.
</P>
<P>
   But participants recalled the balloting as blatantly unfair. The
PRI authorities used vast government resources on Labastida's
behalf, and thousands of ballots marked for the main opposition
candidate, Manuel Clouthier del Rincon, a vegetable grower, were
later found in the trash. Labastida won with 69 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clouthier cried fraud, and demonstrators delivered a coffin
labeled ``the Death of Democracy'' to Labastida's Sinaloa home.
After Labastida took office, peasants controlled by the PRI
occupied Clouthier's lands, a time-honored PRI tactic against its
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Clouthier Carrillo, the candidate's son, who publishes
Sinaloa's opposition newspaper, offered a description that
contrasts with the charming image Labastida projects to others:
``He's a man who bears a grudge.''
</P>
<P>
   But many PRI leaders have also benefited from vote fraud. When
Zedillo took office in 1994, he appeared embarrassed by the party's
authoritarian legacy, and he infuriated many party members with his
vow to put ``healthy distance'' between the presidency and his
party.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has vowed to re-establish a ``healthy proximity'' with
the PRI. That sounds good to the leaders of the old guard, who are
often called dinosaurs because of their resistance to democratic
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This dinosaur, as they call him, has a young heart and can be
renewed and can change,'' Labastida said.
</P>

BAFFERT HAS NOTHING BUT ACES   FOR BREEDERS' CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ For a man who paid $700 million for a
professional football team that will not take the field until 2002,
it was probably no big deal to shell out $875,000 for a 2-year-old
filly who had never run a race. But Bob Baffert, the trainer who
scouted the filly and recommended that Robert McNair of Houston buy
her, it was an investment made in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert perched on a stool outside Barn 8 at Gulfstream Park
Sunday morning, a few feet from where he had stabled perhaps the
world's most valuable string of race horses. They include the filly
Chilukki, the undefeated superstar among the eight horses he will
enter in six of the Breeders' Cup races Saturday, with total purses
of $13 million. He thought appreciatively of McNair, and said, ``I
told him today that if Chilukki wins, she'll buy you a punter.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, and added: ``He's a really nice man. You'd never
think he's that wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you saw Baffert perched on top of the racing world as
Breeders' Cup week dawned, you would think that somebody had done
something right in this corner of the business. If so, it's
probably Baffert himself, the man who won the Kentucky Derby two
years in a row but missed winning the Triple Crown both times; the
man who has won $15 million in purses this year, approaching the
record total of $17.8 million set by D. Wayne Lukas in 1988. Yes,
the man who persuaded McNair to pay $875,000 at auction for
Chilukki.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a lot of money at the time,'' Baffert said.
``But you're always gambling. We spent $5 million last year; $3
million, the year before. But I wanted Chilukki. I had turned her
down for $100,000 when she was a yearling, and was very anxious to
buy her back this year.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he bought her back for his newest client, the master of
Stonerside Stable, who recently sold his four cogeneration energy
plants in New York and New Jersey for $1.5 billion. McNair and his
wife, Janice, also bought the former Greentree estate adjoining the
Saratoga backstretch. Then he bought the Houston franchise in the
National Football League for his hometown for $700 million plus
$310 million for a stadium, although right now he doesn't even own
a football.
</P>
<P>
   But he does own Chilukki, who reeled off six victories in her
first six races. She will be the favorite in the $1 million
Juvenile Fillies race and quite possibly the queen of the 128
horses from Europe and America who will run on racing's most lavish
day.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 16th Breeders' Cup and the third staged at
Gulfstream Park, and it makes south Florida the destination of the
stars of the sport:
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, trained by James Bond, the leading candidate for Horse
of the Year and the likely favorite in the $4 million Classic;
Lemon Drop Kid, trained by Scotty Schulhofer, winner of the Belmont
Stakes and the Travers and the leading 3-year-old in racing; High
Yield, the 2-year-old star of the Lukas barn who won the Hopeful at
Saratoga; Ecton Park, trained by Elliott Walden, who won the Jim
Dandy and the Super Derby, and Beautiful Pleasure, Mossflower,
Keeper Hill and Banshee Breeze, who help make the Distaff one of
the day's most competitive events. Plus 24 of Europe's finest
thoroughbreds, chancing the Florida heat as they did, without
success, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Baffert, the man with the most.
</P>
<P>
   In the Distaff, he will saddle the probable favorite,
Silverbulletday; in the Juvenile Fillies, the probable favorite,
Chilukki; in the Sprint, one of the favorites, Forestry; in the
Mile, the French-bred filly Tuzla, who has won 8 of her last 11
starts (and is also owned by McNair); in the Juvenile, the favorite
Forest Camp and the long shot Captain Steve. And in the Classic, a
pair of aces, General Challenge and River Keen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a bunch of terrific horses,'' Baffert said. ``In the
Classic, you know General Challenge and River Keen are going to be
right there. In the Distaff, so will Silverbulletday. But it takes
a horse's career best effort to win in the Breeders' Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilukki is a bay filly daughter of Cherokee Run and the
Damascus mare Song of Syria. She won her debut at Churchill Downs
by nine lengths, won her second race by nearly five, her third by
five and her fourth by six at Del Mar. In her last two starts, she
won by one length at Del Mar and by a length and a quarter at Santa
Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's kind, and a quick learner,'' Baffert said. ``A
sweetheart. When did I think she might be special? When we bought
her.''
</P>
<P>
   He even forgave her so-so victories in the last two races.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just been cruising in her last two,'' he said. ``Why? I
don't know. She might have been bored.''
</P>
<P>
   He reflected on his wealth of opportunities, and on the number
and nature of the challenges he must overcome in the Breeders' Cup,
and said softly, ``She won't be bored Saturday.'' &QL;

ADVERTISING: MERGER CREATES LOWE LINTAS &AMP; PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the second time in less than two months, a big
merger reshaping Madison Avenue is a result of an internal
realignment rather than an acquisition or takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Interpublic Group of Cos. in New York is combining two of its
four global agency networks: Ammirati Puris Lintas and the Lowe &AMP;
Partners Worldwide unit of Lowe Group. The merged Lowe Lintas &AMP;
Partners Worldwide will have offices in 80 countries and billings
of more than $11 billion, ranking it fourth among all agency
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of Lowe Lintas include Lowe clients like Coca-Cola, for
the Sprite soft drink brand; Heineken beer, and Marriott
International, for the Courtyard by Marriott lodging chain.
Accounts coming from Ammirati Puris include the Ameritech unit of
SBC Communications; Lego Systems, and United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the ``Ammirati Puris'' part of the Ammirati Puris Lintas
name disappearing from the moniker of the merged agency, almost all
top managers of Lintas Lowe, including those for American
operations, are coming from Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Frank Lowe, chairman and chief executive at Lowe &AMP;
Partners, will be chairman and chief executive at Lowe Lintas as
Martin Puris, chairman, chief executive and chief creative officer
at Ammirati Puris, resigns.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for the merger echoes the explanation given
by True North Communications in September when that giant agency
company shifted about half the business handled by Bozell Worldwide
_ including all accounts handled outside the United States _ to FCB
Worldwide. The goal, True North management said, was to take
advantage of the economies of scale by bolstering the larger agency
network, FCB, to better handle assignments from multinational
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask ourselves how do we resource these agencies with enough
volume to support better responsiveness to clients on a worldwide
basis,'' Philip Geier Jr., chairman and chief executive at
Interpublic, said Friday, the day the merger was announced after
weeks of speculation in trade publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination as we go forward provides for better growth,
creating a top-five agency that can compete much better,'' he
added. ``This is a good move for the clients, the employees and the
shareholders long term.'' On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of
Interpublic _ the world's largest agency company in billings, at
$37.7 billion, and No. 2 in revenue, at $4.3 billion _ closed
Friday at $40.625, up $1.125.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe has 3,500 employees in offices in 41 countries with
estimated billings of $4 billion and Ammirati Puris has 9,800
employees in offices in 78 countries with estimated billings of
almost $7.7 billion. The merger comes five years after a similar
merger when Interpublic acquired Ammirati &AMP; Puris, a midsize New
York agency with a reputation for creativity, and merged it with
Lintas Worldwide, known for its network of overseas offices.
</P>
<P>
   This time, ``APL is very strong around the world, strategically
and so forth,'' Geier said, ``and Lowe is very creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Clashes generated by the distinctly different cultures of
Ammirati &AMP; Puris and Lintas, made worse by account losses and
turmoil in the executive suite, kept that first merger from
achieving its full potential.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Geier is more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank has a great ability to lead an operation,'' he said of
Lowe, ``and creative people in particular like to work with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And with Sennott coming over, you've got the creative and the
realism working together,'' Geier said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to Michael Sennott, 58, who joins Lowe Lintas
as deputy chairman, the No. 2 post under Lowe, from vice chairman
of an Interpublic sibling, McCann-Erickson World Group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am delighted to have assembled a team of such talent,'' said
Lowe, 58, referring to the board of Lowe Lintas. Lowe joined
Interpublic in 1990 when he sold Lowe Group, the parent of the
London agency, Lowe Howard-Spink, he founded in 1981. In addition
to his duties at Lowe Lintas, Lowe will continue as chairman and
chief executive at Lowe Group and at Octagon, the Interpublic
sports marketing division.
</P>
<P>
   Other board members of Lowe Lintas include: Jerry Judge, 49,
president, from president at Lowe &AMP; Partners; Adrian Holmes, 46,
chief creative officer, from the same post at Lowe &AMP; Partners, and
Lee Garfinkel, 44. Garfinkel, chairman and chief creative officer
of the U.S. operations of Lowe &AMP; Partners, is to take on similar
responsibilities for the domestic operations of Lowe Lintas; he
will be assisted by Gary Goldsmith, 42, who has been vice chairman
under Garfinkel.
</P>
<P>
   As for Puris, he agreed to serve as a consultant to Lowe Lintas
through the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil discussed the concept of the merger with me about a year
ago,'' Puris, 60, said Friday. ``I said, `It sounds interesting,
but if you're thinking of me, don't. One merger is enough in a
lifetime.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of the grunt work,'' he added, ``replacing a lot
of people who needed to be replaced, into the hundreds, and putting
in some very good people around the world and in the New York
office, which is now on its way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now trying to figure out a way to get into the Internet
business,'' Puris said. ``The Internet feels like 1965, when I got
into the advertising business.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger leaves Interpublic with three worldwide agency
networks. The others are Draft Worldwide, specializing in direct
marketing, and McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of
McCann-Erickson World Group.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of some accounts in the merger is unknown as executives
of both agencies try to resolve conflicts. For instance, Ammirati
Puris works for the Burger King unit of Diageo, Dell Computer,
General Motors and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, while Lowe works for the
Denny's unit of Advantica Restaurant Group, Sun Microsystems,
Toyota and American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   And Unilever, a founding client of an Ammirati Puris
predecessor, Lintas Worldwide, conflicts with a Lowe client,
Henkel, the German soap and detergent maker.
</P>
<P>
   One way the conflicts might be resolved is to move accounts from
Lowe Lintas to Interpublic siblings like McCann-Erickson. And if
Interpublic acquires MacManus Group in New York, as trade
publications have speculated, some accounts could be shifted to
MacManus agencies like N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners, D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP;
Bowles and Kaplan Thaler Group. (MacManus executives have insisted
there is no deal to sell to Interpublic.)
</P>
<P>
   The most intractable conflicts seem to be those between Unilever
and Henkel and General Motors and Toyota. The likely outcome will
be to retain the larger clients in both cases, Unilever and GM.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, as if unwilling to be left out of the
realignment mania, McCann-Erickson announced that it would
reorganize its media operations around the world under the name
Universal McCann, which has been used in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Universal McCann will have more than 2,400 employees in 127
countries, providing media planning and buying on accounts with
billings estimated at $13.2 billion. Ira Carlin, 51, will be
chairman; he had been executive vice president and worldwide media
director at McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Other top managers of Universal McCann will include Murray
Dudgeon, 44, worldwide operations director; Mark Stewart, 40,
regional director for North America, and Bill Cella, 48, director
for broadcast and programming.

   AIRCRASH-RDP _ An EgyptAir plane with 214 people on board
crashed at sea off the island of Nantucket early Sunday on a flight
from New York to Egypt; bodies and wreckage were found in the
water. EgyptAir Flight 990, a Boeing 767, plummeted from radar
screens while heading to Cairo on a flight that originated in Los
Angeles. The search was focused in a 36-square-mile area about 60
miles south of Nantucket, Coast Guard officials said at midday.

   WASHINGTON _ A House committee whose Republican chairman has
accused the Justice Department of ignoring questions of illegality
in connection with the Democratic Party's fund-raising efforts is
expected to release on Tuesday the FBI's notes of its interrogation
of John Huang, a major figure in the 1996 campaign finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who is chairman of the House Government
Reform Committee, has said that the Huang interview notes raise
serious questions about the failure of the Justice Department to
investigate allegations of wrongdoing. But Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., who is the committee's ranking Democrat, said on Friday
that the interview notes showed nothing of the sort.
</P>
<P>
   Huang, who has been granted immunity by the committee and might
be able to shed light on the notes, is not scheduled to testify for
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said that the notes of the FBI interviews showed that
when Huang was an official in the Department of Commerce in 1995 he
was told by Harold Ickes, a senior adviser to President Clinton, to
raise funds for Jesse Jackson Jr., who was running for Congress.
Burton said that such activity appeared to be a violation of the
Hatch Act, the federal law that prohibits supervisors in the
government from pressing subordinates into political activity.
Ickes did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Burton also said the interview notes showed that James Riady, an
Indonesian businessman who once employed Huang, told Clinton, then
the governor of Arkansas, during an August 1992 limousine ride that
he would raise $1 million for his presidential campaign. Huang was
eventually convicted of funneling illegal donations from foreign
nationals into Democratic campaign funds. Burton said that the
interview notes should be investigated to see if Riady was part of
such an illegal scheme.
</P>
<P>
   But Waxman said that the interview notes did not show much. Most
important, he said, they do not support the major allegations of a
vast espionage scheme conducted on behalf of the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman Burton and others have over the past couple of
years charged that John Huang was the epicenter of a plot by the
Chinese to influence the presidential election,'' Waxman said.
``There simply is no evidence of that.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the reported request from Ickes to Huang, Waxman said that
raised questions about possible violations of election laws. ``But
that's a far cry from a major Chinese espionage plot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman said he agreed to grant immunity to Huang ``almost for
the wrong reasons.'' He said that Huang would not be an explosive
witness but to deny him immunity and prevent his testimony might
lead to suspicions that congressional Democrats were trying to hide
something.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Waxman insisted that Burton's staff not be allowed
to interview Huang before his public appearance. He said he did so
to prevent leaks from the committee and harassment of witnesses.

   Motorola Chip to Support Many Cell-Phone Standards
</P>
<P>
   With an eye toward the convergence of the Internet and
next-generation digital cellular networks, Motorola plans to
introduce a chip design Monday that is meant to support a wide
range of cellular telephone standards while offering more
computer-like features.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip family is part of Motorola's effort to move its
chip production beyond supplying the company's own cell-phone
business and toward competing directly with chip makers like Texas
Instruments, Royal Philips Electronics and Qualcomm.

   Allianz to Buy 70 PERCENT Stake in Pimco
</P>
<P>
   Allianz, the European insurer, agreed to buy 70 percent of Pimco
Advisors Holdings for $3.3 billion, making it one of the world's 10
biggest money managers and giving it a platform for further
expansion.

   Speculation Astir at Conde Nast
</P>
<P>
   If the gleaming new Conde Nast building in Times Square were a
giant cocktail shaker and rumors and speculation were the
ingredients, S.I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Conde Nast and its
parent, Advance Publications, would be mixing one mean martini. The
concoction is being made up of three parts: the imminent arrival
under the Advance corporate umbrella of the Fairchild Publications
magazine empire; Newhouse's dismissal of a key ally of Conde Nast's
chief executive, Steven Florio; and the strange case of a rising
star, Vogue's publisher, Richard Beckman, who remains in his job
after injuring a female advertising executive. All of which leads
to the question of how Newhouse will arrange his empire and who
will eventually run it.

<P>
   The first part of the verdict in Microsoft's antitrust trial is

   Question of `Wall' Raised at Paper
</P>
<P>
   The protest raised by staff members at The Los Angeles Times
over the newspaper's decision to share the profits of an issue of
its Sunday magazine with its sole subject raised the question of
whether a figurative wall between the news and business sides of
the paper will go up again at The Times.

   Some Sites to Miss Holiday Rush
</P>
<P>
   While some retailers are working around the clock to open their
Web sites in time for the second meaningful Internet shopping
season, several others will miss out. Some established companies,
wary of sullying their brands with a weak Web site, are proceeding
cautiously. Start-ups, on the other hand, often underestimate the
difficulty of building a good site and miscalculate how long it
will take.

IRAQI OPPOSITION GROUPS MEET IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan.)  (lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even in exile, Iraq's fractious opposition groups
have spent more time divided against one another than uniting
against their common enemy, Saddam Hussein. But with the United
States acting as midwife, more than 300 of their representatives
converged on New York City over the weekend to try to forge a
credible alternative to the present dictatorship in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what they're against,'' a senior State Department
official said. ``The question is what are they for? They have not
been as clear on this message as they need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference took place at the Sheraton New York hotel under
the umbrella of the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition of
political organizations opposed to Saddam. Some came from inside
Iraq but many more from exile. The coalition is recovering from a
setback inflicted by Saddam's Republican Guards who defeated its
forces in northern Iraq in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was financed with the last of $3 million that
Congress gave for a series of meetings among Iraqi dissidents this
year. The first session took place in Britain last April. The funds
came from $8 million allocated to support the Iraqi opposition in
the current budget.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress authorized another $97 million in government
goods and services to be drawn upon by Iraqi opponents of Saddam.
This week, four Iraqi rebels, two of them Kurds, are attending a
10-day course in military-civilian relations at an Air Force base
near Pensacola, Fla. The administration has also offered Iraqi
opposition groups $2 million worth of surplus office supplies. U.S.
officials do not rule out providing actual weapons later.
</P>
<P>
   An American presence was conspicuous at the conference, though
the Iraqis conducted their animated debates in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   The conference opened Friday evening with an address by David
Scheffer, the administration's ambassador at large for war crimes
issues, who explained his plan for having Saddam indicted for
crimes against humanity. It ends Monday with an address by Thomas
Pickering, the undersecretary of state for political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule was sprinkled with pep talks from members of
Congress, who coupled pledges of support with pleas for the rival
groups to start working with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., who is chairman of the House
Committee on International Relations, said in a speech on Sunday,
``We in Congress have given our president and his administration
all the tools they need to help you press forward with your
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in order for us to persuade our administration to do more,
you in turn have to do more,'' he added. ``First of all, this
meeting must be a success in bringing all the conference groups
together.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., told the Iraqis: ``You
will need the support and assistance of the United States and of
countries in the region. But most of all, you will need to become a
potent, unified force.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Sayyid Qadhim al Battat, a guerrilla leader who
slipped out of southern Iraq on Oct. 10 to attend the conference,
urged his fellow Iraqis to put aside their differences. Resplendent
in a brown robe and white Arab headdress, Battat said that his
troops were fighting ``continuously'' against Saddam and deserved
to hear that the Iraqi opposition groups meeting in New York had
solidified their own ranks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview later, Battat spoke obliquely of
``discrepancies'' among the groups at the conference. ``Some are
extending big efforts'' to attain the objective of unity, Battat
said in Arabic. ``And there are some who have taken stands that may
lead to preventing success, for various rationalizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department official said that Saddam's subordinates
telephoned some opposition members in exile and warned them against
going to the New York conference. Ayad Allawy, the head of the
Iraqi National Accord, a group that did attend, said that Saddam
routinely accuses opponents of being puppets of the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't consider ourselves puppets of anybody,'' Allawy said.
``We want to get rid of the dictatorship.''

WITHOUT STARS, FIRST RACE OF SEASON SEEMS SO HO-HUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIGNES, France _ The World Cup skiing season had an early start
over the weekend on a glacier in the French Alps. It kicked off a
season that will lack major competitions and some of the sport's
biggest names.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in nearly 10 years, there is not a major ski
event scheduled. The last time a world championship or an Olympics
were not scheduled was in 1990, although in 1995 bad weather forced
the world championships in Spain into the following year.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some stars missing. Katja Seizinger of Germany
and Deborah Compagnoni of Italy, with 10 world and Olympic titles
between them, retired. Alberto Tomba is long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Picabo Street of the United States is out indefinitely, still
recovering from leg injuries she sustained more than 18 months ago
after winning the gold medal in the super-G in the Nagano Olympics
in 1998. She is still waiting to be cleared to get back on skis,
and it is not clear whether she will be able to compete this
season, according to United States team officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's overall winners were missing from the results of the
opening races over the weekend. Norway's Lasse Kjus and Austria's
Alexandra Meissnitzer started the defense of their crowns by skiing
off the course barely 30 seconds into their first runs.
</P>
<P>
   Kjus and Meissnitzer each won two events at the world
championships last season in Vail, Colo., with Kjus winning five
medals in five events. Neither was bothered by the ski-outs, aiming
for the North American races, which will take place Nov. 18-21 on
the slopes of the 2002 Olympic Games in Park City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Wind and poor visibility hampered the women's race Saturday but
the men's race Sunday was in bright conditions at more than 3,400
meters (11,150 feet) after early rain and fog.
</P>
<P>
   Hermann (the Herminator) Maier won the giant slalom. He began
this season maintaining the form of the 1997-98 season when he won
10 races, the overall title and two Olympic gold medals. It was the
19th World Cup victory for the 26-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Maier has a habit of doing well in October. He won last year in
Soelden, Austria, and burst on the scene with two third-place
finishes two years ago in Tignes, foreshadowing his Olympic
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first race is always important,'' Maier said. ``Especially
to see how the other skiers are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Michael Von Gruenigen of Switzerland followed Maier by
.75 of a second, even after losing his right ski pole midway
through the second run, and Austrians took five of the top 10
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Kjetil-Andre Aamodt of Norway and Stefan Eberharter of Austria
tied for third.
</P>
<P>
   Eberharter agreed that the competition for spots on the Austrian
team is intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be prepared early in order to qualify for the
season events,'' Eberharter said.
</P>
<P>
   Competition may be lacking from the other countries. Austrian
skiers won more than half of the World Cup races last year and
nearly half of the medals at the world championships in Vail last
February. The Austrian women were awesome, winning 20 of 35 races
and 9 of 15 world championship medals, including two sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Meissnitzer had trouble, Austrians still placed four in
the top 10 of the women's race on Saturday, led by Anita Wachter,
the 32-year-old veteran, who finished in the top three for the 71st
time in her career.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's Sonja Nef, who has had six knee operations in the
past 10 years, took the women's opener and credited her success to
the help of a sports psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably the only top skier who wasn't seeing a sports
psychologist,'' Nef said. ``But for the past two years I was stuck
between second and fifth place in all my races. I figured I needed
to find a way to break out of my rut.''
</P>
<P>
   Nef's nerves have been a problem. More than once she has been
leading after the first run _ including at the world championships
in 1996 _ but her only victory before Sunday was a slalom race in
1996 at Sestrieres, Italy. But Nef would then be bothered by
criticism, and worry about how she would do after leading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've since learned to build a wall between myself and the
outside world,'' she said. &QL;

COLLEGE FRESHMAN LIFTS HIS SPORT INTO THE ERA OF THE QUAD

   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ Can five revolutions be far behind?
Not with Timothy Goebel, the first man to land three quadruple
jumps in official competition, on the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Skate America, this season's inaugural event on the competitive
calendar of the world's elite figure skaters, turned into a
contemplation on and a celebration of the quadruple jump over the
weekend at the World Arena. Somehow Michelle Kwan, skating with
such seductive elegance that she received a perfect 6.0 from one
judge despite a fall on her long program's triple flip, managed to
win the women's competition without levitating for four rotations.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, 19, a three-time U.S. champion and two-time world
champion, used a glide to the soundtrack of ``The Red Violin'' on
Saturday night to become Skate America's first four-time ladies'
champion, a quadruple coup of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   But like everybody else in attendance, Kwan, now combining her
skating with taking three courses at UCLA, was close to dumbfounded
by what happened in the men's long program. Although the
competition was won once again by Aleksei Yagudin, its defending
champion and the latest two-time world champion from the Russian
assembly line of elite skaters, it was Goebel's unprecedented and
unafraid leaping that was the talk of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Never had anyone landed three quadruple jumps in the space of a
single skate. But Goebel, who sneaked a quadruple salchow into the
performance that left him in third place after Friday's short
program, made good on his announced plan to make history in the
long program on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Tim earlier today, and I think I said something like `I
hear you're doing three quads; is that possible?''' Kwan said after
her winning skate. ``And then because I didn't want to psych him
out or anything, I told him, `You go, Tim!' When you're pushing the
envelope like that, it's pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, especially after Goebel, a Case Western Reserve freshman
from Rolling Meadows, Ill., an unprepossessing 5 feet 7 inches who
describes his training regimen as ``nothing exotic,'' commenced his
challenge to Yagudin and the United States champion Michael Weiss,
who stood in first and second place after the short program, in
inauspicious fashion.
</P>
<P>
   After an unpromising beginning, when he fell after his triple
lutz and stepped out of the landing on his triple axel, Goebel took
heart when the time came to launch his arsenal of quadruple jumps
and finished in second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I wanted to stay in the medals at this event, I had
to fix something and fix it quick,'' said Goebel, who is coached by
Carol Heiss Jenkins, the 1960 Olympic gold medalist. So Goebel,
skating to the soundtrack from ``Seven Years in Tibet,''
resuscitated his performance by pulling off a quadruple
salchow-triple toe loop combination followed by a quadruple toe
loop and another quadruple salchow. Goebel's feats not only
distinguished him as the first man to complete three quads in
official competition, but also made him the first to land two
different quads in senior-level competition.
</P>
<P>
   Though he won the event, Yagudin admitted that Goebel had
probably altered his, and everybody's, future programs. ``A couple
of years ago we were thinking about one quad,'' Yagudin said, ``and
now he's done three quads; he's pushing us hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Elvis Stojko, who landed the first quadruple
combination jump in official competition two years ago and finished
in third place here on the strength of a program that featured a
quad toe loop-double toe loop combination, concurred with Yagudin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an inevitable evolution,'' Stojko said. ``It's amazing to
see, and that's what sports is all about, to push forward.''

TRADITIONAL `WALL' MAY GO UP AGAIN AT L.A. TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS ``this week'' to ``last week'' in 2nd graf) (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Mondays, Kathryn Downing, the publisher of The
Los Angeles Times, spends perhaps half the day closeted with her
top management team: seven business executives, the general counsel
and the newspaper's editor, Michael Parks.
</P>
<P>
   For those on the news side of the paper, which is owned by Times
Mirror Co., the business-to-news ratio seems skewed. Last week, two
high-ranking editors, both speaking on condition of anonymity,
pointed out the disparity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is all alone there,'' said one of the editors. ``He
can say no'' to ideas that he thinks would compromise editorial
integrity. ``But how often can he be the only one saying no?''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of a newspaper finds the balance between the
interests of the news and business departments and sets the tone.
But in The Los Angeles Times newsroom in recent years, the correct
balance has often been a matter of debate. And last week, the
debate went public when hundreds of journalists at the paper
attended an angry staff meeting and heard their colleagues denounce
the decision to share the profits of an issue of the newspaper's
Sunday magazine with its sole subject, the new Staples Center
sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   The protest raised the question of whether Mark Willes' vision
of newspaper management _ a vision Ms. Downing had embraced _ will
continue to guide The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Willes, a former vice chairman at General Mills, became chief
executive of Times Mirror in 1995 and chairman in 1996, and served
a stint as publisher of The Times starting in 1997. He argued that
the wall between the news and business departments had to fall.
Cooperation and entrepreneurial creativity would be the watchwords
at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Ms. Downing, who succeeded Willes as publisher in
June, faced the upheaval over her approval of the entrepreneurial
creativity of the Staples arrangement. She issued an apology and on
Friday wrote a memorandum to the newsroom suggesting cooperation of
a different sort: cooperation in an effort to rebuild some sort of
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will develop, with editorial leadership, written policies
that clearly define editorial independence and integrity, and
interaction between the newsroom and the business side,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Downing also wrote that she would conduct ``special
awareness training for current and future business-side employees''
and ``spend more time with our journalists to gain a better
appreciation of their efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Because last week's upheaval focused on the core issue of
balancing news and business concerns while preserving editorial
integrity, its reverberations are likely to linger. For the Staples
Center arrangement was not the only issue to trouble editors in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign editor, Simon Li, was furious when the
representative of an advertising sales company, which was producing
an ad supplement about Brazil for The Times, posed as a Times
reporter to gain an audience with the president of the Brazilian
Senate. The Times' relationship with the company was severed
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   There was also concern about a daily editorial feature,
``Stories That Shaped the Century,'' which, the two high-ranking
editors said, had its genesis in the advertising department.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the distrust of Ms. Downing is her lack
of newspaper experience. Ms. Downing, 46, came to the business
after a career in legal publishing, beginning with a stint at Mead
Data Central, which at the time published the Lexis-Nexis database.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Lewis and Clark College and Stanford University
Law School, Ms. Downing is described by current and former
colleagues as smart and focused on Willes' goal of increasing
circulation. He called for a 50 percent increase. Ms. Downing, when
she was president of The Times and again when she became publisher,
was even more ambitious, calling for a 100 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kathryn is a determined and creative executive,'' said Richard
Harrington, the chief executive of Thomson Corp., which publishes
newspapers and specialized information services, particularly in
legal publishing. ``She started in electronic publishing, and that
is a very entrepreneurial business.''
</P>
<P>
   She spent five years at Thomson subsidiaries, three as president
of the electronic publishing unit and two as chief executive of the
Lawyers Professional Publishing division. Then she became president
of Matthew Bender, the troubled Times Mirror legal publishing unit.
After some executive shake-ups and reorganizations, the unit was
eventually sold. In March 1998, she became president of The Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, her tenure has been a time of turnaround. After a
year of lagging results, The Times' performance improved, according
to Times Mirror's statements to Wall Street. The company does not
break out the financial information for individual units, but it
said that in the second quarter it posted its first year-over-year
increase in quarterly profits after five quarters of decline.
</P>
<P>
   During these quarters, top business executives, like John
McKeon, the newspaper's senior vice president for marketing, were
pushing to find new revenue sources and new ways to compete for ads
with magazines, radio, TV and the Internet. The original engine for
this activity had been a network of general managers, one for each
section, who were supposed to collaborate on new projects. Though
that system has atrophied somewhat, business executives continue to
come to the news side with possible projects, the two high-ranking
editors said.
</P>
<P>
   The Staples deal was originally regarded internally as a coup.
In late 1998, Times executives signed a contract that made the
paper one of the center's 10 ``founding partners'' _ a kind of
corporate sponsorship. The paper agreed to give the center the
roughly $3 million in annual compensation it sought from each of
those sponsors, in return for a skybox, a luxury suite, exclusive
advertising rights within the center and other concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Times structured its payment in three parts, offering the
center cash, free or discounted advertising space and
profit-sharing from joint ventures. A few months ago, Ms. Downing
decided to use the Sunday magazine to fulfill the profit-sharing
commitment. In Friday's memorandum, she wrote, ``We will fulfill
the financial portion of our Staples Center agreement by check.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Downing, Parks and McKeon declined to be interviewed about
the issue on Friday, and four other senior vice presidents did not
return telephone calls. Willes left town Thursday afternoon.

<P>
   The whirlwind of fury and anguish, particularly from reporters
and editors who worked on the section and felt betrayed, is likely
to keep business executives at the paper more conservative, some
Times editors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the walls going back up?'' asked John Arthur, the managing
editor responsible for regional editions. ``Who knows? There was
certainly a call for that in the staff meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's my experience that newspapers work best when
there is a healthy divide between editorial and advertising.''

IN THE CHAOS OF COLOMBIA, THE MAKINGS OF A MASS KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw)

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Now that Luis Alfredo Garavito is finally in
custody, Colombian police and news reports are describing him as a
cunning serial killer, a glib predator and a ``solitary sadist.''
But it is also clear that, whatever his personality traits,
Colombia's deepening social disintegration provided him with the
perfect environment in which to operate.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Garavito, a 42-year-old drifter, confessed to the
slayings of at least 140 boys between ages 8 to 16 during a
five-year killing spree that ended only because he was recently
jailed on an unrelated rape charge. Police say that Garavito would
befriend the children and take them on long walks until they were
tired. Then he would tie them up with nylon rope, slit their
throats or behead them and then bury their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Many, if not most, of Garavito's victims appear to have been
street children, from poor families or separated from their parents
by poverty or the political violence that has displaced 1.5 million
Colombians in little more than a decade. Such children _ grimy,
hungry, morose and poorly dressed _ have become a familiar sight on
the corners of Colombia's large cities and towns, where they beg,
sell newspapers or chewing gum, or shine shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids disappear all the time in Colombia, especially those from
the poorer strata,'' said Timothy Ross, a former journalist who now
works with juvenile prostitutes and youthful drug users on behalf
of a private social services agency here. ``They tend to come from
unstable homes anyway, but the deep social instability produced by
military, political and economic displacement has fragmented
families even further.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said it was because there was no one to notice that
the children were missing or to inquire about their whereabouts
that Garavito was able to go on killing for so long without being
detected. But his arrest has brought an avalanche of criticism from
poor people, who say that they find police officials indifferent,
abusive or corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were poor kids that nobody cares about, and that is why
this went on for so long before they did anything about it,'' Norma
Garzon Duque, a street vendor here, said Sunday. ``If it had been
rich kids disappearing like that, the cops would have been on top
of the case from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, Garavito seized on the social convulsions
Colombia is experiencing as a result of three decades of armed
conflict and turned them to his own advantage. He often passed
himself off as a priest, social worker, teacher or representative
of charitable foundations. At other times, he posed as a
handicapped or displaced person himself to gain sympathy. He kept a
list of his victims, but not by name, and some of the remains are
so badly decomposed that it will be difficult if not impossible to
identify them.
</P>
<P>
   The Guinness Book of World Records lists another Colombian,
Pedro Armando Lopez, known here as the ``Monster of the Andes,'' as
the largest-scale serial killer of modern times. He is believed to
have killed more than 300 girls and young women in Colombia,
Ecuador and Peru before being captured in Ecuador and convicted of
57 counts of murder there in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez served 16 years in an Ecuadorean prison, but because that
country does not have a law that permits consecutive sentences, he
was released and deported back to Colombia. His present whereabouts
are not known, but it is presumed he is living under an assumed
identity.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Garavito's arrest has generated disgust,
indignation and fear throughout this South American nation of 40
million people. Colombia does not have the death penalty for
murder, but the enormity of the crimes of which Garavito is accused
has led Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, chief of the national police, and
many others to call for an exception.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Garavito's confession, numerous other cases of child
abductions and killings remain unsolved across Colombia. That led
to warnings Sunday that parents should not allow their children to
go out unaccompanied on trick-or-treat excursions for Halloween, an
imported holiday that has become popular here in recent years,
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors say Garavito has admitted killing
children in 54 cities across Colombia as well as in Ecuador. The
largest single concentration of killings appears to have occurred
in his native region, in and around Pereira, a coffee-growing area
in the west-central part of the country that was severely damaged
by an earthquake in January.
</P>
<P>
   The first major break came there last November, when skeletal
remains of 27 children were found in a ravine. Police initially
attributed those deaths to satanic cult rituals. But further
investigation yielded physical evidence that eventually led to
Garavito, who has been held under a different name in a jail in
Villavicencio, south of here, since April.
</P>
<P>
   Videotape of Garavito's interrogation broadcast on Colombian
television Sunday showed a small dark-haired man with a mustache
gesticulating and smiling as he talked. ``Yes, I killed them, and I
ask forgiveness for all that I have done,'' he is reported to have
told police investigators, who coaxed a confession from him during
a marathon grilling that began Thursday and ended early Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Garavito was born in 1957 in the town of Genova. According to
the account Garavito has given government investigators, he was
often beaten as a child by his father and was also sexually abused
by two older neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, Garavito drifted from job to job, drinking heavily
and behaving aggressively until he wore out his welcome and moved
on to the next town. He attempted suicide at least once, police
officials said, and also was under psychiatric care at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not facing some sort of criminal genius,'' Pablo Elias
Gonzalez, director of the state prosecutor's investigative team,
said here Saturday. ``We are confronting an individual who had no
inhibiting restraints to killing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a memorial to Garavito's victims, scenes of children at play
have recently been painted onto a hillside at the site where the
first remains were found. At the bottom of the ravine, there is now
a sign that reads, ``If we continue with indifference and
abandonment, we will never know what happened to the children of
Pereira.''

   BOEING-CRASH (Seattle) _ In a strange twist of fate, the
EgyptAir 767 that crashed Sunday rolled down the assembly line at
Boeing's Everett, Wash., plant immediately ahead of a Lauda Air 767
that crashed eight years ago when an engine braking device deployed
in flight. Some 770 of the widebody jets, which dominate North
Atlantic air routes, have been built since the 767 entered service
in the early 1980s. Other than a hijacked Ethiopian Airlines 767
that ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean in 1996, the only

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Robert C. Smith, newly returned from the
campaign trail, sat in his spacious office the other day and
reflected on the importance of not being a thin-skinned grudge
holder.
</P>
<P>
   He had just folded an independent presidential campaign that
produced hardly a ripple, and even a newspaper in his home state,
New Hampshire, had asked in an editorial, ``Where did this
down-home guy get this goofy idea?''
</P>
<P>
   The senator laughed. No, he said, he would not respond in kind.
He remembered the advice an old politician gave him years ago:
``There's no point getting into an argument with someone who has an
unlimited supply of ink and paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning serious, he said, ``You can't succeed if you're afraid
to fail.'' All right, he went on, he's not going to be president.
But he got to talk about his deeply conservative principles, and he
met a lot of wonderful people.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Smith must be hoping, as he prepares for the next
phase of his public life, that some other politicians don't hold
grudges either.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced in July that he would run for president as an
independent, he excoriated the Republican Party in an hourlong
speech on the Senate floor, saying that it was too willing to
compromise, that pollsters had become more important than
principles, that the party was frittering away the victory it won
through the Reagan revolution. His denunciation infuriated party
stalwarts, not least Jim Nicholson, the Republican National
Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Now his campaign is out of money, and the polls he so disdains
show him registering barely a blip even in New Hampshire, site of
the first primary. Smith wants to be back in the Big Tent.
Apparently unwilling to contemplate becoming the only independent
in the Senate, he has been making overtures to party leaders.
Perhaps more important, there is the lure of a significant
committee chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said he would wait until Monday before discussing
his intentions. But he acknowledged that when he appeared at a news
conference to announce them, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
majority leader, and other top Republicans would be at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two and two makes four, doesn't it?'' Smith said, inviting a
visitor to draw his own conclusions. ``Well, with the new math, it
may not.''
</P>
<P>
   More later about the old values that Smith holds dear, and why
he does. For the moment, there are more pragmatic considerations.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island on Oct. 24 left
vacant the top seat on the powerful Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee. Smith is the next Republican in line _ that is, if
he is welcomed back to the party, and if party leaders do not count
his few months in the wilderness against his seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is known to have signaled his desire to return to the fold
well before Chafee's death, which was unexpected. But has the anger
against him cooled enough for him to be awarded the chairmanship?
</P>
<P>
   If Republican leaders hold a grudge, they may give the post to
Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who is next in seniority. (Unlike
Chafee, neither Smith nor Inhofe is considered an ally by
environmentalists, although they rate Smith a bit friendlier to
their cause.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A big (6 foot 6), affable man, the senator told another story
about grudges, or the lack thereof. A quarter-century ago, after he
had left his job as a junior high school history teacher, he went
to work with a real estate company.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy was bad, sales were slow, and Smith was fired.
Nothing personal, his boss said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and his wife, Mary Jo, had a family to feed (they now have
three grown children), so Smith borrowed some money and went into
real estate on his own. The economy picked up. Smith prospered.
After a while, his old boss's company was for sale. As it happened,
so was his old boss's house. ``I bought his business and his house,
all in the same transaction,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate turnabout was not his life's defining moment.
That came on March 28, 1945, two days before his fourth birthday,
when his father, a naval aviator, was killed. Lt. Cmdr. Donald
Smith had lived through combat in the Pacific only to die in a Navy
plane crash back home. His wife, Margaret, never remarried.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smith, who served in the Navy during the Vietnam War, has
only a hazy memory of his father. The senator's younger brother,
Richard, has none at all. On the wall of the senator's office is a
picture of his father shaking hands with Adm. Chester Nimitz.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up without a father, wishing he had one, taught him what
a gift life is, the senator said, and that is why he is among the
most dedicated foes of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   And having felt the cost of war, he said he opposes sending
Americans into harm's way unless doing so is clearly in the
national interest. (He opposed U.S. involvement in Bosnia in 1995
and Kosovo in 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of his most vivid memories are of cemeteries. His parents
are buried in Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the visit he and his wife made to an American
military cemetery in Italy a few years ago. They came upon the
grave of an American soldier who was killed on May 29, 1944, the
day the senator's wife was born.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the sacrifice and the symbolism, the senator said with
a catch in his voice: ``He died so she could live free.''

COLORADO AGAIN SEEKS WAY TO EASE TRAFFIC CONGESTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ As one of the fastest-growing states in the country,
Colorado has the traffic problems to prove it. On any given day,
almost any given hour, highways are clogged and tempers are frayed.
Arriving late has become a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado residents have a chance on Tuesday to speed things
up, or so say proponents of two ballot initiatives. One would
authorize state bond sales for improvement of highways. The other,
for voters in Denver and five adjacent counties, would expand the
light-rail system in Denver. Passage of both measures would allow
the state to borrow $2.1 billion that would be repaid with money
from the federal highway trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls suggest that both measures have about a 60 percent
chance of passing. Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican who won election
last year after promising to improve traffic conditions, has
campaigned for both measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic,'' he said in an interview,
reflecting his belief that both measures would pass. ``Historically
with these proposals, the voting has narrowed at the end. This time
we have more room to maneuver.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Western states _ including Oregon, California and
Utah _ that have forged ahead with new highways, light-rail
systems, subways and expanded bus routes, Colorado has resisted any
substantial spending to ease highway congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicle miles traveled around the country have increased by 70
percent over the last 20 years, compared with a 2 percent increase
in new highway construction, according to transportation experts.
And Colorado voters have consistently rejected measures to address
traffic problems. They defeated two initiatives in 1997 and another
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two initiatives under consideration, the highway measure
is the more expensive at $1.6 billion. It would add lanes, rebuild
interchanges and widen roads in 24 places around the state, a third
of them along Interstate 25, the north-south axis that passes
through Denver. Supporters say passage would fix problems in 10 to
12 years, rather than 20 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents have called it a temporary solution that failed to
consider other critical issues, like land use, employment centers
and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't work,'' said Greg Casini, chairman of the Rocky
Mountain Chapter of the Sierra Club, one of several environmental
groups fighting the highway measure. ``It's just throwing money
away as a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Adding a few
lanes on a few highways is not a magical way to solve
transportation needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Other opposition has focused on the cost of borrowing so much
money that the total interest could reach $600 million and on
uncertainties of the economy, which could reduce federal highway
support.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say they would be more inclined to support highway
construction as part of a larger plan that included alternative
solutions. For that reason, the light-rail extension proposed for
the Denver area has been viewed as a major step.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The current system is modest, 5.3 miles of track that runs
through downtown into a few nearby neighborhoods, doing little to
mitigate rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed 19 miles of extensions would be built along two
major highways, one of them a parallel spur to an insufferable
stretch of I-25 between the state's largest employment centers,
downtown Denver and the Denver Tech Center to the south. The
extensions are expected to carry 30,000 commuters a day, the
equivalent of three to five lanes of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said passage of both measures would save money in the long
run and would help accommodate population growth. Since 1990, only
four other states _ Nevada, Arizona, Utah and Idaho _ have had a
higher percentage of population increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have more people,'' said Owens. ``We would
only be harming ourselves if we tried to pretend that not building
roads for them is a good idea.''

STUDENTS SHAKEN BY ARRESTS IN SHOOTING PLOT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Carl Henderson and his girlfriend had been looking
forward to their first high school homecoming on Friday, but their
plans were dashed when city officials accused some of their
classmates of planning a violent act at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was going to wear a cream-colored dress, with little
sparkles and a slit in the leg,'' said Carl, a ninth-grader, as he
sat on his front porch on Saturday and thought about what might
have been. ``She looked pretty,'' he said with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   But homecoming, that high school rite of passage, was a victim
of what many fear could have been a Columbine-style shooting spree
at South High School here. Mayor Michael White announced Thursday
that ``there was an alleged plan to commit some sort of violent act
at the school'' on homecoming day, so Friday classes were canceled,
along with the homecoming football game and dance. Four students
were arrested, and police and school officials questioned seven
more.
</P>
<P>
   At a preliminary hearing Sunday, a magistrate accepted pleas of
denial from the four boys, but ordered that they continue to be
held in detention, at least until a judge is assigned to their
cases, which typically takes a few days, said Len Munks,
superintendent of the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Detention Center.
The magistrate considered what was best for the four as well as
``what is in the best interest of the public for security,'' Munks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The court has not named the boys because they are juveniles. One
is 14 and three are 15.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jedd, 15, one of the students questioned in the case and a
friend of the four boys, said the boys had laughed about the April
killings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., and had
planned to imitate that massacre at South High, ending with a
suicidal shootout. ``They were going to stand in a circle and just
open fire,'' said Sarah, who told her mother of the plan on
Wednesday. Another girl had already told school officials of the
plot by the time Sarah's mother alerted authorities.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how serious the teen-agers were. No weapons
were found with the students who were questioned. Police
confiscated two guns from the home of one of the four teen-agers
arrested but found no weapons at the school. ``They searched
floor-by-floor, room-by-room and locker-by-locker, and they didn't
find any guns, any explosives or any contraband of any sort,'' said
Lt. Edward Thiery of the Cleveland Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have said they will not take any chances with
school threats. ``There is going to be zero tolerance,'' White said
last week. South High is scheduled to reopen on Monday with metal
detectors and a heavy police presence.
</P>
<P>
   News of the alleged plot _ and the mayor's unexplained
contention that race was a factor in it _ has riveted the city,
worrying parents and students and dividing neighbor from neighbor.
Most South High students are black; all 11 students questioned are
white. White refused to elaborate on his comments this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among a cross-section of students interviewed was
that the 11 students were outcasts who were often picked on. White
students scoffed at the idea that race was a motive, while black
students believed that it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always got made fun of, but they didn't have to go out
like this and shoot people,'' said Pat Sender, 16, a white
11th-grader.
</P>
<P>
   It shocked Carl's mother, Rhonda Henderson, who is black. ``I do
want to thank the other girl for coming forward because I would be
burying my child today,'' Ms. Henderson, 36, a medical assistant,
said as she tended her garden on Saturday. Homecoming has been
rescheduled for Monday, but her son is not sure he wants to go.

</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ For the last week, Terje Roed-Larsen, a Norwegian
diplomat known for enduring patience and a passion for finding
peace in the Middle East, has juggled appointments in Gaza, Tel
Aviv and Jerusalem, testing the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, in this wintry city, he awaited the arrival of
the three big players: President Clinton, Prime Minister Ehud Barak
of Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Roed-Larsen
hopes they will take the opportunity to press forward on a
once-and-for-all Israeli-Palestinian agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If things go right in the next two days of ceremonies, meetings
and corridor conversations, the preparatory work by Roed-Larsen,
who was the main go-between in the secret 1993 Palestinian-Israeli
talks in Oslo, will have paid off. He hopes that Arafat and Barak
will leave here with fresh confidence in their
February-to-September timetable for a final accord.
</P>
<P>
   That the meeting is taking place in the city where secret
negotiations that led to the 1993 breakthrough accord were held has
created an aura of warmth. That Roed-Larsen, who is described by
many involved in the 1993 talks as the glue that held them
together, is back on the scene has also added trust.
</P>
<P>
   This time the talks are not secret and there are no safe houses,
ruses or disguises.
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen is the first to caution that this very public Oslo
gathering, endowed with all the pomp of a presidential visit and
blessed by the Norwegian royal family, is not expected to result in
a milestone conclusion. The endgame issues to be decided by
September _ the borders of the Palestinian-controlled area, the
future of Jerusalem and what will happen to Palestinian refugees _
are too monumental to get anywhere near that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said the timing was auspicious for Barak and Arafat
to meet with each other and with Clinton. After a bright start with
the election of Barak and the signing of an agreement at Sharm el
Sheik in Egypt in September, the situation has stalled, with little
contact between the two leaders or their representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has angrily denounced the expansion of Jewish settlements
in the West Bank. Barak delayed naming the leader of his
negotiating team until last week.
</P>
<P>
   And in the lobby of the Grand Hotel here Sunday night, the
Palestinian negotiator, Yasser Abed Rabbo, gave a sense of the
obstacles ahead. He yelled at Roed-Larsen in front of television
cameras about the Israeli settlements and suggested that
negotiations were futile if settlement activity went ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can be achieved is to solidify the new confidence that is
building between the parties since Barak's election,'' Roed-Larsen
said. ``Timing is the main reason all the main actors are coming
from the United States and the Middle East to Norway _ to the
backwoods of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen also hopes that the Israelis and Palestinians will
be able to agree on steps for reaching a framework agreement by
mid-February. On Friday the two sides announced that they would
hold their first formal negotiating session for the February
agreement next Sunday. Roed-Larsen hopes that they will agree to
more sessions, more benchmarks, by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Middle East it is always a complicated process of who
does what when,'' he said. ``Sometimes organizing the process is
more important than the substance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993 talks, Roed-Larsen was a diplomat with the Norwegian
Foreign Ministry. He still is, but in September he was appointed
the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace efforts. He
is also Secretary-General Kofi Annan's representative to the
Palestinian Authority and is playing his intermediary role from
Gaza, where he is now based.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 secret talks in Oslo culminated in the historic
handshake on the White House lawn by Arafat and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. In two books by Israelis, Roed-Larsen is
described as the indispensable believer who kept the often
irascible, nervous sides talking.
</P>
<P>
   David Makovsky, now the executive editor of The Jerusalem Post,
who wrote ``Making Peace with the PLO,'' (Westview
Press/HarperCollins, 1996), said Roed-Larsen and his wife, Mona
Juul, also a Norwegian diplomat, were the ``body and soul'' of the
1993 effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terje and his wife gave the talks the human empathy that are
not the stuff of big-power politics,'' said Makovsky. ``They were
almost the wailing walls.'' Roed-Larsen, a sociologist and
philosopher by training, is in a position to do the same again,
Makovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen has kept in touch with the major figures, including
the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Dennis Ross. The two
diplomats worked on details of these new talks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ross, Roed-Larsen is not a negotiator, but has acted as a
back channel and sounding board. Now the situation is much
different from that in 1993. Then, the Israelis were forbidden by
law from meeting with the Palestine Liberation Organization. There
were no phone lines between the PLO, then based in Tunis, and
Israel. For the parties to talk, they had to go to the Norwegians.
Now the two sides can talk directly ``if there is a will,''
Roed-Larsen said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the Israeli side, there is a complete change in the cast of
characters. Rabin, who in the end made the pivotal decision to go
ahead in 1993, is dead. It is the fourth anniversary of his
assassination that Clinton, Arafat and Barak will commemorate here.
Shimon Peres is in a lesser role.
</P>
<P>
   And the new prime minister, Barak, has made clear that
``interpreters,'' as he calls intermediaries, are not needed.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, Barak has emphasized that he is his own
man. If there is a secret channel this time _ and all sides say
that it is an essential ingredient _ it will be between Barak and a
Palestinian delegated by Arafat, or Arafat himself, according to
Israeli and U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, the key negotiator at Oslo in 1993,
Ahmed Qurei, also known as Abu Ala, is now speaker of the
Palestinian Council in Ramallah, but he will be with Arafat here.
</P>
<P>
   In describing how the talks toward a final agreement might
unfold, Clinton administration officials painted a picture of steps
similar to those that led up to the Oslo accord of 1993 and a later
one in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   First, in 1993, a declaration of principles was outlined _ not
unlike the framework agreement that is supposed to be finished in
February _ and then an agreement was worked out to put it into
effect.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, U.S. officials have acknowledged, the stakes are
higher and the time schedule much tighter.

A COMPLEX BUT FAMILIAR SEARCH FOR ANSWERS BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With AIRCRASH-RDP and related stories.) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moments after EgyptAir flight 990 suddenly, mysteriously dropped
from the sky at about 1:50 Sunday morning, the complex _ but by now
familiar _ search for a plane at sea, and for an explanation of why
it went down, was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted by the Federal Aviation Administration when the plane
disappeared from its radar screens, Coast Guard search planes and
helicopters lifted off in darkness from Otis Air Force Base on Cape
Cod at 2:15 a.m. By late Sunday afternoon, four Coast Guard cutters
and 11 planes were methodically criss-crossing a 36 square mile
search area 60 miles southeast of Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Go Team'' of investigators from the National Transportation
Safety Board _ the lead agency in the inquiry _ flew out of
Washington as the nucleus of an investigation that will draw on a
half-dozen federal agencies, including U.S. Navy deep-sea divers.
Two FBI agents were already aboard the Coast Guard ships
supervising the gathering of debris that could be evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning what may be a long investigation and we are
prepared to do what it takes,'' Jim Hill, chairman of the safety
board, told a news conference in outlining the initial steps.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the template for the investigation was set by the
arduous investigation, still not fully completed, into the crash of
Trans World Airlines flight 800 south of Long Island, N.Y., in July
1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the TWA 800 investigation _ which developed into contentious
clashes between the FBI and safety board investigators over whether
the plane was brought down by terrorists or a mechanical failure _
has also apparently provided lessons of what not to do. Ultimately,
it was determined that fuel vapors in the nearly empty center fuel
tank ignited in an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, from officials at the White House to the
investigators giving limited public briefings on the crash, there
was much cautioning about not leaping to conclusions that terrorism
might be involved, even though Egypt has a long history of fatal
blows struck by Islamic fundamentalists. And the FBI appeared to be
deliberately keeping a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when several high-ranking FBI officials arrived at the
safety board's news conference in Washington, Hill asked them not
to appear on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no threats, we have no one claiming responsibility,''
said FBI spokesman Jim Davis, one of a number of agents who,
publicly and privately, stressed that the FBI is routinely involved
in the initial stages of these investigations in case it later
turns into a criminal matter.
</P>
<P>
   `'We have to follow the rules of evidence, the chain of
evidence,'' said Special Agent Barry Mawn, who is supervising the
Boston-based agents as they catalog the debris. ``So we work that
right from the get-go.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, the FBI opened its Strategic
Information and Operations Center in the J. Edgar Hoover Building
in Quantico, Va., a secure command center packed with classified
computers and communications gear, an indication that the crash was
regarded as a potentially serious matter.
</P>
<P>
   A similar command center that houses the Joint Terrorism Task
Force run by the FBI in New York was also activated, and agents in
New York began to examine the passenger manifest and to question
the workers at Kennedy Airport who might have had access to the
ill-fated Boeing 767 carrying 217 people.

LEETCH PROVIDES A SPARK FOR THE RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took a tour de force from Brian Leetch for the Rangers to
earn their first point in five games on Saturday night. Now if they
can muster a little production from some of their high-priced
forwards, they might be able to win a game again.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch was all over the ice in the Rangers' 2-2 tie against the
Montreal Canadiens at the Molson Center in a tussle featuring two
offensively challenged teams that had each lost four straight
games. Leetch scored the Rangers' first goal, snapping a drought of
253 minutes 33 seconds for the Rangers' offense. He assisted on the
other goal on a two-on-one rush.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch, a 31-year-old defenseman, rattled off a game-high seven
shots, four in the second period alone, each one providing a
different test for Montreal goaltender Jeff Hackett. Leetch logged
a game-high 30:33 of ice time. He was so good he grabbed the
headlines in The Gazette, Montreal's English-language daily, even
though the Canadiens had played one of their best games of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch said that in his role of team captain he had consciously
sought to lead the Rangers out of their slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always feel that way,'' Leetch said after scoring his
first goal of the season in the Rangers' 13th game. But Leetch
added that he realized he could not do it alone, although it seemed
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved the puck a lot better, and we skated a lot better,''
he said. ``But the position we've put ourselves in is we need to
win some games.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way the Rangers (4-7-2) are going to do that is if
players like Theo Fleury, Petr Nedved and Adam Graves _ and anybody
on the power play _ start scoring some goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers went 0 for 4 on the power play on Saturday night and
are 4 for 59 on the season, at .068 the worst rate of efficiency in
the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought that Fleury, Nedved, Graves and the
injured Valery Kamensky (his right forearm is in a cast as he waits
for a stress fracture to heal) would have combined for only nine
goals in the Rangers' first 13 games? Or that Fleury's four goals
would lead the team?
</P>
<P>
   Fleury hit the side of the net with a shot on a rebound in the
waning seconds of the four-on-four overtime, just after Nedved
could not score into a gaping expansion of open net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Fleury said of his inability to put the puck
in the net. ``That's just the way it's going right now. At least
I'm getting chances.''
</P>
<P>
   He just can't finish them.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury has not scored in five games. The same is true for
Nedved, who has two goals on the season. Graves, who also has two
goals, has gone nine games without one. He led the team in goals
last season with 38.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Rangers are 1 for 31 on the power play over their
last eight games. Neil Smith, the president and general manager,
would be right to expect more for his $58.8 million payroll, a
league record.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no way Smith could have expected any more from
Leetch on Saturday night.  &QL;

ADVISER PUSHES GORE TO BE LEADER OF THE PACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore has been paying Naomi Wolf,
the feminist author, thousands of dollars a month to help him
figure out how to become the top dog _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolf has been telling Gore that he is a beta male, a
subordinate figure, and must learn to become the alpha male, or
leader of the pack, before the public can accept him as president,
according to a report in the new issue of Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a valued adviser, and she'll remain one,'' Gore said
Sunday on the ABC program ``This Week.'' He said Ms. Wolf was one
of several campaign advisers and that she specializes in strategy
and communications. He said she works with his daughter, Karenna
Gore Schiff, a law student in New York, on trying to attract women
and young people to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said Ms. Wolf had been receiving $15,000 a month
since January but that Donna Brazile, who took over as campaign
manager last month, has cut her salary to $5,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolf, 37, is the author of ``Promiscuities,'' a 1997 best
seller recounting her sexual coming of age, as well as ``The Beauty
Myth'' and ``Fire With Fire.'' She is married to David K. Shipley,
a former speech writer for President Clinton and now an editor at
The New York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolf was an adviser on the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 and
worked closely with Dick Morris, Clinton's top adviser, a position
that evolved into influence with the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Behind the Oval Office,'' his own account of that campaign,
Morris credited Ms. Wolf with ideas about how to reach women voters
_ school uniforms, tax breaks for adoption and workplace
flexibility _ and for ``remarkably prescient analyses of the
social-cultural trends in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   This included her notion that the nation was searching for a
``good-father role model,'' which Morris said helped lead to
Clinton's emphasis on family issues. Part of cultivating the father
image included cultivating his image as a leader, a quality that
voters tell pollsters Gore lacks and one he is apparently trying to
develop with Ms. Wolf's help.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolf does not travel much with the campaign, but she
ensconced herself with a bevy of Gore advisers last week in a New
Hampshire hotel to prepare the candidate for his first town meeting
with former Sen. Bill Bradley. Gore turned in a notably aggressive
and assertive performance. On stage with Bradley for 20 minutes
until the televised program was to begin, Gore initiated and
controlled a discussion with the audience _ definite alpha male
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha males dominate and lead other members of the pack, while
beta males are subordinate and play a helpmate role. According to
Time, Ms. Wolf has argued within the Gore campaign that Gore ``is a
`beta male' who needs to take on the `alpha male' in the Oval
Office before the public will see him as the top dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Other advisers have told Gore that he needs to separate himself
from President Clinton not only to shed the image of being No. 2
but also because it would help him with women voters, who remain
especially irritated with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said that he needs to establish himself as his own man
but has been ambivalent about how far to go. While he says he
disapproved of Clinton's extramarital behavior, he also says the
president is his friend.

<P>
   An Egyptian jetliner bound from New York to Cairo overnight with
217 people aboard plunged suddenly into the Atlantic Ocean south of
Nantucket Island 33 minutes after takeoff early Sunday. One body
and some debris but no survivors were found in a massive search,
and the disaster's cause was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft _ EgyptAir Flight 990, a twin-engine, wide-bodied
Boeing 767-300 carrying 199 passengers and 18 crew members _ left
Kennedy Airport at 1:19 a.m. ET on a scheduled 11-hour nonstop
flight to the Middle East. While takeoff was late, everything
seemed normal.
</P>
<P>
   But at 1:50, with the plane cruising at 33,000 feet in a clear
night sky lit by a half moon, something went terribly wrong, and
the aircraft went into a plummeting, out-of-control dive. There was
no distress call from the cockpit, the last voice contact with
ground controllers having been routine. Two minutes later, the
plane vanished from radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what happened: whether an explosion had erupted,
whether some mechanical failure had occurred, or even whether the
aircraft was in one piece as it went down, aviation officials said.
What was known was that the jetliner, without warning, plunged out
of the sky and into the dark, rolling sea about 60 miles southeast
of the Massachusetts island of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that radar sweeps at 12-second intervals
showed that the aircraft fell from 33,000 feet to 19,100 feet _ a
drop of 13,900 feet _ in 36 seconds, indicating that it was falling
``like a rock,'' as one aviation expert put it. The rate of descent
was more than 23,000 feet per minute, while a normal descent is
1,500 to 2,000 feet a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the plane was still intact as it fell, aviation experts
said, the high-speed impact with the water would have shattered it,
and the chance that anyone survived was small. The water was a
chilly 59 degrees, and 250 to 270 feet deep, a cod and tuna ground
that would have been dotted with fishing boats and lobstermen in
early October but was all but deserted early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard rescue ships swarmed to the scene, followed by
helicopters and reconnaissance planes. As dawn broke, one body and
a flotsam of wreckage _ none with burn marks that might have
suggested an explosion _ were found adrift in the choppy sea.
Throughout the day, officials insisted that they were still seeking
survivors, but the grim search seemed all but hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to reemphasize our focus, and that is a continued
effort to find victims who may still be alive,'' Rear Adm. Richard
Larrabee of the Coast Guard said at a late-afternoon news
conference in Boston. ``This is still a search-and-rescue case, and
we are very mindful of the families, the trauma they are going
through, and making every effort to keep them informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, federal investigators began what was sure to be a long
inquiry into a catastrophe that was hauntingly reminiscent of the
fate of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, which took off from
Kennedy Airport on a calm July evening in 1996, climbed out over
the sea south of Long Island, N.Y., and exploded in midair, also
without warning, killing all 230 people aboard. A bomb was long
suspected, but officials now believe a fuel tank in the fuselage
accidentally blew up.
</P>
<P>
   There were no indications that the EgyptAir plane had been
sabotaged and no claims of responsibility made by terrorists,
American and Egyptian officials said, although the Federal Aviation
Administration had warned airlines a month ago of a threat to bomb
an unspecified flight out of Los Angeles or New York. EgyptAir
Flight 990 had originated in Los Angeles on Saturday.

   LA-EGYPTAIR (Los Angeles) -- As family members of the Los
Angeles passengers on EgyptAir Flight 990 met with American Red
Cross grief counselors at LAX Sunday, FBI and FAA officials
launched a probe of the maintenance, fueling, passenger and crew
activity involving the Boeing 767-300ER during its Los Angeles

   LA-LANDFILL (Los Angeles) -- Proposals -- unexplored by
sanitation officials and ignored by the City Council in voting last
week to reopen Sunshine Canyon Landfill in the San Fernando Valley
-- could allow the city to send its trash to Riverside or San
Bernardino counties for as little as 50 cents extra a month per
household. At that rate, the total cost to Los Angeles would be
about $4 million a year _ half the figure used by the City Council
to justify giving preliminary approval on a 9-5 vote to reopen the
Granada Hills garbage dump. By Beth Barrett and Rick Orlov. (Will

and Los Angeles Unified insider Ruben Zacarias. By Greg Gittrich.

   NEW YORK _ One year before the election for U.S. Senate, a
remarkably small number of New Yorkers say they are undecided in a
contest between Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton,
suggesting the advertisements, speeches and assaults that are being
readied will be aimed at a scant few hundred thousand voters,
according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that the level of voter interest at this time is
already equal to what it was a single month before Election Day in
last year's Senate race. That finding reflects an electorate that
is both highly informed and opinionated about the race to succeed
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who is retiring in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In one bit of good news for Mrs. Clinton, New Yorkers list
health care and education as their two most important concerns, and
they say they overwhelmingly believe that Mrs. Clinton would do a
better job handling those issues than Giuliani. But that is offset
by a clear drop in what the public says is its opinion of Mrs.
Clinton over the six months her potential candidacy has received
sustained attention.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Giuliani is now viewed more favorably, in some
important ways, than he was last spring. And a majority of voters
statewide, according to the poll, believe the mayor cares more
about the needs and problems of New York City residents and those
in the surrounding suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News Poll, conducted from Oct. 23 though Oct. 28,
found that Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton (neither has officially
announced) are in a statistical dead heat. If elections were held
today, Giuliani would have the support of 46 percent of voters,
compared with 42 percent for Mrs. Clinton, with 8 percent of voters
saying they do not have a preference at this time.
</P>
<P>
   But when those 8 percent of voters are asked which way they are
leaning, the number of undecided voters shrinks to just 3 percent,
with Giuliani receiving 49 percent and Mrs. Clinton 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And while there are voters in both camps who say they might
still change their minds, the Times/CBS News Poll strongly suggests
that a key to this election is likely to be which campaign is
successful in first identifying and then appealing to the distinct
class of New Yorkers who have yet to take sides in a
Giuliani-Clinton contest, while at the same time reinforcing the
support of voters who are with them now.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which New Yorkers have formed opinions and seem
fairly set in them also suggests that the flood of television
advertising, media coverage and the views of so-called opinion
leaders _ newspaper and Internet columnists, television
commentators and editorial boards _ that have already washed over
this contest may have less sway on voters in a more conventional
political season.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll respondents clearly indicated that they are not
necessarily delighted with either of these likely choices. Each
candidate is viewed unfavorably by one-third, and more than 4 in 10
of the New Yorkers who were polled expressed a desire for other
candidates to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News telephone poll was conducted with 1,315
residents of New York state, of whom 1,026 said they were
registered to vote. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points. That means there would have to be a
difference of more than 6 percentage points in order to say that
one candidate clearly leads the other in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   In the last Times/CBS News Poll, in March, Mrs. Clinton led
Giuliani by 9 percentage points, 48 percent to 39 percent. At the
time, the impeachment scandal had just ended with President
Clinton's acquittal by the Senate. Mrs. Clinton may have benefited
then from her husband's extremely high popularity in New York
State, and from a wave of sympathy among voters who viewed her as
the wronged but loyal wife. Conversely, Giuliani at the time was
being buffeted in the midst of a furor over the police shooting of
Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's pollster, Mark Penn, said he was not surprised by
poll results showing so few undecided voters. ``This is consistent
with our belief that this is a very, very close race, starting off
within the margin of error,'' Penn said. ``And that's excellent,
considering that she's just making a transition into the state, and
that over time the race will be more about what she stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce J. Teitelbaum, the director of Giuliani's political action
campaign, said he was not surprised to hear that Mrs. Clinton's
unfavorable rating was beginning to inch up. ``When a campaign goes
negative, especially this early, the candidate's negatives go up
and their approval rating falls,'' Teitelbaum said, referring to
incidents in which Democrats close to Mrs. Clinton have attacked
Giuliani in recent days. ``Mayor Giuliani focuses on the issues and
his record, and that accounts for his strong poll numbers.''

</P>
<P>
   The poll raises flags of hope and caution for both likely
candidates as they prepare for the year ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For Giuliani, the Times/CBS News poll also showed an increase
since March in the number of people who believed that he ``cares
about needs and problems of people like you,'' as well as the
percentage who believed he had the experience to be a senator.
There was a slight decline in the number of people who offered
similar opinions about Mrs. Clinton over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   There was also an increase among respondents who said they
believed that Giuliani would be ``good at getting things done for
New York.'' And by overwhelming numbers, voters said they believed
Giuliani would do a better job at working to reduce crime.
</P>
<P>
   The most encouraging result for Mrs. Clinton appears to be the
emerging shape of the campaign when it comes to issues. The
respondents listed health care as the single most important problem
facing the next president and Congress, with education a close
second. Indeed, 89 percent of respondents said the health care
system needed fundamental changes, or should be completely rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Two of three said that Mrs. Clinton would do a better job than
Giuliani at dealing with the health care system, a notable finding
considering Mrs. Clinton's involvement with her husband's failed
attempt to reform the nation's health care system in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And a similar percentage said Mrs. Clinton would do a better job
with education. In this regard, it appears that Giuliani is being
dragged down by the New York City public school system: barely
one-third of the respondents said they approved of the job he had
done with the city schools, one of the few areas in city governance
in which Giuliani does not get high marks.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of New Yorkers would also prefer to see any budget
surplus go to shoring up Social Security and Medicare rather than
promoting a tax cut. Congressional Republicans, with Giuliani's
support, have pushed the tax cut, while Democrats, including
Clinton and Mrs. Clinton, have pushed for allocating the money to
those domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers also overwhelmingly support an increase in the
minimum wage, which has also been promoted by Mrs. Clinton.
Giuliani initially said he opposed raising the minimum wage unless
he saw studies that showed it would not result in a decline in job
growth; he has since switched and says he now expects to support
it.
</P>
<P>
   There are clear signs that Mrs. Clinton is having some
difficulty in establishing herself with the New York electorate.
The number of voters who expressed a favorable opinion of her
dropped from 52 percent to 37 percent since March, while her
unfavorable rating jumped from 22 percent to 38 percent. By
contrast, Giuliani's favorable rating increased from 34 to 39,
while his unfavorable rating moved from 28 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   While a solid majority of New Yorkers do not believe the
scandals that have marked Clinton's seven years in Washington were
fair issues to raise against Mrs. Clinton, they are evenly divided
on the question of whether Mrs. Clinton's ``involvement in various
investigations'' is a legitimate issue. Giuliani, a former federal
prosecutor, has yet to say to what extent, or whether, he might
raise such issues against Mrs. Clinton, who has been at the center
of Whitewater and other longtime investigations.
</P>
<P>
   She also continues to be burdened by questions about her
nonresidency. Notwithstanding her almost weekly visits to New York,
four of 10 New Yorkers say they do not believe she could
effectively represent the state, about the same number as last
March.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' announcement that they have purchased a $1.7
million house in Chappaqua (they are to close on the deal on
Monday) has not appeared to help her. Even after being reminded of
the impending home purchase, two of three respondents said they did
not consider her a resident of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is I don't care for Hillary,'' Sue Daily, 51, a
Democrat who lives in Jamestown, said in a follow-up interview. ``I
know she's not from New York, and I don't think she has a right to
run for senator of New York. I feel she's using New York as a
stepping stone for the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking figure in the poll is the slight
number of people who say they are genuinely undecided. Even in a
sample of this size, it is impossible for pollsters to conduct a
reliable analysis of its make-up.
</P>
<P>
   However, follow-up interviews with some of them suggest that
while voters may be undecided, they are certainly paying attention
to the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's troubling to me,'' said Joseph O'Connor, 68, a retired
phone company worker from Bethpage who said he almost always voted
Democratic. He said he would hate to waste his vote, but added,
``I'm not truly convinced on either one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Blick, 68, of New York City, said he had voted for Giuliani
for mayor but was not prepared to vote for him for senator because,
he said, he had been troubled by Giuliani's attempt to cut off
funding to the Brooklyn Museum of Art over an exhibition the mayor
described as anti-Catholic. In the poll, more than half of New
Yorkers disapproved of the mayor's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot depends on what he's going to say,'' Blick said. ``They
haven't really discussed meaningful things yet. If I had to vote
now, I'd vote for Hillary, but it's a long time between now and
Election Day.''

 OSLO, Norway: Roed-Larsen said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the Israeli side, there is a complete change in the cast of
characters. Rabin, who in the end made the pivotal decision to go
ahead in 1993, is dead. It is the fourth anniversary of his
assassination that Clinton, Arafat and Barak will commemorate here.
Shimon Peres is in a lesser role.
</P>
<P>
   And the new prime minister, Barak, has made clear that
``interpreters,'' as he calls intermediaries, are not needed.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, Barak has emphasized that he is his own
man. If there is a secret channel this time _ and all sides say
that it is an essential ingredient _ it will be between Barak and a
Palestinian delegated by Arafat, or Arafat himself, according to
Israeli and U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, the key negotiator at Oslo in 1993,
Ahmed Qurei, also known as Abu Ala, is now speaker of the
Palestinian Council in Ramallah, but he will be with Arafat here.
</P>
<P>
   In describing how the talks toward a final agreement might
unfold, Clinton administration officials painted a picture of steps
similar to those that led up to the Oslo accord of 1993 and a later
one in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   First, in 1993, a declaration of principles was outlined _ not
unlike the framework agreement that is supposed to be finished in
February _ and then an agreement was worked out to put it into
effect.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, U.S. officials have acknowledged, the stakes are
higher and the time schedule much tighter.

   NEW YORK _ Hatem Ayad said the Muslim prayers with his
father-in-law in the airport early Sunday morning before putting
him on the EgyptAir flight for Cairo, Egypt. Then he went home and
slept, content that their first visit in three years had ended on
such an intimate note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called my family in Cairo in the morning and said the plane
would be delayed,'' said Ayad, a computer engineer who shuttles
between Cairo and Jersey City, N.J. ``And they said: `What's
happening? We hear the plane has crashed.' My wife in Egypt and her
family, they're crying and asking me to do something. But I can't
do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is responsible for this?'' he asked, his composure
cracking as he stood in the airport hotel where other grieving
relatives of the plane's passengers wept or sat in stony dazed
silence on Sunday. ``Who is responsible for 200 screaming
families?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of loss and prayer and humble wonder at life's
second chances, as the passengers on EgyptAir Flight 990 were
mourned by relatives, friends and an extended family of
Egyptian-Americans in New York City and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Ramada Plaza hotel, where relatives were invited for
whatever solace and information could be offered, Soheir Makarey
collapsed as she faced a thicket of television cameras outside the
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers carried her inside. Rowis Mayar, the pastor of
Saint George Coptic Orthodox Church in Astoria, Queens, said he
tried to comfort Ms. Makarey but found her inconsolable.
</P>
<P>
   ``She still believes he's alive,'' the pastor said sadly.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hotel, the lobby was a whirling mass of grief
counselors, airline executives, police officers and government
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   As relatives of the passengers trickled in, they were gently
steered to a private conference room where clerics offered what
comfort they could amid the incongruous hustle of routine hotel
activity. Little boys in pressed tuxedos and little girls in frilly
white dresses, on hand for an International Prince and Princess
Pageant, bounced past the dazed relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the room, some relatives slumped into chairs, tears rolling
down their cheeks. Others sat in stunned silence. Every few hours,
several of the men left with Muslim clerics to pray in another area
of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men held up pretty good but the women were pretty
emotional,'' said Ghazi Khankan, director of interfaith affairs at
the Islamic Center of Long Island in Westbury.
</P>
<P>
   Khankan spoke with a sister of one of the pilots, who attended
the Westbury mosque. ``She recognized me and started crying,''
Khankan said. ``I consoled her. I told her in Arabic, `We belong to
God and to God we return.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mohamad Gemeaha, the Egyptian-born imam of the Islamic Cultural
Center of New York, had rushed to the airport at 6 a.m., when he
heard the plane was missing. He said he knew a number of the
victims and their families and tried to encourage them to accept
the will of God.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his staff commandeered a conference
room on the sixth floor. Every few hours he passed through the
lobby, trailed by aides and police officers, to meet privately with
victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   One man, frustrated at the lack of information, cried out in
anger: ``We aren't getting any answers. We aren't getting any
answers.'' Giuliani tried to comfort the man, quietly urging
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything the city of New York can do to help,
that's what we're trying to do,'' the mayor told reporters later.
Grimly noting his experience in handling previous airline
disasters, the mayor said that he attempted to impress upon the
families that he was prepared to be their champion in the weeks
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``if the mayor asks, it happens a little
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir flight was crowded with its usual assortment of
businessmen, elderly couples returning home from visits with their
Egyptian-American children, and families.
</P>
<P>
   Ayed's father-in-law, Mahmoud Laz, was a pilot in the Egyptian
army and had been on a two-week inspection tour, with seven friends
in Alabama, of military equipment bought by their government.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the passengers were Egyptian teen-agers from Luxor who
had been visiting Baltimore for two weeks on an exchange program.
They were accompanied by the father of one of the students, who was
the secretary of the exchange program in Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   At mosques and churches across New York City and New Jersey, in
smoky coffee shops where solemn men smoked mint-flavored tobacco
through their traditional water pipes, Egyptians spent the day
assessing their community's losses and spreading the word about
those who were on the plane and those who might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know each other,'' said Hamad Nabaway, a restaurant and
grocery-store owner in Brooklyn who drove to the airport Sunday to
see if there was anyone he knew among the victims' relatives. ``If
it's not family, it will be family of friends. This is small close
community.''
</P>
<P>
   That morning, he added, a friend who was supposed to have been
on the flight called him to share his mix of relief and horror. The
friend, a businessman who did not want his name to be published,
had arrived at the airport late and was turned away at the ticket
counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told him the flight was closed, but he was screaming and
yelling because he missed it,'' Nabaway said. ``So he went home and
got the news in the morning. Can you believe it?''

</P>
<P>
   Baher Shaarawy, a host of weekly Egyptian television and radio
programs, spent much of the day on the telephone, calling every
acquaintance or friend in the Egyptian diplomatic service, and at
EgyptAir, so he could give an informed report on his Sunday
afternoon broadcast on WSOU radio in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   What he heard sent him on a roller coaster of emotions. There
was a rumor that one EgyptAir reservations official had lost his
parents on the flight. There was a story that another was supposed
to be on the plane with his family but had missed it when his wife
took too long to finish packing.
</P>
<P>
   Shaarawy, who is the president of the Egyptian American Cultural
Foundation, also heard the raw sounds of grief, through a friend
who was inside the Ramada Plaza Hotel with the slowly gathering
crowd of grieving relatives. The friend passed his cell phone
around the room from shaking hand to shaking hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are crying and screaming and it's difficult to talk to
them,'' Shaarawy said later, sounding deeply shaken himself. ``They
are in pretty bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, he felt like crying himself. As he was
rushing to get to the station, he saw a list of the EgyptAir crew
members broadcast on his Egyptian satellite television station and
realized he knew one of the crew, Hatem Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew with him one time and he once helped my daughter when
she was coming from Egypt,'' Shaarawy said. ``He took care of her.
He was a really nice guy I knew since 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the crash reached Talaat Abdel Moneim and his wife,
Gihan, at their home in Williston Park at about 6 a.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Late the night before they had driven Talaat Abdel Moneim's
elderly parents to the airport for their flight home to Cairo on
EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, Abdelrahman and Alia Amin, had wrapped up their
annual visit earlier than usual _ after only two months _ because
one of their daughters is pregnant and they wanted to be there for
the birth of their eleventh grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really looking forward to going back home,'' Mrs.
Abdel Moneim said of her in-laws. ``They were anxious to be there
for the new baby.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her husband had taken the family and his parents to the
airport early in the evening, but found out the plane's departure
was delayed. ``So we brought them back home for a while,'' Mrs.
Abdel Moneim recalled. ``Then our four kids fell asleep and my
husband took them back out to the airport last night on his own and
said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   After calling relatives in Cairo late Saturday to warn them the
plane might arrive late, the couple went to sleep. But they
apparently left the receiver off the hook. They only found out the
plane would never arrive when Mrs. Abdel Moneim's brother-in-law,
frantic because he had not been able to get through by telephone,
drove over and rang their doorbell at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Saad, owner of the Village Restaurant in Greenwich
Village that specializes in Egyptian food, said his roommate Gamal
Gaballa had planned to take the EgyptAir flight. But he discovered
a cheaper fare on another airline at the last moment and changed.
``Now he's scared to leave,'' Saad said. ``I tell him you have to
leave. It can happen to anybody.''

3 PLAYS DEFINE GIANTS' WEIRD VICTORY OVER EAGLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Football games are won in focal moments,
sequences almost stolen from the game's routine _ the stab of hand
on ball, a bull-rush to block a kick, a deflected pass that leads
to a catch-and-run and touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had three such moments Sunday against the Eagles. The
first was game-saving, the next game-tying and the last
game-winning.
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants trailing by two touchdowns, their season
teetering between advancing prosperity or a dreary descent to
mediocrity, their defense turned three playmaking moments into a
stunning, and perhaps meaningful, victory.
</P>
<P>
   The last act was Giants defensive end Michael Strahan _ head
back, legs churning to carry his 285 pounds and a pound of pigskin
_ running 44 yards with an overtime interception return for a
touchdown, giving the Giants a 23-17 victory over the Eagles and
salvaging a season at its midpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense may look as lost as ever, but thanks to the
team's defense, the Giants are on a three-game winning streak and
have a 5-3 record that positions them firmly in the chase for a
playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   A bizarre game, fitting for the historically quirky nature of
the Giants-Eagles series, revolved around three plays during the
final half-hour at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   First, Giants defensive tackle Christian Peter blocked a
field-goal attempt that would have put the Eagles ahead by 10
points with six and a half minutes to play. About four minutes
later, Peter's colleague at tackle, Keith Hamilton, knocked the
ball from the hands of Eagles running back Duce Staley on the
Philadelphia 5-yard line. The fumble, recovered by the Giants,
produced a late touchdown that tied the score at the end of the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, once again it was Peter, fighting his way through a
block, who deflected a pass by quarterback Doug Pederson high into
the air roughly four minutes into the overtime period.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan, who acknowledged he would have considered the game over
had Philadelphia converted the field goal Peter blocked, and who
called Staley's fumble ``a miracle from God,'' said he watched the
deflection of Pederson's pass spin through the air in wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking: `It's too good to be true,''' Strahan said.
``It was moving in slow motion. I knew I had to catch it or
everyone in New York would hate me right now. But I have good
hands. I grabbed it and ran.''
</P>
<P>
   The ending brought about comparisons to the 1978 fumble on an
exchange between Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik and Larry Csonka
at Giants Stadium, a game won by the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It guess it's the inverse of that,'' Coach Jim Fassel said.
``Though I know the situation was different, with a team that was
ahead then just trying to take a knee.''
</P>
<P>
   But Strahan's touchdown was an astounding finale to a game the
Giants seemed destined to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had dominated the first half, pushing around the same
Giants' defensive front four that would steal the game in the
second half. Staley had 83 of his 97 rushing yards today in the
first half, when he also scored on a 21-yard touchdown run that
gave the Eagles a 10-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles then went after Giants right cornerback Jason Sehorn,
Pederson connecting with Torrance Small late in the second quarter
for an 84-yard bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn, who was also called for pass interference on the play,
was beaten to the ball by Small, who broke free from Sehorn at
midfield and ran untouched into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But roused by a blistering rebuke from the coaching staff at
intermission, the Giants' defense played better, and by the
beginning of the fourth quarter, the Giants had closed the gap to
17-10 with a 16-play scoring drive that ended with a 2-yard
touchdown run by LeShon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Giants' offense mounted little in its next three
possessions. And soon, the Eagles were lining up for a routine
33-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Peter pushed through the middle of the line,
getting his right hand on the kick of Norm Johnson to keep the
Giants' deficit at 7 points and buy time.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense, however, could not take advantage of the
good fortune and punted the ball away with 3 minutes 21 seconds to
play in the fourth quarter. Philadelphia punt returner Allen Rossum
waited for the punt near his 10-yard line, but did not make an
attempt to field it as it bounced nearby.
</P>
<P>
   His mistake may have cost the Eagles the game. The Giants downed
the 63-yard punt on the Eagles' 3-yard line. After barely escaping
a safety on first and second down, the Eagles sent Staley up the
middle on third down.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton poked the ball free, and the Giants' Andre Weathers
recovered the fumble at the 5-yard line. Two plays later, Giants
quarterback Kent Graham, who would complete 26 of 42 passes for 240
yards, found tight end Pete Mitchell alone in the back of the end
zone for the game-tying 7-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of this team to find ways to win is amazing to
me,'' Fassel said later. ``Keith getting the fumble and Christian
blocking the kick, those are examples of guys who have a spirit and
attitude that they're going to find a way to win. And then,
Michael's play was really amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had the ball first in the overtime, but punted after
three plays. The Eagles were driving and had reached the Giants'
45-yard line when Pederson retreated to pass and threw a pass that
never got past Peter's outstretched left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan, who has four career interceptions, returned one for a
touchdown for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they should play me at safety,'' Strahan said, joking.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead, a team leader
like Strahan who had an interception, a sack and seven tackles, to
summarize the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big guys on a team are supposed to make the big plays,''
he said. ``There comes a time in every game when somebody has to
step up, or go home with a loss. That time came for us and the guys
did what they had to. And we get on the bus and go home winners.'' &QL;

<HEADLINE>
ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FIELDS HAVE ANSWERS TO THE DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were no major upsets. Every team in the top 10 that was
supposed to win did so. The nicest thing to come out of this
college football weekend was the resurrection of one of the most
memorable names in sports: Sonny Sixkiller.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Sixkiller was a record-setting quarterback at
Washington, and he went on to become a supporting actor in ``The
Longest Yard,'' the ``Citizen Kane'' of football movies. You know,
a jailed star quarterback (Burt Reynolds) rallies a ragtag bunch of
inmates to upset the prison guards' championship team.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Marques Tuiasosopo became the first Huskies
quarterback to throw for more than 300 yards in consecutive games
since Sixkiller did so in 1970. Bigger than that, he became the
first quarterback in National Collegiate Athletic Association
history to pass for 300 yards and run for 200 yards in the same
game as Washington beat Stanford, 35-30.
</P>
<P>
   But most pundits _ broadcast, print or barroom _ would rather
talk about the complexities of the Bowl Championship Series
ranking. A sample of the radio and cable channels, the news wires
and the mahogany ridge over the past 24 hours reveals some burning
questions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Which will the subjective polls (news media and coaches') look
more favorably on: Florida State's 28-second half points to paste
Virginia by 35-10, or Penn State's 20 second-half points to shake
Illinois by 27-7?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did Virginia Tech alienate the computers it had charmed last
week with a 62-0 rout of Syracuse by beating Pittsburgh by only
30-17?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is there a human and technological conspiracy to keep Kansas
State out of a national title game?
</P>
<P>
   When the BCS releases its latest ranking Monday, those answers
will be revealed definitively _ until next week. For now, here are
some informed responses.
</P>
<P>
   For Question No. 1: Who cares? Both the Seminoles and the
Nittany Lions are 9-0, both have tough games ahead and, if both win
out, they will play in the BCS title game at the Sugar Bowl on Jan.
4. Talent and strength of schedule say so.
</P>
<P>
   For No. 2: Definitely not, says the BCS coordinator, Roy Kramer,
who helped develop the formula that includes the news media and
coaches' polls, eight computer rankings and the strength of
schedule to ensure that the best two teams in the nation play in a
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you pass 17 or 19 points, it becomes infinitesimal,''
Kramer said of the margin-of-victory benefit built into some of the
computer rankings.
</P>
<P>
   For No. 3: Absolutely not. The good people of Kansas need to be
reminded that last year's thrilling double-overtime loss to Texas
A&AMP;M in the Big 12 championship game, not voters or computers, kept
the Wildcats from a title shot.
</P>
<P>
   Any anger, and there is much, should be directed at organizers
of the BCS bowls, who opted for regional matchups, like at-large
Florida against Big East champion Syracuse in the Orange Bowl,
rather than inviting Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Like Virginia Tech (7-0), Kansas State (8-0) won't establish a
claim to the top spots until it improves its nonconference
schedule. Virginia Tech beat James Madison, and Kansas State beat
Utah State. Compare that to Florida State's victory over Miami and
its nonconference closer against Florida or Penn State's victories
over Miami and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And, if we learned anything last year, the BCS ranking isn't
worth debating from week to week. The Wildcats were not the only
team to lose a title shot in their last game of the regular season
_ undefeated UCLA lost to Miami. The result? Undefeated Tennessee
met once-defeated Florida State for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   These things have a way of taking care of themselves that defies
all manner of computer programs and popular votes. In the meantime,
enjoy the amazing feats that occur every Saturday on fields far
from the top of the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tuiasosopo, who was injured on the second play of the game
when he was thrown to the artificial turf on his backside and hip.
He went into the dressing room at one point and was limping badly
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could barely lift his leg to walk,'' Washington receiver
Dane Looker said. ``Yet, he didn't even look hurt when he was
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't stop him from completing 19 of 32 passes for 302 yards
and a touchdown or from running 22 times for 207 yards and two more
scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach kept asking me if I could still run the option and I
said, `Let's do whatever we need to win the game,''' Tuiasosopo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about Marshall quarterback Chad Pennington? He completed
26 of 33 passes for 288 yards and 4 touchdowns in a 41-9 rout of
Northern Illinois. In two-plus major-college seasons, he has thrown
for 10,236 yards and needs four touchdown passes to become the
third player to reach 100.
</P>
<P>
   Not included are the 2,445 yards and 15 touchdowns Pennington
threw for as a freshman in 1995 when Marshall was in Division I-AA.
</P>
<P>
   The Thundering Herd (8-0) has won 12 straight and 29 in a row at
home _tops in Division I-A. Its defense has allowed the
second-fewest points in the nation and has not given up a touchdown
in 10 quarters.
</P>
<P>
   So don't let anyone tell you that nothing happened last weekend
in college football. Pennington has tossed and tossed and tossed
Marshall onto the college football map. Tuiasosopo has reminded us
that a talented player with a neat name can do something historic
beyond the view of broadcasters and computer widgets.
</P>
<P>
   The college football season, if not life itself, is too short to
listen to or read of arguments about which team looked better doing
what. And the computers can't really measure performance. If you
want debate, go to the video store and rent ``The Longest Yard.''
Better than ``Citizen Kane,'' perhaps?

 UNDATED: on Saturday.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weather conditions did not appear to be a factor. Fog had
shrouded Kennedy Airport at the time of takeoff and through much of
the day Sunday, but there were no storms in the vicinity of the
crash, winds were light and visibility was 10 miles or more,
according to meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   It was equally unclear whether some mechanical failure on the
10-year-old jet, which had no history of major problems, or a human
error had contributed to the disaster, which ranked with a score of
crashes as being among the worst in aviation history. It was the
first crash in the 67-year history of EgyptAir, a state-run airline
that has 38 planes and flies to 85 cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   By daylight, four and a half hours after the crash, a small
armada of Coast Guard ships and planes were on station,
methodically searching a 36-square-mile region of ocean. Among
their first discoveries were a body and wreckage _ seats, seat
cushions, a wheel, clothing, life jackets, passports, two partly
inflated yellow life rafts and other small items that were not
identifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Through the day, five Coast Guard cutters and as many as 11
helicopters and airplanes joined the search, tracing routes worked
out by computer to maximize efficiency. Wreckage and bodies were to
be brought to the U.S. Naval Base in Newport, R.I., for
identification.
</P>
<P>
   A primary focus of the search was the wreckage of the plane
itself, and its black boxes _ the flight data and cockpit voice
recorders _ which hold a range of information, from speed and
altitude to the talk of pilots, and could prove invaluable in the
inquiry. The boxes have pingers that signal their location, but
equipment to detect the pings was not expected to be available
until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness forced the planes back to their bases Sunday night, but
the ships planned to continue their search for survivors through
the night, and full operations were to be resumed Monday. The USS
Grapple, the Norfolk, Va.-based Navy ship used to locate John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s doomed plane last July, was expected to join the
search Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board quickly took charge of
the inquiry, with the FBI, the Federal Aviation Administration, the
Coast Guard and other agencies in supporting roles in what was
expected to be an exhaustive investigation. The FBI, which had long
clung mistakenly to suspicions of a bomb in the TWA case, was
clearly taking a subordinate role, with rivalries that had marred
previous cooperative efforts put aside.
</P>
<P>
   At Kennedy Airport, federal investigators and officials of the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the
airport, quarantined trucks that had refueled EgyptAir 990, and
began questioning mechanics, ground crews, food handlers, customer
service personnel and anyone else who had come into contact with
the plane. Manifests of the passengers and crew were also being
examined.
</P>
<P>
   A wealth of paperwork that was not available Sunday _ data from
numerous radar tracking stations, for example _ was expected to be
in hand over the next few days to provide a much clearer picture of
the flight path, altitude and speed of the plane in its final
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the aircraft fell in international waters, Egyptian
officials might have taken charge, but they authorized the United
States on Sunday to conduct the many-sided investigation, which was
expected to unfold in New York, Cairo, Los Angeles and Newark, N.J.
_ all points where the plane had landed over the weekend _ as well
as in Boston, Newport, R.I., and Nantucket, where search-and-rescue
operations were being coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, grieving families and friends of the crash victims
gathered in Los Angeles, New York and Cairo to await news from
airline officials and to meet with chaplains and other counselors.
Many were sobbing in desperation over the loss of loved ones, while
others were angry or in denial, unable to make sense of a tragedy
that seemed to have no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, EgyptAir's chairman, Mohammed Fahim Rayan, said those
aboard the jetliner included 62 Egyptians, two Sudanese, three
Syrians and one Chilean. Of the others, many were believed to be
Americans or Egyptian-Americans. Three of the 15 crew members were
described as nonpaying EgyptAir employees.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston-based travel agency said the airplane was carrying 54
people, all over 50 years old and many from Colorado, Arizona and
the Pacific Northwest, who were heading for a 14-day tour of Egypt
and the Nile. Others were from New York, Connecticut, New Jersey
and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The airline did not release the names of the passengers or crew
members. But a Montreal daily newspaper, La Presse, announced that
its deputy publisher, Claude Masson, and his wife, Jeannine
Bourdages, both 58, were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton ordered American agencies to
coordinate efforts to investigate the crash and aid the families of
victims, for whom he expressed deep sympathy. ``Like all Americans,
Hillary and I are very saddened by the crash of the EgyptAir
flight,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York, Gov. George Pataki also voiced sympathy for the
families of the victims and ordered state agencies to provide them
with counseling and other assistance, and to cooperate with
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and federal officials in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani spent much of the day at the
Ramada Plaza Hotel near Kennedy Airport, helping Red Cross workers,
Muslim clerics and counselors to console the families of 16 victims
amid wrenching scenes of grief. ``It's horrible in there,'' said
Mahmoud Hamza, who lost two friends on the flight. ``Everybody's
crying, everybody's in mourning.''

BUDGET BATTLES FOCUS ON POLICY, NOT ON DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: The following story replaces AIRCRASH-REACT on The New York
Times' front page.) 
(jw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton and the Republican-controlled
Congress begin final budget negotiations this week, the combative
debate and expected vetoes obscure a fundamental reality: The two
sides have only modest differences over how much to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The talks nonetheless could still take some time. A handful of
high-profile policy disputes remain over such issues as the
environment, education, the payment of back dues to the United
Nations, and other foreign policy questions. And the Democrats, who
are accustomed to making political gains whenever budget talks drag
out, are stepping up their criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be haunted by the agenda of the extremist wing
of the Republican Party, stuck in the Gingrich past,'' Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, said recently, trying
to tie Republicans once again to a speaker who resigned after the
last election.
</P>
<P>
   But step by step across the last few months, the Republican
Congress has moved toward Clinton. Republican leaders quickly
abandoned their drive for a $792 billion tax cut after the
president vetoed the legislation. And over the summer, Republicans
quietly gave up on their promise to adhere to the stringent limits
on spending set in the bipartisan balanced budget agreement of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found last week that
the Republicans were spending nearly $31 billion more than the $580
billion target that had been set in July as necessary to stay
within the limits.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there is no better example of the sea change than in
education. This year, the Republican majority's spending bill
covering an array of programs _ set for Senate passage this week
and then a certain veto by the president _ contains $300 million
more for the Education Department than Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Republicans' last-minute 1 percent
across-the-board cut to government agencies is factored in, the
Republicans would be allotting $37.1 billion for education _the
same level originally requested by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president himself said recently about education, ``The big
issue in Washington now is more on how we spend the money. I mean,
I've been fighting for four or five years on whether to spend
adequate amounts of money. Now we're fighting about how to spend
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another telling political moment came when the National
Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans' campaign
arm, issued press releases this month attacking seven Democrats
from traditionally competitive districts.
</P>
<P>
   They were assailed not, as might have been expected, for being
big spenders, but for opposing spending projects by voting against
a bill financing the Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years in Congress this is a first _ a member of
Congress actually voting against a project that would have
benefited his own district,'' Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority
whip, was quoted as saying in each of the seven press releases.
</P>
<P>
   What all this suggests is that if there is the political will
for a compromise, a deal can be struck reasonably quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could get the political bull gravy out of this debate,
we could solve all the remaining dollar problems in about three
days,'' Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said in floor debate last week.
``We are not that far apart.''

 WASHINGTON: far apart. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The White House, however, has been trying hard to play down any
expectation that a compromise is in sight. ``I think people are
thinking it's all easier than it is,'' said Jacob Lew, Clinton's
budget director, insisting that Clinton had a number of important
initiatives he wanted put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats acknowledge privately that they do not want to
see a quick solution. In years past, the Democrats have been able
to use the budget fight to portray the Republicans as hostile to
popular retirement and education programs or as irresponsible
partisans who would shut down the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' spending bills have made this line of attack
much more difficult this year. But Democrats are still trying to
focus on those differences that remain, particularly by denouncing
as ``mindless'' the Republicans' resorting to a 1 percent
across-the-board cut.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many of the final points of contention have less to do
with dollars than with policy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton objects to a bill for the Interior Department because of
several riders that environmentalists oppose. They include
provisions that could allow more logging in national forests, keep
major oil companies from having to pay fair market royalties for
drilling on public land and allow companies that mine on federal
land to leave behind waste.
</P>
<P>
   When he vetoed another bill for the Commerce, State and Justice
departments, Clinton listed many objections. Most significantly the
bill provided only a fraction of the money he requested for 50,000
new community police officers. It did not include language giving
the federal government more powers to fight hate crimes. And it did
not free up money to pay back dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign policy issues concern the failure of the
Republicans so far to provide money for the Wye River peace accords
in the Mideast and for helping with disarmament in the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The most intractable fight could well come over education,
because each party wants to run in 2000 as a champion of schools.
The struggle is not over money but over whose policy initiative is
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants another down payment on his program to put 100,000
new teachers in classroom across the nation. Republicans, who argue
that schools are a local issue, want states left flexible to use
federal education funds for whatever purpose they choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't treat things like education language and U.N.
arrears as insignificant issues,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan animosities have been made more strained by the
Republicans' stance on Social Security. Democrats and Republicans
alike began promising this year to end the longstanding practice of
drawing on tax revenues that are supposed to finance Social
Security to pay for other programs. But that has proved difficult
because both parties want to spend too much on other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans contend that their spending bills protect
Social Security. And House Republicans are running television
commercials accusing the Democrats of wanting to use Social
Security reserves for ``big government'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, stung by the advertisements, have seized on a report
by the Congressional Budget Office showing that once fiscal
gimmicks and creative accounting techniques are discounted, the
Republicans' spending bills might well use up an estimated $17
billion in Social Security revenues. Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the
minority leader, said Senate Democrats would soon begin running
their own commercials to counter the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal analysts say that there is a way that the Republicans'
claims they are protecting Social Security reserves could prove
true _ if the economy does better across the next year than is now
projected.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are gambling that as has been the case in the
last three years, estimates of revenues will prove low, and the
government will bring in more tax revenues in the fiscal year than
expected. If that happens, the federal surplus will be larger than
is now forecast and federal spending will probably not dip into
Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But if the economy does not prove as robust, the Republicans
could be left in next year's campaign season trying to explain away
official figures, traditionally released in October, that could
show that Social Security reserves were not left untouched.
``They're betting the ranch,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas,
``that the economy is going to get better, not worse.''

COMMENTARY: RUNNING HUGE RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Words in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans are unaware that Congress and the
president have just agreed to put us all at extraordinary financial
and personal risk.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Banking Chairman Phil Gramm has struck a deal with
Clinton Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to knock down all fire
walls between banks, insurance companies and brokerage houses.
Global financiers are given the green light for ever-greater
concentrations of power.
</P>
<P>
   Few remember the reason for those fire walls: to curtail the
spread of the sort of panic from one financial segment to another
that helped lead to the Great Depression. But today's lust for
global giantism has swept aside the voices of prudence; generous
financial lobbies have persuaded our leaders that in enormous size
there is strength.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has forgotten the adage of ``the bigger they come,
the harder they fall.'' In a little-noticed speech to bankers about
the need for oversight of the growing ``appetite for risk,''
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said that megabanks
are becoming ``complex entities that create the potential for
unusually large systemic risks in the national and international
economy should they fail.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fail &LR; ? That's a word that has been all but stricken from
mergermania's vocabulary. It can only be used in the phrase ``too
big to fail'' _ where the American taxpayer would have to bail out
a failing multitentacled financial network lest it sink the whole
jerry-built global edifice. A few of us have no appetite for
assuming that risk _ which would be 10 times as costly as the '80s
S&AMP;L debacle.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just a monetary risk that, come hard-to-imagine hard
times, would wipe out a decade's projected surplus. More
irreversible is a greater risk that we are assuming this month _ t
the veil over our health records ripped away. The feckless GOP
Congress tossed that hot potato to Clinton, who caved to the
insurance and hospital lobbies. The key word is  &UR; consent &LR; . Instead
of requiring written  &UR; permission &LR;  from patients before confidential
health records are shopped to drug marketers or shown to
prospective employers, Clinton's phony ``controls'' put patients
and doctors at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   As for financial privacy, the Gramm-Summers sellout makes your
bank account everybody's business. You will hear much huffing and
puffing about privacy protection as the fire walls are torn down,
especially about allowing you to object after the fact to the
handing-around of your personal records, like a plate of cookies,
to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the catch: What happens when those ``outside companies''
are not outside at all _ but are part of one great big family of
broker-banking-insurance services? Then, without your consent, the
private information you write on your mortgage application, with
your tax return attached, goes to your insurance company, which
already has your health history _ and its snoops can also see your
investment behavior and what you've been buying with your credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gramm-Summers, giant financial conglomerates _ using other
surveillance to protect against fraud _ will know more about your
money habits, your assets, your diseases and your genetic makeup
than your spouse or paramour does, and probably more than you do.
</P>
<P>
   And just as he has done with his health-privacy ``protection,''
Clinton will sign the bipartisan legislation, leaving you naked to
any prying eyes with an Orwellian statement about how this protects
your privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Listen for the word  &UR; consent &LR; . Listen for the word  &UR; permission &LR; .
You won't hear them, because that puts the expensive obligation on
the marketers and snoops to seek your consent and alert you to
their intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you will hear malarkey about how you will have
 &UR; control &LR; . That code word means that you must search for invasions
of your privacy from punch-this-number telephone-answering
computers and impenetrable bureaucracies. Some ``control.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheer size rules. We look to government either to regulate
monopoly or to enforce competition. But as we have deregulated to
let the free market operate, government has failed to enforce
antitrust laws to maintain competition in media and now in money.
</P>
<P>
   Today's result: mergermania, dangerous concentration of
financial risk, and the even greater risk to that part of our
freedom we call privacy.

COMMENTARY: BLUEPRINT FOR TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lives of the homeless, in the view of the mayor,
are not wretched enough. So here comes the threat to drive them out
of the shelters and into the streets if they don't shape up and go
to work, and the terrifying threat to snatch children from their
mothers and dump them into foster care, and so forth and so on.
</P>
<P>
   As this is the United States of America, Rudolph Giuliani has
had trouble imposing the full measure of his cruelty on the poor,
but he keeps trying.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming, and the winter that will
usher in the year 2000. The mayor sees it as an opportunity. Hey,
he says from the comfort of his throne at City Hall, I've got a
great idea. Let's welcome the millennium by pushing poor folks into
the icy streets.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Vallone, the speaker of the City Council and no radical,
is among the many who are objecting. ``We do not believe that the
best way of helping homeless people is by subjecting them to cruel
and unusual punishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's plan is to require what he describes as able-bodied
homeless people to work and meet other welfare rules in return for
their beds in city shelters. Parents who do not comply could,
according to city officials, lose custody of their children.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is a blueprint for tragedy. People who are homeless
are, almost by definition, in a profoundly chaotic state. Many are
in deep emotional trouble or are caught in the throes of addiction.
Some are already working _ struggling at real jobs, not workfare _
but have not yet earned enough to pay for housing. Some are looking
for work. Some are chronically confused.
</P>
<P>
   Dumping any or all of them onto the street is hardly a great
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor sees this sort of thing as ``the highest form of
compassion.'' After all, he's a Republican. But others see it
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Brosnahan, the director of the Coalition for the Homeless,
said she thinks that 40 percent to 50 percent of the people in the
shelter system are homeless ``by reason of social dysfunction.''
That's a category of homeless people specifically acknowledged by
the consent decree that has guided the city's homeless policy for
nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the group that Rudy is trying to carve out, target,
eliminate, frankly, from the protection of emergency bedrock
shelter,'' Ms. Brosnahan said. ``And that chills me to the bone
because it's exactly that group that is most difficult to deal
with, and that will wind up in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   If the city follows through on the threats, homeless people will
be driven from the shelters in the same way that poor families
unable to comply with workfare requirements were driven from
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani likes to travel the state bragging that he's pared the
city's welfare rolls by more than 400,000 people. What he doesn't
tell his applauding audiences is that two-thirds of the 400,000
were children. And he doesn't talk about the families who were
improperly _ unfairly _ stricken from the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The city's own commissioner of homeless services, Martin
Oesterreich, acknowledged last week that some families have been
mistakenly thrown off welfare. He said he was concerned that
similar foul-ups could result in families being improperly evicted
from homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Oesterreich's comments were made during a meeting with worried
officials of private nonprofit agencies that are contracted to
operate family shelters for the city. In a story about the meeting,
The New York Times' Nina Bernstein wrote: ``Many problems with the
plan are still unresolved and may have to be worked out after it
takes effect, Oesterreich said, since Mayor Rudolph Giuliani wants
`a full-blown program in place' by Jan. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor may not know it, but others realize that ideas that
sound reasonable in the abstract often have dreadful consequences.
Consider, for example, what will happen if word spreads that the
city is taking children from homeless mothers in need of shelter.
Many women, faced with even the remote possibility that they will
lose their kids, will not seek shelter, no matter how dire the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   It is not difficult to imagine a woman who is the victim of
domestic violence remaining in her home and submitting to the
abuse, rather than seeking shelter and risking the loss of her
children.
</P>
<P>
   That will happen. And that's just one example of the ways in
which this cruel and mindless policy can go tragically haywire.
</P>

AIRLINE'S SAFETY RECORD IS MARRED BY SECURITY PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Egyptair Boeing 767 that crashed Sunday morning
was a relatively new model with a good safety record, operated by
an airline with extensive international experience and relatively
few operational problems, but with some horrible security failures.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was delivered new to Egyptair almost exactly 10 years
ago, on Sept. 26, 1989, and had completed about 6,900 flights,
covering about 30,000 flight hours since then _ about normal for a
long-range plane of that age. Including the plane that crashed,
Egyptair operated five 767s. The plane that crashed was one of its
two extended-range 767-300s, the newest version produced by Boeing;
it could fly 7,080 miles nonstop, putting Cairo well within range
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptair is one of the world's oldest airlines, tracing its
operations back to 1933. Owned by the government and a candidate
for privatization under a new policy of economic liberalization, it
flies to approximately 70 cities around the world, with an icon of
the pharaonic god Horus adorning each airplane's tail. In the
1970s, when Egypt was allied with the Soviet Union, it acquired a
fleet of Ilyushins and other Russian jets; now it flies Boeings and
Airbuses. The airline said its planes are an average of six years
old, which would make it one of the youngest fleets in the
industry. Some of the aircrafts boast television screens in each
seat's armrest.
</P>
<P>
   But Egyptair has frequently been a target of hijackers, most
recently on Oct. 20, when a passenger kicked in the cockpit door on
a flight from Istanbul to Cairo and forced the crew to fly to
Hamburg. All aboard were released without injury. In November,
1985, a Boeing 737 was taken over by hijackers on a flight from
Athens to Cairo. The hijackers shot five passengers, and Egyptian
commandos stormed the plane in Malta, where 56 more were killed.
</P>
<P>
   One month earlier, an Egyptair 737 was carrying the hijackers of
the ocean liner Achille Lauro when it was intercepted by American
fighter jets and forced to land in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a twin-engine jet with two aisles, seats seven
abreast in economy class. The model has become popular with
airlines for trans-Atlantic flights, replacing older planes, partly
because it has a lower operating cost than older models.
</P>
<P>
   The 767 has a generally good operating record. One owned by
Lauda, an Austrian airline, crashed in the jungle near Bangkok,
Thailand, in May, 1991, killing all 223 people aboard.
Investigators found that a thrust reverser, a device usually used
on the runway shortly after landing to redirect the jet exhaust and
slow the plane, had deployed during the flight.
</P>
<P>
   According to one Web site that tracks airplanes, the plane that
crashed today came off the assembly line at the Boeing plant in
Seattle immediately before the Lauda plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 767 is covered by a variety of ``airworthiness
directives,'' or orders from the Federal Aviation Administration to
inspect or fix certain parts, because of crashes on other
airplanes. Among these are inspections of fuel tank wiring required
after the explosion of TWA 800, which was a Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference between the Egyptair flight and TWA 800 could
be the flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders. The ones
on TWA 800 stopped at the beginning of the event, apparently
because of a complete loss of electrical power. But the Egyptair
plane had electrical power for at least 36 more seconds, with its
transponder continuing to function, and thus its recorders may have
continued.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, as a later vintage airplane _ about 15 years
younger than TWA 800 _ the Egyptair 767s flight data recorder might
have captured more information. Boeing was not able to say Sunday
evening, however, what it equipped the plane with when it was
delivered.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ODESSA, Ukraine _ He was just a geologist. She was a grande
dame, the celebrated epicenter of cultural life in a beautiful, if
faded, seaport. As he entered his prime, she was leaving hers, a
web of crow's-feet splintering her lovely face and her graceful
frame slowly settling southward.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, they had more in common than one might suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Now 66, Gleb Dranov looks like the artist he is, with his brown
wool jacket, disheveled gray hair and modulated voice, and not the
rock-cracking prospector for the Soviet government that he was four
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was five years a geologist,'' he said in a long talk last
week. ``I was educated at the University of Kiev. I was a
specialist. We'd find some minerals in an area, and then new towns
were built around them.''
</P>
<P>
   He liked his work. In the summer he could traipse through fields
and woods, collecting samples; in the winter he analyzed them. In
southern Ukraine, he found rare-earth metals beneath what would
become the city of Samotkan. Along the Southern Bug River, which
flows into the Black Sea, he found nickel.
</P>
<P>
   But something else tugged at him, too. At the University Dranov
had sung in student theater productions and found a new avocation.
In 1960 he applied to the Kiev Conservatory of Music, where Ivan
Sergeyevich Patorzhensky, a world-renowned teacher, said he had a
handsome baritone and potential as an opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   Dranov marked time for a couple of years, singing musical comedy
in the evenings. ``I faced a choice,'' he said. ``Either I could be
a geologist or I could use a gift from God, because I am sure my
voice was God's gift.''
</P>
<P>
   He went with God, enrolling in the conservatory in 1962.
Daytimes he cracked rocks; nights he sang scales. After graduating
and narrowly missing a spot in the Bolshoi Opera in Moscow, he
heard of an opening in Odessa, joined a competition for the job and
won.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, in 1964, that he met the Odessa Opera and Ballet
House, a grande dame among European opera houses, but even then
past its best years. And a relationship that would last 35 years _
culminating in his appointment as director _ began to blossom.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Odessa, where the fusion of seagoing immigrants and a
thriving Jewish ghetto routinely spawned gifted musicians and
inspired writers, the Opera House was a special place. When it
opened in October 1887, replacing a squat Classical building that
had burned down, Odessa was a rich town, and the city's traders
spared no expense.
</P>
<P>
   From Vienna they hired two architects who had built great opera
palaces across Europe. From Italy came hard salmon-colored brick
for the foundation and walls. From Ukraine came hundreds of statues
and plaster friezes: monuments to Pushkin and Gogol, to
Aristophanes, to the Muses. Atop the entrance sat Melpomene, the
Muse of tragedy, in a chariot harnessed to four panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Vast and endlessly baroque, the building weighed 52,000 tons and
cost 4,000 golden rubles _ a fortune in those days. In the
cavernous half-oval performance hall, 1,800 crimson velvet seats
lay beneath a ceiling of Shakespearean scenes and filled ornate
boxes that seemed to tumble down the 70-foot walls.
</P>
<P>
   The acoustics were remarkable: a whisper on stage could be heard
in the worst seat in the house. To keep patrons comfortable in
Odessa's steamy summers, workers lowered wagonloads of ice and
straw down a 35-foot shaft, then carried it through a tunnel to a
basement beneath the hall, where cool air wafted up from vents
beneath the seats.
</P>
<P>
   The structure's grandeur was exceeded only by the greatness of
the musicians and dancers who performed there: Rimsky-Korsakov,
Rachmaninoff, Chaliapin, Sobinov. Anna Pavlova danced in the big
hall. Tchaikovsky filled it with his music.
</P>
<P>
   So did Dranov. He performed opera for 25 years. ``I sang 44
leading roles,'' he said quietly. ``I traveled throughout Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't regret leaving geology behind. ``I don't feel sorry
about it,'' he said. ``It was interesting. And the knowledge I
received about it never interfered with my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the magnificent Odessa Opera and Ballet House was a
wonderful place to work, marred by only one problem: it was falling
apart.
</P>
<P>
   The first cracks in the Italian brick foundation appeared almost
as soon as the building opened. Its eastern half sagged almost 7
inches in its first three years, and the walls _ six of them, from
the outside to the hall itself _ began to tilt.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1920s workers installed a movable concrete firewall
between the orchestra pit and the stage. It weighed 42 tons, and
the two walls on either side of the stage began to crack and buckle
further.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Dranov began singing there, in the mid-1960s, the
old building was midway through its second renovation. But while
the grand hall received new paint and gold leaf, the structural
problems went largely unaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the time Dranov left the stage in 1989, becoming the opera's
assistant director, the Soviet Union was in its death throes and
even basic repairs had been given up for lack of money. Statues
began to deteriorate. The silvery zinc roof, by then a century old,
began to leak. So did the storm sewers beneath the structure.
</P>
<P>
   Every time it rained, the opera house's network of gutters,
concealed within the walls for aesthetic purposes, funneled
torrents into the sewers and from there into the ground beneath the
building. The sagging began to speed up: soon, the outside walls
were a foot lower than the innermost ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilings and the upper parts of the structure were opening
up like a flower,'' Ivan S. Voloschuk, an engineer specializing in
the reconstruction of old buildings, said last week. ``And walls on
the second and third floors were barely touching the load-bearing
walls beneath them. Given time, they would have simply come
crashing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Dranov did not know all of this in 1993, when he was named
director of the Odessa Opera and Ballet. But three years ago, when
he discovered a serious roof leak and cracks in interior walls, he
realized that something was seriously wrong and persuaded
government officials to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   He was puzzled by what on earth _ more accurately, in the earth
_ could lead a structure so clearly built for the ages to come
apart at the seams. What the inquiry found was frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opera house was built on top of a ravine that had been
filled with dirt,'' Dranov said, ``and the foundations were simply
sitting on the clay layers instead of touching solid rock. Thus
water affected the clays and the sagging began in the foundation _
in some places worse, some not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation problem also made the building susceptible to the
earthquakes that frequently rock the region. The huge quake that
reduced parts of northwestern Turkey to rubble in August originated
less than 400 miles across the Black Sea from Odessa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Odessa sits on a tectonic plate,'' Dranov said. ``The plate
consists of three blocks, which come together beneath the city.
Fortunately there are no major earthquakes here. But earthquakes in
Romania and Turkey, for example, have effects here, too. In the 35
years I've been here, there also have been three microquakes, and
they could not help but have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, settling and shaking had a huge impact: the opera house
was broken into 36 pieces. Some parts, for instance a 300-ton wall
near the stage, were in imminent danger of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was left up to Dranov, now the keeper of the theater
where he sang for 25 years, to figure out what to do. Merely
staving off collapse would require drilling 1,800 50-foot holes
beneath the foundation into underlying rock, then filling the holes
with concrete to create pilings. To avoid future cracks, the width
of the foundation would have to be doubled.
</P>
<P>
   All that would go for naught unless the roof was replaced,
cracks in interior walls repaired, heavy firewalls replaced with
lighter material, and so on. The pipes and wiring were shot. Upper
floors had to be encircled with metal bands to put a stop to
further flowering.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we get the patient on her feet, and then we repair the
head,'' Voloschuk, the restoration engineer, said of the foundation
and the roof. ``Then we put on the bandages.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week he displayed for a visitor the recently removed brass
handle from the service entrance door, which performers used to
leave and enter the building. Once plump as a man's middle finger,
it had been worn by 112 years of use to the thickness of a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the handles that Tchaikovsky grabbed,'' he said
reverently. But replacing it _ and all the other long-neglected
aesthetics _ must wait until the building itself is saved.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that will cost nearly $18 million _ a lot of money
for a theater whose finest seat costs about $5.50.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine's government can help some, but is mostly broke. Odessa,
while comparatively prosperous, has far fewer golden rubles to
spare these days.
</P>
<P>
   So Dranov has organized a fund-raising committee and is seeking
contributions to save the old lady. By ``selling'' foundation
pilings for $1,000 apiece _ a donor gets a glass paperweight
depicting the building, mounted beside a chip of the Italian brick
foundation _ the theater has amassed about 10 percent of its
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the money has allowed workers to install
1,200 of the 1,800 pilings. The bad news is that the third of the
theater still without pilings is continuing to sink.
</P>
<P>
   And unless the opera house somehow finds more money to fix the
foundation _ and the cracked walls, and the roof and the rest _ its
day of reckoning with the forces of Mother Earth has only been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a geologist,'' Dranov said. ``So I know this better than
anyone.''

FOOTBALL COLUMN: FROM HALFTIME TO OVERTIME, COACHES PROVIDE
INSPIRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The New York Giants trailed the hapless
Philadelphia Eagles by two touchdowns at halftime Sunday, and the
locker room was in chaos. Players were arguing with each other.
Defensive linemen scolded defensive backs for missing tackles.
Offensive players were embarrassed that they had scored only 3
points.
</P>
<P>
   Then coach Jim Fassel entered the crowded room. Actually, he
blew in like a tornado and gave the team the kind of dressing-down
no Giants player had seen in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   During an explosive, expletive-filled speech that was punctuated
by Fassel's kicking a chair around the room, the coach chastised
his players, calling them ``pathetic'' and their play ``garbage.''
Then Fassel, players said, issued a challenge, telling them he was
sick of hearing guys talk about how good they are and then seeing
them play so poorly. ``And you know who I'm talking about,'' he
said. ``So now is the time. Go out and prove what you can do. Stop
talking and do something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is by far the maddest I have seen him,'' running back
Tiki Barber said after the Giants managed a 23-17 victory in
overtime. ``Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety Sam Garnes said, ``It was a humbling experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Jessie Armstead added: ``I was just praying he did
not have a heart attack. I thought he might. I really did.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Michael Strahan, who has had a rocky relationship
with Fassel, listened intently to the coach. But what had an even
more dramatic effect on Strahan was when the always calm defensive
line coach, Denny Marcin, blew up at his men minutes earlier,
screaming at them with the same kind of disgust as Fassel did.
Marcin blowing a gasket is the equivalent of Bill Parcells becoming
a yoga instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Denny started screaming at us,'' Strahan said, ``I really
became humiliated. I was ashamed. There was no way I was not going
to play 110 percent, 120 percent. If I had to leave body parts on
the field, that is what I was going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from that frustrating, chaotic scene was a defense that
decided, as it has done consistently all season, that it would win
the game, and at the heart of that attitude is Strahan. On his way
out of the locker room at halftime, he told Armstead and Garnes:
this is the day we stop caring about what the offense does; this is
our team.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead said that when the team went back on the field in the
second half, he knew the Giants were going to win. ``We were so
unified after all that stuff had happened at halftime,'' he said.
``When our defense comes together like that, we're unstoppable,
because you don't want to be the one who blows it, so you play your
butt off.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan, sparked by the emotional locker-room speeches, saved
the game, and maybe the season. With the score tied at 17-17 in
overtime, defensive lineman Christian Peter, who is nearly always
around the ball, tipped a Doug Pederson pass. It was caught by
Strahan and returned 44 yards for the touchdown. It was Strahan's
fourth interception, his second returned for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is if we would have lost this game, it could
have killed our season,'' Strahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, despite a season of dreadful offense, despite some
extremely conservative _ and questionable _ play calling by Fassel,
and despite allowing a running back named Duce Staley to look like
Jim Brown, the Giants are 5-3 at the halfway point. They have as
good a chance as any team in this National Football League-lite to
make the playoffs, and even to win a few postseason games, thanks
to a defense that makes big play after big play.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the blowout loss to Washington, the
Giants' defense has not played a bad game. The defense was the
reason the Giants beat Dallas, Tampa Bay and Philadelphia twice. It
is time to start putting this defense among some of the better
defenses in team history; the only difference with this group is
that past great units had solid offenses to complement them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the team must do something to upgrade its offense. The
Giants' remaining games are at home against Indianapolis, Arizona,
the Jets and Minnesota, and on the road at Washington, Buffalo, St.
Louis and Dallas. This is not an easy schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel's main priority must be to unknot his offensive mess. And
it is his mess. His play calling is extremely conservative,
composed mainly of dinks and dunks to the backs and short passes to
the wide receivers. It is as if he is scared to throw downfield.
There are few offenses in the league that go into a shell the way
the Giants do.
</P>
<P>
   What Fassel does do well, extremely well, is constantly remind
his players to believe. If that reinforcement comes in the form of
a belligerent halftime speech, so be it. With just eight games
left, and a playoff run a serious possibility, Fassel will do
whatever is needed. &QL;

AS IF BY DECREE, WOODS WRAPS UP YET ONE MORE TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Through the sadness and the symbolism, the
extraordinary run of Tiger Woods continued Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Winning his third consecutive start and winning for the eighth
time worldwide this year, Woods cruised to a 4-stroke victory at
the Tour Championship Sunday, ending a week that was emotionally
draining for everyone involved. In a poignant show of respect, 24
of the field's 29 players wore knickers, the distinctive golfing
attire worn by Payne Stewart, who died in a plane crash Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unforgettable week at Champions Golf Club, with the
golf world mourning the loss of Stewart while playing one of the
year's most prestigious events. But through the myriad feelings,
Woods added another milestone to a memorable season, becoming the
first player to win seven PGA Tour events in one season since
Johnny Miller won eight times in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   With the $900,000 first-place check, Woods clinched this year's
money title, having won more than $5.61 million on tour this
season. He is the first PGA Tour player to surpass $5 million in
one season, and he has more than doubled David Duval's previous
record of $2.59 million set last year. With a first- or
second-place finish at the season-ending World Golf Championships
American Express Invitational next weekend in Spain, Woods could
surpass $6 million for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot a 2-under-par 69 and finished at 15-under 209 for the
tournament, four strokes ahead of Davis Love III and five strokes
ahead of Brent Geiberger. But these days, the distance between
Woods and his peers cannot be measured by strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there were times when people on the tour sat back and
watched Jack Nicklaus do the same things,'' Love said while
discussing Woods' supremacy. ``When he first came out, I told guys
he is not even close to how good he can get. I think we are
starting to see that. He is going to be good for a long, long time.
We are all going to have to get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 23, Woods has already won 14 times on tour, including two
major championships, the 1997 Masters and this year's PGA
Championship. But the Tour Championship victory was unlike any
other, because the entire week was surrounded by tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 players wearing knickers on Sunday served as a constant
reminder of Stewart, and Stuart Appleby took the gesture one step
further by wearing one of Stewart's actual outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby visited Stewart's home in Orlando, Fla., on Thursday
night, the day before his funeral, and received permission from
Tracey Stewart to get one of her husband's outfits from the closet.
The hat, the knickers, the shirt, the socks and the shoes that
Appleby wore Sunday all belonged to Stewart. None of the clothes
had to be altered to fit Appleby, and especially from behind he
bore an eerie resemblance to his late friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really sure what I looked like, but I was told
that,'' said Appleby, whose wife, Renay, died last year when she
was hit by a car. ``It's like walking in his shoes for one day,
even though my swing's not fluid, and I don't putt as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Woods, there has never been a prolonged stretch of
better golf. Early this year, the swing changes he had been working
on since last year started to come together, and he mentioned as
much to his coach, Butch Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I came off the West Coast swing, I told Butch, don't be
surprised if I won seven times this year,'' Woods said. ``I felt I
could win in bunches.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day with a 3-stroke lead over Chris Perry, who
finished fourth, Woods was never seriously threatened, winning for
the 11th consecutive time when he has entered Sunday with at least
a share of the lead. When Woods begins a Sunday in first place, he
is as close to a sure winner as there is in golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had it,'' Woods said of his ability to close
tournaments. ``It's something you can't teach. I've always felt you
have to love the situation. You have to love everybody chasing you,
having all the pressure on you. I love that feeling. Give me your
best shot. If I can fend them off, great. If I can't, I learn from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was one of the players who decided against wearing
knickers, but he wore a black ribbon on his hat throughout the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to show it outwardly, the pain that I feel
inside, and how much I held Payne in honor,'' Woods said. ``Other
players may feel differently, but that's the way I feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very difficult week. We've all had to come to
grips with everything. I can honestly say I'm drained.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the course, Woods managed to focus. His most precarious
moment in the tournament occurred Thursday, when he sustained a
stinger injury to the left side of his neck while hitting a
fist-sized rock with his golf club while taking a swing. Play was
suspended Friday because of Stewart's funeral, however, and by
Saturday Woods felt much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday would have been a difficult round to play because my
neck was still a little stiff,'' Woods said. ``My range of motion
wasn't there. I was maybe 70 percent, and that would have been
tough to play at. But I felt a lot stronger Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods became the first tour player to win three consecutive
starts since Duval in 1997, and next weekend in Spain Woods will
try to become the first player to win four consecutive starts since
Ben Hogan in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could imagine winning eight times worldwide in 20
starts, as Woods has done this year, Love said: `No, I can't
imagine it. In this day and age, with the competition, I just think
it shows he is clearly head and shoulders above the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   That is where Woods wants to be. And that is where he intends to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much better I can get,'' Woods said. ``Over
the course of the next 20 years, we'll see what happens. Then
you'll be able to understand when my peak was. But I can tell you
one thing. I will continue to work hard.'' &QL;

 NEW YORK: believe it?''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baher Shaarawy, a host of weekly Egyptian television and radio
programs, spent much of the day on the telephone, calling every
acquaintance or friend in the Egyptian diplomatic service, and at
EgyptAir, so he could give an informed report on his Sunday
afternoon broadcast on WSOU radio in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   What he heard sent him on a roller coaster of emotions. There
was a rumor that one EgyptAir reservations official had lost his
parents on the flight. There was a story that another was supposed
to be on the plane with his family but had missed it when his wife
took too long to finish packing.
</P>
<P>
   Shaarawy, who is the president of the Egyptian American Cultural
Foundation, also heard the raw sounds of grief, through a friend
who was inside the Ramada Plaza Hotel with the slowly gathering
crowd of grieving relatives. The friend passed his cell phone
around the room from shaking hand to shaking hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are crying and screaming and it's difficult to talk to
them,'' Shaarawy said later, sounding deeply shaken himself. ``They
are in pretty bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, he felt like crying himself. As he was
rushing to get to the station, he saw a list of the EgyptAir crew
members broadcast on his Egyptian satellite television station and
realized he knew one of the crew, Hatem Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew with him one time and he once helped my daughter when
she was coming from Egypt,'' Shaarawy said. ``He took care of her.
He was a really nice guy I knew since 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the crash reached Talaat Abdel Moneim and e,
Gihan, at their home in Williston Park at about 6 a.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Late the night before they had driven Talaat Abdel Moneim's
elderly parents to the airport for their flight home to Cairo on
EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, Abdelrahman and Alia Amin, had wrapped up their
annual visit earlier than usual _ after only two months _ because
one of their daughters is pregnant and they wanted to be there for
the birth of their eleventh grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really looking forward to going back home,'' Mrs.
Abdel Moneim said of her in-laws. ``They were anxious to be there
for the new baby.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her husband had taken the family and his parents to the
airport early in the evening, but found out the plane's departure
was delayed. ``So we brought them back home for a while,'' Mrs.
Abdel Moneim recalled. ``Then our four kids fell asleep and my
husband took them back out to the airport last night on his own and
said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   After calling relatives in Cairo late Saturday to warn them the
plane might arrive late, the couple went to sleep. But they
apparently left the receiver off the hook. They only found out the
plane would never arrive when Mrs. Abdel Moneim's brother-in-law,
frantic because he had not been able to get through by telephone,
drove over and rang their doorbell at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Saad, owner of the Village Restaurant in Greenwich
Village that specializes in Egyptian food, said his roommate Gamal
Gaballa had planned to take the EgyptAir flight. But he discovered
a cheaper fare on another airline at the last moment and changed.
``Now he's scared to leave,'' Saad said. ``I tell him you have to
leave. It can happen to anybody.''

CHINA CHARGES FOUR SECT LEADERS UNDER NEW LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Chinese government on Sunday formally charged four
of the top leaders of the banned Falun Gong movement, immediately
using new sections of the country's criminal law that were approved
by legislators on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The laws state, in part, that organizing ``superstitious sects
and secret societies'' that ``violate laws or administrative
regulations'' is a criminal offense punishable by prison terms of
seven years or more.
</P>
<P>
   The quick use of the new law to charge Li Chang, Wang Zhiwen, Ji
Liewu and Yao Jie signaled the Communist government's resolve to
quash the group, whose core members have been stubbornly devoted
despite the government ban on July 12. Many say that they have
endured harassment and police detention and have been forced to
quit their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The four charged on Sunday are thought to have been arrested
shortly after the July ban.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of adherents have come to Beijing recently, group
members said, in the hopes of pressuring the government to reverse
its prohibition on Falun Gong, a once popular program of
traditional exercises and meditation that followers say has brought
them remarkable health and spiritual well-being.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, like every day this past week, a small number of
adherents were detained as they sat or stood in an act of silent,
anonymous protest in Tiananmen Square, the country's political
epicenter. Sunday's high-profile charges cap a tense week in which
government officials have admitted that security forces detained
more than 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   A core group of members _ including retirees, provincial
policemen, farmers and graduate students _ seem determined to push
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spoken with others, and they say they still plan to go
to the bureau of complaints again tomorrow,'' said one believer who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They expect to be arrested
before they get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Public security has escalated over the course of the week and
both members and Western reporters face heightened surveillance; a
few reporters have been followed by police, a once common practice
in Beijing that has become rather unusual in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   The Western press has been the only outlet for the protesters to
state their grievances. The Chinese state media have been filled
with invective against the group and its spiritual leader, Li
Hongzhi, who moved to New York last year but continued to influence
followers through an Internet site, now blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, China's most prominent newspapers and television news
shows uniformly referred to Falun Gong as a dangerous ``evil
sect,'' even comparing it to the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan, which
killed 12 people and injured thousands when it carried out a
nerve-gas attack on a Japanese subway in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The state media have not mentioned the weeklong protests, and
most Chinese are totally unaware of the small drama playing out
each day in Tiananmen Square _ it is almost invisible amid the
normal hubbub of this city of 12 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Tiananmen Square was packed with cheerful tourists
and strolling families. Most of those in uniform were soldiers on a
day off, snapping photos in front of the many Communist monuments
there.
</P>
<P>
   There were the usual uniformed police officers, although they
were unusually active Sunday, occasionally stopping people to ask
for identification. But there were also many plainclothes officers,
and blue-and-white police vans periodically snaked across the
square. They stopped once in a while to pick up a person or two,
presumably those who had identified themselves as Falun Gong
members when questioned.
</P>

<P>
   The surprising struggle between the government and Falun Gong
started on April 25, when an estimated 10,000 followers shocked
China's leaders by staging a surprise silent protest around the
government leadership compound, demanding official recognition for
the group.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong claimed tens of millions of followers in China before
the ban, and groups of devotees did Falun Gong's slow intense
exercises each morning in virtually all of Beijing's parks. Li
Hongzhi's books and tapes, now banned, were available in a number
of bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how many people retain their devotion to the
group.
</P>
<P>
   The people charged on Sunday with using the movement to
``undermine the country's laws,'' were among the first publicly
identified with the Falun Gong movement in China earlier this year,
and some were formerly prominent in the Communist Party. Li Chang
had once been a deputy director at the Ministry of Public Security,
and Wang Zhiwen a Railway Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   No trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those charged _ Li Chang, Wang Zhiwen and Yao Jie _
also face charges relating to holding and leaking top state
secrets, the New China News Agency reported.

PLAN TO REBUILD DANUBE BRIDGES WIDENS GAP ON AID TO SERBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania _ Over strong American and British
opposition, France and Germany are backing a European Union plan to
aid Yugoslavia by building a temporary bridge over the Danube and
clearing the wrecks of the bridges bombed by NATO earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the European Union would provide $25 million and
the technical means to haul away debris of three bombed bridges at
Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city, which block traffic on
Europe's longest river. The plan would include sending an old
dismantled Danube bridge now stored near Vienna, Austria, and
temporarily installing it at Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   European officials and experts involved in the negotiations,
some of whom attended a conference here led by Patriarch
Bartholomew of the Eastern Orthodox Church, said details were being
worked out and the money was available.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, aid is likely to cause new friction between Europe
and the United States, which has argued it would violate sanctions
that prohibit economic assistance and trade with the government of
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's backing is important because the Americans can best
assess whether there is still unexploded ordnance on the river bed,
and, if so, how to clear it.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its European allies have already clashed
over how best to isolate and weaken Milosevic. Washington objects
to a European plan to send heating oil to two Serbian cities, Nis
and Pirot, that are controlled by Milosevic's opponents. The
shipments are to start in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Washington argues that Milosevic could use assistance to his
advantage; the Europeans, led by France and Germany, counter that
an American policy that envisages a cold and hungry population
ousting Milosevic is too tough on ordinary people, and unlikely to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the bridges, there are other practical concerns:
blockage of the Danube is crippling shipping and trade along the
1,800-mile waterway, which links 10 countries. There are also fears
of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freeing this great European river has important practical and
financial consequences for all the Europeans who live on its banks,
but most significantly for the people of Romania and Bulgaria,''
Bartholomew wrote in an appeal for European Union aid sent after he
traveled through the region.
</P>
<P>
   Losses in trade and shipping revenues, estimated at some $200
million, have had the most impact in the poorest countries, notably
Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine, where hundreds of barges lie idle
and some shipping companies have laid off half their workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving cargo like coal, iron ore or wheat is four to five
times cheaper by river,'' said Anatoli Georgiev, a director of
Ukrainian Danubian Shipping Co., which he said has had to let go of
many dockworkers and boat crews.
</P>
<P>
   There is almost no traffic on the Danube, normally bustling. At
Galati, a Romanian port, several boat captains said they had not
worked for four months. ``The few barges going up the river are
heading for Serbia, with Russian cargo and oil,'' said Valerio
Panzar, a boat captain. His remarks indicated that Russia is not
adhering strictly to the sanctions against Milosevic. Experts from
the Danube Commission, which oversees navigation, said that
Milosevic has been receiving Russian oil via barges that use a
bypass channel.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists also warn of the danger of vast flooding if ice
piles up and effectively forms a dam behind the wrecks of the
bridges and a pontoon bridge the Serbs recently put across the
Danube at Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   Under a treaty regulating traffic on the Danube, Milosevic's
government is obliged to clear obstacles from the river, or let
others do so. But Serbia says the wrecked bridges can be cleared
only if the West pays and builds three new bridges.
</P>
<P>
   If agreement is reached, the big question remains whether the
work can be done before winter. The Danube is low now, which will
ease the clearing work. Once frost sets in, work would be
impossible, experts say, meaning the river would remain closed
until next spring or summer.

THE VICTIMS: YOUNG AND OLD, SET FOR ADVENTURE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were drawn across the Atlantic by curiosity
about another culture, love for their extended families or
dedication to their professions. Some were retirees savoring their
freedom, or grandparents relishing their grandchildren. Others were
students, exploring another part of the world. Some were
businessmen. Some were crew members, for whom the flight between
American and Egypt was business.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, all 217 passengers and crew members on
Egyptair Flight 990 were apparently plunged into the sea off
Nantucket. Though united in death, they were diverse in life.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the passengers were Egyptian students, ages 12 to 19,
who had been in Baltimore for a two-week exchange program between
Luxor, their hometown, and Baltimore, its sister city, said Abdel
Wahab Elabd, the chairman of the Baltimore-Luxor-Alexandria Sister
City Committee. A fifth passenger was the father of one of the
students; he was a chaperon on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very bright kids, very charming, all of them,''
Elabd said. ``They had a great time here.''
</P>
<P>
   The students attended classes at Paul Laurence Dunbar Community
High School in Baltimore, and stayed with host families who have
children at the school. ``They just were fun,'' Elabd said. ``There
was excitement in the whole school.''
</P>
<P>
   The students went to classes, visited colleges like the
University of Maryland, went to the aquarium and to Annapolis and
Washington. They shopped with their host families, stocking up on
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   A highlight, Elabd said, was when the Egyptian students and
their American classmates, went to the Science Center and saw an
Imax movie, ``Mysteries of Egypt,'' much of which focuses on the
monuments of Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   The students had been selected for their ability to serve as
ambassazzazy described Roushdy as extremely experienced. He said he
believed that Roushdy was the head pilot in Egyptair's 767 group.
</P>
<P>
   Another pilot was Ahmad El-habashy. ``He was an incredible
man,'' his niece, who would not give her name, said Sunday. ``We
miss him very much.'' He had worked for Egyptair since he was 21,
she said. He was 57 and lived in Cairo with his three children.

AFTER PROTRACTED TALKS, A DISNEYLAND WILL RISE IN HONG KONG
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a deal that will bring Main Street, USA to the
doorstep of mainland China, Walt Disney Co. has reached an
agreement to build a theme park in Hong Kong, a government official
close to the negotiations said early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which comes after nearly a year of arduous talks
between Disney and the Hong Kong government, is to be announced on
Tuesday. The theme park will be Disney's third outside the United
States, after those near Tokyo and Paris, but is precedent setting
in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   For Disney, the park would be its first significant beachhead in
China, a nation with which it has had a long and occasionally
stormy history. For Hong Kong, which is shaking off the effects of
its worst recession in decades, it would be the most costly
government undertaking since the former British colony returned to
Chinese rule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Disney and Hong Kong are to be
partners in a joint venture that will develop the park at a
secluded bay on Lantau island, six miles or so west of central Hong
Kong. The park, to be built on reclaimed land not far from the vast
new airport here, would open in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details were scarce Monday, but executives briefed on
the deal said Hong Kong would put up the bulk of the project's cost
through its contribution toward land, roads and other services.
Disney's investment is expected to be less than $300 million, these
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that Disney would be reluctant to put a lot of its
own money into the park because, remember, this is a Communist
country that occasionally has disputes with the United States,''
said David Londoner, a media analyst who follows Walt Disney for
Schroder Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the agreement comes after a tense period in U.S.-China
relations that began with the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade in May. While anti-American feeling was not as fierce in
Hong Kong, the Chinese government barred some American warships
from docking here.
</P>
<P>
   Disney seems aware that its brand of Americana could ruffle
feathers in China's newest city. Last week, when a deal looked
probable, Disney executives began meeting with economists,
political leaders and academics here to build support for the theme
park. They sought to allay fears about the project's financial,
environmental and cultural effect on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Disney said it planned to give the park's
restaurants and hotels a strong Chinese flavor, according to one
person who met with the company. But he added that Disney left no
doubt that it would build an all-American Magic Kingdom, where
Mickey Mouse _ not Chairman Mao _ would reign supreme.
</P>
<P>
   While the prospect of a Hong Kong Disneyland has drawn
objections from a few people here on cultural grounds, it is not
expected to be as emotional an issue as it was in France, where the
opening of Euro Disneyland in 1992 provoked accusations of American
cultural hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   People in this money-minded city seem more concerned about the
financing of the project, particularly Hong Kong's share. ``The key
is how much is this going to cost?'' said Ian K. Perkin, chief
economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. ``And how
much of the project will Hong Kong own?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Disney and Hong Kong missed a deadline for signing a deal in
June. The two sides agreed to extend the talks until the end of
October, and they continued to wrangle until after the midnight
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which is based in Burbank, Calif., has promoted the deal
as a tonic for Hong Kong's sagging economy. The company estimates
that the park will attract five million visitors a year to the
territory. Hong Kong now draws about 10 million visitors annually,
but it has been struggling to revive its tourism industry after the
1997 hand-over to China and the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hong Kong has a population of 6.8 million, analysts said
Disneyland would need to draw visitors from mainland China, Taiwan
and Southeast Asia. One question is whether mainland Chinese will
be able to travel here easily enough to visit the park in large
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Although people from the mainland now account for one-third of
Hong Kong's visitors, they generally travel in large tourist
groups. The Chinese government grants visas for individual visits
sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   During the long negotiations, Disney and Hong Kong have been
mindful of the unhappy precedent of Euro Disneyland. In that case,
Londoner said, Disney invested $140 million in the venture up front
and the project borrowed heavily. When Euro Disney ran into severe
financial trouble a few years later, the parent company had to
inject an additional $700 million to rescue it.
</P>
<P>
   Londoner said one of the French Disneyland's key weaknesses was
a glut of hotel rooms. At the Hong Kong park, Disney plans only
1,400 rooms, according to one person briefed on the project. That
is a conservative number, given the visitors Disney expects.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is sealed, Hong Kong and Disney will each have to
satisfy demanding audiences. Hong Kong's legislature must approve
large public expenditures. Although the legislature is friendly to
the territory's government, its members could ask tough questions
if Hong Kong seemed to be giving too much away.
</P>
<P>
   And Hong Kong's economy has bounced back since the negotiations
began early this year, prompting some critics to argue that it does
not need a Disney theme park as desperately as it did.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Disney's shareholders will pay close attention to the
size of the company's capital investment. Disney has been in a
slump as it wrestles with slowing growth and problems at its ABC
television network. The company's chairman, Michael D. Eisner, has
told shareholders that he will keep a tight rein on spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number $200 million to $300 million would not be a
problem,'' said an influential media investor who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Anything approaching $1 billion would be
problematic for investors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Disney's desire to expand its presence in China appears to
have outweighed its short-term financial problems. The company has
had a rocky recent history here. In 1996, China closed its film
market to Disney after the company released ``Kundun,'' a film
about the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   In February, China approved the release of ``Mulan,'' an
animated feature about a female Chinese warrior. The decision
represented a thaw in relations with Disney. The film, though,
performed poorly at the box office.

SCHWAB TEAMS WITH OFFROAD CAPITAL TO CATER TO RICH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that anybody with an online trading account has a shot at
those coveted first-time stock offerings, what do brokerage firms
have left to offer exclusively to the rich?
</P>
<P>
   For Charles Schwab Corp., a firm once synonymous with discount
investing, the answer is a chance to invest in companies before
they sell stock to the masses. Schwab is teaming with OffRoad
Capital, which connects wealthy clients with emerging companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go to a cocktail party these days without hearing
about private equity deals,'' said Susanne Lyons, enterprise
president for Schwab Retail Client Services. ``People are becoming
emotionally involved with getting in on the ground floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab will offer clients who have more than $1 million invested
with it free access to private stock offerings from OffRoad, which
began operations in June and, like Schwab, is based in San
Francisco. Federal securities laws limit participation in private
stock offerings to investors with a net worth of at least $1
million because the deals are highly risky.
</P>
<P>
   The move is Schwab's latest attempt to cater to wealthy
investors, who traditionally have been clients of brokerage firms
like Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group. Ms. Lyons said
that Schwab had ``tens of thousands'' of customers with more than
$1 million in their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   OffRoad has raised only $10 million in two offerings so far,
said Stephen Pelletier, the company's chairman and chief executive.
But he expects the pace to quicken now that it has formed an
alliance with BancBoston Robertson Stephens, an investment bank
known for financing emerging companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pelletier said he saw Schwab as an ideal partner because it
``has aggregated more self-directed high-net-worth investors than
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   OffRoad finds private companies seeking $3 million to $15
million in second-stage, or so-called mezzanine, financing. It
screens these companies and electronically presents information
about them to prospective investors.
</P>
<P>
   After reading about the companies and interviewing management _
either over the Internet or live in a San Francisco TV studio _
investors decide how many shares they want at the offering price.
The minimum investment is $25,000; clients are not obligated to
invest in any deals.
</P>
<P>
   OffRoad's ``openness'' fit with Schwab's business model, Ms.
Lyons said. ``It's online,'' she said. ``It's immediate. It's very
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lyons said that the low cost of entry into OffRoad's deals
was enticing because even wealthy investors are inclined to spread
their bets. ``Some of these companies will do well,'' she said.
``Some won't.''

<P>
   Baher Shaarawy, a host of weekly Egyptian television and radio
programs, spent much of the day on the telephone, calling every
acquaintance or friend in the Egyptian diplomatic service, and at
EgyptAir, so he could give an informed report on his Sunday
afternoon broadcast on WSOU radio in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   What he heard sent him on a roller coaster of emotions. There
was a rumor that one EgyptAir reservations official had lost his
parents on the flight. There was a story that another was supposed
to be on the plane with his family but had missed it when his wife
took too long to finish packing.
</P>
<P>
   Shaarawy, who is the president of the Egyptian American Cultural
Foundation, also heard the raw sounds of grief, through a friend
who was inside the Ramada Plaza Hotel with the slowly gathering
crowd of grieving relatives. The friend passed his cell phone
around the room from shaking hand to shaking hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are crying and screaming and it's difficult to talk to
them,'' Shaarawy said later, sounding deeply shaken himself. ``They
are in pretty bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, he felt like crying himself. As he was
rushing to get to the station, he saw a list of the EgyptAir crew
members broadcast on his Egyptian satellite television station and
realized he knew one of the crew, Hatem Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew with him one time and he once helped my daughter when
she was coming from Egypt,'' Shaarawy said. ``He took care of her.
He was a really nice guy I knew since 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the crash reached Talaat Abdel Moneim and his wife,
Gihan, at their home in Williston Park at about 6 a.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Late the night before they had driven Talaat Abdel Moneim's
elderly parents to the airport for their flight home to Cairo on
EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, Abdelrahman and Alia Amin, had wrapped up their
annual visit earlier than usual _ after only two months _ because
one of their daughters is pregnant and they wanted to be there for
the birth of their eleventh grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really looking forward to going back home,'' Mrs.
Abdel Moneim said of her in-laws. ``They were anxious to be there
for the new baby.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her husband had taken the family and his parents to the
airport early in the evening, but found out the plane's departure
was delayed. ``So we brought them back home for a while,'' Mrs.
Abdel Moneim recalled. ``Then our four kids fell asleep and my
husband took them back out to the airport last night on his own and
said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   After calling relatives in Cairo late Saturday to warn them the
plane might arrive late, the couple went to sleep. But they
apparently left the receiver off the hook. They only found out the
plane would never arrive when Mrs. Abdel Moneim's brother-in-law,
frantic because he had not been able to get through by telephone,
drove over and rang their doorbell at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Saad, owner of the Village Restaurant in Greenwich
Village that specializes in Egyptian food, said his roommate Gamal
Gaballa had planned to take the EgyptAir flight. But he discovered
a cheaper fare on another airline at the last moment and changed.
``Now he's scared to leave,'' Saad said. ``I tell him you have to
leave. It can happen to anybody.''

   RELATIVES OF CRASH VICTIMS SHOW GRIEF, ANGER AND CONFUSION IN
CAIRO

   C. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
</P>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt Relatives and friends of those who perished in the
crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 sobbed and cursed here Sunday,
demanding to know everything from what happened to the plane to how
they can recover the bodies of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Cairo, a grimy and largely impoverished metropolis of more than
15 million people, is a place where answers are often elusive even
in good times. In the hours after the flight was supposed to have
landed, hectic Cairo International Airport echoed with the grieving
questions about the 217 people who disappeared in the Atlantic
Ocean 6,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we bring him home?'' asked Hisham El-Shaer(cq),
looking at a blurry fax that showed the names of the passengers on
board, including his 33-year-old cousin, Hussein Ismael. ``My
cousin's parents are killing themselves over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Four EgyptAir representatives kept the manifest on a desk in an
airport lounge filled with plastic chairs. At times, more than 100
people crowded into the makeshift lounge, located at the top of a
wide spiral staircase in Terminal One. The airport was covered in a
thick haze, the residue of an unexplained wave of pollution
affecting the city in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   In the lounge, some relatives wondered what the list actually
meant, apparently disbelieving that family members had died in the
Boeing 767 crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know,'' shouted a middle-aged woman as she took the
manifest off the desk and looked for a relative's name. ``They are
lying to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she dead or is she lost?'' Hisham Mansour asked of his
niece, whose name was on the crumpled fax.
</P>
<P>
   Several doctors and nurses tried to calm the crowd, at times
dispensing tranquilizers. Sons comforted weeping mothers, many of
whom wore black head scarves. Several people, overcome by grief,
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many questions _ about the traffic controllers,
the maintenance of the plane,'' said Zein Ahmed, a 42-year-old
Egyptian-American who lost a cousin, Egyptian Army communications
engineer Imad Abdel Rahim Suleiman, in the crash. Ahmed is a diner
cook in Albany, New York and is back in his native Egypt on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled other crashes in the same region of the Atlantic _ a
TWA flight, a Swiss Air flight and the crash of John F. Kennedy
Jr., who he admired.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed said Suleiman's brothers were headed to the airport to see
the list for themselves, unable to take his word for it.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency carried a statement from
President Hosni Mubarak in which he expressed his ``deepest sadness
and greatest condolences to all the families of the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday night, early editions of Monday's Egyptian
dailies posed their own questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery surrounds the reason why the Egyptian airplane fell in
the Atlantic,'' said the Al-Wafd newspaper. Noting that there were
reports of fog in the region of the crash, similar to the Kennedy
crash, one headline stated: ``The curse of the Kennedy family is
chasing Egyptian airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash touched the top classes of Egyptian society. A
well-known industrialist, who headed a company of 1,500 employees,
was reported to have died. The daughter of a prominent college
professor was killed, leaving her father to pepper airport staff
with questions about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir officials said there were more than 60 Egyptians on
board the flight, which originated in Los Angeles and was bound for
Cairo via New York. Most of the rest were likely Americans and
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, fighting back tears for the 31-year-old cousin he said
was like a little brother, said he did not fault the airline for
the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it was more sophisticated and more organized than this,
but we are a developing country. I'm not going to compare it to
America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His cousin, Suleiman, had come to him two weeks before, excited
about his first visit to the United States and asking for
recommendations on what to see and where to shop. Suleiman was
among a group of Egyptian officers receiving training in the
northeast United States. Just days before, his wife Safa gave birth
to their second child.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will raise her kids until they become adults. We do not
believe in second marriages. Especially when you marry someone you
love, you cannot forget him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim tradition dictates that funerals be held within hours
after death, but that would not be possible for Suleiman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a big part of the sadness, that we are not able to
have the body, to see the body,'' Ahmed said.
</P>

 HOW CERENT BUILT A LITTLE BLACK BOX WORTH $8 BILLION  &HT;     By PETER KUPFER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At lunchtime on August 26, the employees of
Cerent Corp., a little-known technology startup in Petaluma, were
summoned to the banquet room of the Doubletree Hotel in Rohnert
Park for a staff meeting. Carl Russo, Cerent's dashing 42-year-old
chief executive, wasted no time announcing the purpose of the
gathering: Cisco Systems, the San Jose data networking juggernaut,
had agreed to buy Cerent in a stock swap now worth a staggering $8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Cisco was buying Cerent (pronounced SAYR-ent) was
hardly earthshaking. A famously acquisitive corporation, Cisco has
devoured scores of companies in the past few years in a relentless
drive to maintain its worldwide dominance in supplying the
equipment that steers data between computers _ the routers and
switches that comprise the backbone of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   What was surprising is the price tag. The Cerent deal _ which is
expected to close today _ dwarfs Cisco's largest previous
acquisition, the $4.4 billion takeover of StrataCom in 1996, and is
believed to be the largest sum ever paid for a privately owned
technology company. The deal transformed Cerent's top executives
into millionaires many times over and enriched even the company's
most junior employees by hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   How did an obscure 2-1/2-year-old outfit with fewer than 300
employees, revenues of $10 million and nonexistent profits suddenly
become more valuable than such venerable American companies as
Delta Air Lines, Occidental Petroleum, Archer Daniels Midland or
Dow Jones &AMP; Co.?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in a black box the size of a microwave oven.
That box, packed with hundreds of computer chips, is designed to
enable telecommunications companies to dramatically increase the
efficiency of their networks to accommodate the explosive growth of
data traffic generated by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Cerent's technology, industry insiders say, is
that it allows telecommunications service providers to ramp up the
capacity, or bandwidth, of their fiber-optic networks without
having to replace existing infrastructure. Cerent's
``plug-and-play'' box can be installed in hours, and it can be
reconfigured with the click of a mouse rather than a forklift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cerent solved the problem of converging voice networks and
data networks,'' said Wayne Price, chief technology officer for
Williams Communications of Tulsa, Okla., which operates a
nationwide fiber-optic network and is one of Cerent's biggest
customers. ``Their box is smaller, more flexible and cheaper to
manufacture (than other platforms). They were able to build a
better mousetrap.''
</P>
<P>
   What really sold Price on Cerent's box was how easy it is to
install. ``I see a lot of slide shows from a lot of companies, and
I get a little skeptical about the claims these startups make,'' he
said. ``But Cerent was different. They shipped us their box within
a few days, without sending an engineer to baby-sit. My lab guys
were able to get it hooked up in two hours. That's an unheard of
scenario in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerent's better mousetrap was the brainchild of Vinod Khosla, a
partner in the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers. In 1996, Khosla concluded that
the accelerating convergence of data and voice networks would
create lucrative opportunities for companies that could supply the
equipment to ease the bottlenecks between the two networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecom networks used to change something like 5 percent a
year,'' Khosla said. ``In today's world, they are starting to
change 5 percent a month, even 5 percent a week. So none of the old
paradigms really work. Cerent's box is designed for this more
responsive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed by $8 million in seed money from Kleiner Perkins, Khosla
hired a team of engineers to begin developing the prototype for
Cerent's next-generation optical networking equipment. Khosla, the
chairman of Cerent's board, served as the fledgling firm's acting
CEO until he hired Russo to replace him in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The first Cerent 454, as the box is called, shipped in September
1998, and it quickly became clear that the company had a winner.
``It absolutely took off,'' Khosla recalls. ``We had 70 customers
within the first six months. The run rate (revenues) was four times
more than what we had planned. It was complete customer
validation.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many high-tech startups that attempt to drum up as much
hype as possible in the hope of attracting a wealthy suitor, Cerent
went out of its way to keep a low profile. One reason for the
``stealth mode,'' said Russo, was to keep management focused on the
business rather than contemplating intoxicating takeover bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Startups tend to be very high-strung,'' he said. ``People have
fairy dances of instant wealth. We felt a takeover entr &LR; e &LR; e was
basically a distraction _ it would take people away from the
business of building the company.''
</P>
<P>
   That seriousness of purpose impressed Price. ``It was obvious to
me that these guys were building a company and not just trying to
cash in on the Internet hype to get rich,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, within weeks of the product launch, Russo received
a call from Mike Volpi, vice president of business development for
Cisco. That was the beginning of an ongoing &LR;   &LR; dialogue between the
two companies that resulted in Cisco investing $13 million _ an 8.8
percent stake _ in Cerent last November.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were casual discussions about the possibility of
Cisco buying Cerent outright, Russo said, it wasn't until Cerent
filed papers in mid-July declaring its intention to go public that
Cisco made a serious overture.
</P>
<P>
   On August 11, Volpi met Russo, who was returning from a business
trip, at the Red Carpet Club at San Francisco Airport. According to
Russo, Volpi proposed a purchase price for Cerent that was
substantially higher than the $4.4 billion Cisco had paid for
StrataCom.
</P>
<P>
   But Russo wasn't impressed. In view of the lofty valuations
other networking equipment makers were receiving in the stock
market _ Juniper Networks of Mountain View, another company dreamed
up by Khosla and his team, went public in June and saw its market
capitalization rocket to more than $10 billion _ Russo told Volpi
that a price of $7 billion to $8 billion would be more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Russo drove down to San Jose to have lunch with
John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive. Chambers offered Russo 100
million shares of Cisco stock _ or about $7.3 billion based on
Cisco's share price that day _ for the keys to Cerent's box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to me that that was their ceiling,'' said Russo.
``The thought went through my head that many people have overplayed
their hands, and I didn't want to overplay mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied with the financial terms, Russo moved the discussion
to the status of Cerent's workforce. ``I was concerned that we were
on the same wavelength about people. If we weren't, that would kill
the deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that in many takeovers, employees of the acquired company
``fly out of there like they're on a lazy Susan,'' Russo insisted
there be no layoffs, changes in title or reassignments for two
years for any Cerent worker without his and Chambers' written
consent. When the Cisco chief agreed to the unusual arrangement,
the deal was all but done.
</P>
<P>
   Russo worked out the details of the agreement with Volpi over
the weekend and presented it to his management team and board of
directors early the following week. After the euphoria died down,
Russo said, the decision to sell was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we believed that Cisco would help us
grow faster rather than slow us down _ that we would be able to win
more customers, win more market share and do more of the things we
wanted to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From Cisco's perspective, the acquisition of Cerent makes
perfect sense. The company, which has long been synonymous with the
infrastructure of the Internet, is aggressively competing with
companies such as Nortel Networks and Lucent Technologies in
courting traditional telecommunications companies such as Sprint
and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Ammar Hanafi, director of business development for Cisco, who
helped orchestrate the Cerent deal, said he has no regrets about
the 10-figure purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought they (Cerent) had a compelling solution for our
customers,'' Hanafi said. ``I think this deal will absolutely pay
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the $225 billion market for telecommunications
equipment is projected to grow by 50 percent a year, industry
analysts tend to agree with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a slam-dunk for Cisco,'' said Laurie Gooding, an
analyst at Cahners In-Stat Group. ``It's a very strategic
investment. They are taking a big slice out of every piece of the
networking pie. When they don't have the expertise, they acquire
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strongest validation of Cisco's strategy came
October 25, when Sycamore Networks, a Massachusetts startup that
makes optical networking equipment similar to Cerent's, went
public. Sycamore's shares surged to five times their initial
offering price, making it one of the most successful IPOs in
history and giving the company an astonishing $14.4 billion market
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Russo, who personally holds a 5.2 percent stake in Cerent and
stands to pocket more than $400 million as a result of the sale,
said he has mixed feelings about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously an enormous amount of money, but the flip side
is that you are giving up something that you poured your heart and
soul into,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deal was announced, Russo said, surprisingly little
has changed inside the sleek, modern office building that Cerent
occupies off Interstate 101. ``I'm amazed at the focus of the
company,'' he said. ``Everybody's got their heads down. I've seen a
couple of new BMWs in the parking lot, but that's about it.''

 CLICK AND LEARN ON THE WEB  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As online enterprises continue to invade almost
every business niche, one of the latest hot spots is business
training.
</P>
<P>
   Today (Nov. 1), Headlight.com publicly launches its Web site,
with more than 1,000 online training courses.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco startup is targeting the millions of small and
medium-size businesses that know skilled employees are essential
for success but often are loathe to spend the time or expense to
send employees to off-site training courses that might last a day
and cost $500.
</P>
<P>
   Headlight.com is not the only company to build a library of
training courses and deliver them via the Internet. Two weeks ago,
Click2learn, a Bellevue, Wash., company financed by Microsoft
co-founder Paul Allen and previously named Asymetrix Learning
Systems, launched its own learning portal. The company's Web site,
www.click2learn.com, offers a conduit to a full range of
Web-delivered courses for businesses of all sizes and also lets
them publish their own online courses.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate training is a big market. The percentage of skilled
workers in the U.S. workforce is rising from 45 percent in 1991 to
65 percent next year, according to International Data Corp. The
corporate training market, both schools and on-site study, is a $60
billion business.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet portion is relatively small _ &LR;   &LR; just $500 million
last year. But like everything online, it is growing fast. IDC
predicts that it will hit $7 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Headlight.com aims to provide cheaper, easier online training
programs for companies with fewer than 999 employees. These
businesses account for about 60 percent of the workforce and more
than 90 percent of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can deliver courses in 50 percent of the time it takes in a
classroom,'' said Headlight.com CEO Peter Mellen. ``The courses are
75 percent to 90 percent cheaper than classroom courses, and the
completion and retention rates are as good.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web site, &LR;   &LR; www.headlight.com, offers hundreds of
online courses from leading publishers such as NETg, Spire, KT
Solutions and Skillsoft. Topics range from high-tech Microsoft
Excel and Java programming language to low-tech subjects like
writing a business plan and managing a project.
</P>
<P>
   Because training is available anywhere, anytime, from any
computer or Internet connection, courses can be taken at home or at
work, during the day, night or weekends. In other words, they don't
have to interfere with ``real'' work.
</P>
<P>
   Because all learners don't start at the same point or learn at
the same pace, Headlight.com offers up to a dozen different courses
in each topic area. Customers can choose courses by price ($25 to
$149), by publisher or by functions, and from simple text (for slow
modems) to multimedia presentations (for fast PC connections).
</P>
<P>
   Assessment tools let learners pinpoint their strengths and
weaknesses and allow their bosses to monitor their progress.
</P>
<P>
   Headlight.com was founded in June 1998 by former Internet
consultant Mellen, 32, and former Arthur Anderson consultant Scott
Mitic, 29. It has lined up more than $10 million in financing from
venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is to be made in sending employees to a learning portal
instead of spending $600 to send them to a seminar or classroom,''
said Brandon Hall, editor of Multimedia &AMP; Internet Training
newsletter in Sunnyvale.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Headlight.com and Click2learn, Hall notes that
San Francisco's Hungry Minds (www.hungryminds.com) includes
business-training courses among its broad curriculum of adult
education courses &LR; , which range from astronomy to screen writing &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge Universe (www.knowedgeu.com), the Redwood City
lifelong learning venture owned by financiers Michael and Lowell
Milken and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, also has an interest in
on-the-job training.

STUDENTS HELP NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS RESCUE PCS FROM POSSIBLE  Y2K
SNAFUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ It was late on a Friday afternoon, when most students
had already kicked back for the weekend. Yet the Y2K Squad was
still on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean, this one's going to need a BIOS fix,`` said squad member
Tuan Mai, 17, keeping a steady gaze trained on the computer screen
as he ran a diagnostic program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one, too,'' said squad captain Sean Sharma, 16, as he
sorted through a maze of wires connecting a printer to an adjacent
computer.
</P>
<P>
   A few mouse clicks later and the Y2K Squad from San Jose's Oak
Grove High School had rescued yet another nonprofit organization
from potential Year 2000 computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   The work isn't glamorous and the squad members don't have any
special powers that allow them to see through computer casings. But
they do have their own special '`Y2K Squad'' shirts.
</P>
<P>
   And more importantly, they are heroes to the nonprofit
organizations, which, according to Y2K experts, are generally in
dire need of help preparing for possible computer snafus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This helps us out a whole lot,'' said appreciative Marc
Hunter, interim office manager for San Jose's San Juan Bautista
Child Development Center, during a visit by the Y2K Squad.
</P>
<P>
   The squad is comprised of about 10 advanced computer class
students at Oak Grove who have donated after-school hours to help
more than 40 South Bay nonprofit organizations so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a public service,'' said Dennis Barbata, the school's
technology coordinator. ``We don't receive any money, we don't ask
for a donation, although if one were to come about, that would be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbata formed the squad earlier this year to go out and tackle
the Y2K problem, a programming shortcut that could cause some
computer software and microchips to misread the year 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. corporations and government agencies have pumped billions
of dollars and countless hours of staff time into attacking the
problem, but the estimated 1 million nonprofit groups in the
country often don't have the same resources. One survey taken late
last year showed 40 percent of nonprofit groups had yet to start
Y2K work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person in charge of technology at a nonprofit is often
just the person who knows the most about computers,'' said Jennifer
Beckett, senior program manager for the CompuMentor Project, a San
Francisco group that provides computer help for schools and
nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   CompuMentor, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard held a Y2K Mentor Day
on October 23 to match nonprofit groups in San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties (California) with volunteers to help with Y2K
assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, CompuMentor has logged 20,000 downloads of its own
Y2K self-help workbook for nonprofits, available in English,
Spanish and Portuguese at www.compumentor.org. But a recent survey
showed about 30 percent still had not used the workbook.
</P>
<P>
   So, Beckett said, there's plenty of work to be done by
volunteers like the Y2K Squad, especially with only two months left
before the date change.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Napa high school last year briefly formed a Y2K SWAT
team, Barbata's Oak Grove squad appears to be the only one of its
kind currently active in the Bay Area. He decided earlier this year
that his Silicon Valley school's special Information Technology
Pathway curriculum, which has an enrollment of about 250 of the
school's 2,700 students, was in a perfect position to help.
</P>
<P>
   IDG Books Worldwide sponsored the squad, providing the special
Y2K shirts and intense workshop training by Y2K help book authors
K.C. Bourne and Dean Sims.
</P>
<P>
   Symantec Corp. armed the squad with its Norton 2000 software,
which diagnoses and fixes problems in computer systems and lists
software programs that could have problems.
</P>
<P>
   The team also uses a program from WRQ Inc. of Seattle for
computers that don't have CD-ROM drives.
</P>
<P>
   The team doesn't go in and fix the software, but gives the
organization a printout listing programs like spreadsheets and
databases that could fail or misread dates. The squad suggests
patches and other fixes for the software that are most critical to
the organization, such as a spreadsheet program that tracks grant
application dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're just printing letters, it doesn't matter if the
computer thinks it's 1900,'' Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosing computers for Y2K problems is time-consuming,
especially if a nonprofit group has an office full of desktops.
Sharma said the average squad call takes about 90 minutes, but said
one place had 150 computers, which kept squad members busy over the
course of three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the original 30-person squad lost about 20 graduating
seniors, the Y2K Squad has more than enough work to do before the
end of the year _ and about 15 nonprofit groups are still on the
waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma, who is also earning stock options working as a part-time
Web designer at a local Internet startup, believes there will be
jobs waiting for the squad members after the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't believe the Y2K problem will be disastrous for
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paranoia is going to be worse than the actual problem,''
Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think there's going to be no more than a week of
problems.''
</P>
<P>

 MICROSOFT UNITES WITH MUSICMATCH  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft Corp., in a move to bolster its
challenge to Internet audio and video leader RealNetworks Inc.,
today (Nov. 1) will announce a marketing and development
partnership with MusicMatch Inc., maker of one of the most popular
digital MP3 music-jukebox programs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., will ship the MusicMatch
Jukebox software as part of a new Windows 98 Second Edition upgrade
CD-ROM  &LR; due out  &LR; later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, MusicMatch of San Diego will collaborate with Microsoft to
develop future digital audio and video products using both
MusicMatch and Microsoft's Windows Media technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest in a series of major marketing
partnerships that MusicMatch has put together with technology
companies _ most notably computer-makers Hewlett-Packard Co. and
Dell Computer Corp. _ to ship its MP3 music program with new
desktops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hot space now,'' said MusicMatch CEO Dennis Mudd.
``I think a lot of bigger-name companies in the world are seeing
this as a great opportunity and are getting involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also creates an alliance between Microsoft and MusicMatch
against a mutual rival, RealNetworks, known for its software which
allows Internet users to play streaming audio and video. A recent
study by research firm Dataquest showed that RealNetworks still has
a sizable lead, with 70 million downloads of its RealPlayer
software, compared to about 40 million for Microsoft's competing
Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetwork's RealJukebox software, meanwhile, is in a tight
race with MusicMatch in the small but emerging consumer market for
programs that play and organize digital music files on a personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   MusicMatch announced last week that it switched its base
technology to one made by the German firm Fraunhofer, which
originally developed the MP3 format for compressing audio files. &LR; 
In making the switch, MusicMatch dumped its old code developed by
Xing Technologies, which earlier this year was bought by
RealNetworks.

CELLULAR PHONE USERS SAY SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA IS FULL OF
DEAD  ZONES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Based on a thoroughly unscientific survey of
Chronicle readers' experiences with cellular phone service in the
Bay Area, one conclusion is inescapable: Coverage-wise, the Bay
Area has more holes than the plot of a bad novel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, asking people to comment on cell phone ``black
holes'' _ areas where you can't make a connection or calls get
dropped _ is like inviting Muni riders to share their feelings
about everyone's favorite transit system. It's almost too easy.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture that emerges from such a survey, with more than
200 readers responding by e-mail, is one of a region riddled with
cell-phone dead zones.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is so far-reaching that, for many people, the
daily commute from home to the office is nothing less than an
obstacle course of static and lost calls.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single wireless carrier is immune to the snafus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am continually frustrated and amazed by the numerous dead
service zones which exist in the Bay Area, particularly since more
than 7 million people live here and there is an enormous amount of
business conducted on cell phones in California,'' said Tama
Donaldson, echoing the sentiments of many others.
</P>
<P>
   She said her Sprint PCS connection snaps like a twig whenever
she's on the western span of the Bay Bridge, traveling virtually
anywhere on Interstate 80 in the East Bay, passing through large
swaths of Marin County, or at any point on Interstate 5 between
Davis and the Oregon border.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gillette said his GTE Wireless service goes kerblooey
along stretches of Grizzly Peak, in large parts of Berkeley and
Walnut Creek, and just about everywhere in Orinda and Lafayette.
``In short, it doesn't work anywhere I happen to be and want to use
it,'' he lamented.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what I am experiencing is anything like what others are
experiencing, then I think the wireless revolution is more like a
`pig in a poke' and we are all being scammed by phone companies
that cannot deliver on what they have promised,'' Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, he's correct. When signing up for wireless service
with just about any carrier, customers will be shown a map
depicting sprawling areas of seemingly uninterrupted coverage.
There is generally no mention of holes or gaps, even though the San
Francisco Bay Area is notorious for spotty service.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless calls essentially use radio technology. The trick to
clear, hassle-free connections is for users to remain within ``line
of sight'' of antennas.
</P>
<P>
   In a region famous for its spectacularly diverse landscape, that
isn't always easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In engineering, the greater Bay Area is considered one of the
most challenging terrains in the country,'' said Mirjana
Cvjeticanin, local general manager of Nextel. ``We have mountains
and valleys, are surrounded by water, and have dense urban areas
with tall buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's practically inevitable that some areas, if
not whole communities, will skirt the line of sight of antennas.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the very nature of wireless, I don't believe that in the
next few years, if ever, that every nook and cranny is going to be
covered,'' Cvjeticanin admitted.
</P>
<P>
   This won't come as good news to Nextel subscriber Dave Andersen,
who struggled recently to contact employees of his construction
firm at a location in upscale Atherton.
</P>
<P>
   To make a halfway clear connection, he said, the workers had
``to walk around the client's backyard like a poodle with a bladder
infection, trying to find the magical location to pick up a
signal.''
</P>
<P>
   While sections of Interstate 280 on the Peninsula, and 80 and
880 in the East Bay, drew plenty of heat for intermittent black
holes _ and don't even get people started on the Caldecott and
Waldo tunnels _ perhaps no single piece of Bay Area turf is as
prone to cell-phone mishaps as the city of Alameda.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the volume of e-mail from the area would
suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure there is a bubble of some sort, sitting over
part of Ballena Isle (in Alameda) right around the marina, that
reflects any and all cell signals,'' theorized Bill Smith. ``At any
rate, my Sprint PCS is worthless at home.''
</P>
<P>
   On Alameda's Bay Farm Island, GTE subscriber Donna McDonald
noted that during a recent power outage, few if any local residents
were able to use their cell phones inside their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very funny to see a lot of my neighbors walking around
out in front of our townhouse (myself included) trying to get some
reception,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Bay Farm, Randy Phillips experimented with GTE and
Sprint, and found his calls routinely being cut off on both
services while at home and traveling around the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little incentive for wireless companies to improve
the situation, as it's a mostly residential area,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. While it's true that every wireless carrier
has to prioritize in allocating resources for new cell sites, and
that busy commercial zones will figure more prominently on to-do
lists than sleepy residential communities, each company is finding
that it's no easy task to win approval from local city councils and
zoning commissions for new antenna arrays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some areas that are challenging to cover because
it's challenging to put up a cell site,'' said Erin Eggleton, a
spokeswoman for Cellular One. ``It took us 10 years just to get
approval to put up a site in the Presidio.''
</P>
<P>
   Wireless signals aren't frazzled only by hills and mountains.
They also can be cut off by reinforced buildings and even heavy
foliage on trees. One quick fix for areas with chronic troubles is
installation of a gadget called a ``repeater,'' which boosts the
cell signal within a limited radius.
</P>
<P>
   However, repeaters don't add more capacity, so they're of little
value in high-traffic areas or situations where numerous cell phone
users congregate in one place, such as a ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to completely fill in a gap in coverage is to erect
a new antenna in the area _ or to piggy-back on someone else's
antenna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to find an existing tower or an existing
building,'' said John Boyer, Pacific Coast network director for GTE
Wireless. ``A new tower is a last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   In communities that are reluctant to grant zoning approval for
multiple towers, as many as five different carriers may share a
single facility.
</P>
<P>
   And in municipalities with even greater sensitivity to
industrial intrusions, wireless carriers are taking the innovative
step of disguising antennas as trees or hiding them within church
steeples.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we continue to move forward, locations are driving us
deeper into residential neighborhoods,'' said Boyer. ``We have to
use every trick in our toolbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of tricks, Alison Bronstein had some spleen to vent
regarding the PCS voice mail service provided by Pacific Bell.
Turns out, she found, there was one small catch: ``You can only
access the voice mail via the cell phone . . . a tricky little
feature that the wireless people added to ensure we keep using
their cell phone and using up our `free' minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there are huge areas/times when I'm unable to use the
&AMP;$!&AMP; cell phone because of their &AMP;&AMP; &LR;  inadequate coverage, I am
unable to retrieve messages _ or even find out if I HAVE messages _
unless I get back in my car and drive for five minutes to an area
where, hopefully, the service will be adequate to allow me to check
for message and actually hear them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most readers were very, very specific in detailing locations of
cell phone black holes: the corner of Chestnut and Larkin streets
in San Francisco, for example, or the Alameda del Prado exit of
Highway 101 in Novato.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellular One subscriber Bill Clyde gets the prize for his
observation that service is especially sporadic on holes 14, 15, 16
and 17 of Sharp Park Golf Course in Pacifica. Important calls
clearly should be confined to the front nine only.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens when disgruntled customers make their feelings
known to the various wireless providers? Judging by the e-mail
received, it isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy D'Amico said she contacted Cellular One to complain about
the Twilight Zone of service in Alameda. ``They basically said,
`Too bad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Finley was trying to be helpful in informing Sprint about
coverage gaps in Berkeley and Oakland. ``Each time they claim to
open a file and promise to get back to me; to date I have had no
response _ no information, no explanation for the delay, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Melcher said he's been getting the runaround from GTE for
more than five years. ``Usually when I call customer service, I am
on hold so long that if I can get the call to go through when I
leave work, or place it when I leave from home to work, I either
get to my destination before I talk to anyone, or I get dropped due
to poor coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jim Wiltschko wanted Cellular One to know about a dead zone
along Highway 1 in Pacifica. ``I've called them repeatedly over the
last two years and their answer is to try to sell me a new phone.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, spokesmen for the various wireless carriers
expressed shock that their customer service representatives might
be anything but Johnny-on-the-spot when handling reports of
coverage problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint spokeswoman Heidi Swanson was the only one to admit that
service reps for all carriers are trained primarily to handle
billing inquiries or activation of phones, and thus may come up
short when addressing more technical matters.
</P>
<P>
   If so, this is a significant lapse in light of the fact that a
recent survey by market researcher Telephia found that 63 percent
of respondents feel that being able to complete calls without being
cut off is the most important consideration when selecting a
wireless provider.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of approximately 3,000 Bay Area cell phone users also
found that an extensive local coverage area without holes is
another top consideration for most respondents.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it appears that The Chronicle's more informal
sampling of public opinion may have been skewed toward the
sentiments of a vocal minority.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Telephia survey, roughly 25 percent of local
Cellular One, GTE, Pacific Bell, Sprint and Nextel customers
describe themselves as being ``extremely satisfied'' with their
level of service. Only about 5 percent say they're ``extremely
dissatisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Christoforou, Telephia's vice president of network
performance measurement, noted that levels of satisfaction vary
with the amount of time one uses a cell phone. Heavier users _
i.e., the ones more likely to experience black holes or dropped
calls _ tend to be significantly less contented than those who use
their phones only for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   As for the wireless carriers' insistence that the Bay Area's
unusual topography virtually guarantees gaps in coverage,
Christoforou could only smile and shake his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The geography around the bay is quite tough,'' he said. ``But
there's nothing that money can't solve. There are solutions for
every problem.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason that providers may not be investing in $10,000
repeaters around every corner or cutting checks for about $500,000
to erect a new antenna is because they may not have faith that
current technological standards will be around for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Christoforou said a mishmash of competing standards now
characterizes the U.S. wireless market (as opposed to more unified
standards in Europe and Asia), but American carriers are gearing up
for next-generation technology called ``3G'' that would allow
seamless roaming between multiple networks.
   He speculated that because today's repeaters likely would not be
compatible with tomorrow's 3G system, companies may not be feeling
a great sense of urgency to fill in existing holes in coverage.
</P>
<P>
   That surely wouldn't sit well with Phil Albert, whose Sprint
connection has proved of marginal value at his home in (of course)
Alameda, as well as ``anywhere else a cell phone might be needed
reliably.''
</P>
<P>
   As Albert, speaking for numerous other Bay Area cell phone
users, put it, ``My most common expression while talking on the
phone is, `Are you still there?' '

ODD OCTOBER LEAVES NO TEAM CLEARLY AT TOP OF THE HEAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say goodbye to October. With five Saturdays, this was a long
month for college football. Perhaps that explains the wild and
wacky happenings.
</P>
<P>
   Games were postponed by hurricanes and blown transformers. The
leading Heisman Trophy candidate fell out of the race because he
didn't want to pay list price. A father earned his 300th career
victory by coaching a game against his son. And Texas beat Nebraska
(oops, sorry, 'Huskers fans; that's not that odd an occurrence
anymore.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because the season is in its dog days, the middle of
the schedule where teams tend to lose focus, where players start
looking to the end of the schedule and The Big Game. Whatever the
reason, the nation's top teams lately have masqueraded as
pretenders.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State appears interested only in playing the second
half. Penn State keeps playing as if it's missing brain cells.
Virginia Tech is starting to play as if it is believing its press
clippings. Florida, which is in the national championship hunt,
beat Georgia on Saturday without a single passing yard in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Florida State spent most of the month getting off the
ground, dusting itself off and regrouping at halftime. Not that
they're not good at it. But Florida State has been far from
dominating. Saturday night, they trailed at Virginia, 10-7, before
scoring 28 second-half points.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the half, I would have never felt we'd beat them by the
score we did,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said. ``We were
fighting for our life.''
</P>
<P>
   In their last four games _ Miami, Wake Forest, Clemson and
Virginia _ the Seminoles have been tied 21-21, leading 9-3,
trailing 14-3 and trailing 10-7 at the half. In the second halves
of those games, Florida State has outscored those four teams by a
combined 69-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be a close game going into the
fourth quarter,'' Virginia coach George Welsh said. ``They don't
have the depth they've had in other years. They have a pretty good
knack of turning it up a notch in the second half, taking over the
game on defense to enable their offense to get going. And they did
it again tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Penalties have been a seasonlong problem for second-ranked Penn
State. While the Nittany Lions had just six penalties for 65 yards
Saturday, they countered that by throwing three interceptions. Penn
State scored 20 second-half points to put away stubborn Illinois,
27-7.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, Penn State has committed 60 penalties compared
with 45 for their opponents. And, despite a dominating defense, the
Nittany Lions have committed more turnovers (30) than they have
forced (29).
</P>
<P>
   No wonder then, that Penn State coach Joe Paterno has spent a
good part of the season wailing about his team's brain-dead play.
</P>
<P>
   And while the nation's top two teams were struggling, Virginia
Tech failed to make a significant move. The Hokies had a 27-7
halftime lead but failed to score a knockout of Pitt. Their final
points came on a 52-yard field goal _ which was 5 yards longer than
it should have been. Virginia Tech was penalized for delay of game
when it had just 10 players on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be lots of things we'll take from this game to work
on,'' Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer said.
</P>
<P>
   And this seems like a good time to remind college football fans
that last year's national championship game was not a thing of
beauty. Tennessee had not played in nearly a month, Florida State
had not played in six weeks. The teams combined for 21 penalties,
four interceptions and seven fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which teams survive this season to play for the
national title in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4, plan on this: Neither
team is likely to bring its A game. Let's just assume that this
ragged midseason play is getting us accustomed to what will happen
when two teams try to shake off at least four weeks of rust in New
Orleans.

AIRLINE'S SAFETY RECORD IS MARRED BY SECURITY PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS to ``EgyptAir'' in first 5 grafs as well as 10th and 11th
grafs) (ms) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The EgyptAir Boeing 767 that crashed Sunday morning
was a relatively new model with a good safety record, operated by
an airline with extensive international experience and relatively
few operational problems, but with some horrible security failures.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was delivered new to EgyptAir almost exactly 10 years
ago, on Sept. 26, 1989, and had completed about 6,900 flights,
covering about 30,000 flight hours since then _ about normal for a
long-range plane of that age. Including the plane that crashed,
EgyptAir operated five 767s. The plane that crashed was one of its
two extended-range 767-300s, the newest version produced by Boeing;
it could fly 7,080 miles nonstop, putting Cairo well within range
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir is one of the world's oldest airlines, tracing its
operations back to 1933. Owned by the government and a candidate
for privatization under a new policy of economic liberalization, it
flies to approximately 70 cities around the world, with an icon of
the pharaonic god Horus adorning each airplane's tail. In the
1970s, when Egypt was allied with the Soviet Union, it acquired a
fleet of Ilyushins and other Russian jets; now it flies Boeings and
Airbuses. The airline said its planes are an average of six years
old, which would make it one of the youngest fleets in the
industry. Some of the aircrafts boast television screens in each
seat's armrest.
</P>
<P>
   But EgyptAir has frequently been a target of hijackers, most
recently on Oct. 20, when a passenger kicked in the cockpit door on
a flight from Istanbul to Cairo and forced the crew to fly to
Hamburg. All aboard were released without injury. In November,
1985, a Boeing 737 was taken over by hijackers on a flight from
Athens to Cairo. The hijackers shot five passengers, and Egyptian
commandos stormed the plane in Malta, where 56 more were killed.
</P>
<P>
   One month earlier, an EgyptAir 737 was carrying the hijackers of
the ocean liner Achille Lauro when it was intercepted by American
fighter jets and forced to land in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a twin-engine jet with two aisles, seats seven
abreast in economy class. The model has become popular with
airlines for trans-Atlantic flights, replacing older planes, partly
because it has a lower operating cost than older models.
</P>
<P>
   The 767 has a generally good operating record. One owned by
Lauda, an Austrian airline, crashed in the jungle near Bangkok,
Thailand, in May, 1991, killing all 223 people aboard.
Investigators found that a thrust reverser, a device usually used
on the runway shortly after landing to redirect the jet exhaust and
slow the plane, had deployed during the flight.
</P>
<P>
   According to one Web site that tracks airplanes, the plane that
crashed today came off the assembly line at the Boeing plant in
Seattle immediately before the Lauda plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 767 is covered by a variety of ``airworthiness
directives,'' or orders from the Federal Aviation Administration to
inspect or fix certain parts, because of crashes on other
airplanes. Among these are inspections of fuel tank wiring required
after the explosion of TWA 800, which was a Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference between the EgyptAir flight and TWA 800 could
be the flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders. The ones
on TWA 800 stopped at the beginning of the event, apparently
because of a complete loss of electrical power. But the EgyptAir
plane had electrical power for at least 36 more seconds, with its
transponder continuing to function, and thus its recorders may have
continued.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, as a later vintage airplane _ about 15 years
younger than TWA 800 _ the EgyptAir 767s flight data recorder might
have captured more information. Boeing was not able to say Sunday
evening, however, what it equipped the plane with when it was
delivered.

   Got the shakes for some lip balm? Try the Chap Stick Addicts
support group on sixdegrees.com.
</P>
<P>
   The group had about 250 active members at last count, and is
adding more every day _ from a high school student who says she
can't concentrate without her balm to another who can't walk into a
dime store without buying a new stick.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of ChapStick as addictive product came as news to the
folks at Whitehall-Robins, the American Home Products unit that
makes ChapStick. ``It's certainly not addictive _ it's a petroleum
product for lips,'' said Carol Dornbush, a spokeswoman for the
company, based in Madison, N.J. ``I guess we have a lot of loyal
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that, however, to the several dozen people who took
to the site last week to discuss their habit, or any regular at Lip
Balm Anonymous, an unrelated site (www.kevdo.com/lipbalm) whose
stated purpose is to ``stay free from lip balm and to help others
achieve the same freedom.'' The premise of those who see a
potential for addiction is that lip balms eventually dry out the
lips, forcing the user to apply more.
</P>
<P>
   Chap Stick Addicts is only one of 15,000 discussion groups on
sixdegrees.com, an advertising-supported site that states that it
was ``inspired'' by the theory that every person in the world is
connected to every other person through no more than six
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The site appears to have a struck a chord: More than 6,000 new
members sign up every day, each apparently interested in chatting
with people of similar interests. A spokeswoman for the company,
Rebecca Tompkins, partly attributes the popularity of the ChapStick
group to its being featured in the site's theme of the week section
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sixdegrees site's astounding growth results from an
innovative, though perhaps irritating, process: Anybody who
registers must supply the names and e-mail addresses of three
friends; the company then invites them to become members. Nearly a
third of those people who receive invitations register for the
service. Members can request to meet only those people who are
direct friends of their friends, or just anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Now, pass the ChapStick.

   Revamped Britannica Site Is Swamped by Demand
</P>
<P>
   The maiden voyage of the free Internet-based version of
Encyclopaedia Britannica is shaping up like the Encyclopaedia
Titanica.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, Britannica opened a revamped version of its Web
site, Britannica.com, offering free access to the entire contents
of the encyclopedia. Trouble is, the company was unprepared for the
influx of traffic, which promptly caused the site to crash.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks later, the site still is not up, and it is not
expected to be accessible until at least the middle of this week
until the company increases its computer capacity. Instead of
seeing encyclopedia content, site visitors last week were met with
a note from Don Yannias, chief executive of Britannica Inc., which
is based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were simply unable to handle the demand,'' he wrote, adding
that reaching sufficient capacity ``is a big job but we're
committed to getting there as fast as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, even that letter of explanation was removed, replaced
by a notice that the site was ``Coming Soon.''
</P>
<P>
   How could Britannica be so unprepared, given that it is no Web
novice? The company has been online since 1994 with a fee-based
research service _ $5 a month before the recent remodeling _ and a
licensing program for educational organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In a manner of speaking, Britannica officials blame the
messengers. They said they had vastly underestimated the amount of
media coverage the site's revamping would create. The grand
reopening generated some 850 articles and Internet accounts
worldwide _ including front-page coverage in five of nine daily
newspapers in Britain, said Kent Devereaux, Britannica's senior
vice president for product development.
</P>
<P>
   Devereaux said that international visitors helped contribute to
levels of traffic that were ``orders of magnitude'' higher than the
hundreds of thousands of daily visitors the site was accustomed to.
He said late last week that the company still was not certain how
many visitors it had received and was analyzing the traffic data.
</P>

<P>
   Fine Art Flexibility
</P>
<P>
   So the corporate digs need spiffing up and you think some
original art sure would be nice over the reception desk, or in the
conference room. True, you could get some by-the-numbers original
oils, or an old master print _ but you want something with a bit
more class.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at today's art prices? Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Peck has heard that cry, and he plans to start a Web site,
fineartlease.com, that, as its name implies, leases original
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   The good stuff includes the likes of N.C. Wyeth, Chagall,
Hockney. Browse the site's gallery; if a painting grabs your fancy,
it can be had for as little as three months or as much as 10 years
_ at, say, roughly $1,400 a month for a painting valued at $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where so much is borrowed, why should art be any
different? Think of the tax deduction on those lease payments _
starting at 15 percent of the painting's value a year. Peck cites
the tax benefit as a big selling point.
</P>
<P>
   Browsing can be conducted by genre, period or size, fitting the
art to the room. If the design consultant wants an 18th-century
landscape, punch that in. If a 3-by-4-foot still life is called
for, search away.
</P>
<P>
   While the target market is a corporate clientele, individuals
may also apply. And there is even a lease-to-own option.
</P>
<P>
   Peck, who is 32, began as a junior cataloger at Sotheby's and
went on to run his own gallery. His new company will own some
artwork, but will mostly act as an agent for museums and galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums in this country,'' he said, ``hang 6 to 8 percent of
their permanent collection, and the rest sits unused. So for them,
it's found money.'' And they'll be insured _ a key part of the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Peck said he had about 50 galleries lined up and was close to
deals with various museums, which he expects to account for about a
third of his art.
</P>
<P>
   With this service, ``corporations can have a lot of flexibility
with their collections,'' he said. ``They can even sell their
collection to us and we can lease it back to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several corporations and law firms lined up,'' he
said, adding that law firms ``are very interested in this.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't surf the site expecting to lease something you just
saw at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Peck promised everything
from ``old masters through contemporary,'' but only the stuff
stored in the basement is available.

 (Repeating for all needing) 
UNDATED: on Saturday.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weather conditions did not appear to be a factor. Fog had
shrouded Kennedy Airport at the time of takeoff and through much of
the day Sunday, but there were no storms in the vicinity of the
crash, winds were light and visibility was 10 miles or more,
according to meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   It was equally unclear whether some mechanical failure on the
10-year-old jet, which had no history of major problems, or a human
error had contributed to the disaster, which ranked with a score of
crashes as being among the worst in aviation history. It was the
first crash in the 67-year history of EgyptAir, a state-run airline
that has 38 planes and flies to 85 cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   By daylight, four and a half hours after the crash, a small
armada of Coast Guard ships and planes were on station,
methodically searching a 36-square-mile region of ocean. Among
their first discoveries were a body and wreckage _ seats, seat
cushions, a wheel, clothing, life jackets, passports, two partly
inflated yellow life rafts and other small items that were not
identifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Through the day, five Coast Guard cutters and as many as 11
helicopters and airplanes joined the search, tracing routes worked
out by computer to maximize efficiency. Wreckage and bodies were to
be brought to the U.S. Naval Base in Newport, R.I., for
identification.
</P>
<P>
   A primary focus of the search was the wreckage of the plane
itself, and its black boxes _ the flight data and cockpit voice
recorders _ which hold a range of information, from speed and
altitude to the talk of pilots, and could prove invaluable in the
inquiry. The boxes have pingers that signal their location, but
equipment to detect the pings was not expected to be available
until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness forced the planes back to their bases Sunday night, but
the ships planned to continue their search for survivors through
the night, and full operations were to be resumed Monday. The USS
Grapple, the Norfolk, Va.-based Navy ship used to locate John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s doomed plane last July, was expected to join the
search Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board quickly took charge of
the inquiry, with the FBI, the Federal Aviation Administration, the
Coast Guard and other agencies in supporting roles in what was
expected to be an exhaustive investigation. The FBI, which had long
clung mistakenly to suspicions of a bomb in the TWA case, was
clearly taking a subordinate role, with rivalries that had marred
previous cooperative efforts put aside.
</P>
<P>
   At Kennedy Airport, federal investigators and officials of the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the
airport, quarantined trucks that had refueled EgyptAir 990, and
began questioning mechanics, ground crews, food handlers, customer
service personnel and anyone else who had come into contact with
the plane. Manifests of the passengers and crew were also being
examined.
</P>
<P>
   A wealth of paperwork that was not available Sunday _ data from
numerous radar tracking stations, for example _ was expected to be
in hand over the next few days to provide a much clearer picture of
the flight path, altitude and speed of the plane in its final
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the aircraft fell in international waters, Egyptian
officials might have taken charge, but they authorized the United
States on Sunday to conduct the many-sided investigation, which was
expected to unfold in New York, Cairo, Los Angeles and Newark, N.J.
_ all points where the plane had landed over the weekend _ as well
as in Boston, Newport, R.I., and Nantucket, where search-and-rescue
operations were being coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, grieving families and friends of the crash victims
gathered in Los Angeles, New York and Cairo to await news from
airline officials and to meet with chaplains and other counselors.
Many were sobbing in desperation over the loss of loved ones, while
others were angry or in denial, unable to make sense of a tragedy
that seemed to have no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, EgyptAir's chairman, Mohammed Fahim Rayan, said those
aboard the jetliner included 62 Egyptians, two Sudanese, three
Syrians and one Chilean. Of the others, many were believed to be
Americans or Egyptian-Americans. Three of the 15 crew members were
described as nonpaying EgyptAir employees.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston-based travel agency said the airplane was carrying 54
people, all over 50 years old and many from Colorado, Arizona and
the Pacific Northwest, who were heading for a 14-day tour of Egypt
and the Nile. Others were from New York, Connecticut, New Jersey
and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The airline did not release the names of the passengers or crew
members. But a Montreal daily newspaper, La Presse, announced that
its deputy publisher, Claude Masson, and his wife, Jeannine
Bourdages, both 58, were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton ordered American agencies to
coordinate efforts to investigate the crash and aid the families of
victims, for whom he expressed deep sympathy. ``Like all Americans,
Hillary and I are very saddened by the crash of the EgyptAir
flight,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York, Gov. George Pataki also voiced sympathy for the
families of the victims and ordered state agencies to provide them
with counseling and other assistance, and to cooperate with
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and federal officials in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani spent much of the day at the
Ramada Plaza Hotel near Kennedy Airport, helping Red Cross workers,
Muslim clerics and counselors to console the families of 16 victims
amid wrenching scenes of grief. ``It's horrible in there,'' said
Mahmoud Hamza, who lost two friends on the flight. ``Everybody's
crying, everybody's in mourning.''

By EDDIE SEFKO 
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
While Tiger Woods was all smiles after winning the Tour
Championship on Sunday, Payne Stewart was having a good laugh up
above.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all those days when Hal Sutton and others teased Stewart
about wearing ``that clown suit,'' as Sutton used to call it,
Stewart oversaw the payback during the final round at Champions
Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of golfers played the final round while paying
tribute to Stewart as they donned his trademark knickers and, in
some cases, wore tam-o'-shanters.
</P>
<P>
   Some looked natural and spiffy. Some looked like they should
never get close to knickers again. But the spirit of the idea was
grand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kidded Payne a lot about his knickers,'' Sutton said. ``Now,
I know he's up there saying, `OK, how do you feel now, fat boy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 29 players, all but six came to the practice range
wearing plus-fours. On the first tee, Vijay Singh relented and
tucked his long pants into his argyles for some makeshift knickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' Jeff Maggert said. ``I couldn't help thinking
about Payne all day and how he must have been laughing at all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, meanwhile, elected not to change his wardrobe, going for
navy slacks instead of cream knickers. Nothing changed about his
game, either. He won his third event in a row with a 2-under-par 69
for a 269 total and has won six of the last nine tournaments he has
entered. He owns seven official PGA Tour victories for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll have to let you in on a little secret,'' Woods
said after his victory. ``After I came off the West Coast swing (in
February), I told Butch (Harmon, his swing coach), `Don't be
surprised if I win seven times this year.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've won eight times (including an international
tournament). So I've already superseded my own expectations, which
has been nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won seven times in 1999, the first time anybody has
won seven official events in a season since Johnny Miller won eight
in 1974. Jack Nicklaus won seven times in '72 and again in '73.
Woods ran his victory total to 14 on the PGA Tour in just 3{
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to win eight times on our tour,'' he said.
``But to accomplish what I've accomplished since May, I think that
in itself speaks volumes. I've been on a great run.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Nicklaus, Woods has 14 victories before his 24th
birthday. Nicklaus had eight wins before turning 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say he's on a hot streak,'' David Duval said.
``People said that about me, and I sort of took offense to it. When
you do something for two years, it's not a streak.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Woods, who has dominated the PGA Tour for six
months, finishing out of the top seven only once since the GTE
Byron Nelson. He has won more than $5.6 million in 20 events.
</P>
<P>
   He made only four bogeys all week at Champions. Sunday, after
Woods tapped in a five-foot par putt to end it, he signed his card
and then paid tribute to Stewart's memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne, this one's for you,'' Woods said on the 18th green as a
large picture of a knickered Stewart watched from the right edge of
the green.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has proved he can dominate in any way, shape or form. In
good times and in bad, he shells the competition in unbiased
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he started with a three-shot lead and it never went
lower than a two-stroke edge. By the back nine at the Cypress Creek
Course, he was four up and aiming for the middle of Champions'
generous greens.
</P>
<P>
   And so, a week that started forever ago with six people dying in
a Learjet mishap ended with Woods hoisting the crystal trophy and
giving people reason to wonder just where his overwhelming play
will lead him in the coming weeks, months and years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there were times when people sat back and watched Jack
do the same things,'' said Davis Love III, who finished second,
four shots behind Woods after a 67 on Sunday. ``As long as he
doesn't hit too many rocks, he's going to be good for a long, long
time. And we're all going to have to get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly head and shoulders above the rest. And we're
going to have to catch him on just an average week. Or we're going
to have to play 120 percent instead of 100 percent to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching Woods on any Sunday is proving to be nearly impossible.
He has won 11 consecutive tournaments when leading or tied for the
lead going into the final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful course to protect a lead on because the
greens are so big,'' Woods said. ``If you don't feel comfortable,
just dump the ball in the middle of the green, give yourself a 30-
or 40-footer, take your two-putt and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the other players who declined to wear plus-fours, Woods
had his reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to wear knickers to honor someone and to feel
resolve for them,'' Woods said. ``That's my way of handling things.
I don't need to show things on the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   What mattered the most, other than Stewart's memory, was that
Woods just keeps hammering everything in his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's staggering statistically what he's done in the last 10
events,'' Phil Mickelson said. ``It's something that's almost
unheard of. His play has been unbeatable. What I have a hard time
believing is what a high level he's playing at because, normally,
out of all the guys in the field, a couple get hot. But it's been
Tiger every week, and that's been amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Duval said: ``I'm pretty sure the player of the year was
decided a month ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Woods has been terrific since May, and his year will go
down as the greatest financially ever and one of the best ever in
terms of victories.
</P>
<P>
   And he isn't done. The American Express Championship starts in
Valderrama, Spain, on Thursday, and Woods, with his reworked swing
producing magical results, seems poised for perhaps even a better
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger seems like he's very, very confident, that he's got
everything around him where he wants it,'' Love said. ``And I don't
see him easing off at all. He is a hard worker. He didn't get this
far just on ability. He's a hard worker, and I think he's got a
great work ethic from his dad. I think he will continue this.'' &QL;

 By SCOTT KAISER  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
If this was Davis Love III's last tournament of the 1999 season, at
least he can say he finished the year as it started.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Love's final-round 67 on Sunday earned him sole possession of
second place at the Tour Championship at 273, four strokes back of
Tiger Woods. For Love, who has won 12 PGA Tour events this decade,
it was his fourth runner-up finish this season. He was second at
the Hawaiian Open, the Los Angeles Open and the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My season was like this week _ close,'' Love said. ``I was
real close a couple of times. Ever since Hartford (when he injured
a nerve in his left arm, affecting his hand) I've been playing at
less than 100 percent and just trying to get through, and I don't
like that feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a couple strokes away at a few tournaments from having a
great year. If I had made a couple putts at the Masters or hit one
more good tee shot, this would have been a great year. Still, I'm
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Love opened play Thursday with a 7-under 64 on Champions Golf
Club's Cypress Creek Course but played the first nine of the third
round Saturday at 2-over. Love birdied Nos. 7, 10, 13 and 17 on
Sunday to move out of a tie for fifth to stand alone in second at
11-under. That earned him $540,000 and upped his season earnings to
$2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played pretty well this week at times,'' said Love, who tied
for second at this event behind David Duval in 1997. ``I drove the
ball well, but my long irons and fairway woods weren't up to it. We
saw that a couple of times because it really cost me a lot of
strokes. I'd drive it up the middle and then hit a bad second shot.
It's frustrating to go out there and play like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that's hard to say when I just finished second, because
I did make some putts and emotionally I hung in there better than
some of the other guys did.''
</P>
<P>
   Love was alluding to the tragedy Monday when fellow Ryder Cup
teammate Payne Stewart was killed in a plane mishap. Love was one
of a number of players who wore knickers Sunday in Stewart's
memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fit pretty good,'' Love said. ``I snuck through the pile
early and made sure I had a pair that worked. It doesn't feel right
(wearing them), but the pants fit.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what he wore, Love knew it would be tough to make up
six strokes on Woods with only 18 holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my 100 percent would have beaten Tiger this
week,'' Love said. ``He's just playing outstanding. I played 27
holes with him (Saturday), and there was no doubt that he's playing
very, very well. He's going to be tough to beat, no matter what. I
think (Saturday) I got a little frustrated because I knew that even
if I was playing at my best, I probably couldn't have caught up
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Love, Davis' caddie and brother, was impressed with the
concentration level Davis showed throughout the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little distracted, just like everybody, but the golf
course seemed to be the most normal place of all,'' Mark Love said.
``He played great this week with the exception of those extra nine
holes (on Thursday and Saturday). When he gets tired and that
(injury) is bothering him, it's hard to play that way. Considering
he had all that going on, he did a heck of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, who like all the competitors wore a pained look much of
the tournament, admitted playing golf was more of a job than a game
this past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness that I had 27 (holes) with Jeff Maggert, 27
with Tiger and 18 with Tom (Lehman), all of whom are Ryder Cup
teammates,'' Love said. ``We were all close a month ago, and I
think this has even brought us closer together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all saw something real special that week, and we'll be able
to share that for a long time, and I think it was good that I was
out with them. This was a good week for all of us to be together.''

MAHANAMBRATA BRAHMACHARI, HINDU SCHOLAR, IS DEAD AT 95
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Ill., Minn., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mahanambrata Brahmachari, a soft-spoken Hindu scholar who
offered early and important intellectual encouragement to the Roman
Catholic monk and writer Thomas Merton, died in Calcutta, India, on
Oct. 18. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brahmachari lived most of his life in his native
Bengal, he enjoyed a remarkable sojourn in the Depression-era
United States _ mainly in Chicago between 1933 and 1939. He arrived
there penniless, sent by his monastery to attend a conference of
the World Fellowship of Faiths.
</P>
<P>
   But Brahmachari's intellectual gifts, his sense of spiritual
assurance (``that heaven would have to take care of him,'' Merton
later wrote) and the interest that American scholars and religious
figures took in him gave him the scope to make an unusual impact
during his six years in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he address the Chicago conference, but he also
became the fellowship's international secretary and traveled to
London in 1936 for its assembly there. He also delivered hundreds
of lectures, often on college campuses, on Hindu and other
religious beliefs, aspects of Indian society, and the work of
Gandhi in the movement for Indian independence.
</P>
<P>
   He was already equipped with master's degrees in Sanskrit and
Western philosophy from the University of Calcutta, then gained
admission to the University of Chicago, earning a doctorate in
philosophy in 1937. That year, Charles Gilkey, the university's
dean, described Brahmachari in a letter as a ``beloved figure on
our quadrangles,'' who had impressed people ``through the
winsomeness of his personality, the keenness of his mind, the
catholicity of his point of view, and not least through his deeply
religious spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Brahmachari came from a religious tradition called
neo-Vaisnavism, focused on the worship of the god Vishnu and his
incarnations. Vaisnavism emphasizes religious devotion.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of recollections of Brahmachari, gathered by William
Buchanan and published by the Vivekananda Monastery in Minnesota,
the poet Robert Lax wrote that Brahmachari possessed a quiet and
calm that drew people to him.
</P>
<P>
   He would come unnoticed into a crowded room, Lax wrote, and soon
people would be sitting around him, ``quietly asking him questions
or listening to him because it was just the natural thing to do in
the presence of someone who had that quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than attempt to convert Americans to his own faith,
Brahmachari told those he met that they ought to look into their
own religious traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Merton met Brahmachari in 1938, when Merton was 23 and studying
at Columbia University. He was taken by a friend to meet
Brahmachari, who was arriving at Grand Central Terminal in New
York. At first, the two were unable to locate Brahmachari, nor
could they find anyone who had seen him. Yet one would have
thought, Merton later wrote in ``The Seven Story Mountain,'' that a
man ``in a turban and a white robe and a pair of Keds would have
been a memorable sight.'' Eventually, the three men linked up.
</P>
<P>
   Merton became friends with Brahmachari and would later credit
him with helping provide inspiration toward the spiritual path
Merton would take as a Trappist monk. In ``The Seven Story
Mountain,'' Merton recounts how Brahmachari, who rarely gave direct
advice, told him to read two classics of Christian spirituality,
St. Augustine's ``Confessions'' and the late medieval mystical
book, ``The Imitation of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I look back on those days,'' Merton wrote in his
book, ``it seems to me very probable that one of the reasons why
God had brought him all the way from India, was that he might say
just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahanambrata Brahmachari was born on Dec. 25, 1904, into a
religious, middle-class family in a village in what is now
Bangladesh. After he returned to British-ruled India in early 1939,
he continued to live as a monk, and also wrote and lectured on
religious subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The area of Bengal in which he lived became part of East
Pakistan after Indian independence from Britain in 1948. He
remained there, providing spiritual support to the Hindu minority
and working for peace, even during Pakistan's attempt to suppress
the drive to independence in what became Bangladesh in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute included in the recollections published by
Vivekananda Monastery, Merton wrote of Brahmachari that the latter
taught a lesson with his life, ``that one can and must entrust
himself to a higher and unseen Wisdom, and that if one can relax
his frantic hold on the illusory securities of everyday material
existence and abandon himself peacefully to a Supreme Will, he will
himself find freedom and peace in that Will.''

BOSTON TRAVEL AGENCY FACES ITS OWN MOMENTS OF HORROR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY AND JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The typical Grand Circle Travel tourist is a
72-year-old sunbird, retired and living far from New England, but
the Boston company that apparently had 54 passengers on EgyptAir
Flight 990 Sunday has inspired such loyalty that clients have
occasionally driven in from other states just to meet their agents
face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   The company's headquarters on Congress Street are lined with
snapshots of venturesome senior citizens _ four women in their 60s
peering out from a South American train; a 70-year-old man grinning
through goggles in Antarctica. A mural spells out the company's
mantra of ``speed, teamwork, risk-taking, and thriving on chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, as word spread that a group of Grand Circle
passengers had been booked on the flight, 80 employees showed up
voluntarily at the company's offices for a day of grim and unusual
work.
</P>
<P>
   One agent was assigned to make travel plans to New York for the
families of the passengers so that they could be nearer to the
source of information about the crash, said chairman Alan E. Lewis.
Most of the EgyptAir passengers are from California, Oregon,
Washington, and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our 41 years, we have never received this kind of
information before. This is the worst crisis I have ever been
exposed to,'' said Lewis, who was awakened with the news at 4
Sunday morning. ``This is a very tough day.''
</P>
<P>
   As they passed in and out of the building, Grand Circle
employees appeared worn and sad. More than a dozen company agents
were already on hand to comfort grieving families at the Ramada
Plaza Hotel at Kennedy Airport. Others were busy offering early
passage home for the 100 Grand Circle tourists currently traveling
in Egypt, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Any travelers who had booked future trips to Egypt are being
offered alternative packages, although the company has not
suspended its Egyptian tours. Lewis noted Sunday that there was no
indication that terrorism was a factor in the plane's downing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing you can do is overreact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 54 passengers aboard EgyptAir 990 had paid $2,500 per person
for a 14-day tour that featured a five-day riverboat cruise down
the Nile to Luxor. Advertisements for Grand Circle's Egyptian tours
_ one of the company's most popular options _ promise that tourists
will ``behold the pyramids, stand inside massive temples, gaze upon
timeless landscapes, and touch the very waters where Cleopatra once
sailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1958 as a branch of the American Association of
Retired Persons, the company's fortunes have soared along with new
reserves of physical health and disposable income on the part of
their clients. Between 1986 and 1996, Grand Circle went from being
a $20 million company to one worth $150 million, and as of this
year had arranged tours for 91,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that growth is repeat business, which makes up 45
percent of the company's volume, according to company officials.
</P>
<P>
   The over-50 market has developed ``astonishingly fast'' over the
past 15 years, as tentative first-timers turned into savvy
enthusiasts, said Adele Malott, who edits the newsletter, The
Mature Traveler. Every year, travelers in their 60s and 70s become
a little more venturesome, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now nothing stops them,'' she said. ``They tend to go for the
adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates
Logan International Airport, Sunday prepared for the possibility
that some families would want to come to Boston to be near the
crash site, and opened a family assistance center at the Logan
Hilton Hotel. Massport spokeswoman Georgeane Tacelli said Sunday
that no relatives had arrived, but the center was nonetheless
expected to remain open through Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Clark, who has booked tours for clients as old as 95, says
that after two years the enterprise still surprises him. His own
parents, in their mid-70s, have just returned from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more disposable income and they're healthier. Most of
the time, I talk to 70-year-old couples now, and I ask, `Do you
walk at all?' and they say, `We walk two or three miles a day,''
said Clark. ``They feel the excitement, they feel secure with
themselves and their lives. That's only been in the last 20
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's news cast a pall over what those within the industry
otherwise consider an unmitigated success story. Malott, 64, who
has gone on Grand Circle Tours herself, said she felt a pang when
she heard the group was on board, but took heart from their sense
of adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these people were traveling,
</P>
<P>
   and they had chosen to travel, God bless them,''she said.

BOMB THREAT LAST MONTH DISMISSED AS NOT CREDIBLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration warned air
security personnel in September of a bomb threat against an
unspecified plane leaving from the same US cities as EgyptAir
Flight 990, but government officials said Sunday the threat had
ultimately proved ``not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA issued the alert to airlines and airports Sept. 24 after
someone told several US government agencies that a bomb would
``soon be used'' on a flight departing from Los Angeles Airport or
New York's Kennedy Airport, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   But an aviation official and other government sources said
Sunday that the FAA quickly learned that the individual responsible
for the tip was in jail on a murder charge and had a history of
making wild assertions.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir Flight 990 originated in Los Angeles and crashed into
the Atlantic Ocean after departing from Kennedy International
Airport for Cairo early Sunday. The alert expired Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA issued the alert, but they investigated it and found
there were no grounds for it,'' said a State Department official.
``In any case, they're dismissing any connection'' between the
threat and Flight 990, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department official said there had been no air
sabotage threats arising from President Clinton's trip to Norway,
which began Sunday. Clinton is in Oslo to discuss the Middle East
peace process with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Norway is also having ceremonies to mark the fourth anniversary
of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   At the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, spokesman Abdel Aleem El
Abyad said no terrorist group had claimed responsibility for
downing Flight 990. ``Nobody has called us. Nobody has called the
Americans to claim anything,'' he said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   El Abyad also said that Egypt's minister of transportation had
already issued a statement saying no foul play was involved, though
he added that it was too early to draw that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   US officials also said there was no evidence that the plane was
sabotaged, though intelligence officers at several federal agencies
began studying the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, the lead investigative
agency, appeared to be taking steps to downplay speculation that
terrorism caused the disaster. After the 1996 crash of TWA Flight
800, the NTSB held a series of joint press conferences with the
FBI, which heightened the perception that a criminal act had caused
that crash. Sunday, NTSB officials took the podium alone at a press
conference, even though the FBI is also investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different kind of investigation,'' said Jamie Finch,
an NTSB spokesman. ``With TWA, the question at the very beginning
was whether terrorism was involved,'' and the NTSB shared that
suspicion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts said that airlines and law enforcement agencies
receive hundreds of threats to air safety each year, but that most
of them are investigated and dismissed as not credible. Relatively
few threats prompt alerts such as the one the FAA issued Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hundred of those (threats) come every day from people in
prison, nuts on the street, crank calls to local police agencies,''
said Vince Cannistraro, the CIA's former counterterrorism chief,
who led the agency's probe of the 1988 crash of Pan Am Flight 103
over Scotland. He said that only a ``limited number'' of the calls
turn into FAA alerts after investigation by the FBI, the CIA or
other law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Another air security specialist, who works for a Maryland
security firm, said that many threats are so inspecific, mentioning
no airline or time frame, that it is difficult to issue a useful
alert.
</P>
<P>
   The security specialist, who asked that his name not be printed,
speculated that the few facts known so far about the disaster
suggest that a bomb was not involved. A timer seemed unlikely to
this person because Flight 990 was delayed at the New York airport
for nearly three hours after its scheduled departure of 10:30 p.m.
Saturday, EDT. The fact that the plane was at cruising altitude for
some time suggested to this person that a detonator keyed to
barometric pressure also seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials working on the Flight 990 crash would
likely study a set of Egyptian terrorist groups that oppose secular
rule in Egypt and the regime of President Hosni Mubarak, even
though none of the groups has been implicated in the crash in any
way.
</P>
<P>
   The groups include the Eqyptian Muslim Brotherhood; al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya, which is accused of killing foreign tourists in Egypt;
and Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Osama bin Laden, the
fugitive Saudi millionaire who allegedly backed the 1998 attack on
US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Cannistraro noted that these groups had not issued a threat
against the airliner and have no background in airline terrorism.
``There is nothing in the threat environment that indicates that
this was the result of a terrorist incident,'' Cannistraro said of
the Flight 990 crash.
</P>
<P>

MAX PATKIN, 79, THE CLOWN PRINCE OF BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Fla.)  (ms) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Max Patkin, who made more consecutive appearances on the diamond
than Cal Ripken Jr. and was thrown out of more games than Earl
Weaver in half a century of slapstick as the Clown Prince of
Baseball, died Oct. 30 at a hospital in Paoli, Pa. Patkin, who
lived in Exton, Pa., was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was an aneurysm in the aorta, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Cavorting in a baggy uniform, a question mark sewn on the back
of his jersey, his cap tilted sideways, his toothless face capable
of contortions rivaling a knuckleball, Patkin was a major
attraction at minor league ball parks on countless summer
afternoons. And he was a comedy accomplice of baseball's master
showman, Bill Veeck, during coaching stints for him with the
Indians, the Browns and the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Patkin made more than 4,000 appearances, by his estimate,
without missing a single scheduled pratfall. He crawled through
Yogi Berra's legs, kissed Frank Howard to inspire a home run,
played himself in the movie ``Bull Durham'' and was a goofy
baseball fixture long before the Phillie Phanatic and the Chicken.
</P>
<P>
   His routine included an adventure starting out in the batter's
box. First, he would dodge a brushback pitch. Then he would take a
fastball over the heart of the plate and push the catcher over.
Finally, he would connect on a lob, run to third base, be tagged
out and engage in an epic argument that saw him tossed out of the
park and sent off to his next stop on America's baseball map.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a corny act,'' Patkin acknowledged, ``but the fans
liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Philadelphia, Patkin became captivated with baseball
at age 8 when he saw Jimmie Foxx play at Shibe Park with the
Athletics. ``I didn't want to be a clown,'' he once said. ``I
wanted to be a major league ballplayer. I'd sit at dinner with my
baseball hat on. I never took it off until I went to bed, then I'd
put it under my pillow with my glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Patkin pitched in the White Sox minor league system, then found
his niche while with a Navy team in Hawaii during World War II.
After seeing Joe DiMaggio of the Army Air Forces send one of his
pitches out of sight, Patkin, on a whim, followed DiMaggio around
the bases, mimicking his trot. A career in comedy was born.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared before big crowds in the majors, but there was also
the time when he performed before a crowd of four, two of the
spectators being the parents of one of the starting pitchers. That
was in Great Falls, Mont., the night of July 20, 1969, when the
rest of America was watching Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walk on
the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Patkin had a host of routines, carrying a miniature glove. He
would imitate the first baseman's warm-up ritual, show the
third-base coach how to give signs while dancing to ``Rock Around
the Clock'' and _ in his signature flourish _ take long drinks of
water and spew a geyser. He was actually the second Clown Prince of
Baseball, taking the sobriquet that Al Schacht, a former pitcher
and coach for the Washington Senators, had used in his pantomime
routines.
</P>
<P>
   Patkin's last performance was at Glens Falls, N.Y., in 1993. The
following year, his brother, Edward, his pal on the road, died.
Patkin was hospitalized after that for depression, then was back in
the public eye when The National Enquirer wrote an article on his
travails after baseball. That brought 5,000 letters from
well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   Patkin is survived by a daughter, Joy Tietsworth, of Exton, and
a sister, Ruth Cohen, of Pompano Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Patkin wrote an autobiography, ``The Clown Prince of
Baseball'' (W.R.S. Publishing), collaborating with Stan Hochman, a
Philadelphia sportswriter. But he took that as seriously as his
other baseball escapades.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, when a panhandler appeared in court for snatching
$35 from Patkin while he had been videotaping a television spot in
Philadelphia, Patkin asked the judge to grant the man leniency and
presented the robber with a copy of his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that ought to be the sentence,'' Patkin said. ``To
read my book.''

EGYPTIAN AIRLINER CRASHES WITH 217 ABOARD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS AND MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An EgyptAir jetliner en route from New York to Cairo
with 217 people on board went into a terrifying dive, apparently
broke apart, and crashed into the waters off Nantucket early
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no distress calls, no clear causes, and no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir Flight 990 carried 129 Americans, according to Egyptian
government officials, including a group of 54 tourists hoping to
see the Pyramids and other treasures of antiquity. The tour was
organized by a Boston-based company, but none of its participants
were from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included residents of Connecticut, Vermont, Maine,
New York, New Jersey, and several Western states, as well as
citizens of Egypt, Sudan, Syria, and Chile, Egyptian and US
officials said. Two infants reportedly were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   A massive, multinational investigation was launched to determine
why the 10-year-old Boeing 767-300ER plunged into the Atlantic 60
miles southeast of Nantucket shortly after taking off from John F.
Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication of any criminal activity at this
time,'' said Barry Mawn, special agent in charge of the Boston
office of the FBI, one of six US agencies working with the Egyptian
government on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed his sympathies for the victims and
their families and said there was no evidence of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's better if people draw no conclusions until we
know something,'' said Clinton, who called President Hosni Mubarak
of Egypt to offer condolences and pledge US assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard teams reported pulling one body from the 59-degree
waters during a search-and-rescue mission that began 20 minutes
after the plane disappeared from air traffic control radar screens.
Also recovered were seats, seat parts, a wheel, passports, life
jackets, and two partly inflated life rafts.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee said there were no
burn marks on the life rafts, but cautioned against drawing
conclusions based on that fact. He did not say how the rafts became
inflated.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, four Coast Guard vessels and 11 aircraft
scoured a 36-square-mile ``debris field'' in an area where the
water is about 270 feet deep. Larrabee said the search will
continue Monday. A Navy salvage ship, the USS Grapple, is expected
to join the effort Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 990 took off at 1:19 a.m. Sunday from New York, more than
2 hours after its scheduled 11 p.m. departure. The plane had
arrived late from Los Angeles, its point of origin, because of
inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   Everything seemed normal as the plane cruised at 33,000 feet
during the early portion of a standard trans-Atlantic route,
aviation investigators said. Visibility was nine miles and the
weather was calm.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:47 a.m., ground controllers received a radio transmission
from the airplane that investigators called routine. The plane was
at the eastern end of a military training area known as Whiskey
105, at the edge of US air traffic control radar coverage.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last anyone heard from Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, at 1:50 a.m., ground radar from the Boston
Center Air Traffic Control facility in Nashua, N.H., spotted the
plane at 33,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 36 seconds, Flight 990 fell to 19,100 feet, a rate
of descent of 23,200 feet per minute. A commercial airline pilot
who regularly flies Boeing 767s called that rate ``catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The normal rate of descent in that airplane is between 1,000
and 2,000 feet per minute,'' said the pilot, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``Maximum is 6,000, and that is pushing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the radar tapes from the Boston Center
said the plane's transponder stopped working after the 19,100-foot
reading. The transponder is an electrically powered device that
sends critical identifying and flight performance information to
air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several more sweeps of the radar that showed a
strong primary target, and then it breaks up into a cluster of
five'' pieces, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   However, one longtime aviation accident investigator said it is
difficult to make judgments about the plane's last moments based
solely on the Boston Center radar tracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we hear about the condition of the bodies we won't know
anything,'' the investigator said. ``The bodies will tell us if the
plane was ditching and making a low-speed landing, came in at a
high speed, or broke apart like TWA Flight 800.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately before the crash, the plane was under the
supervision of controllers at the New York Center for air traffic
control in Ronkonkoma, N.Y. A source there said the last altitude
picked up by that center was 33,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no one else around him, no one was anywhere near
him,'' the source said, adding that all communications were normal
between controllers and the flight crew. ``There was a routing
clearance, some altitude and'' radio ``frequency changes. Nothing
was abnormal. There were no distress calls.''
</P>
<P>
   James Kallstrom, the FBI agent who led the criminal
investigation into the 1996 TWA Flight 800 disaster, said it might
be difficult if not impossible to pinpoint the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the TWA crash it took 2 1/2 months before we knew that
the central fuel tank blew up,'' Kallstrom said. ``This plane is in
much deeper waters, and it's much more difficult to dive in winter.
. . . It could be years before we know anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a warning
about a bomb threat against an unspecified plane leaving from Los
Angeles or Kennedy airports, the same airports used by Flight 990.
But government officials labeled the threat as ``not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   State-owned EgyptAir said that in addition to the Americans, the
199 passengers on the twin-engine jet included 62 Egyptians, two
Sudanese, three Syrians, and one Chilean. The plane, nicknamed
Thutmosis II after a pharaoh who ruled Egypt around 1450 BC,
carried 18 employees of EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Lewis, chief executive of the Boston-based travel agency
Grand Circle Travel, said the plane was carrying 54 Americans bound
for a two-week trip his company organized to Egypt. Most were from
Colorado, Arizona, and the Pacific Northwest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a woman from Maine and her husband, from Vermont,
were believed to be among the passengers. Neighbors said Virginia
Chaplin, 72, of Georgetown, Maine, and her husband, Richard Brokaw
of Vermont, boarded the plane in New York. The couple married last
year.
</P>
<P>
   On Nantucket Sunday, dozens of people stood on windy beaches,
gazing at the ocean, while emergency officials scanned the sea and
shore for debris. Nothing turned up Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the victims gathered Sunday afternoon at the Ramada
Plaza Hotel in New York, the same hotel that hosted the families of
TWA Flight 800 three years earlier. They were met by Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani and consoled by Muslim clerics, grief counselors, and
Red Cross workers.
</P>
<P>
   At Los Angeles International Airport, about 15 people from three
families were anxiously seeking information about relatives on the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can imagine right now, the hardest thing for the
families is waiting for confirmation,'' said Bonnita Wirth, mental
health chairwoman of the Red Cross of Greater Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Escudero, an FBI spokesman in Los Angeles, said 10 to 20
agents were at the airport, most from an antiterrorism squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was the flight ordinary? Was the flight extraordinary? That's
what we're trying to find out,'' he said. ``It doesn't mean in any
way we think it's a terrorist act. There's nothing to indicate
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane was delivered new to EgyptAir in September 1989 and
had logged more than 33,000 hours in the air during approximately
6,900 flights. Boeing officials reported that the plane was
considered to be in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   A workhorse of transcontinental flight, the Boeing 767 has one
of the best safety records of any airplane model. Boeing estimates
that 813 million passengers have flown on 767s since its
introduction in 1982. There were two previous fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 23, 1996, an Ethiopian Airlines 767 ran out of fuel and
crashed near the Comoros Islands on the east coast of Africa as it
attempted to land during a hijacking. The crash killed 117 of the
160 passengers and 10 of the 12 crew members.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a Lauda Air 767-300ER lost control and crashed after a
thrust reverser _ which redirects a portion of the jet's exhaust on
landing to slow the plane _ deployed as the plane was climbing to
24,000 feet. The plane crashed in Thailand and killed all 223
people on board.
</P>
<P>
   The plane involved in that accident came off the assembly line
immediately after the plane involved in Sunday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   After the Lauda Air accident, the FAA ordered the thrust
reversers disconnected. Later, the company designed a new locking
device, and the thrust reversers were deemed safe. The Lauda
aircraft used Pratt &AMP; Whitney 4000 engines, the same type of engine
on EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presumably, the actions taken by the FAA addressed that
particular problem, but who knows,'' said one airline pilot who is
a captain on the 767-300ER. The designation ``ER'' stands for
extended range.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Boeing said he believed the EgyptAir 767 had the
new locking system installed, but was not certain.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, 12 days before Sunday's crash, a hijacker briefly
took control of an EgyptAir flight between Istanbul and Cairo. The
hijacker was captured in Germany and none of the 46 passengers were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent fatal crash involving EgyptAir occurred in 1976,
when a Boeing 707 jetliner crashed on approach to the Bangkok
airport. All 55 people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, there has been pressure recently on the government to
privatize the 67-year-old airline, which has been plagued by
reports of bad service and poor management. The airline has a fleet
of 38 planes and flies to 85 airports around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth major search for a downed airplane in the same
general area during the past three years. TWA Flight 800 went down
off Long Island in July 1996. SwissAir Flight 111 was next,
crashing off Nova Scotia in September 1998. Then the single-engine
plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, and her sister
crashed off Martha's Vineyard in July.

FOR SOME MARATHONERS, RUNNING LIKE A PENGUIN LEADS TO SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MARC BLOOM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The universal symbol of running has always been the winged foot,
an embodiment of the pursuit of speed.
</P>
<P>
   But that emblem has begun to give way to a new symbol _ the
penguin _ that reflects a growing movement of extremely slow
runners who are changing the character of American road racing.
</P>
<P>
   Embracing a kind of slow chic, this new breed of runners
emphasizes fun over achievement, rejecting the traditional
asceticism of road racing for a more relaxed, noncompetitive ethos.
They have cheerfully adopted the penguin for its girth and its
waddling gait, and they amble their way through marathons, stopping
not only for a drink but to dance or cheer or simply take in the
flowers. Many members of this new wave in running will be on
display Nov. 7 during the 30th New York City Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   John Bingham, a 50-year-old musician from Tennessee who started
the movement that is now called the penguin brigade, was an obese
smoker when he starting running in 1992. Even after seven years of
running, Bingham is not svelte. He is 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighs
170 pounds and is proud of it _ and that's precisely the point. He
relentlessly promotes an acceptance of one's limits with the
mantra: ``The miracle isn't that I finished. The miracle is that I
had the courage to start.''
</P>
<P>
   The novices whom Bingham encourages _ the majority of them women
_ are a powerful force demanding equal treatment with the fleet of
foot, and they are swelling marathon fields. The Marine Corps
Marathon in Washington, which was run Oct. 24, closed its entries
at 18,000 on March 1, keeping many longtime runners from
participating.
</P>
<P>
   And because many of these newcomers walk part or even all of a
marathon's 26 miles and 385 yards and are unfamiliar with race
protocol, they often get in the way of faster, more serious
runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been impeded by new runners who stop cold in front of me
to tie their shoes,'' said Freddi Carlip of Lewisburg, Pa., a
marathoner who is a vice president of the Road Runners Clubs of
America. ``These newcomers don't have a clue how to race.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the penguin brigade do not particularly worry about
stepping aside. As one running T-shirt asserts: ``I'm slow. I know.
Get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some marathons have already adapted to the new breed. Split
times every mile were once enough to motivate runners. But at the
Portland Marathon in Oregon on Oct. 3, there was entertainment at
every mile _ 61 bands playing rock, jazz, reggae and Dixieland _ to
help propel the field .
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not looking for performance, but for a life
experience,'' said the race director, Les Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The marathon's organizers opened a separate division for those
who planned to walk the course, and more than 2,000 of the 7,700
people in the race did just that.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers are responsible for a dramatic slowdown in
marathon median times nationwide. According to Allan Steinfeld, the
race director of the New York City Marathon, the median time for
all of New York's 31,539 finishers last year was 4:19:49, an
increase of more than 12 minutes over the median time 10 years ago.
Last year, 22 percent of the New York field _ far more than ever
before _ finished in a time slower than five hours, a crawling
pace.
</P>
<P>
   New York has also experienced a marked increase in entry
requests, which come mainly from the slow afoot, Steinfeld said.
Entry requests increased to 69,000 this year, from 57,000 last
year. This year's field will be limited to just over 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate slow runners, the course will be open until 6:30
p.m. _ almost eight hours after the race begins. There will also be
extra water along the route for slower participants, who can get a
bottle instead of just a cupful in the latter part of the course.
</P>
<P>
   Before the penguin brigade and other slow-runner groups gained
visibility and a political voice in running, race directors barely
tolerated the slowest entrants. Many races closed their finish
chutes while slow participants were still out on the course. At
some races, water and other refreshments were gone by the time
slower runners reached refreshment stations.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham, who has completed 11 marathons in the five-to-six-hour
range, is passing up New York to save himself for the Columbus
Marathon in Ohio next week and the Florence Marathon in Italy two
weeks after that. In 1996, noting the growing population of slow,
timid and imperfectly shaped runners like himself, Bingham launched
the penguin movement through an Internet site and with his monthly
column, ``The Penguin Chronicles,'' in Runner's World magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham said he knew ``from my first steps that running would
work for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was slow and imagined myself as a short, fat man with
little bitty legs _ a penguin,'' he said. ``Runners tell me all the
time: `I never realized I was a penguin. Thank you for giving me an
identity.'''
</P>
<P>
   Amby Burfoot, the editor of Runner's World and winner of the
1968 Boston Marathon, said that Bingham basically created a new way
of thinking about marathons, one that made them accessible to a
vast new population of runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had ever described what it was like to be a triumphant
but slow runner,'' Burfoot said. ``John found a magical way of
reaching new runners who strive for the marathon on their own,
noncompetitive terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingham, who travels the country spreading the gospel, is
nurturing many penguins planning to run the New York City Marathon.
They will be wearing identifiable pink hats with a penguin logo.
``We're not looked down upon as before,'' said Kecia Lecausi, a
slow runner from St. Louis who recites penguin slogans before
marathons as though they were prayers.
</P>
<P>
   During the Chicago Marathon last year, Lecausi stopped running
to dance with a male runner as they passed a band en route. ``I
didn't care about my time,'' she said.

   Deborah Sullivan, 37, of Manhattan, is running her first New
York City Marathon, hoping to finish in a time of about five hours.
Sullivan, 5 feet 2 inches and 140 pounds, said the fast-and-thin
running elite intimidated her before she met Bingham and his
legions. If not for the penguins' support, she said, she never
would have dreamed of entering a marathon. Sullivan has been
training five miles every morning at 6 in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are amazed when I tell them how far I run,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham, who says he gave 60 talks to 25,000 runners in 33
states last summer on his 1999 Penguin Tour, has built a following
comparable to what the late George Sheehan enjoyed in the 1980s.
But Bingham's message is quite the opposite of the one expounded by
Sheehan, who glorified racing to the limit for personal bests and
who, even in his sixties, would speak bare chested to reveal his
youthful body.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of baby boomers started running in the 1970s after
Frank Shorter won the 1972 Olympic marathon with a graceful stride
and 2 percent body fat. Enthusiasm was further propelled in 1978
when the lithe Norwegian Grete Waitz won the first of her nine New
York titles in world-record time. Those emulating the champions
trained 10 to 20 miles a day and ran the marathon in under three
hours, forming an elite society who disdained those who could not
keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Like a backlash against the fashion industry for its obsession
with youth and thinness, people who could never win a marathon
trophy or wear a Size 6 have latched onto the egalitarian running
movement. ``We will not accept the arbitrary standards of others,''
said Bingham, whose book, ``The Courage to Start,'' was published
this year by Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, the number of marathoners nationwide
increased by nearly 70 percent, to 419,000 in 1998 from 250,000 in
1989, according to the USA Track &AMP; Field Road Running Information
Center in Santa Barbara, Calif. In 1980, 10 percent of marathoners
were women; by 1998, that number had grown to 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The field in the New York City Marathon reflects that pattern,
increasing from 15 percent women in 1980 to 30 percent this year.
About 40 percent of the field on Sunday will be first-time
marathoners.
</P>
<P>
   More participants than ever are expected to walk all or part of
the five-borough course from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to
Central Park. Walking in a marathon was once considered a sign of
defeat. ``Whatever you do, don't walk,'' was the standard advice.
Coaches would even teach marathoners how to keep running while
sipping drinks.
</P>
<P>
   But a few years ago, Jeff Galloway, a coach and Olympic teammate
of Shorter, began advising runners to take purposeful walking
breaks during marathons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell new runners to run two minutes and walk two minutes for
the entire 26 miles,'' Galloway said. ``I'm taking couch potatoes
to an elite accomplishment in life. The whole concept has
changed.''  &QL;

WITH OFFICIALS' CALL REVERSED, TITANS DEAL RAMS' FIRST LOSS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ In the final seconds the unbeaten St. Louis
Rams had the ball and the Tennessee Titans' defense was on the
field mixing its strategy, trying to protect a 3-point lead. The
other Titans stalked up and down the sideline, back and forth. They
had twisted faces, scary looks. Another desperate Titans finish was
unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   The end looked frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Halloween, so who knows what's going to happen right
there?'' Titans tight end Frank Wycheck said. ``The offense was
thinking about going into overtime and preparing ourselves for that
and not getting shook. It was a very trying time. We had just had
the wind slammed from our sails when they got the onside kick and
created that last situation for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans quarterback Steve McNair said: ``We were preparing for
the worst. We were hoping for a turnover. We thought maybe time
would run out on them. There was a lot to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's fears became hearty fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wilkins' 38-yard field-goal attempt with seven seconds left
faded wide right. Initially, the officials ruled that Wilkins had
been roughed by the Titans and awarded the Rams a first down and
another chance to kick. That flag, however, was pulled when the
officials gathered and ruled that the Titans' Terry Killens had
been blocked into Wilkins by the Rams' Mike Gruttadauria.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Tennessee's 24-21 victory was preserved before 66,415 fans
at Adelphia Coliseum. It was the Rams' first loss of the season in
seven games and left the National Football League with no unbeaten
teams.
</P>
<P>
   It was a victory that gave Tennessee a 6-1 record for the first
time in eight years. It was the sixth of seven Tennessee games
decided by 3 or fewer points, and all six have been decided in the
final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was McNair's glowing return from back surgery after a
five-game absence. And for the Titans' rookie defensive end Jevon
Kearse, it was a dynamic display of his rare athletic attributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their execution made us make mistakes,'' Dick Vermeil, the
Rams' coach, said of his team's 15 penalties and 3 turnovers. ``We
haven't been in that kind of atmosphere. We haven't been under that
kind of pressure before.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the Rams create the atmosphere, the pressure. They had
outscored their first six opponents in the first quarter by 66-9.
Sunday after the first quarter, Tennessee led, 21-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at the film of their games and after a quarter or
two they were always far ahead and it was no game,'' Wycheck said.
``So, we said, `Let's challenge them and see how they react.'''
</P>
<P>
   So, on offense, by shifting to empty backfield sets, by throwing
a variety of screen passes and by using McNair's wondrous mobility,
the Titans turned the Rams upside down and inside out in the first
quarter. McNair threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to fullback Lorenzo
Neal and a 17-yard score to tailback Eddie George and ran for a
10-yard score. All in the first quarter, though the &QC; 21-0 lead stood
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from the Tennessee offense. Pressure from the Tennessee
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Especially Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   He is 6 feet 4 inches and 265 pounds, the Titans' first-round
draft pick this year from Florida. He showed a tremendous burst,
quickness and relentless pressure. He affected the game in unusual
ways: The Rams tackle trying to block him, Fred Miller, drew six
illegal procedure penalties, a holding penalty and another that was
declined. Kearse made five tackles and a sack, but often St. Louis
tried to run away from him or throw screens behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy might be jumping in his sleep right now,'' Kearse
said of Miller. ``His eyes were so big watching me. Usually linemen
hold their head down preparing for the run. He kept looking at me.
I started laughing and I knew I was inside his head. I'd speed rush
him sometimes and then power rush him. I think I've opened some
eyes now around the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans showed the same aggressiveness on defense that they
did on offense. Kurt Warner, the Rams' hot quarterback, threw for
329 yards and three touchdowns, but he was sacked six times and hit
all day. He fumbled four times and lost two of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best team we've played,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner tossed a flare pass that Marshall Faulk ran for 57 yards
for the first touchdown of the second half. Isaac Bruce followed
with a 3-yard scoring catch, and it was 21-14 until 4 minutes 18
seconds was left in the third quarter and Tennessee gained a field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the final quarter, with 2:14 left, Amp Lee caught a 15-yard
scoring pass from Warner. St. Louis recovered the onside kick at
the Rams' 42. It was fourth-and-1 at the Tennessee 20 when the
Rams' Wilkins tried the tying field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   With no Rams timeouts left and with the crowd creating a ruckus,
the kick was rushed and missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the loudest I heard the stadium,'' George said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said: ``The game ball goes to the fans. We're going to
paint it up and put it into the lobby of our facilities. This is
the start of a great relationship. They were a huge difference in
this ball game.'' &QL;

   Moments after EgyptAir flight 990 suddenly, mysteriously dropped
from the sky at about 1:50 Sunday morning, the complex _ but by now
familiar _ search for a plane at sea, and for an explanation of why
it went down, was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted by the Federal Aviation Administration when the plane
disappeared from its radar screens, Coast Guard search planes and
helicopters lifted off in darkness from Otis Air Force Base on Cape
Cod at 2:15 a.m. By late Sunday afternoon, four Coast Guard cutters
and 11 planes were methodically criss-crossing a 36 square mile
search area 60 miles southeast of Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Go Team'' of investigators from the National Transportation
Safety Board _ the lead agency in the inquiry _ flew out of
Washington as the nucleus of an investigation that will draw on a
half-dozen federal agencies, including U.S. Navy deep-sea divers.
Two FBI agents were already aboard the Coast Guard ships
supervising the gathering of debris that could be evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning what may be a long investigation and we are
prepared to do what it takes,'' James Hall, chairman of the safety
board, told a news conference in outlining the initial steps.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the template for the investigation was set by the
arduous investigation, still not fully completed, into the crash of
Trans World Airlines flight 800 south of Long Island, N.Y., in July
1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the TWA 800 investigation _ which developed into contentious
clashes between the FBI and safety board investigators over whether
the plane was brought down by terrorists or a mechanical failure _
has also apparently provided lessons of what not to do. Ultimately,
it was determined that fuel vapors in the nearly empty center fuel
tank ignited in an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, from officials at the White House to the
investigators giving limited public briefings on the crash, there
was much cautioning about not leaping to conclusions that terrorism
might be involved, even though Egypt has a long history of fatal
blows struck by Islamic fundamentalists. And the FBI appeared to be
deliberately keeping a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when several high-ranking FBI officials arrived at the
safety board's news conference in Washington, Hall asked them not
to appear on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no threats, we have no one claiming responsibility,''
said FBI spokesman Jim Davis, one of a number of agents who,
publicly and privately, stressed that the FBI is routinely involved
in the initial stages of these investigations in case it later
turns into a criminal matter.
</P>
<P>
   `'We have to follow the rules of evidence, the chain of
evidence,'' said Special Agent Barry Mawn, who is supervising the
Boston-based agents as they catalog the debris. ``So we work that
right from the get-go.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, the FBI opened its Strategic
Information and Operations Center in the J. Edgar Hoover Building
in Washington, a secure command center packed with classified
computers and communications gear, an indication that the crash was
regarded as a potentially serious matter.
</P>
<P>
   A similar command center that houses the Joint Terrorism Task
Force run by the FBI in New York was also activated, and agents in
New York began to examine the passenger manifest and to question
the workers at Kennedy Airport who might have had access to the
ill-fated Boeing 767 carrying 217 people.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hall, emphasizing that the investigation was ``in it's early
hours,'' warned that any reports of the cause of the crash ``will
be speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is to be headed by Gregory Phillips, an
11-year safety board veteran. In addition to the FBI and Coast
Guard, it will also include the FAA, the Defense Department and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as teams
from Boeing and Pratt and Whitney, the manufacturer of the plane's
engines.
</P>
<P>
   The investigative teams will include experts on, among other
things, aircraft structure and systems, engines, air traffic
control and human performance.
</P>
<P>
   Because the plane went down in international waters, Egypt, the
country to which the airliner was registered, bore responsibility
for investigating the crash. But Egyptian officials quickly agreed
to let the Americans run the inquiry, although the United States
was not obligated to. An EgyptAir team, headed by the national
carrier's president, Mohammed Fahim Rayan, is flying from Cairo to
join the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Officials made clear Sunday that the first priority for
determining what happened to the plane was the recovery of the
airliner's ``black boxes,'' the voice and data recorders that chart
every step of a plane's journey and functioning.
</P>
<P>
   While the recorders were only of limited help in the TWA 800
investigation _ the recordings shut off abruptly, and without
having provided conclusive information, at the instant of the
explosion _ officials said Sunday that the recorders in the
EgyptAir plane were significantly more sophisticated and
comprehensive in their tracking of performance.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee of the Coast Guard, who is directing
the initial search-and-rescue operation, said that the required
sonar and diving gear was being loaded onto his ships, and that
with the arrival on Tuesday of a Navy ship, the USS Grapple,
investigators would be in a position to retrieve the boxes. The
arrival of the Grapple was delayed by the initial, brief concern
over which country would run the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard said that, as of Sunday night, it had recovered
only one body, along with seat cushions and partially inflated life
rafts.
</P>
<P>
   In the TWA 800 case, the Navy spent weeks and then months
methodically charting and recovering wreckage _ the FBI and the
National Transportation Safety Board virtually rebuilt the fuselage
from the scraps _ a pattern that is likely to be repeated this
time, at least until enough evidence is found to indicate a cause,
either mechanical or criminal.
</P>
<P>
   In most jetliner crashes, there is at least some communication
with the ground, some hint of what went wrong. But in a few cases,
like TWA 800 _ and now EgyptAir 990 _ there is simply a plane
flying normally on its course and suddenly plunging into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, no one yet knows if there was an explosion _ so
far there are no witnesses and it is unlikely there will be _ or
perhaps some other calamity, like a cargo door opening.
</P>
<P>
   At its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, a jet's hull is
pressurized to provide adequate air to passengers and crew. The air
pressure inside is typically eight pounds per square inch higher
than the air pressure outside, said a federal investigator who
worked on the TWA 800 inquiry, so that any breach of the hull
causes air to blast outward, and could rip the plane apart.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time in three years that a major search
operation was launched in the region for a plane lost at sea. In
addition to TWA 800, there was the crash of Swissair flight 111 off
Nova Scotia in September 1998, and of the single-engine plane
carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister off Martha's
Vineyard in July.

COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY BASKS IN ACADEMIC AND FINANCIAL REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Columbia University, which during the 1970s and '80s
was struggling with a declining reputation and flat alumni giving,
has edged out Yale as the third-most-selective Ivy League college,
after Harvard and Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Last year it raised nearly $400 million in gifts _ behind only
Harvard and Stanford. Columbia is collecting more money from its
patents and royalties than any American university. Even the
normally testy relations with its Morningside Heights neighbors
have turned adulatory. And Robert A. Mundell, a Columbia economics
professor, won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics last month,
Columbia's third Nobel in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Columbia had a record 13,012 applications to its
undergraduate college and accepted only 13.6 percent of them _
fewer than one in seven. As recently as the 1980s, Columbia was
forced to take nearly half of its applicants to keep its classrooms
filled.
</P>
<P>
   Once one of the richest and most admired institutions of higher
learning Columbia, by the 1970s, had slid. Its students still
spilled off the Renaissance-style campus into the bookstores and
bars lining Broadway, signaling the presence of a world-renowned
university on the edge of Harlem, and it still held sway as one of
the city's largest employers, real estate owners and research
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But alumni were dismayed by the violent student takeovers of
five buildings in 1968, aimed at stopping its expansion into
Morningside Park, and many stopped giving money. Respected faculty
members were bailing out. And students sought safer havens than
financially strapped, crime-ridden New York.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's resurgence shows the payoff from careful management
of a $1.5 billion institution that is as much a business as an
ivory tower.
</P>
<P>
   George Rupp, who served as dean of Harvard's Divinity School and
president of Rice University before joining Columbia in 1993, has
proved to be an attentive manager and a careful strategist as well
as a nonstop fund-raiser, many Columbia insiders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rupp is watching the store,'' said Kenneth T. Jackson, a
professor of history and the social sciences, who was on the search
committee that chose Rupp.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the university, too, Rupp is perceived as a strong
manager who has helped raise Columbia's stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbia has ascended nationally and among its peers,'' said
Kay Hanson, executive director of the Consortium on Financing
Higher Education, a group that includes Columbia and 30 other elite
colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The son of German immigrants, Rupp, 57, brought an Ivy League
pedigree (Princeton undergraduate, doctorate in theology from
Harvard) and a long record as an administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The Rupp touch is evident in many ways: He has improved
operations at a university that had a reputation for poor
management. He has increased revenues by expanding the number of
tuition-paying undergraduates, stepping up fund raising and
squeezing greater profits out of the university's intellectual
properties. And he has polished and expanded the physical plant.
</P>
<P>
   Rupp has also placed new emphasis on the undergraduate college,
the smallest in the Ivy League, with 3,400 students when he
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did was to insist that the college should be
at the heart of the university, and that the other schools had to
overcome their fortress mentality,'' he explained. ``In American
higher education, the way John or Mary Q. Public establishes a
hierarchy of quality is by an appraisal of the undergraduate unit
and how hard it is to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Detractors say the growth in the number of students at the
college _ now 3,850 _ has not yet been matched by a similar rise in
modern classrooms or in the number of faculty members, and that
more graduate students are being used to teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rate my experience over all as very good, but there is
mediocrity lurking, in bad professors and unspectacular graduate
students'' said J.J. Lando, a senior from West Orange, N.J., who is
majoring in philosophy, physics and mathematics. ``There has been a
fair amount of student backlash over overcrowding of classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rupp's strategies seem to have paid off. Last year, Standard &AMP;
Poor's added Columbia to its short elite list of triple-A
universities, citing its $2 billion capital campaign, its
diversified revenue stream and its effective planning and budgeting
process.
</P>
<P>
   Michael I. Sovern, Columbia's president from 1980 to 1993, is
widely credited with laying the foundation for the renaissance by
selling the land that the university owned beneath Rockefeller
Center and putting the assets into higher-yielding investments;
doubling the application pool by going coeducational; conducting a
major capital campaign to replenish the university's endowment, and
expanding the school's housing.
</P>
<P>
   Academically, Rupp focused on shifting the balance between
graduate students and undergraduates and encouraged aggressive
hiring to restore the reputations of weak departments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the college sometimes seemed like an afterthought in a
university of 20,000 students that was best known for its graduate
and professional schools.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia is expanding the college to 4,000 undergraduates to
make it a higher-profile part of the university and to bring in
additional revenue. (With tuition and fees at more than $32,000 a
student, an extra 500 students adds up to more than $16 million
annually.)
</P>
<P>
   The most visible sign of the new attention to undergraduates is
the investment in new buildings and renovations. With the help of
large donors, Columbia has invested $85 million in a new student
center and has spent heavily to renovate Butler Library,
undergraduate dormitories and the gymnasium. A new residence hall
is scheduled to be completed next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Katznelson, a professor of political science and history who
left Columbia 26 years ago and returned in 1995, said he found the
university ``significantly stronger'' than 10 or 15 years ago.

WILLIAM WILSON, 51, CO-AUTHOR OF WITTY PRIMER FOR COLLEGE GRADS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y., Conn., Mass.)   (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Wilson, an editor and a co-author of ``An
Incomplete Education,'' a general reference book addressed to
college graduates who felt their education was inadequate, died at
his home in Greenwich Village on Oct. 18. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was HIV-related illness, said his literary
agent, Charlotte Sheedy.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was also active in ACT-UP and other organizations
involved with obtaining government support and medical treatment
for people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was born in Middletown, Conn., graduated summa cum laude
from Yale University in 1969 and attended the Columbia University
Graduate School of Journalism. In the 1970s and '80s he was an
editor at Esquire, GQ and other magazines and a frequent
contributor to Artforum and Interview. He later worked as director
of research for The National Enquirer and was also an editorial
consultant for East/West, a publisher of airline magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Incomplete Education'' came about when Wilson and his
co-author, Judy Jones, shared an office in Esquire's research
department. Perplexed by the elementary inquiries of the magazine's
sophisticated writers, Wilson turned to his office mate and said:
``Haven't these people ever been to college? What they don't know
could fill a book.'' And it did. Published by Ballantine Press in
1987, the hardcover edition is still in print and continues to sell
more than 100,000 copies a year.
</P>
<P>
   The witty entries include explanations of the Dred Scott
decision and Plato's Cave, as well as topographical terms like
swale, vale and dale.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, after learning that he had AIDS, Wilson devoted much of
his time to political activism on behalf of gay causes. In addition
to his work with ACT-UP, he was a member of the visiting committee
at the Robert Mapplethorpe Laboratory for Medical Research at Beth
Israel/Deaconess Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is survived by a sister, Janet Wilson Schmidt of
Middletown.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's New &AMP; Notable capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``MY CAT SPIT MCGEE'' &QL; 
By Willie Morris (Random House, $18.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of any cat hater, this is a major defection.
Morris was a confirmed dog man most of his life. First there was
Skip, about whom Morris wrote a book called ``My Dog Skip,'' and
then there was Pete, a carefree black lab who hung out with the
guys at the local gas station and counted Truman Capote among his
many friends before he settled down with Morris. In the last years
of his life (he died of heart failure this year), however, Willie
Morris loved a cat. Not that he went gently. When he noticed his
faltering resistence to feline company, he consulted with a friend,
the dog-loving Eudora Welty (who was no help), and with a
psychiatrist, who told him it was not unmanly to love a cat. And so
he and Spit McGee became a twosome, Morris spellbound and smitten
and companionable, Spit haughty and all-knowing and coy. This is
Morris' ode to Spit, whom he sometimes believed was his dog Skip
reincarnated. However, Spit was Spit and no one else. Do you have
to love cats to love this book? We'll be honest with you _ it
helps. A little Spit McGee goes a long way. ``This afternoon the
two of us were down by the creek sitting together in our favorite
spot,'' Morris writes. ``It was false spring again in January and
the warming sunlight fell languidly upon us. As I stroked him on
his back, once again he snuggled into my lap. `I love you, Spitty,'
I said. He extended his paw toward me.'' Pete and Skip are probably
spinning in their graves. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``CARE PACKAGES: LETTERS TO CHRISTOPHER REEVE FROM STRANGERS AND
OTHER FRIENDS'' &QL; 
By Dana Reeve (Random House, $20) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get out your hankies, folks. This is a weeper. And yet it's not
a sappy book. We thought it would be, and we opened it with
considerable reluctance. Then we got our hankies out and read to
the last letter in the pile. The people who have written to Reeve
since he was paralyzed in a riding accident four years ago _
especially the strangers _ are not overly sentimental people. They
tend to be survivors themselves, who have faced physical adversity
and come out of it reborn, if not recovered. Their messages tend
toward the challenging. Buck up. Don't let people tell you what you
can't do. Things might never be the same, but make something of the
life you have now. Never give up. Never. Dana Reeve also includes
letters from old acquaintances who knew her husband both as himself
and as Superman, and from celebrities who sent their good wishes
and encouragement. Here's a note, in its entirety, from a
7-year-old boy: ``Hope you'll come out of hospital soon. And you
can come round. Dad will help you up the stair's.'' (cq) Paul
McCartney wrote about the day he and his young son, a huge Superman
fan, traveled on the same plane with Reeve to America from London.
``You were kind enough to give him a big wave when he turned around
to look at you,'' McCartney said. ``That's the kind of thing that
means a lot to soppy old parents like us, and something we won't
forget in a hurry.'' And Katharine Hepburn typed this _ ``Let me
know if I can do anything _ My golly what a mess.'' and signed it
with a very shaky hand. It's hard not to be heartened by the
collective goodness of these people, who took time out of their
days to reach out to a man in need. ``By compiling these letters,''
Reeve says in his foreword, ``Dana is sharing with you and
reminding me of words that helped me start a new life. For that I
am deeply grateful.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BASEBALL'S 25 GREATEST MOMENTS'' &QL; 
(The Sporting News, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We showed this book to a rabid Pirates fan, who let it be known
that the editors erred deeply when they ranked Bobby Thomson's home
run against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1951 pennant race over
Pittsburgh second baseman Bill Mazeroski's homer in the last game
of the 1960 World Series. It's that kind of book _ you don't check
your allegiances at the door. Also among the Top 10: the hobbled
Kirk Gibson's home run in the opening game of the 1988 World
Series; Bill Buckner's devastating error in game six of the 1986
series; Don Larsen's perfect game for the Yankees over Brooklyn in
Game Five of the 1956 series; and ``The Catch,'' which Willie Mays
made in 1954 and has been downplayed ever since, but we think it's
just the most amazing thing, so amazing that we could watch it
forever. Our Pirates fan says the first 10 ``greatest moments'' are
fun, but after that the editors make some faulty picks and leave
themselves open to ridicule. As we said, it's that kind of book. &QL; 
``THE WAY WE LIVED THEN'' &QL; 
By Dominick Dunne (Crown, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he was 9, Dunne's aunt took him from his home in
Connecticut on a vacation in the West. Their first stop was Los
Angeles, and when they got onto the bus that toured movie stars
homes, Dunne sat next to the guide so that he wouldn't miss
anything. In truth, he knew more about the stars than the guide did
_ he was already steeped in Hollywood gossip and glamour, the
intrigue and the dirt. Years later, as a young stage manager, he
attended his first Hollywood party at the home of Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall, where he saw Judy Garland, who lived next door,
and Lana Turner, who lived next door on the other side (she walked
in late, ``looking the way you wanted Lana Turner to look''), Frank
Sinatra, Spencer Tracy and so many others. ``Before the night was
over, people jumped in the pool in their party clothes,'' he says.
``I jumped in, too. I wanted to be a part of it. I thought to
myself, `This is how I want to live.' '' He did, for a long time.
This is his memoir of life in Hollywood, with photographs from his
own scrapbooks showing the stars at leisure.  &QL;

MUDDLED RACE LEAVES TEXAS, TEXAS TECH WITH BEST CHANCE TO WIN sOUTH
TITle 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To their everlasting credit, NCAA officials devised a clear-cut
method for breaking ties on the football field in 1996. They
adopted an overtime policy for Division I-A schools.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the latest round of results in Big 12 games, chances
are good that the phrase ``clear-cut'' will not be applied to the
South Division race any time soon. Unless No. 11 Texas (7-2, 4-1)
can win the rest of its games between now and Nov. 26, the South
will crown a division winner with at least two league losses for
the third time in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A mega-team deadlock in the final standings looms as a real
possibility, with the Dec. 4 representative in the Big 12 title
game decided by which school is most successful in navigating the
league's tiebreaker procedures.
</P>
<P>
   We'll review the tiebreaking steps outlined in Rule 9.18 of the
Big 12 bylaws momentarily. But first, a quick reminder about why
they may prove pertinent.
</P>
<P>
   Disregarding losses to unbeaten Kansas State, the eight
remaining conference defeats suffered by South Division
front-runners have come in foreign stadiums as visiting teams.
Texas is the only contender to avoid such a hickey. But the
Longhorns showed their vulnerability during Saturday's last-second,
44-41 escape at Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has remaining games at Oklahoma State (3-4, 1-3), where
the Longhorns lost in 1997, and at No. 21 Texas A&AMP;M (6-2, 3-2),
where the Longhorns have lost in six of their last seven visits.
Clearly, Texas is eligible for a dose of road rage. In fact, said
A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum, it should be expected.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said he was not surprised by weekend results that saw
Oklahoma (4-3, 3-2) and Texas Tech (4-4, 3-2) lose as road
favorites in contests against Colorado and Missouri, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long that has to happen before fans and
writers realize that's the nature of the game,'' Slocum said.
``Texas had to go to the last play to beat Iowa State. Oklahoma
lost to Colorado. Tech lost at Missouri. A lot of people are
surprised by that. Coaches never are. That's the nature of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   One lesson is paramount, said Texas wide receiver Kwame Cavil,
who insisted a three-point victory over Iowa State represents
``what you expect when you play on the road'' in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take anything for granted in this league,'' Cavil
said. ``Anybody can beat anybody if you're not ready for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it happens even if you are. That's why it's worth
reflecting on the various steps toward breaking a tie in the Big 12
standings, which starts with a comparison of head-to-head records
between the deadlocked teams. If that fails, other tiebreakers are
put in place. When only two teams remain deadlocked under these
procedures, the process reverts back to head-to-head competition.
</P>
<P>
   In order, the tiebreakers that come into play when head-to-head
records are equal, include:
</P>
<P>
   Comparison of records within the division.

   Whether a trip down Tiebreaker Lane proves necessary remains to

race. If either school wins out, it will play Dec. 4 in San
Antonio. Texas can clinch its spot in the Alamodome by Nov. 13 if
the Longhorns beat Oklahoma State and Tech and A&AMP;M falls Saturday
against Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   All other teams would require at least one loss by a team not
remaining on its schedule to reach San Antonio. The possibilities
are voluminous. A clear-cut resolution by the end of November could
prove to be the biggest upset of the Big 12 season.

VICTOR VAN BOURG, 68, DEFENDER OF ORGANIZED LABOR IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (ms)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Victor Van Bourg, who has been called the West Coast king of
union-side labor law, died Oct. 26 at San Francisco International
Airport. He was 68 and lived in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was apparently a heart attack, The Associated Press
reported. He had flown from Washington to be with his daughter,
Julie, who had cancer. She died on the same day as her father, and
it is unclear whether he knew.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 interview, Van Bourg contended that U.S. laws had
always been stacked against organized labor. His law partner
William Sokol said, ``He felt obliged to even the odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in August on a case in which Van Bourg represented
organized labor, the California Supreme Court affirmed the validity
of a labor accord that only union labor would be used in the San
Francisco airport's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced law for three decades with Van Bourg, Weinberg,
Roger &AMP; Rosenfeld, a law firm he founded. The firm, which is in
Oakland, Calif., has 35 lawyers and represents more than 400
unions, their members and their benefit plans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the firm became involved in early litigation on behalf
of health and welfare trust funds against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Van Bourg represented the National Farm Workers Union,
headed by Cesar Chavez, when it merged with the Agricultural
Workers Organizing Committee in 1966. Over the years, Van Bourg
argued before the U.S. Supreme Court four times.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in New York City and grew up in Los Angeles. His
father was a painter and his mother a teacher. He received a
bachelor's degree in 1953 and a law degree in 1956, both from the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Shirley; two sons, Andrew and Timothy;
and three grandchildren.

 &HT;    Falcon hold on to another win
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There were times in the Georgia Dome on Sunday that
memories from a successful 1998 season were in full force. But
then, just about the time the Falcons appeared ready to blow out
Carolina, the reality of 1999 won again.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, neither team was able to undo all the good the
Falcons accomplished during the first three quarters, resulting in
the Falcons' first home victory of the season, a 27-20 victory
against the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The big play _ in a season where there haven't been that many _
came near the end of the third quarter, when defensive end Chuck
Smith knocked the ball loose from Carolina quarterback Steve
Beuerlein, and defensive tackle Shane Dronett recovered and ran 15
yards to the Carolina 5-yard line. It was Smith's third sack of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got on (Dronett),'' said defensive end Lester Archambeau,
who had one of the Falcons' season-high six sacks, after Dronett
was dragged down from behind. ``(Defensive tackle) Travis (Hall)
asked him if he was jogging or running. That's a D-lineman's dream
to scoop up a fumble and go.''
</P>
<P>
   A few plays later, second-year running back Ken Oxendine, who
could not score from the Steelers' 2 in last Monday night's 13-9
loss, twisted and turned his way into the end zone for his first
career score.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta led 20-6 with 5:44 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to decide if I should get up and do something (in
the form of a dance),'' Oxendine said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons soon had other worries.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's Michael Bates, a 1992 Olympic bronze medalist in the
200 meters, returned the kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons responded with a 4-yard touchdown pass to
second-year wide receiver Tim Dwight moments into the fourth
quarter, and Atlanta, leading 27-13, appeared to have the game in
hand. But the Falcons could not run out the clock in the final six
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   So when Carolina second-year wide receiver Donald Hayes gained
54 yards down the left sideline to the Atlanta 16, the crowd of
52,594 hushed. Cornerback Ray Buchanan was called for pass
interference in the end zone, giving Carolina the ball at the 1,
and Beuerlein scored on the next play to trim the lead to 27-20
with 3:07 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' fifth and final takeaway _ against no turnovers _
sealed the outcome. Dime safety Gerald McBurrows returned an
interception to the Carolina 2, where quarterback Chris Chandler
took a knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are struggling like we are . . . it was a good one
for us,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``Our guys hung in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall wasn't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a night and day difference when you win,'' he said.
``It's so much funner.''

`WERTHER': ANDREA BOCELLI DISAPPOINTING IN DETROIT DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Mich., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ There were crestfallen faces throughout the audience
at the Detroit Opera House on Friday night as Andrea Bocelli made
his North American opera debut in the title role of Massenet's
``Werther'' with the Michigan Opera Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Ardent fans of the sensationally successful 41-year-old Italian
tenor, a phenomenon of the crossover recording market, had packed
the house fully expecting to be thrilled and moved. The advance
publicity had created a lot of buzz over the drama of Bocelli's
debut: Could a plucky blind man with scant experience in opera
navigate the stage and portray the tragic hero of a touchstone
French opera?
</P>
<P>
   But the more pertinent question raised by Bocelli's appearance
was strictly musical: Would a latecomer to singing who typically
performed pop ballads, Italian songs, sacred songs and arias
through heavy-duty amplification for tens of thousands in arenas
and stadiums be able to project without a microphone in a
2,700-seat opera house?
</P>
<P>
   Based on Bocelli's recordings and concerts, most critics and
opera buffs could have guessed what the answer to the latter
question would be. But I was surely not the only critic surprised
by the extent of Bocelli's vocal deficiencies for opera. Even many
of his fans in the house seemed shaken. You could see people
gathered in little support groups during the intermissions,
searching for explanations.
</P>
<P>
   The basic color of Bocelli's voice is warm and pleasant, but he
lacks the technique to support and project his sound. His sustained
notes wobble. His soft high notes are painfully weak. Inadequate
breath control often forces him to clip off notes prematurely at
the end of phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the modest dimensions of his voice, he lacks a
feeling for the impassioned lyricism that is a hallmark of this
role, Massenet's operatic rendering of Goethe's character. A young
melancholic romantic, Werther brings about his self-destruction by
falling obsessively in love with a young woman he cannot have,
Charlotte, who honors a pledge made to her dying mother and marries
a prosperous young diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bocelli's inhibition onstage was obviously due to his
blindness, though no one expects sighted tenors to be compelling
actors either. Opera is not that kind of theater. If we can accept
Luciano Pavarotti as a starving Bohemian poet, we can certainly
accept a tall, trim, darkly handsome blind man as Werther. And
Mario Corradi, the director of this attractive production, has
devised simple blockings and placements for Bocelli, which he
handled comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   But neither his disability nor his inexperience account for
Bocelli's lack of intensity. There was little emotion or urgency in
his singing. The silences between phrases went dead. Werther's
radiant first aria is an impassioned young man's invocation to
everything in nature: the sighs of the woods, a trimmed garden
hedge, the sun, the shade. ``A whole world appears before my
astonished eyes,'' he sings. You might think a man who cannot see
would bring special poignancy to this moment. Bocelli's singing was
curiously blank.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was terrified. After all, he could simply continue
makings millions from his concerts and recordings. This production,
with four more performances through Nov. 14, is the fourth time
Bocelli has attempted staged opera, including two appearances last
year as Rodolfo in ``La Boheme'' in Sardinia and in ``The Merry
Widow'' at the Veronaal. To expose himself this way takes
some courage.
</P>
<P>
   But it also takes a certain presumptuousness, not to mention the
compliance of professional opera companies. The Michigan Opera
Theater has a lot to answer for. Not far from Detroit is the
respected school of music at the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor. What does it say to the students there about integrity and
standards when a singer so inadequately equipped for opera is given
this opportunity because he is a pop-culture icon who has sold more
than 20 million records?
</P>
<P>
   Bocelli's weaknesses placed the rest of the cast in awkward
positions, especially the glamorous mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves,
who made her company debut in the role of Charlotte. What was she
to do in her several highly charged duets with Bocelli? Sing full
out and blast him off the stage? Restrain her voice to match his
and risk sounding wan and cautious? She did a little of both.
During Charlotte's long solo scene in the beginning of Act III, Ms.
Graves finally let go with some stretches of lustrous, gutsy
singing.
</P>
<P>
   And the orchestra under Steven Mercurio, which had been so
cautious when Bocelli was onstage, dug in and started to play
grippingly. Even so, Ms. Graves seemed ill at ease and,
uncharacteristically, had trouble with a few high notes. It must be
said, though, that she brought this on herself by accepting the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The fine young baritone Christopher Schaldenbrand looked dashing
and sang well in his solo moments and scenes with Ms. Graves. But
he too seemed uncomfortable, and one had to feel for this Detroit
native, whose surname was not even spelled correctly in the
program. Is he being taken for granted? Schaldenbrand has done
things the old-fashioned way: he won the Metropolitan Opera Council
Auditions in 1992, spent three years in the Met's training program
for young artists and has been working himself into the rosters of
many companies, including the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Ying Huang, a bright-voiced soprano, made her company debut as
Sophie. The sturdy bass-baritone Steven Henrikson sang the role of
the town magistrate who is the widowed father of Charlotte and
Sophie.
</P>
<P>
   Bocelli received the expected standing ovation, but it had an
obligatory quality. We had all been invited to feel good about
ourselves for supporting Bocelli's dream of becoming an opera
singer. The fact that those hearing Massenet's impassioned
``Werther'' for the first time probably left thinking it a musical
and dramatic dud is the price we had to pay.

   The New York Times computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a small difference
between Florida State (No. 1) and Penn State (2), and the
difference between Penn State (2) and Florida (3) is slightly
larger.

CHARGES PUSH DRUG-USE SCHOLAR'S CAREER FROM HEIGHTS TO DEPTHS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JUAN FORERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a quarter-century, Ansley Hamid was a creative
researcher and trailblazing anthropologist, discovering and
documenting trends in urban drug use that were closely watched and,
in some cases, celebrated by academics and drug-use experts
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   With notebook in hand, Hamid would trudge into America's drug
underworking to addicts and users and documenting such
trends as the advent of crack in New York. But his ``crowning
achievement,'' as the professor put it, came in 1996, when the
federal government awarded $2.6 million to Hamid's employer, the
John Jay College of Criminal Justice, so he could head a five-year
study of heroin use in New York's toughest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' he said, ``I get national and international
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of finding acclaim, though, Hamid has watched his career
disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, a federal complaint filed in Manhattan accused
Hamid, 55, of misusing money from the grant, which was made by the
National Institute on Drug Abuse, a division of the federal
Department of Health and Human Services. Based on a two-year
investigation, the complaint said that Hamid used at least $5,000
to take trips, buy CD's and hire researchers to work on a book
manuscript _ all unrelated to the research for which the money was
earmarked. The complaint also said Hamid directed a researcher to
use fund money to purchase heroin for his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hamid, who remains free on a $25,000 bond after
appearing in U.S. District Court, faces the loss of his college
job. He was suspended from the heroin project in December 1997
after accusations surfaced and removed from teaching in January
1999, though he is still being paid.
</P>
<P>
   College officials are building a case to revoke his tenure, said
Robert Diaz, the college counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid remains adamant about his innocence, charging that
colleagues envious over his success conspired with university
officials to ruin him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, for
what is really trumped-up charges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid does not deny spending money on some of the items outlined
in the complaint, but he disputes the federal complaint's
assertions that the spending was unrelated to his research. College
officials and several former colleagues disagree. Joy Settembrino,
whom Hamid hired to supervise workers and handle the the federal
accounting, contended that the professor ``started getting carried
away with the spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Settembrino said Hamid requested money from the account for
items that did not appear related to the heroin research. She said
she refused. So Hamid instead spent from another account, Ms.
Settembrino said, in the process accumulating such items as a
tapestry worth about $800, computer equipment no longer at the
university and furniture that never arrived at the offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anyone to imply I'm taking a position, but I'm
very unhappy about a man of achievement who's in this situation,''
said Nathan Gould, chairman of the anthropology department at John
Jay. ``It's a tragic situation. It may not be Shakespearean in
scope, but for him, it is. For him, it's a terrible, terrible
situation.''

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After teaching and studying in Nigeria and India, Hamid arrived
at Columbia University in the mid-1970s, developing a keen interest
in the role drugs and drug policies play in society.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a doctorate in anthropology in 1980, Hamid
distinguished himself by heading into the city's bleakest
neighborhoods, developing rapport with residents and those immersed
in the drug culture.
</P>
<P>
   His findings began to receive notice. He developed theories
detailing the structure of the drug economy. He wrote about how
Washington's tough marijuana interdiction policies in the 1970s and
1980s hastened the international trafficking of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   His work brought him grants, most of them modest, though the
Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation gave him $130,000 for two
projects.
</P>
<P>
   So for the professor, the government's $2.6 million grant was an
affirmation. Then, in 1997, the National Institute on Drug Abuse
notified the college that an additional $2.8 million grant had been
approved, for Hamid to study drug policies in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   But by early 1997, his reputation had begun to unravel. His
demeanor had begun to deteriorate, former colleagues said, and he
became volatile and verbally abusive. Hamid, who as principal
investigator had overall authority on the project, also cut
salaries and fired researchers, project employees said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would not give grandfatherly advice,'' said Richard Curtis,
an anthropology professor at John Jay who was a co-writer of the
grant request for financing for the heroin project and who served
as project director. ``He would sometimes be quite nasty about it,
and people would leave in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   With questions over Hamid's management style threatening to
derail the project, exasperated researchers at first went to Curtis
for advice. Curtis responded by going to Gould and to college
officials. When allegations arose in late 1997 about the possible
misuse of grant money, sources close to the case said the college
notified the Department of Health and Human Services and an
investigation followed.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid still has his supporters, people like Suzana Maia, a
part-time researcher on the project, who said: ``I never had any
problem with Professor Hamid. I was very well treated during the
short period I stayed in the program.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hamid is clearly wistful about his years of work and worried
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like this whole action at John Jay has destroyed my
viability and made it more difficult for me to go to funding
agencies,'' he said. ``So it's a little heartbreaking that all of
that has been destroyed.''

   BLOOMSBURY ART
</P>
<P>
   Described as Britain's first comprehensive exhibition of the art
of Bloomsbury, some 200 paintings focusing on the visual side of
the vibrant avant-garde of London in the years from 1910 to 1925 go
on display Thursday at the Tate Gallery in London. Focusing on
artists like Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant and Roger Fry, the show
includes some of the earliest abstract art and highlights some of
the lyrical and sensual elements that infused Bloomsbury paintings
after World War I. Included among the portraits are images of J.M.
Keynes and Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, Aldous Huxley and Lytton
Strachey, and Bloomsbury figures depicted by some of the great
modern artists they admired: Picasso and Matisse. ``The Art of
Bloomsbury'' continues through Jan. 30. Information:
011-44-171-887-8727.

   Taking its name from a passionate, rhythmic type of music and
dance that originated in Cuba and spread through the Americas to
Europe, ``Danzon'' opens a five-performance run at 7:30 p.m.
Tuesday at the BAM Opera House at 30 Lafayette St., Brooklyn.
Presented in its United States premiere as the eighth event in the
1999 Next Wave Festival of the Brooklyn Academy of Music,
``Danzon'' is a creation of Pina Bausch and her Tanztheater
Wuppertal. Beginning with babies and closing with a visit from
Goethe in his old age, the piece, performed by a cast of 18 and
filled with references to nature and culture, chronicles humanity
at its best and worst. Information: (718) 636-4100.

   With Ed Bradley as host, Duke Ellington providing the
compositions and Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz
Orchestra playing the music, it's ``Love You Madly'' at 7:30 Monday
at Avery Fisher Hall. The event is the fourth annual awards gala
and benefit concert of Jazz at Lincoln Center, with accolades for
excellence going to John Lewis, the pianist, composer and
co-founder of Modern Jazz Quartet; for leadership to the arts
patron Irene Diamond, and for lifetime achievement to Norman Granz,
the founder of Jazz at the Philharmonic and Verve Records. Because
Granz is unable to attend, Oscar Peterson will accept in his stead.
The musical portion of the program will focus on popular Ellington
compositions like ``Love You Madly,'' and ``Satin Doll.''

CUT TAXES? NOT SO FAST, NEW YORKERS WARN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Could you use $10,496? That's what the average
household in New York state would get back through the tax cuts
approved by Congress, according to the Tax Foundation, a research
group in Washington. Because so many New Yorkers, including
middle-class ones, are in high tax brackets, the average windfall
in New York would be $3,000 higher than in the rest of America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet New Yorkers do not especially want the money, according to
The New York Times/CBS News Poll released Monday. The tax cuts
(vetoed by President Clinton) were favored by only 14 percent of
the respondents statewide, and just 13 percent in the city. Almost
two-thirds preferred using the budget surplus to ``preserve
programs like Medicare and Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   You could quibble with the question's wording, which presumes
that current taxes can finance future benefits. That may be like
presuming that you can give a crack addict money for his child's
college education. The question could have been worded differently:
``Is your retirement money safer in a 401(k) account or in the
hands of politicians up for re-election next year?''
</P>
<P>
   But New Yorkers would probably still give politicians the money.
No matter how many studies come out showing that the city's
residents pay more than their share of taxes to Albany and
Washington, and get back less in return, they keep voting for
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George E. Pataki, elected against the wishes of the city's
voters, did manage to cut state income taxes in 1996. But even that
did not change much.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Pataki's 25 percent cut, we went from being the
highest-taxed state in the nation to being the highest-taxed state
in the nation,'' said Brian Backstrom, vice president of the
anti-tax group Change-NY. And as soon as the cuts began taking
effect, the city's Democratic legislators vowed to undo the damage.
</P>
<P>
   In most places, politicians do not call a news conference to
come out for higher taxes. But that is what Hillary Rodham Clinton
did in September to announce her opposition to federal tax cuts _
and it seemed such a brilliant stroke of public relations that she
was joined by all four of the leading Democratic contenders for
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Why do New Yorkers like paying taxes? The aberration has never
been explained. There are various theories, none fully
satisfactory:
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are realists. ``We have a flinty-eyed understanding
that it takes money to operate the government,'' said Manfred
Ohrenstein, the former Democratic minority leader of the State
Senate. That may be, but why do the most flinty-eyed New Yorkers _
the ones who sit up late fretting over the household budget _ so
often end up fleeing to New Jersey and Connecticut?
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are dreamers. They have been fleeced year after
year, but New Yorkers continue to hope that they will get back more
from Albany and Washington than they send. ``We always think the
taxes are being paid by someone else,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan. ``But, of course, they never are.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are spendthrifts. ``Everyday costs here are so high
that taxes don't seem so bad by comparison,'' said Mitchell Moss,
the director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York
University. ``New Yorkers are used to spending $8 for a bowl of ice
cream. We tolerate high taxes because we tolerate the high price of
ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are generous. New Yorkers pride themselves on paying
for expensive government programs to help the needy. Residents of
the Upper West Side of Manhattan may be the only people in America
to describe themselves the conscience of the nation. But their
innate moral superiority is not always obvious to others,
especially those who have tried to reach the salmon counter at
Zabar's.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers feel guilty. Maybe taxes are the atonement that New
Yorkers pay for their everyday rudeness and greed. Lee M.
Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., has noted a correlation between his
polling data and a recent incident at a stoplight in New Hampshire,
a state with no tax on income or sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at a map and didn't realize the light had turned
green,'' Miringoff recalled. ``I probably sat there for 20 seconds,
but not a single car behind me honked. Can you imagine the chorus
in New York? People elsewhere are much more kindhearted and gentle
in dealing with each other, but they're not as likely to support
government social programs. New Yorkers are the reverse.''

`HAPPILY EVER AFTER': CARTOON BODIES WITH REAL TALKING HEADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ms) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the timeless tradition of ``Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' HBO's
``Happily Ever After'' series of animated fairy tales zooms over
the heads of children, gleefully playing to their parents with
tongue-in-cheek casting. Tuesday brings the series' highlight: a
wickedly funny election saga that updates ``Chicken Little,'' with
enough real-life political voices to make the bookers of ``Meet the
Press'' faint with envy. Some are cast so close to type that the
roles seem like sly cameos.
</P>
<P>
   The tale begins with an election in the small town of New
Barnyard. In one of those familiar collisions of politics and show
business, Mary Hart of ``Entertainment Tonight'' is running against
Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor and all-around talking
head. He provides the whining voice of the duplicitous incumbent,
Turkey Lurkey. You can always tell when this politician is lying
because he says ``Gobble gobble'' right afterward. (If only such
dreams could come true.) Ms. Hart plays his honest, common-sensical
challenger, Lucy Goosey. This series is about female heroes, so you
can bet she'll win, bland though she is.
</P>
<P>
   The tale's true villains are those distrusted behind-the-scenes
operatives, the campaign manager and the reporter. Johnnie Cochran
plays Foxy Woxy, a sleazy fox in a natty double-breasted jacket,
who runs Turkey Lurkey's campaign. This casting amounts to a lawyer
managing a lawyer, which even in New Barnyard is as wily as things
can get. Though his client doesn't know it, Foxy Woxy would rather
eat the voters than fulfill that campaign promise to mend a hole in
the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Less malicious but just as dangerous is Henny Penny, the
bubble-headed blond television reporter with the voice of Sharon
Stone. Henny Penny is sitting under a tree while two squirrels,
Merle and Earl, toss acorns around. Merle is played by Geraldine
Ferraro and Earl by (as the credits officially list him) Rudy
Giuliani. It may or may not be significant that the mayor plays the
squirrel who accidentally drops an acorn on Henny Penny's head,
causing a panic. She dashes off to file a story headlined, ``The
Sky Is Falling.''
</P>
<P>
   The tales in ``Happily Ever After'' have been reconceived by
well-known writers. Perhaps because this one came from Molly Ivins,
the newspaper columnist, Henny Penny stops to consider what the
scoop means for a journalist. ``I smell Pulitzer,'' she says in a
singsong voice, plunging into a jubilant song (not sung by Ms.
Stone) that envisions the inevitable next steps: the book deal, the
movie deal, the Oscar. ``The sky is falling,'' she sings. ``And
everyone will know before it falls/That I'm the best reporter of
them all.''
</P>
<P>
   This is hilarious and mordant to a grown-up, but what will a
toddler make of it? The cartoon is colorful and swift enough to
keep a child's attention, but that's so beside the point. Children
may be amused at Cocky Locky, the rhyming rooster, but only their
parents will howl at the realization that the voice preaching to
New Barnyard belongs to Jesse Jackson, chanting ``Wake-y wake-y,
Eggs and Bak-ey'' every morning. It helps to listen closely; the
only character who looks unmistakably like his voice is the
authoritative police chief, Ducky Daddles, who with his gray hair
and heavy black glasses could only be Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, even Turkey Lurkey learns a lesson: ``Never trust a
fox, no matter how good a campaign manager he may be.'' And that's
why they're called fairy tales.  &QL;

`LE CID': A LONG-ABSENT SPANISH WARRIOR RESURFACES AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his multiple role as artistic director,
occasional conductor and vocal drawing card at the Washington
Opera, Placido Domingo has assembled a varied season that is
unusually laden with novelties. The first is ``Le Cid,'' Massenet's
spectacularly scored and vocally demanding opera, which opened
Saturday night at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. In a
week the company is adding Carlisle Floyd's ``Susannah'' to its
fall repertory, and later in the season it will offer Bellini's
``Puritani'' and Handel's ``Julius Caesar.'' These last three are
from that netherworld where operas dwell when they are no longer
true rarities but not yet repertory staples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Le Cid'' is a bona fide rarity, and it shouldn't be. Massenet
completed it in 1885, between ``Manon'' and ``Werther,'' both of
which have had long and fruitful lives. It was a great success at
its Paris Opera premiere, and it was popular for a while in the
United States as well, having first been heard in New Orleans in
1890, then at the Met in 1897.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after a production in Chicago in 1902 _ one that newspaper
accounts described as a huge success _ it vanished until 1976, when
Eve Queler offered ``Le Cid'' in a concert version at Carnegie
Hall. A recording of that performance, in which Domingo sang the
title role, helped win the work a following, but since then there
have been only a handful of concert performances. The Washington
Opera production, a collaboration with the Teatro de la Maestranza
in Seville, is apparently the first fully staged production in the
United States since 1902.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of the opera is Rodrigue _ or, to use his historical
name, Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar _ the medieval Spanish warrior who won
several decisive battles in Spain's long war with the Moors and
came to be known as El Cid (or Le Cid in Massenet's French). In
Massenet's telling _ the libretto is by Adolphe d'Ennery, Louis
Gallet and Edouard Blau _ Rodrigue is knighted by the king of Spain
and is about to marry Chimene, but his father (Don Diegue) and
Chimene's father (Le Comte de Gormas) get into a fight. In a duel
to save his father's honor, Rodrigue kills Gormas. Chimene demands
justice, and the king is inclined to agree. But when a Moorish
envoy brings word that the war will resume, the king defers
judgment and puts Rodrigue at the head of his army. When he is
victorious, Chimene relents.
</P>
<P>
   Massenet makes the most of the opportunities this scenario
provides. Recurring themes represent Rodrigue and Chimene, and
there is vivid brass writing _ sometimes combining onstage and
offstage brass choirs _ during the scenes at the Spanish court and
on the battlefield. There are several lushly orchestrated dances
with shapely solo wind lines, and choral music is abundant.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo seemed slightly out of sorts Saturday night; it is
unusual to hear him overpowered by other singers, but that was the
case much of the time. He also had some trouble being heard over
Massenet's dense orchestration _ again, not typically a problem for
him _ and there were a couple of uneasy register breaks. Still, in
his best moments Domingo produced that seductive timbre that has
long been his signature, and he brought an irresistible passion to
the prayer scene that leads to Rodrigue's vision of St. James of
Compostela on the night before the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabete Matos brought a powerful, attractively dark-hued
soprano to Massenet's music for Chimene. If her physical
characterization was wooden, her voice conveyed Chimene's confusion
perfectly. Hao Jiang Tian was a compelling enough Don Diegue to
move the character from the periphery into the spotlight. There
were also strong performances by Kimm Julian as the king, Angela
Turner Wilson as the infanta and William Parcher as Gormas.
</P>
<P>
   The production, designed and directed by Hugo de Ana,
capitalizes on the work's invitation to pageantry. Courtly costumes
of red and gold and heavily armored warriors _ some on oversize
metallic merry-go-round horses _ pack the stage. In the dance
scenes, Leda Lojodice's choreography seemed overly simple, yet the
dancing was often awkward. The orchestra, on the other hand, played
superbly under Emmanuel Villaume's baton.

`AIR PUMP': ABSORBING PLAY, HANDSOME TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(jw) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Where is it all leading?'' asks the out-of-work
English lecturer played by the sterling Daniel Gerroll in Shelagh
Stephenson's engrossing and beautifully mounted ``Experiment With
an Air Pump.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a century it is a pertinent question, and in the
course of an ambitious play addressing such provocative concerns as
the state of medical ethics, passion vs. love, the evolving role of
women and the aims of science at the dawning of eras 200 years
apart, the question is even more relevant. For at times this rangy
drama seems to want to lead in every direction as it shuttles
between 1799 and 1999 and the tragedies and epiphanies of 11 main
characters portrayed by seven actors.
</P>
<P>
   You may find yourself wondering at some point how exactly Ms.
Stephenson is going to tie all her themes together, ``An Experiment
With an Air Pump'' feels as if it has so much ground to cover. It
ts title from a 1768 painting, ``An Experiment on a Bird in
the Air Pump,'' and like the tableau that work depicts, the play is
a portrait of the uncertainty in an increasingly sophisticated
technological age _ two such ages, in fact _ and how the challenges
are borne variously by those depicted: the young, the mature, the
idealistic, the cynical, the romantic.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Ms. Stephenson sends more marbles rolling than she
can ever retrieve, her absorbing play benefits greatly from its
handsome treatment by the Manhattan Theater Club, where it opened
on the main stage Sunday night. Like a favored child, this work
appears to have been given every advantage, from John Lee Beatty's
elegant and ingenious set, to Catherine Zuber's flawless costumes,
to an excellent cast led by the creamy-voiced Gerroll and the
soon-to-be-major Linda Emond, to a director, Doug Hughes, who does
his utmost to balance two turbulent worlds on one spare stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experiment,'' by the author of last season's ``Memory of
Water,'' resembles a play that used a similar time-shifting device,
Tom Stoppard's ``Arcadia,'' which was set in 1809 and the present
in an English country house. ``Arcadia'' commuted from one epoch to
the other, mingled historical and imagined figures and brimmed with
entertaining language on subjects great and small. Ms. Stephenson's
play attempts much the same thing, though her language is more
poetic than witty and her characters tend to sound as if they have
all joined an artsy debating society.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are rewards to be reaped from a two-hour investment
in Ms. Stephenson's ``Arcadia Jr.'' To her credit, this dramatist
ventures into the world of ideas, a zone that is not particularly
well traveled in New York theater. And the most serious questions
she raises have a contemporary urgency, as they concern the
conflict between science and morality. Ms. Stephenson uses the
turns of two centuries _ one heralding the birth of the Industrial
Age, the other the age of biotechnology _ to juxtapose ethical
quandaries, suggesting that while the machinery has evolved, human
impulses have changed not one whit.
</P>
<P>
   The play takes place in a house in the northern English city of
Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, where in 1799 a celebrated senior scientist,
Joseph Fenwick (Gerroll), and his wife, Susannah (Ms. Emond), are
entertaining his friends and proteges, Peter Mark Roget (yes, the
Roget of thesaurus fame, and played here by Christopher Duva) and
Thomas Armstrong (Jason Butler Harner), a promising doctor. The
same house belongs in 1999 to Tom and Ellen (Gerroll and Ms. Emond
again). He is a professor, she is a geneticist, and they have just
sold the house so she can take a job in fetal genetics research
some distance away.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom is deeply troubled by Ellen's proposed work on
``pre-embryos,'' and though the research has a potential payoff for
humankind, he wonders whether advances for science are setbacks for
the conscience. Roget, Tom's man of letters stand-in 200 years
earlier, is similarly disturbed by a fact of medical life: for the
bodies used in their anatomical research, Fenwick and Armstrong
depend on grave robbers.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists in both times make the case that ethical corners
may have to be cut in the name of progress. ``We're scientists
because we want to change the world,'' Fenwick announces, and the
literary types are like pesky librarians, forever reminding them
that a payment eventually comes due. ``Do you never have qualms?''
Roget demands of Armstrong. ``I've never had a moral qualm in my
life,'' he replies.
</P>
<P>
   This proves in the course of ``Experiment'' to be an
understatement, as Ms. Stephenson places Armstrong at the crucial
center of one of the many ancillary twists in her play. A young
Scottish domestic in the Fenwick household, Isobel (Seana Kofoed),
a brilliant girl with a hump on her shoulder, falls in love with
Armstrong, a turn of events that brings out the young doctor's true
nature. There are loads of exposition to be got through in 1799
involving Susannah's unhappy marriage to Joseph and, for comic
relief, the epistolary love affair of her daughter Maria (Clea
Lewis), but it is Isobel's doomed romance that unites the stories
across the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   By the point at which Isobel's sad tale has played out, so has
Ms. Stephenson's story. The mystery about the events of 1799
remains obscure to the denizens of 1999 (who discover the bones of
a young woman in a pantry), and not much more meaningful or moving
for us. And the sundry ideas the writer tosses off don't have much
cumulative effect. Fortunately, though, Hughes and the cast deftly
flesh out the eras; Gerroll and Ms. Emond (a fine actress who
deserves to be seen more often) are especially effective as two
married couples who seem to speak to one another through the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experiment'' begins and ends with a lovely framing device, a
living version of the painting by Joseph Wright that gives the play
its name. As with the play itself, the effect reminds you of things
you've seen onstage before. That may diminish its specialness, but
it's still pleasant to sit through.

<P>
   An Egyptian jetliner bound from New York to Cairo overnight with
217 people aboard plunged suddenly into the Atlantic Ocean south of
Nantucket Island 33 minutes after takeoff early Sunday. One body
and some debris but no survivors were found in a massive search,
and the disaster's cause was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft _ EgyptAir Flight 990, a twin-engine, wide-bodied
Boeing 767-300 carrying 199 passengers and 18 crew members _ left
Kennedy Airport at 1:19 a.m. ET on a scheduled 11-hour nonstop
flight to the Middle East. While takeoff was late, everything
seemed normal.
</P>
<P>
   But at 1:50, with the plane cruising at 33,000 feet in a clear
night sky lit by a half moon, something went terribly wrong, and
the aircraft went into a plummeting, out-of-control dive. There was
no distress call from the cockpit, the last voice contact with
ground controllers having been routine. Two minutes later, the
plane vanished from radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what happened: whether an explosion had erupted,
whether some mechanical failure had occurred, or even whether the
aircraft was in one piece as it went down, aviation officials said.
What was known was that the jetliner, without warning, plunged out
of the sky and into the dark, rolling sea about 60 miles southeast
of the Massachusetts island of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that radar sweeps at 12-second intervals
showed that the aircraft fell from 33,000 feet to 19,100 feet _ a
drop of 13,900 feet _ in 36 seconds, indicating that it was falling
``like a rock,'' as one aviation expert put it. The rate of descent
was more than 23,000 feet per minute, while a normal descent is
1,500 to 2,000 feet a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the plane was still intact as it fell, aviation experts
said, the high-speed impact with the water would have shattered it,
and the chance that anyone survived was small. The water was a
chilly 59 degrees, and 250 to 270 feet deep, a cod and tuna ground
that would have been dotted with fishing boats and lobstermen in
early October but was all but deserted early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard rescue ships swarmed to the scene, followed by
helicopters and reconnaissance planes. As dawn broke, one body and
a flotsam of wreckage _ none with burn marks that might have
suggested an explosion _ were found adrift in the choppy sea.
Throughout the day, officials insisted that they were still seeking
survivors, but the grim search seemed all but hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to reemphasize our focus, and that is a continued
effort to find victims who may still be alive,'' Rear Adm. Richard
Larrabee of the Coast Guard said at a late-afternoon news
conference in Boston. ``This is still a search-and-rescue case, and
we are very mindful of the families, the trauma they are going
through, and making every effort to keep them informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, federal investigators began what was sure to be a long
inquiry into a catastrophe that was hauntingly reminiscent of the
fate of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, which took off from
Kennedy Airport on a calm July evening in 1996, climbed out over
the sea south of Long Island, N.Y., and exploded in midair, also
without warning, killing all 230 people aboard. A bomb was long
suspected, but officials now believe a fuel tank in the fuselage
accidentally blew up.
</P>
<P>
   There were no indications that the EgyptAir plane had been
sabotaged and no claims of responsibility made by terrorists,
American and Egyptian officials said, although the Federal Aviation
Administration had warned airlines a month ago of a threat to bomb
an unspecified flight out of Los Angeles or New York. EgyptAir
Flight 990 had originated in Los Angeles on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Weather conditions did not appear to be a factor. Fog had
shrouded Kennedy Airport at the time of takeoff and through much of
the day Sunday, but there were no storms in the vicinity of the
crash, winds were light and visibility was 10 miles or more,
according to meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   It was equally unclear whether some mechanical failure on the
10-year-old jet, which had no history of major problems, or a human
error had contributed to the disaster, which ranked with a score of
crashes as being among the worst in aviation history. It was one of
several fatal crashes in the 67-year history of Egyptair, a
state-run airline that has 38 planes and flies to 85 cities around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   By daylight, four and a half hours after the crash, a small
armada of Coast Guard ships and planes were on station,
methodically searching a 36-square-mile region of ocean. Among
their first discoveries were a body and wreckage _ seats, seat
cushions, a wheel, clothing, life jackets, passports, two partly
inflated yellow life rafts and other small items that were not
identifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Through the day, five Coast Guard cutters and as many as 11
helicopters and airplanes joined the search, tracing routes worked
out by computer to maximize efficiency. Wreckage and bodies were to
be brought to the U.S. Naval Base in Newport, R.I., for
identification.
</P>
<P>
   A primary focus of the search was the wreckage of the plane
itself, and its black boxes _ the flight data and cockpit voice
recorders _ which hold a range of information, from speed and
altitude to the talk of pilots, and could prove invaluable in the
inquiry. The boxes have pingers that signal their location, but
equipment to detect the pings was not expected to be available
until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness forced the planes back to their bases Sunday night, but
the ships planned to continue their search for survivors through
the night, and full operations were to be resumed Monday. The USS
Grapple, the Norfolk, Va.-based Navy ship used to locate John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s doomed plane last July, was expected to join the
search Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board quickly took charge of
the inquiry, with the FBI, the Federal Aviation Administration, the
Coast Guard and other agencies in supporting roles in what was
expected to be an exhaustive investigation. The FBI, which had long
clung mistakenly to suspicions of a bomb in the TWA case, was
clearly taking a subordinate role, with rivalries that had marred
previous cooperative efforts put aside.

<P>
   At Kennedy Airport, federal investigators and officials of the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the
airport, quarantined trucks that had refueled EgyptAir 990, and
began questioning mechanics, ground crews, food handlers, customer
service personnel and anyone else who had come into contact with
the plane. Manifests of the passengers and crew were also being
examined.
</P>
<P>
   A wealth of paperwork that was not available Sunday _ data from
numerous radar tracking stations, for example _ was expected to be
in hand over the next few days to provide a much clearer picture of
the flight path, altitude and speed of the plane in its final
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the aircraft fell in international waters, Egyptian
officials might have taken charge, but they authorized the United
States on Sunday to conduct the many-sided investigation, which was
expected to unfold in New York, Cairo, Los Angeles and Newark, N.J.
_ all points where the plane had landed over the weekend _ as well
as in Boston, Newport, R.I., and Nantucket, where search-and-rescue
operations were being coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, grieving families and friends of the crash victims
gathered in Los Angeles, New York and Cairo to await news from
airline officials and to meet with chaplains and other counselors.
Many were sobbing in desperation over the loss of loved ones, while
others were angry or in denial, unable to make sense of a tragedy
that seemed to have no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, EgyptAir's chairman, Mohammed Fahim Rayan, said those
aboard the jetliner included 62 Egyptians, two Sudanese, three
Syrians and one Chilean. Of the others, many were believed to be
Americans or Egyptian-Americans. Three of the 18 crew members were
described as nonpaying EgyptAir employees.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston-based travel agency said the airplane was carrying 54
people, all over 50 years old and many from Colorado, Arizona and
the Pacific Northwest, who were heading for a 14-day tour of Egypt
and the Nile. Others were from New York, Connecticut, New Jersey
and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The airline did not release the names of the passengers or crew
members. But a Montreal daily newspaper, La Presse, announced that
its deputy publisher, Claude Masson, and his wife, Jeannine
Bourdages, both 58, were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton ordered American agencies to
coordinate efforts to investigate the crash and aid the families of
victims, for whom he expressed deep sympathy. ``Like all Americans,
Hillary and I are very saddened by the crash of the EgyptAir
flight,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York, Gov. George Pataki also voiced sympathy for the
families of the victims and ordered state agencies to provide them
with counseling and other assistance, and to cooperate with
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and federal officials in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani spent much of the day at the
Ramada Plaza Hotel near Kennedy Airport, helping Red Cross workers,
Muslim clerics and counselors to console the families of 16 victims
amid wrenching scenes of grief. ``It's horrible in there,'' said
Mahmoud Hamza, who lost two friends on the flight. ``Everybody's
crying, everybody's in mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing 767s, which went into service in 1982, have a good
service record, with only two other fatal crashes, one in Thailand
in 1991 that killed 223 people when an engine went into reverse and
sent it into an uncontrollable dive, and one off the Comoros
Islands in 1996 that killed 125 of the 175 people aboard after
hijackers refused to let it refuel. It has become a workhorse of
trans-Atlantic travel.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptair has had three fatal crashes in the past three decades _
one in Libya in 1971 that killed 16 passengers and crew members,
another on Cyprus in 1973 that left 37 dead, and one in Thailand in
1976, when a Boeing 707 slammed into a textile mill, killing 52 on
board and 20 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that crashed, a sleek white craft with a blue tail and
trim, twin aisles in the passenger cabin and twin Pratt &AMP; Whitney
engines that are used by more than 60 airlines, was delivered to
Egyptair in September 1989, and in the past decade had accumulated
33,334 flying hours and more than 6,900 takeoffs and landings. It
had regular inspections and no record of serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   It typically made five round-trips a week _ Cairo to New York to
Los Angeles as Flight 989, and back again as Flight 990. Its last
trip began in Cairo on Friday night. Kennedy Airport was socked in
by fog on Saturday morning, so the plane was diverted to Newark
before going to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The first leg of the return flight began at 7:30 p.m. Saturday,
two hours late, because of poor visibility at Los Angeles
International Airport. The plane arrived at Kennedy at 12:48 a.m. _
still Eastern Daylight Time. The plane refueled and took on 167 new
passengers, who joined 32 staying on from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kelly, director of aviation for the Port Authority, said
all the baggage had been scanned by the most sophisticated X-ray
machines in the industry, using color coding to show the contents,
and each of the passengers were checked twice. Armed security
guards routinely fly on Egyptair flights, and this was no
exception, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane left for Cairo at 1:19 a.m., standard time. It flew
directly out over the Atlantic and veered north toward Nantucket on
a roughly similar route taken by another ill-fated plane, Swissair
Flight 111, which crashed off Nova Scotia last year with 229 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   As Egyptair 990 climbed to 33,000 feet, its cockpit crew had
several routine conversations with ground controllers, the last at
1:47 a.m., officials said. Three minutes later, the aircraft began
its precipitous descent into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   A transponder signal broadcast by the plane to radar devices
recorded the plunge for 36 seconds, and then the transponder
stopped sending signals, said James Hall, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board. But radar _ picking up the reflection
of the aircraft's metal skin _ continued to track the dive for
about 90 seconds, until 1:52 a.m., when the plane hit the water and
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know at this point what caused the crash,'' Hall
said at a news conference. ``You will undoubtedly hear many reports
of what might have caused the crash. All of those reports will be
speculative.''

THESE TWO SHIPS HEAD IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ This might as well have been two NFL ships
passing each other in the Indiana afternoon. One looked sleek and
imposing, with exotic football ports obviously in its future.
</P>
<P>
   And the other? Well, this particular ship once ruled the NFL
seas, but by comparison yesterday, it was a tramp steamer badly in
need of a dry dock.
</P>
<P>
   The new said hello to the old. More telling, however, was when
the new said bye-bye to the old with a second half butt-kicking
that was both humbling and telling.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys ran smack into reality at the RCA Dome, and smack
into the rear-end of a 34-24 defeat. The Colts gave them a history
lesson by giving the Cowboys a flashback glimpse to the way it once
was. When a star on the side of the helmet was a symbol for a young
and emerging dynasty that came roaring to life in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the fade of the Cowboys as a super power hasn't exactly
been well-disguised the last two or three seasons. But this
particular humiliation was different. This loss hit closer to home,
like a live grenade rolled into a pup tent.
</P>
<P>
   There were all the obvious pregame comparisons of new and old _
the ``Triplets'' thing, combined with the Colts as an overall team
that seemed to be a young and talented copy of those Jimmy Johnson
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The playing of the game, however, demonstrated much more than
just the promise the Colts ``might'' have.
</P>
<P>
   Indy had to overcome early special-teams adversity that led to a
17-3 hole in the second quarter. The overall poise was impressive,
but what eventually separated the Colts from the Cowboys on this
afternoon is what separates good in today's NFL from mediocre, or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Star power. You win with stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts won because second-year quarterback Peyton Manning _ a
true star in the making _ left Troy Aikman in his dust. Whatever
the play, whatever the situation, Manning had every answer on his
way to 312 passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   And the Colts won because rookie running back Edgerrin James so
overshadowed counterpart Emmitt Smith that Emmitt had a
decent-enough game and still looked like nothing more than a spare
part. James combined for 205 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   And the Colts won because they treated cornerback Deion Sanders
like a common yard dog. Manning not only went right at him, the
Colts beat Nine-Toed constantly with receivers Marvin Harrison, who
you already knew about, and Terrence Wilkins, a rookie free agent
who you will know about.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange, strange afternoon for Deion, who in the
opening minutes was apparently headed for a touchdown on a punt
return, only to be run down and tackled by, gulp, the punter.
Hunter Smith's grandkids will someday grow weary of the re-telling.
</P>
<P>
   But in a game when Aikman became a footnote compared to the
other quarterback, and Emmitt wasn't in the same league with the
other running back, and Deion had his jock shoved up around his
ears, it's a harsh reality check for the Cowboys. And on the
subject of checks, Jerry Jones will write over $21 million worth
this season for that well-beaten threesome.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his star-power shortcomings against the Colts, coach
Chan Gailey replied, ``Whether someone could have done more, I
don't know. But I fall into the same category. What more could I
have done?''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's postgame headache was for real, and not just symbolic
of the Cowboys' performance. He had to miss a fourth-quarter series
after being belted by the Colts' Jeff Burris on a blitz. Aikman was
sacked five times. Admittedly, he was holding onto the ball longer,
trying to find open receivers, which was a rarity. One of those
five sacks did cause a killer momentum switch in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Said Aikman: ``The two key plays were when we couldn't make it
on third-and-one to start the second half \REmmitt was stuffed at
the Colts' 40, forcing a punt\S and then the fumble.''
</P>
<P>
   The fumble was Aikman's on a sack by Chad Bratzke. An open
receiver was ignored in the flat as Aikman tried to make something
happen downfield. When Aikman lost the ball, it was batted around
and ended up on the lip of the goal line. Tackle Erik Williams
could have jumped on it there _ and giving up a safety would have
been proper _ but instead, Williams batted the ball out to the
2-yard line. Not smart. The Colts recovered, and went in for a
go-ahead touchdown. That meant Indy had scored 15 points in 34
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The tide had turned.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, any time the Cowboys' defense is placed under pressure, a
collapse will come. Same story yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, the old NFL ship sunk while the new one
continued on its journey into the NFL's future.

DEION HAD SCARY DAY WITH UNAFRAID COLTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Since it was Halloween, the question lingers:
</P>
<P>
   Who was that guy wearing the Deion Sanders suit?
</P>
<P>
   Surely, that wasn't the real Reverend Do-Rag, master of his
weekly domain. Surely, that wasn't the $13-Million Man, made to
look like chump change by Peyton Manning and the up-and-coming
Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' Sanders, a man of many faces, displayed most of
them yesterday, as he darted, danced, backpedaled and gasped for
air, all in the course of the Cowboys' 34-24 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   From the surprise conclusion of his game-opening punt return _
tracked down by the Colts punter, of all people _ to the vapor
trail left by receiver Marvin Harrison, as he streaked past Sanders
for the decisive touchdown, Deion never seemed far from the center
of the action.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts willed it so. For four periods, they played a game of
liar's poker with the Cowboys secondary. They periodically backed
away from their two tight-end sets and used a third wide receiver _
and then ran rookie Edgerrin James, anyway. They ran at Deion, and
they threw at Deion.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, unlike so many Cowboys opponents, quarterback
Manning and the Colts seemed not to fear Deion. Coach Jim Mora had
his team ready for Prime Time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty conscious of where he was the whole game, to tell
you the truth,'' Manning said, respectfully.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders made some plays. He even made some tackles _ five of
them, a normal month's worth, on the official scoresheet. But on
this ghoulish day, the guy wearing the No. 21 suit seemed
distracted from time to time, randomly even displaying uncertain
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts turned it into the Which Deion Project.
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend Do-Rag, however, objected to the characterization.
In the interview room afterwards, he questioned the line of
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me? They were catching balls today,'' Sanders sought to
explain. ``It's amazing. My game has got to be so strong that when
they catch some balls on me, you guys get tickled.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is. Sanders performs at such a high level that the rare
display of frailty was disarming. For five seasons, his on-field
play has been as dependable as Owner Jones' American Express card.
Sanders has mastered the art of the big play _ and the dance
thereafter. When he hasn't been nursing the World's Worst Toe
Injury, he has been Prime Time, in every sense of the term.
</P>
<P>
   But not this day. From the time he went wheezing off, gassed by
his 76-yard punt return, Deion looked like just another $13-million
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this Deion Sanders vs. the Indianapolis Colts, or the
Dallas Cowboys vs. the Indianapolis Colts?'' Sanders asked. He was
objecting to being tossed under the post-game interview bus.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, there were other Cowboys culprits on this
disappointing day. Quarterback Troy Aikman's third-quarter fumble
was deadly, but not nearly as bone-headed as tackle Erik Williams'
attempt to slap the fumble away from the goal line. Coach Chan
Gailey also curiously sent Emmitt Smith up the middle on a draw
play on third-down-and-7 at the Indianapolis 9. The Cowboys had to
settle for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   But give the young Colts credit. Offensive coordinator Tom Moore
called a masterful game, spreading the visitors' defense, which
gave James vital running room, and sending the three receivers out
on what the Cowboys call bunch routes. Manning made it all come
together by finding time, in and out of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the game was that we didn't get them stopped on
third down,'' cornerback Kevin Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys did and they didn't. The Colts were 5-of-13 in
converting third downs. But so went the day for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   They controlled the game in the first half, only to see it all
unravel in the second. They ran the ball well, but Aikman's
receivers seldom seemed to get open.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to help with the run because strong safety Darren Woodson
had to cover someone, Sanders showed a rare nose for the point of
attack. But yet, there Deion was on the game-killing play to
Harrison, frozen in his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking right in the backfield,'' Sanders said,
``and the guy just ran by me. I'm not going to blame the safety or
anybody. I'll take full blame for it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did, sort of. But Deion did ramble on about ``so much
time'' that Manning had to throw, and he praised Harrison and the
``great scheme'' that the Colts threw out there. At one point he
blamed the loss on turnovers _ the Cowboys had exactly one, the
Aikman fumble.
</P>
<P>
   But it was stunning to see an out-of-breath Sanders being caught
by punter Hunter Smith at the end of his early punt return. Deion
said he was still trying to recover from a long pass play on the
snap before. The whole ordeal left him sidelined for an eneries, taking on oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebound?'' he asked a questioner. ``I didn't know that I had
failed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at peace with the way I performed, but I'm not going
to go home and kick my poodle. Life must go on.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounded like a guy who had gone trick-or-treating, expecting
candy, and instead got only humble pie.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, that wasn't the real Deion Sanders?

<P>
   LONDON -- Matt Jones, a Web designer and member of London's new
media elite, winces as he glances at a table of four American
businessmen heatedly discussing an upcoming deal at a fashionable
Notting Hill restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't they ever take a break?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may be the center of the technology world --
salaries are higher, code is chic and geeks have become heroes --
but young tech professionals here are more than a little worried
that the Silicon Valley way of life is slowly taking over.
</P>
<P>
   Parties are no longer quite as funky. Working hours are
certainly not as short. And the once common five-pint pub lunches
are a thing of the past for successful companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signs that the U.S. work-to-live culture is hitting Europe are
everywhere,'' Jones said. ``Dress-down Friday blue oxford shirt and
deck shoes are becoming the uniform of the smart money looking to
emulate the success of their American counterparts.''
</P>
<P>
   This reaction to the infiltration of the ``American way'' is by
no means limited to the high-tech sector. Across Europe, citizens
are still battling to preserve their more relaxed view of work
life. French workers still regularly go on strike to fight for a
35-hour workweek. In Germany, citizens have been outraged by moves
to reduce their entitlement to six weeks of vacation and
all-expense-paid four-week trips to a health spa every three years.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the twinges of resentment over the changing digerati
culture hark back to the 1980s and early 1990s, when digital art
and computer code were anything but sexy. There were few
entrepreneurs, and the industry was made up of artists, designers
and programmers who were not in it for the money but because they
savored being at the edge of the creative frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of that has changed. The most popular meeting place
for high-tech professionals is not a basement pub but a moveable
monthly event called First Tuesday. Started in October 1998, with
just 50 people, the group now boasts 4,500 members. Each meeting
attracts around 2,000 entrepreneurs, designers, and programmers who
want to plug in to the booming high-tech scene.
</P>
<P>
   The events, held at different at hip London clubs and more
recently in other European capitals including Paris and Madrid, are
networking extravaganzas. Twenty- and thirtysomethings prowl the
bar area with business cards in hand. As in Silicon Valley, many of
the cards sport ostentatious titles like ``senior vice president,''
``content strategist'' or ``information architect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First Tuesday mirrors how the London of the Networked 90's is
swinging like the Austin Powers 60's with investors from all over
the world trying to tap into a dynamic Web movement of shagadelic
proportions,'' a BBC News correspondent recently reported.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the creative types, dressed in all black or
fatigues, are fast being replaced by smooth-talking entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But some believe the nostalgia for the ``good old days'' -- when
programmers coded for the challenge and life and work were totally
divorced -- rings false.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think people here are consciously imitating what is
going on in Silicon Valley and setting aside a lot of the
traditional ideas and advantages of European life,'' said Dhiraj
Mukherjee, the lead strategist for Viant, a company that helps
incubate and launch e-commerce enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Mukherjee should know. He grew up in Europe but went to business
school at Stanford University, in the heart of Silicon Valley.
``The reality is the same rules of the Internet apply in Europe as
in the U.S.,'' he said. ``What they are doing is following the
rules even if it means working 80 hours a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that while the culture is changing, most people still
keep life and work separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are working more hours now, it's because they love
what they do and there is more opportunity,'' said Cherie Matrix, a
producer at Syzygy, a London digital media agency that helps blue
chip and Internet start-ups build an online presence. ``We did 80
hours occasionally four years ago when we were making no money. The
atmosphere here is not cutthroat. It's collegiate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The main question in the life of a technology bandit is still:
Am I having enough fun?'' added Chris Barton, a Californian who is
studying for his MBA in London and plans to set up a European
e-commerce business. ``Trust me. They are having a lot of fun.''
But if life in London is increasingly becoming as intense as life
in Silicon Valley, there are fewer reasons to stay put. For one,
the money is still much better in the United States. A computer
programmer in Britain earns on average only 30,000 pounds, or about
$50,000
</P>
<P>
   But stay put, they will. No matter how similar the two
lifestyles become and how strong the pull to the United States
might be, the problem is work visas. Current U.S. law places allots
115,000 so-called H-1B visas each year. That figure was reached in
mid-June for the 1999 fiscal year ending Sept. 30. Companies have
estimated that there could be at least 43,000 petitions pending by
the time the 2000 fiscal year begins in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent 18 months with firm job offers from a massive U.S.
tech company that came to nothing because of visas,'' recalled
Stephan Magdalinski, who now works at Virgin.com, the umbrella
commerce site for Virgin Atlantic Airlines, Virgin Records, Virgin
Trains and other well-known European brands. ``The one thing that
amused me was that they told me that high-tech workers now fall
into the same class as supermodels and rock stars.''

COLTS' BIG THREE ROMP, TIRED COWBOYS STUMBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Troy Aikman was knocked dizzy in the fourth
quarter of yesterday's 34-24 loss in Indianapolis, but he was
clear-headed enough afterward to recognize that the upstart Colts
had more playmakers on the field than the Cowboys did at the RCA
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared that way today,'' Aikman said. ``They had more big
plays than we did out there today, and that's how you put points on
the board.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts produced nine plays of 16 or more yards, including six
in the second half when they outscored the Cowboys 28-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys blew a 17-6 halftime lead. They also relinquished a
24-21 lead on the first play of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something you have to be able to do in this league,''
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``Instead, we couldn't get any
points in the fourth quarter, and we couldn't stop them in the
fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Cowboys, now 4-3 after a 3-0 start, into
third place in the NFC East behind the Washington Redskins, 5-2,
and the New York Giants, 5-3, both of whom won yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have led in each of their three losses, all on the
road, all against teams that failed to make the playoffs last
season: Philadelphia, New York Giants and Indianapolis. And the
have now been outscored in the second halves of their three losses,
51-14.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it has been 26 months since the Cowboys last won a
non-divisional game on the road, losing the past nine. Their most
recent victory outside the NFC East and away from Texas Stadium
came in the 1997 season opener at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have also lost three of their past four games. They
began the toughest six-game stretch on their schedule yesterday,
and now face road games at Minnesota, Arizona and New England the
next five weeks, with home games against Green Bay and Miami in
between.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's game was a microcosm of the 1999 season for the
Cowboys: Fast start followed by sudden malaise on both sides of the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders took himself out of this seesaw battle for one
series in the first quarter after he had returned a punt 76 yards
to set up a 2-yard touchdown run by Emmitt Smith 2:02 into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders wasn't the only one who ran out of gas yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Cowboys couldn't make enough stops. Peyton
Manning and the Colts' offense scored on their first five
possessions of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the whole thing today, I thought, was how they ran
the football,'' said coach Chan Gailey, referring to Colts rookie
Edgerrin James' 205 combined yards rushing and receiving, including
113 yards on 26 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders admitted that he was ``looking into the backfield'' when
he was burned by Marvin Harrison by nearly 15 yards on a 40-yard
touchdown pass on the first play of the fourth quarter. It was
Colts quarterback Peyton Manning's only touchdown pass on a
312-yard passing day.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also ran well for the Cowboys, in the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Smith averaged 4.8 yards on his first 16 carries. But on a
pivotal play with the Cowboys leading 17-6, Smith was stuffed on
third-and-one at the Colts' 40. The Cowboys' first series after
intermission was three plays and punt. Smith had six carries for 16
yards the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Colts started the second half on fire. They
started by driving 90 yards in eight plays for a touchdown. Two of
those plays covered 66 yards _ a 38-yard pass from Manning to
Jerome Pathon and a 28-yard pass from Manning to James to the
Cowboys' 2.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, James fumbled as he was trying to fight his
way in. The loose ball went in and out of Cowboys strong safety
Darren Woodson's hands, and was recovered in the end zone by Colts
receiver Terrence Wilkins for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened to the ball,'' Woodson said. ``I
knocked it out \Rof James' grasp\S, turned to get it ... and it
bounced. I lost it after that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next series, Aikman was sacked at the Colts' 12 by Chad
Bratzke, who hit Aikman's arm, forcing a fumble. Bratzke ended up
recovering the ball at the Cowboys' 1 when tackle Erik Williams
inexplicably flipped the ball away from the goal line rather than
trying to recover it.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, James scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them that touchdown,'' said Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was knocked out of the game for one series when he became
``groggy'' after a helmet-to-helmet collision on a corner blitz by
the Colts' Jeff Burris in the fourth quarter. Headache and all,
Aikman returned and finished the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys couldn't sustain their momentum.
</P>
<P>
   It has become an unwanted trend for this team. The Cowboys on
the road know how to get a lead, but they haven't yet finished the
job.

TAKE ONE TABLET AND ENJOY THE EXHIBIT
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   I am standing in front of Jackson Pollock's ``Number 27,1950.''
In full view of a guard at the Whitney Museum of American Art,
where the painting hangs as part of the exhibition ``The American
Century: Art &AMP; Culture, 1950-2000,'' I touch the work.
</P>
<P>
   Alarms do not ring, nor does the guard bark a reproach, because
the Pollock I've poked is not the masterpiece on the wall but a
digital reproduction displayed on the handheld computer I am toting
through the Whitney's galleries. My touch cues an excerpt from Hans
Namuth's famous footage of Pollock drizzling paint on a canvas. The
video clip appears on the screen of the inch-thick, clipboard-sized
tablet PC that rests on my arm.
</P>
<P>
   The Pollock painting and four other pieces are featured in a
software program called ``Gallery Explorer'' that runs on the
tablet PC and supplements the works with audio commentary, video
clips, still images and interactive games. A stylus-like pointing
device controls access to the multimedia content.
</P>
<P>
   The tablet PC is part of an experiment being conducted this fall
by the Whitney and the microprocessor giant Intel Corp., sponsor of
the two-part, century-spanning exhibition. About 100 people
selected by the museum's staff will tour the Whitney's fifth-floor
galleries, where all five pieces are installed, and share their
thoughts about the devices with the project team.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is notable because, at a time when museums are
still debating the merits of interactive kiosks and struggling with
ways to make their Web sites mean something, the Whitney and Intel
are studying how personal-computer technology might -- or might not
-- enhance the museum-going experience.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his office in Hillside, Ore.,
Ralph C. Bond, Intel's educational technology manager, said, ``This
is an initial experiment, and it primarily has to deal with
answering a super-simple question: Is it a good idea to have
multimedia in your hand when you're wandering around, or is it a
distraction?''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from a recent test drive, the idea definitely has
potential as an alternative to the standard audio tours available
at many museum exhibitions. Despite the tablet PC's colorful
display and 3-pound weight (which took its toll on my tendons over
the hour I spent with it), I had no trouble remaining focused on
the original art works. And even though the multimedia content was
limited, I still appreciated the historical tidbits that were
supplied -- and enjoyed being able to access them at my own pace.
</P>
<P>
   After his own spin through the galleries, Maxwell L. Anderson,
director of the Whitney, said: ``I love seeing Hans Namuth's film
of Pollock while standing in front of 'Number 27, 1950.' It's what
the Whitney's all about -- providing a context for the
contributions of American artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gallery Explorer program offers guides to each work for
adults and younger people. Anderson provides the adult narration,
which mainly consists of biographical notes and some historical
stage-setting. Children get a candy-colored interface, games and a
woman's voice that seeks to involve them through exclamations like
``Way cool, you found the painting by Jackson Pollock!''
</P>
<P>
   Bond acknowledged that the experimental nature of the project,
as well as the difficulties involved in acquiring rights to
multimedia elements, constrained developers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the adult tour for the Jasper Johns painting
``Three Flags'' (1958) has an audio clip from the McCarthy hearings
and an (anachronistic) excerpt from Jimi Hendrix's performance of
the national anthem at the 1969 Woodstock festival. But the sole
video footage shows a flag fluttering in the breeze. Johns is alive
and still painting, so an interview with the artist and
reproductions of his recent work might have made for better bonus
material.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the games for children seemed excessive. Even
if they wanted to make their own Rothko paintings by dropping
adjectives like ``giggly'' and ``cranky'' onto a dark field to
create blocks of color, children should probably engage in this
exercise at the end of the gallery tour, not while standing in
front of Rothko's compelling canvas.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most illuminating content is an extended commentary
on Alex Katz's ``Ada, Ada'' in which Anderson verbally guides
visitors through a variety of ways to view and interpret the 1959
``cutout'' portrait of the artist's wife. As helpful as the remarks
are, though, they would have functioned equally well as part of an
audio-only tour.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of the tours, the Katz content progresses in a linear
fashion. Bond said future tours might more closely resemble the
structure of a Web site, with a small copy of a work surrounded by
buttons that lead to different content areas. This would allow,
say, someone who already knows Pollock's biography to skip it.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallery Explorer program has already evolved since an early
field test in July for about 50 users during the first half of the
American Century exhibition. Scrolling subtitles have been added
for the hearing-impaired, an indication that handheld computers may
someday become multipurpose devices that can be used for audio,
closed-captioned or multimedia tours.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent update is the frequent suggestion to stop staring
at the screen and start looking at the art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, you're standing in front of the artwork with this
thing in your hand, and the natural inclination -- certainly among
younger people -- is to keep your face buried into that screen,''
Bond said. During the first test, ``we just figured people would
get it, they would just intuitively know when they should be
looking at the screen and when they should be engaging the real art
work in front of them. Wrong, big wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The visual prompts work, but they have a curious side-effect.
With the viewer's attention directed to either the art or the
screen, there is little left over for the other people in the room.
Museums are a social space, but during an hour in a crowded
gallery, I rarely noticed my fellow art-lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said the $2,000 tablets would have to become considerably
lighter and cheaper to succeed in the marketplace, particularly in
the cost-conscious world of nonprofit arts institutions. The tablet
PC is based on a Mitsubishi pen computer with a built-in hard
drive, but future versions may retrieve information via radio
waves.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney has no specific plans to use the devices before they
are more fully developed. But Bond said Intel is in discussions
with the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art about using handheld
computers for a future-oriented show scheduled to open there at
midnight on January 1, 2001. David A. Ross, the director of SFMOMA,
has hinted that the exhibit might include Internet-based art works,
and handheld devices might be one way to view them.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sayre, director of museum media and technology at the
Minneapolis Institute of Arts, believes that museums will continue
to incorporate computer technology into the museum-going
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis museum conducted its own five-week experiment
with handheld computers in 1996, using Apple's Newton to lead 1,100
users through its period rooms. The conclusion, Sayre said, was
that the technology was not yet ready, if only because dramatic
lighting in the museum made the Newton's watery display unreadable.
</P>
<P>
   Sayre recently took a tablet PC through the Whitney and was
generally pleased with the results, saying, ``For each person to be
at their own place with that kind of content is really
revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sayre also envisions a day when the computing device is
worn, rather than carried. Already, he said, he has seen
demonstrations of slightly oversized glasses that permit users to
look at an embedded computer display or the world in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   He added that developers need to continue to work on ways to
structure information for such tours, because ``it means a complete
rethinking of how we present this material.''

 TWO 767s INVOLVED IN CRASHES WERE BACK-TO-BACK ON BOEING LINE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Whether it was simply an unfortunate coincidence or
something more, no one yet knows.
</P>
<P>
   But in a strange twist of fate, the EgyptAir 767-300 that
crashed Sunday rolled down the assembly line at Boeing's Everett,
Wash., plant immediately ahead of a Lauda Air 767-300 that crashed
eight years ago when an engine braking device deployed in flight.
</P>
<P>
   The crash of the Lauda Air plane killed all 223 people aboard
when it broke apart in flight and plunged into a jungle in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The two planes would have been among the last produced in
Everett before Boeing machinists walked off the job on Oct. 4,
1989, when negotiations to reach a new contract failed. The strike
lasted 48 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds of having two crashes of planes built in sequence on
our assembly line is obviously very great,'' said a Boeing
spokesman in Everett, where the company's wide-body jets are
produced. ``It was an unfortunate coincidence.'' He asked that his
name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the Lauda Air plane, the only other fatal crash of a
767 was in November 1996 when an Ethiopian Airlines 767-200 was
hijacked and ran out of fuel near a beach in the Comoros islands
killing 116 of the jet's 160 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 770 of the 767s, which today dominate North Atlantic air
routes, have been built since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Webb, Boeing's chief spokesman in Everett, said there is
nothing to suggest the Air Lauda and EgyptAir crashes may be linked
just because the planes were built in sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too early to speculate,'' he said. ``During the course
of the investigation (into the EgyptAir crash), we will look into
every possible scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir plane was the 282nd 767 to be built in Everett. It
was delivered to the airline on Sept. 26, 1989, according to
Boeing. The Lauda Air 767 was plane No. 283 on the assembly line.
It was delivered to the Austrian airline on Oct. 16, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Once a plane has rolled out the factory door, it typically takes
about a month before it is ready to be delivered to the customer.
So production of the Lauda Air plane would have been completed
before the strike. Non-union employees would have performed the
pre-delivery testing.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Boeing labor problems also were a factor or just
coincidence is unknown at this point. But just before the 48-day
strike, many Boeing workers _ especially those in Everett _
complained about job-related stresses stemming from heavy overtime
they were required to work.
</P>
<P>
   Both the EgyptAir and Lauda Air planes were 767-300s, which is a
stretched version of the original 767-200. Boeing is now flight
testing an even longer version called the 767-400, which made it
first flight last month. The 767-400 will enter service next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lauda Air 767 crashed May 26, 1991. It had just taken off
from Bangkok bound for Vienna and was climbing through 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators eventually concluded that a thrust reverser had
deployed on the plane's left engine, sending the two-engine jet
into a steep and fatal dive. It broke apart before hitting the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Both the EgyptAir and Lauda planes were equipped with Pratt &AMP;
Whitney 4080 engines. The engines' thrust reversers _ designed to
match the type of engine _ redirect the exhaust flow from the rear
of the engine and are used to slow a plane once it has landed. They
are never supposed to be used in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing redesigned the device on the 767 and 757 to incorporate a
locking mechanism that it said prevents deployment in flight.
Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration recommended airlines
make similar modifications to the planes already in their fleets.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, however, the National Transportation Safety Board
criticized the FAA for inaction on its recommendation that airlines
be required to inspect all electronically operated thrust reversers
and disconnect them if they could not be controlled in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Webb said Sunday the company was trying to find out if
modifications were made by EgyptAir to the thrust reversers on 767
that crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir jetliner bound for Cairo was at 33,000 feet Sunday
when something happened and it fell from the night sky, hitting the
water within two minutes. Investigators said the pilots made no
distress call.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir plane had completed more than 30,000 flight hours
before the crash, and had made nearly 7,000 flights, Boeing said. A
spokesman for EgyptAir said the plane had flown 33,334 hours and
had not previously reported a breakdown or accident.
</P>
<P>
   As it always does in such cases, Boeing sent a team of its
experts to assist the NTSB in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing posted a brief statement on its web site that said, ``All
of us at Boeing extend our sympathies and condolences to the
families and friends of those involved in this accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crash came on a weekend when Boeing was already under
fire for holding back a 1980 report on 747 fuel tank problems. The
report was only recently delivered to the NTSB, which has been
investigating the crash of TWA Flight 800 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The TWA 747 exploded and crashed into the water off Long Island,
N.Y. shortly after taking off from Kennedy Airport. The NTSB
believes the center fuel tank exploded, apparently because of an
electrical spark.
</P>
<P>
   All Boeing planes have similarly designed fuel systems, Boeing
safety spokesman Russ Young said Sunday, while stressing it is too
early to speculate on the cause of the EgyptAir crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of speculation you try and avoid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the 747 and 767 have center fuel tanks. The 767-300 carries
about 16,700 gallons in its wing tanks, and about 8,000 more
gallons in the center tank. Under an FAA directive, airlines are
supposed to inspect the fuel tank systems and wiring to reduce
potential of a spark igniting fuel.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesperson said last night he does not know how far
along that inspection process is.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir crash also comes at a time that Boeing is out
trying to sell the newest member of the 767 family, the 767-400.
</P>
<P>
   The 767-200 entered service in September 1982. The 767-300
program got under way the next year. Boeing stretched the fuselage
by 21 feet so the plane could carry about 40 more passengers.
</P>
<P>
   About 107 of the 767s produced have so far been the -300 series,
Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said it has delivered five 767s to EgyptAir, three of
which are the 767-300. The one that crashed may have been the last
one delivered, a Boeing spokesman said, though that could not be
confirmed with EgyptAir Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Both the -300 and -400 planes carry an ER designation, which
stands for extended range. The maximum range of the 767-300 is
about 7,000 miles. The maximum range of the 767-400 is about 6,480
miles. Those both fall short of 7,600 mile range of the 767-200s.
</P>
<P>
   The 767-300 has the older cockpit with analogue instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The new 767-400 has an upgraded the cockpit that uses the flat,
liquid crystal panel displays found on the 777 and new generation
737.
</P>
<P>
   Since its introduction in the early 1980s, the 767 has become
the dominant airplane used on North Atlantic routes between the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As markets in Asia fragment and airlines there need more planes
for direct city to city service, Boeing believes its 767-400 will
find a home on many of those new routes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to passenger versions of the jet, Boeing also makes
767 freighters. United Parcel Service, for example, flies many
767s. Boeing also makes a military version of the 767 for Japan. It
was designed to replace older 707 AWACS planes flown by the U.S.
Air Force and NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing is planning to offer the 767 as a possible
replacement for the KC-135 tankers flown by the Air Force. The
KC-135 is a modified 707.

   GILA RIVER INDIAN COMMUNITY _ Frustrated with science's
inability to provide relief, the Pima Indians are attacking
diabetes from all sides, creating their own programs with their own
resources. At stake, leaders say, is the community's survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we've come to realize is that we're going to
have to do it for ourselves, and we're moving in that direction,''
said Kristina Morago, a Community Council member.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the children of St. Peter's Indian Mission School,
where running is required and broccoli is mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Twice each day, the children run laps around the schoolyard.
They are fed healthful breakfasts and lunches with plenty of
vegetables, prepared from scratch on the premises by cooks who cut
the fat, salt and sugar. They also attend weekly classes on
physical fitness and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   After nine years, the experiment in prevention on the Gila River
Reservation south of Phoenix is paying dividends. Only one of the
175 students has diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not lean and mean, they're just physically fit, and
that in itself has protected the children a little bit more (from
diabetes),'' said Karmen Booth, health education coordinator for
the Gila River Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter's program, for children in kindergarten through eighth
grade, has become a model of success.
</P>
<P>
   It is one example of how Pimas in Arizona are fighting back
against Type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that affects more
than half of all adults in the community and an increasing number
of children.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that until they can pinpoint the underlying cause
of the illness, sure-fire prevention isn't possible.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing to do in the meantime is attack the risk factors
_ the obesity, lack of exercise and fatty diet that are known to
increase the chances of developing diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pimas are responding with tribal programs that encourage
healthful eating, exercise and diabetes education.
</P>
<P>
   Morago says such tribal activism on health issues was almost
non-existent before 1995. But these days on the reservation, the
new attitude toward diabetes is spreading.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, tribal leaders are speaking out, encouraging
people to forget about a magic bullet from science and take control
of their fate.
</P>
<P>
   People are listening.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Lucero, a warehouse manager for a tribal housing company,
has shed nearly 200 pounds since he gave up Indian fry bread and
started running and going to the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started working out in December 1995, and I've been at it
ever since,'' said Lucero, part of a disciplined group of Pimas who
are getting fit. ``I was a 60-inch waist, and I've gone down to
42.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribe offers support in various forms.
</P>
<P>
   Council leaders have begun spending money to add sports
facilities. Proceeds from the tribe's two casinos have been used to
build new community ballfields. And tobacco tax funds have gone
into remodeling a gym in Sacaton that includes an indoor basketball
court, locker rooms and a fitness center filled with the latest
exercise equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The new emphasis on health also is displayed at tribe-sponsored
meetings and community events. By council decree, the food served
at such gatherings must include healthful snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Those with advanced diabetes get special attention. Patient
advocates are being assigned to make home visits to people
undergoing kidney dialysis. Homemakers are volunteering to help
disabled diabetics with their cooking and household chores.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere has the effort been as intense as it is at St.
Peter's, where the curriculum emphasizes exercise and nutrition as
much as reading and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Martha Carpenter, the principal, starts the day by
jogging along with the kids, her black veil flapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them we do this for the health of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Students also learn they must eat every bit of the breakfasts
and lunches served.
</P>
<P>
   When one little boy couldn't stomach broccoli after he arrived
at the school, Sister Martha became his daily lunch date, cajoling
and eating with him until he learned to clean his plate.
</P>
<P>
   She became a personal coach for an eighth-grader who disliked
jogging, doing laps with him and cheering him around the field.
</P>
<P>
   All this seems to have instilled a love for activity in the
students, most of whom go out for after-school soccer and
basketball teams. Saturday ``fun runs'' hosted by the school
several times a year typically draw 100 students, plus family
members.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Catholic nuns' crusade to save their students
from diabetes, the children are offered fruit breaks twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a semester, they are weighed and measured by a physical
education teacher on guard for excess pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The added attention to the children is well-placed.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, diabetes had almost exclusively afflicted adults
in the Gila River community. But in the 1980s, an alarming new
trend emerged: The disease was striking children.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 50 Gila River children with diabetes, the
largest cluster of children with Type 2 in the world, said Valerie
Cook, a nurse practitioner assigned to help prevent diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; With the help of tobacco tax money allocated by tribal leaders,
Cook has begun applying the successful techniques of St. Peter's to
public schools. Working with tribal dietitian Joanne Hurley, Cook
designed a program called Quest to teach healthful habits to
students in kindergarten through second grade.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In 1996, Hurley and Cook began giving twice-weekly lessons to
children at one grade school, teaching them how good nutrition and
exercise protect against diabetes. Soon, teachers began taking
daily one-mile walks with the children. Students were given
take-home lessons to share with their families.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hurley drew up modified school lunch and breakfast menus that
go light on the sugar, fat and starch. She won approval for the
changes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Last year, Quest was expanded to four schools. A staff of
diabetes educators now works with Cook and Hurley. It will be
several years before results can be quantified, but tribal medical
personnel and leaders are hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Diet and exercise are already paying off for Dallas Salkey, a
casino worker.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Salkey was nearing 600 pounds and his 30th
birthday when his doctor warned that he needed to change his eating
habits and get moving if he wanted to reach 40.
</P>
<P>
   Salkey took the warning to heart. He had seen family members,
including Sister Juana Lucero, a nun who teaches at St. Peter's,
battle the complications of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real heavy guy, and it used to be hard for me to move,''
he said. ``Just getting out of bed in the morning would get me out
of breath, and getting dressed would get my heart rate up.''
</P>
<P>
   He was taking four pills a day to control his diabetes and
continual doses of ibuprofen to ease the pain in his legs and feet.
Salkey knew it was going to be tough, but he decided to make
changes.
</P>
<P>
   With encouragement and coaching from the trainers at the tribe's
gym, he began a walking and modified exercise program. He gave up
alcohol, switched to artificial sweeteners and cut down his food
portions.
</P>
<P>
   In the first seven months, he lost nearly 80 pounds and began to
feel a world of difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not on medication anymore,'' he boasted one day at the
gym. ``Now, I'm just on diet and exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   By taking up new healthful habits, Salkey and other Pimas are
controlling their blood sugar and blood pressure, two key factors
in keeping diabetes at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Their success is giving other Pima hope that they can take
control of their lives and defeat diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that it's easy for me every day,'' Salkey said.
``It's hard. I've still got a long way to go. But at least I'm not
where I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies among healthy Pimas living a traditional rural lifestyle
in a Mexican mountain village suggest that heavy physical exercise
and a simple diet can substantially reduce the occurrence of Type 2
diabetes, even among people genetically susceptible to it.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the new programs to prevent diabetes on the Gila
River Reservation, eating right can be downright daunting.
</P>
<P>
   There are no supermarkets here, only convenience stores that are
stockpiled with endless varieties of chips, candy and sodas. Fresh
fruits and vegetables are in meager supply in the minimarts.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't any fast-food outlets on the reservation, but it's
easy to find high-fat foods, such as Indian fry bread and tamales,
being sold from parking lots and roadside stands.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who really wants to indulge can go to the tribe's
casinos, where for $8 you can pick up a 13-inch plate and load up
on the dinner buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Getting exercise is another hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the improvements, community sports facilities and
programs are limited at Gila River.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one gymnasium. Although it has state-of-the-art
equipment, an array of sports programs and trainers, it is on the
southern end of a sprawling reservation that lacks public
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Organized sports and exercise classes are sporadic and not
available in all parts of the community. For now, becoming active
is largely an individual and uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   Given such obstacles and human nature, medical workers realize
that persuading people to change their habits is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Bennett, chief of the National Institutes of Health's
Pima studies, says a case in point is the medical community's
attempt to warn people about the connection between smoking and
lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we've known for 20 years that there are advantages
to giving up smoking,'' he said. But although everyone has heard
the advice, there are those who smoke until their dying breath.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, he said, ``The American population at large is
getting more and more obese in spite of all the knowledge that
obesity is not good for health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the general American population has a hard time
with things like weight loss, is it reasonable to expect that you
can convince people to make changes to prevent or slow diabetes?''
