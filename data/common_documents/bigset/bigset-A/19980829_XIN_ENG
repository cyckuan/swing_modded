<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Agreed on Key Proposals Amid Economic Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
agreed on the key proposals of the government and the parliament
on measures to overcome the country's economic crisis, Acting
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after a Kremlin meeting Friday with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, Chairman of the Federation Council Yegor
Stroyev and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov on measures to stabilize the
domestic situation.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also called for concerted efforts by the
government and the parliament in the face of the economic trouble
which came to a peak last week when Russia defaulted on some
international debts and devalued the ruble.
</P>
<P>
"Bargaining over anti-crisis documents is out of place," said
Chernomyrdin, adding the president was ready to express his
support for the anti-crisis initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin's words were echoed by Yegor Stroyev, chairman of
the Federation Council, the upper house of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"During the meeting we reached an agreement on a political
statement for all the branches of power," Stroyev said. "The
destiny of the state is more important than personal ambitions."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the two political documents drafted by the
trilateral commission in the Duma, lower house of the parliament,
Stroyev expressed confidence that a coordinated program to
overcome the crisis would be found.
</P>
<P>
He said the most essential thing was that all branches of
the government work together.
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Yyri Luzhkov said, "Each of us may have his
own ambitions, but when national interests are on the agenda, we
put these ambitions as far aside as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Do not look for differences between us. There are none."
</P>
<P>
The Russian government was entirely dismissed by the president
on August 23. Yeltsin nominated Chernomyrdin as prime minister a
day later, asking the State Duma to confirm his nomination.
</P>
<P>
The Council of the Duma insisted that before confirmation of
the president's nominee, two political documents should be worked
out, namely the agreement on economic policy and the political
accord. The two documents have been drafted out by the tripartite
commission.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Says He Plans to Complete Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin has indicated that he will not resign before the year of
2000 despite the political and economic crisis, a U.S. official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin briefed U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
of his decision in a meeting in Moscow earlier on Friday, said the
official, who is with President Bill Clinton vacationing in the
Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
"Yeltsin told Secretary Talbott that he was planning to finish
his term in office," the official said. The term ends in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has spread around Russia and rest of the world that
Yeltsin would resign amid a deepening financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Talbott and Yeltsin lasted about 15
minutes, said the official, adding Yeltsin "seemed very eager and
looking forward to the meeting" next week with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting itself was on summit preparations. The president
(Yeltsin) obviously was well aware of the summit preparations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The White House has repeatedly said that Clinton will visit
Russia and have the summit with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis is becoming worse after Yeltsin dismissed
the government of Sergei Kiriyenko more than one week ago and
reinstated Viktor Chernomyrdin as the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> European Finance Ministers Urge Moscow to Stick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Finance Ministers of the four
European members of the Group of Seven (G-7) Western
industrialized countries have made a joint call on Russia to hold
on to its reform program in order to take the country out of the
current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel and his European
counterparts, Dominique Strauss-Kahn of France, Gordon Brown of
Britain and Carlo Ciampi of Italy, made the appeal in a joint
letter to Russian Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
German Finance Ministry said in a statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
While pledging solidarity with Russia, the finance ministers
agreed that it was now decisive for Russia to strengthen the basis
of its public finance through a fair taxation system and to take
further measures to restore the stability of its financial system,
the German Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also urged the Russian central bank to pursue an
independent, stability-oriented monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The complete implementation of the structural reforms agreed
with the International Monetary Fund was the best way to sustain
growth and social stability in Russia, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Calls for Ceasefire in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe had called for a ceasefire in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), South African Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a welcome move as it will strengthen the SADC
(Southern African Development Community) countries' efforts to
bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the DRC," South
African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Pahad as saying in
Durban, a port city in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We really welcome this move by President Mugabe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe had insisted on military intervention and sent troops
to the DRC to help embattled President Laurent Kabila, while
South Africa pushed hard for a peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said South Africa was worried about the continuing
conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"It is for this reason that we will push for a debate on the
situation in Congo at this NAM (Non-Aligned Movement) summit," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Kampala Beefs up Security After Blasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Police forces of Uganda's
capital have beefed up security in many areas in the wake of the
recent blasts to protect the interests of people, a senior police
commander told Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Namanya, the police commander of the Kampala region,
said the best way to avoid more disastrous blasts is to make
people alert.
</P>
<P>
To sensitize civilians in this aspect, they used various forms
of media to educate people living in the capital city. Leaflets
have been distributed to show the suspicious parcels.
</P>
<P>
Only when people know where the dangers lie can they be best
protected, he said, adding that they do not have enough police
men to be deployed in every corner of the city.
</P>
<P>
Police are also encouraged to give tips to the grassroots
people.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in some vulnerable areas, more police force is
deployed. But Namanya declined to say the exact scale of
reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
Following bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, capitals of
Kenya and Tanzania, some embassies here received threats from
terrorists. The parliament avenue, where the U.S. embassy and
British High Commission are located, is partly closed to some
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday and Wednesday this week, some 30 people were killed
by bombs allegedly planted on buses traveling to different
destinations from Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism is a new kind of crime in Uganda, the police
commander said. But we are confident that we can defeat it, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Records Low Growth in Manufacturing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's manufacturing sector
experienced a marginal growth of 2.5 percent last year in
Manufacturing Value Added (MVA), according to a U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
The report just issued by the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) said the performance placed
Nigeria in the third position among sub-Saharan African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon ranked the first with the growth rate increasing from
7.8 percent in 1996 to 8.4 percent last year while Zimbabwe
recorded a 5.6 percent growth in 1997 which placed it the second.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 report attributed the low growth in manufacturing
sector of Nigeria to economic and political uncertainties in the
west African country in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
An industry survey conducted by This Day newspaper showed that
the past couple of years is tough ones for Nigerian companies in
various sectors, especially those in the productive sector such
as manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered 23 companies in different sectors including
textile, construction, pharmaceutical, food and beverage with the
focus on three key parameters of turnover, profit before tax and
profit margin.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 23 companies, the survey said, 12 or 52 percent had
positive growth in their turnover while the others recorded
negative growth with the highest turnover decline by 41.64
percent.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the profit before tax of the studied companies
showed that 11 posted positive growth and 12 had negative growth
in their profit.
</P>
<P>
Some industry leaders like Nigerian Breweries, the most
profitable company in the country, dropped in profits by seven
percent, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Poor purchasing power and infrastructure are the main causes
of the industrial stagnation in productive sector in the past
years in Nigeria, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Reppas: Drachma's Entry Into EU' ERM Strengthens Greek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Greek national currency's
entry into the European Union's exchange rate mechanism (ERM)
earlier this year had helped protect the Greek domestic market
from the worst fallout in a Russian financial crisis that has
badly affected the world markets, a Greek government official said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a cabinet meeting chaired by Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
that Greece was better prepared than ever to meet a financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
It was a blessing that Greece was a member of the ERM as the
national economy was receiving the impact of the crisis
indirectly, but was in no worse a position than other developed
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
While calling on investors to stay calm in order to avoid
jeopardizing the economic gains the Greek government had secured,
Reppas admitted that some structural changes in the Greek economy
were affected but the government's program and planning remained
the same. That was promoting flotations, privatization and
revitalization of the broader public sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
Greek National Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou
Friday also said that the drachma's entry to the ERM had
strengthened the Greek economy's credibility abroad and was
working as "a shield against the current crisis."
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the Greek market remained undervalued and
forecast a return of the Athens bourse to higher levels.
</P>
<P>
In March, drachma entered the ERM as part of efforts made by
the Greek government to join the European Economic and Monetary
Union in 2001.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Greek equities came under severe pressure and
registered their largest ever point drop to finish with the Athens
Stock Exchange's general index plunging 7.7 percent or 190.42
points to 2,281.33 from Wednesday's 2,471.88 close.
</P>
<P>
After concerted buying intervention by the brokerage
subsidiaries of state banks on Friday, the general index ended
4.89 percent down at 2,169.83 points.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Economy Continues Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The economy of Cyprus continued
its revival in the first half of 1998, due to expansions of
exports and domestic demands, an official report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by the Statistics Department said the
composite leading indicator showing the trends of the overall
economic activities has been on the rise since mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Not only the tourism but also the service sectors in general
are expected to witness a high rate of growth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Construction, which went through a slump last year, is showing
a recovery with a 3.9 percent increase in the volume of building
permits issued in the first five months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector is also picking up due to expansions
of foreign and domestic demands.
</P>
<P>
The domestic demands for manufacturing products rose by 8.3
percent in the first four months of the year. And exports soared
in cigarettes, plastic products, footwear, furniture, cosmetics,
lighting fixtures, cheese and clothing.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the economic revival, Cyprus' unemployment rate
fell to 3.2 percent, 0.1 percentage points lower than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicle registrations in the first half of this year
jumped to 19,688, 22.8 percent more than the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The report said the tourism industry is booming with nearly a 5
percent rise in the number of tourists visiting the Mediterranean
island in the first six months from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism accounts for 20 percent of Cyprus' gross domestic
product, the country's main source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' economic growth rate slowed down to 1.9 percent in 1996
from 6 percent in 1995 due to a severe drought and a slump in
tourism.

MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
stated on Friday evening that "I will never resign and will not
run for the presidential elections in 2000 year."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Russian Television Yeltsin said that
the government should be concentrated on implementing the
stabilization program and decide cadre problem.
</P>
<P>
On the monetary crisis, the President noted that he, as a
president, will make every effort to save citizens loss. He
pledged to reduce the monetary losses to minimum.

<HEADLINE> Germany Says It Does Not Expect Russian Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- German government officials and
leading economic institutes said Friday they did not expect that
the Russian financial crisis would dampen Germany's economic
recovery, in the short run at least.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference of his Christian Social Union (CSU)
party in Munich, German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said that the
German government had no reason to revise downwards its forecast
for the German economic growth this year because of the Russian
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Similar view was also voiced by German Economics Minister
Guenter Rexrodt on Friday, who said that Russia's economic links
with Germany were too minimal to pose a threat to the German
economy.
</P>
<P>
Wolfram Schrettl, an economist of the German Institute for
Economic Research in Berlin, also said that because of its
relatively small economic scale, the Russian crisis alone would
not exert great impact on the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The actual problems should be found elsewhere, especially in
Japan, which had made too little efforts to counter its own
crisis, Schrettl said in an interview with the German news agency
DPA.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that if Japan, as well as Europe and the United
States still stood on the sidelines, the Russian crisis could
develop into a real problem.
</P>
<P>
Another leading German economic institute, the IW institute in
Cologne, also said that it would hold on to its earlier prediction
of a near three percent growth for the German economy this year.
</P>
<P>
It expressed the belief that the Russian financial crisis and
the one in Asia were manageable through coordinated international
countermeasures.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Economy Grows by 50 Percent Over Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's economy has
grown by fifty percent over the last five and six years, Fayez
Omar, outgoing World Bank resident representative said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Omar, who has completed his five years and eight months
assignment in Ethiopia, made these remarks at a press conference
held at the World Bank resident mission to introduce new resident
representative Nigel Roberts.
</P>
<P>
Omar said Ethiopia will double its economy in 11 and 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 0.5 percent
in 1997/98 fiscal year as a result of a big decrease in
agricultural production. The GDP growth rate for 1998/99 in real
term is projected at 9.4 percent. Agriculture is estimated to be
about 47 percent of the current year GDP.
</P>
<P>
Omar said, Ethiopia is an agriculture-based country and her
agriculture still dependent on rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian agricultural sector is expected to recover this
fiscal year after the unfavorable weather conditions of last
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to relations between Ethiopia and the World Bank,
Omar said Ethiopia is now the biggest beneficiary of World Bank's
loan in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the last year ending June 30, 1998, the World
Bank had provided a total of 660 million U.S. Dollars for
developing projects in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is not only the biggest beneficary of the World Bank
in Africa, but also the tenth larggest in the world, Omar added.
</P>
<P>
The new resident representative of the World Bank, Nigel
Roberts, a British national, joined the World Bank in 1981.

The Pakistani envoy also called on the countries
sharing border with Afghanistan to "join Pakistan in promoting
peace and harmony in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
But he said that "no other country has suffered more from the
conflict in Afghanistan than Pakistan," which has launched peace
initiatives for the neighboring Afghanistan. "Pakistan
has also been the victim of terrorism, drug trafficking and arms
struggling" in the wake of the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pakistani Ambassador condemned Washington's
August 20 missile strikes on alleged terrorist targets in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"This action has caused deep indignation irrespective of the
motives behind the air strikes," and "The violation of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan cannot but be
a matter of grave concern," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has lodged official protest with the Security Council
against the U.S. violation of its airspace as a U.S. cruise
missile went astray into Pakistan. The missile failed to went off.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Tries to Relieve Financial Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz Friday announced economic measures aimed at relieving the
financial market, hit by the latest wave of global selloff.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz told a press conference here that his government will
continue to stick to the set economic programs and will not try to
distort the economy in order to benefit in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that withholding rate in interbank deposits will
reduced to zero from 6 percent, and banking insurance and
transaction tax imposed on commerce of public papers will be
reduced to 1 percent from 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the banking and insurance transaction tax
in currency exchange will be cut from 5 percent to 1 percent, and
limitation on forward exchange transactions will be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said his government, targeting to reduce inflation to 50
percent as of the end of 1998 and to 20 percent by the end of
1999, will "meticulously abide by" the economic program.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which has close trade links with Russia, has decided
not to devalue its currency, despite the ruble tumbled against the
dollar and other currencies.
</P>
<P>
Ankara will give priority to the reformation laws, social
security law and changes in laws related to the arrangement and
control of financial markets, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the government will quickly resort to other,
additional measures to ensure the implementation of its economic
programs, if necessary.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader in Ethiopia for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin held discussions Friday with Hussein Aideed, leader
of the Somali National Movement in south Mogadishu, who was
invited by the Ethiopian government.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Seyoum said Ethiopia will step up its
efforts to sustainably settle the crisis in Somalia, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia will continue its support to the establishment of a
stable and sovereign government in Somalia, pledged the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without central authority since 1991 and is
fractured into clan-based fiefdoms.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesperson as saying
that the Sodere peace initiative was mentioned as a case in point
during their discussions.
</P>
<P>
The Sodere agreement has not, however, produced the desired
results because the movement led by Hussein Aideed did not take
part in the meeting, said the spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was reached by 26 Somali factions at Ethiopia's
resort site of Sodere, some 130 kms away of capital Addis Ababa
in January, 1997, in the absence of Hussein Aideed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson noted that Ethiopia, in line with the mandate
given to it by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), has
endeavored to settle the crisis peacefully in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has exerted efforts to bring on board the movement,
he said, adding Ethiopia has not lost contact with the movement,
although the movement boycotted the Sodere reconciliation
conference.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi also met Hussein
Aideed Friday, said the news agency.
</P>
<P>
This was the first high level meeting between Ethiopia and
Hussein Aideed's movement since the end of 1995 when he assumed
chairmanship of the movement following his father's death, said
the spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
Meles also told Hussein Aideed that Ethiopia supports the
principle of all-party involvement in the Somali peace process
for the establishment of a broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
Rival factions agreed to work for a united government at an
Arab-sponsored meeting in Cairo last December.
</P>
<P>
But an all-party conference scheduled to take place in the
Somali town of Baidoa last week has been delayed and is now
planned for January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman believed that Hussein Aideed's current visit is
important and will help bridge the gap. It will also facilitate
Ethiopia's effort to resolve the problem peacefully in the Horn
of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aideed arrived here Thursday night for an official
visit to Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> GCC Members Agree on Custom Union Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have agreed on a timetable for the
establishment of a customs union of the group, the Kuwait News
Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers proposed that customs union be formed by March
2001, sources close to a meeting of the ministers told the news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The minister were holding an extraordinary meeting in Jeddah,
Saudi Arabia, to assess the latest efforts aimed at setting up the
customs union.
</P>
<P>
Three phases will proceed the deadline, the sources said,
without going into the details of the phases or the classification
of rest of the goods related to the formation of the customs union.
</P>
<P>
So far 149 out of the 1,289 commodities have yet to be
categorized due to the reservations of Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The commodities which have been classified fall into three
categories, namely those exempted from tariffs, basic goods with
tariffs ranging from 4 to 12 percent, and other goods.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states have wide gaps over customs unification due to
differences in each country's economic priorities, which have
blocked an agreement on the customs union ever since it was signed
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance set up in
1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
UAE.

<P>
The European Union urged Libya to accept the arrangement and to

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece to Work for Reviving Cyprus Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Defense Minister
Yiannakis Omirou said on Friday that Nicosia and Athens will join
efforts to revive the Cyprus peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon returning from Athens, Omirou said
political moves and initiatives concerning the Cyprus issue were
decided at their latest summit between Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, Cyprus and Greece will take steps aimed
at resuming a productive dialog which would lead to a settlement
of the Cyprus problem or a dialog on security issues to reduce
tensions on the island with an aim of realizing demilitarization,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish
Cypriots broke down last summer after Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash walked out to protest European Union's decision to start
accession talks the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island after an abortive coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is maintaining more than 35,000 troops in northern
Cyprus, where the Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway
Turkish Republic recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Omirou said the two allies have rejected the accusation made by
foreign countries that the Cyprus problem is one of arms purchases
by the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus reached a deal with Russia in 1997 to buy anti-aircraft
missiles reportedly scheduled to be delivered and deployed in
November.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has strongly opposed the deal and threatened military
strikes against the missiles if deployed. The United States and
Britain have also criticized Cyprus for aggravating the tensions.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot minister said that his country and Greece have
underlined that the Cyprus problem is that of "invasion and
occupation" and Turkey's refusal to comply with the United Nations
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government is committed to defending Cyprus in case
of a military threat and has voiced support for its sovereign
right to build defense, Omirou said.
</P>
<P>
Under a defense pact between the two countries, Greece will
provide military aid to Cyprus if the island is attacked.

confirmation of it."

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said on Friday that it
will not change its position of opposing the deployment of the
Russian-made S-300 missiles on the divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Ankara
will not allow the missile deal to become a bargaining issue as
the missiles threaten both Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots in
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third after a failed coup by the
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. Turkey is maintaining
more than 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 the breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Ankara, against
the internationally acknowledged Republic of Cyprus dominated by
the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that Turkey fully shares and supports the
views of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said in a statement on Friday that the missile issue
is a problem created by Greece and the Greek Cypriots, which he
said should bear the responsibility for the outcome caused by the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia last year to buy anti-aircraft
missiles. This has triggered strong opposition from Turkish
Cypriots and Turkey. Ankara has threatened military strikes
against the missiles if they are deployed.

<HEADLINE> 4,000 Congolese Rebels Killed, Injured or </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government Friday
said over 4,000 rebels have been killed, wounded or captured by
the forces of the three southern African nations helping the
Democratic Congolese (DRC) government in its fight.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe News Agency ZIANA, quoted a government spokesman as
saying that rebel losses were half of their total strengths in
the southwest where they opened a second frontline to march on
the Congolese capital Kinshasa soon after they took up arms in
the east on August 2.
</P>
<P>
The claim follows reports from the DRC that the rebels have
suffered heavy losses since August 20 when Angola, Namibia and
Zimbabwe made the controversial decision to intervene militarily
on the side of President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, The Zimbabwe Independent, a private-owned weekly
newspaper, said two more battalions of about 1,000 men each have
been dispatched to Kinshasa following heavy fighting Wednesday
outside the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The weekly, quoting military sources, said that the Zimbabwean
government has also put 2,200 specialized airborne troops on
standby for the war in the former Zaire, where ethnic Tutsi-led
rebels fighting to oust Kabila claimed to have killed at least 50
Zimbabwean soldiers.
</P>
<P>
It said that the total Zimbabwean strength is now 2,800 men in
Congo, Africa's third largest country. Also sent to Congo are
tanks and Brazilian-manufactured armored cars.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of invading to help the
Banyamulenge rebels but the two deny the charge.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela is trying to mediate
and urged the two sides to stop fighting but Kabila calls on the
rebels to lay down their arms and surrender.
</P>
<P>
The weekly estimated that the Zimbabwean government is now
spending 30 million Zimbabwean Dollars or 1.2 million U.S.
Dollars a day on the war in which six countries have been
involved. Some fear that the war in Congo might become a regional
one if it is not curbed.

ADDIS ABABA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of displaced
Ethiopians of the border conflict with Eritrea has risen to
204,630, an Ethiopian government spokesperson said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Selome Taddesse said in a statement issued here that "to date
the number of Ethiopians expelled from Eritrea has risen to
14,938."
</P>
<P>
And the number of internally displaced as a result of
"Eritrean occupation" has risen to 189,692, Taddesse said.
</P>
<P>
"This brings the total of displaced as a result of Eritrean
aggression to 204,630," she claimed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "thousands of others are still being held hostage
within Eritrea -- mainly in Assab, Massawa and Asmara," the
spokesperson charged, adding that "we urge the international
community to push for the safe return to Ethiopia of Ethiopians."
</P>
<P>
She said in another statement Thursday that 34 Ethiopians were
arrested by the Eritrean police on August 23, 1998 and their
whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
Taddesse urged the international community to do all it can to
obtain their release and safe return to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, however, also claimed that up to 17,000 of its
nationals have been expelled by Ethiopia since the border dispute
between the two countries erupted in May, this year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday
rejected Libya's request to negotiate on terms for trial in the
Netherlands of two Libyan suspects in blowing up a Pan Am flight
over Lockerbie, Scotland, demanding immediate turn over of the two
men.
</P>
<P>
Libya's Foreign Ministry earlier Friday called on the United
States, Britain and the Netherlands to enter into negotiations on
judicial procedures for the trial of the two men.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the concerned parties, the United States, Britain
and the Netherlands, to negotiate with it as soon as possible
about the arrangements," the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Washington had no
intention of negotiating any more on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"As you all know, the Security Council last night unanimously
endorsed the proposal by the United States and the United Kingdom
and it should leave no doubt that the only choice for Libya at
this point is immediate compliance," Toiv told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"If (Libyan leader Muammar) Gadhafi is serious, we would expect
the secretary general's notification that the suspects have been
transported to the Netherlands and are in custody," he added.
</P>
<P>
Toiv said the resolution approved by the Security Council
provided a suspension of U.N. sanctions against Libya once the
Lockerbie suspects arrived in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
But he also warned that if the suspects did not appear in the
Netherlands promptly, the United Nations would impose additional
measures against Libya.
</P>
<P>
"Our sole motivation here is to seek justice on behalf of the
victims and families of the Pan Am 103 tragedy," he said.

The weekly estimated that the Zimbabwean government is now
spending 30 million Zimbabwean Dollars or 1.2 million U.S.
Dollars a day on the war in which six countries have been
involved. Some fear that the war in Congo might become a regional

Rebels in Congo (K) have threatened to blow up the Inga
hydro-electric Dam unless they are allowed to retreat safely
before advancing Angolan forces, an Angolan army Captain who
returned from Congo recently said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Our forces have reached the hydro-electric dam at Inga
where they are negotiating because the rebels say that if they
are not allowed to retreat in safety, they will blow up the
dam," a report from Cabinda, Angola quoted the officer as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Rebels holding the giant dam in the strategic western Congo
river corridor, Kinshasa's gateway to the sea, have cut power
to Kinshasa over the past 11 days, and the Angolan officer also
claimed that Angolan forces had captured the port city of
Matadi.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Has $38m Trade Deficit in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- After successive large
trade surpluses in May and June, South Africa recorded a deficit
of about 38.18 million U.S. Dollars in July, (one U.S. Dollar
equals to 6.6 Rand), customs figures released showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The total exports for the seven months to July at 81.79
billion Rand were higher than imports for the same period at
79.09 billion Rand.
</P>
<P>
And the imports for the July at 14.36 b0 million Rand were
27.5 percent higher over the June figure and 250 million Rand
more than the export for the month.
</P>
<P>
Exports for July only grew 14.5 percent to about 14.11 billion
Rand.
</P>
<P>
Most of the country's aggregate trade surplus to date came
from trade with other African countries. South Africa's exports
to the rest of Africa stood at 10.94 billion Rand for the seven
months, while exports from the continent were at 2.16 billion
Rand.
</P>
<P>
South Africa recorded a 12.7 billion Rand trade deficit in its
dealings with Europe during the same period, and nearly five
billion Rand with North America. South Africa also imported 7.15
billion Rand more from Asia than that continent imported from the
country.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the figures, Standard Bank Investment
Corporation said the July trade deficit was a short-term
development reflecting preemptive buying of imports in
expectation of currency weakness.
</P>
<P>
"We had expected a substantial decline, but remaining positive
at 300 million Rand. The Outlook for the trade balance in the
next few months, however, is favorable," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the expected recovery in the trade balance by
the end of the current quarter would come as a result of import
volumes being subdued by their higher Rand cost and a weaker
domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus would average around one billion Rand a
month in the second half of this year, resulting in a cumulative
surplus of about nine billion Rand for the year.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday adopted unanimously a resolution, calling for a ceasefire
in Afghanistan and an end to "the supply of arms and ammunition to
all parties to the conflict" in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called upon all Afghan warring factions to "stop
fighting, resume negotiations without delay and preconditions, and
cooperate with the aim of creating a broad-based and fully
representative government" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also voiced the Security Council's hope that
"any outside interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan
should cease immediately."
</P>
<P>
The resolution called on all states "to take resolute measures
to prohibit their military personnel from planning and
participating in military operations in Afghanistan and
immediately to end the supply of arms and ammunition to all
parties to the conflict."
</P>
<P>
The resolution reiterated that the Afghan crisis "can be
settled only by peaceful means, through direct negotiations
between the Afghan factions" under the auspices of the United
Nations.
</P>

The resolution urged all Afghan factions, the Taliban in
particular, to "do everything possible to ensure safety and free
movement of the U.N. workers and other international and
humanitarian personnel.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Afghanistan was recently worsened by the
Taliban's in northern parts of the country, resulting in a serious
and growing threat to regional and international peace and
security, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, a U.N. spokesman, said that the United Nations
was withdrawing its workers out of Afghanistan due to worsening
situation in the country.

<HEADLINE> GCC Urges World Effort to Combat Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) on Friday expressed concern over the repercussions
resulting from striking terrorist-related facilities.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the conclusion of their 68th meeting
in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the GCC foreign ministers stressed the
need to combat terrorism through the mechanisms of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that while GCC realized the motives behind
the retaliatory measures, it voiced worry at their repercussions,
the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The United States fired cruise missiles at what it called
terrorist-related facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan a week ago
in response to the twin bombings at its embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania early this month, which killed more than 250 people,
including 12 Americans, and wounded over 5,000.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to combat terrorism lies in a concerted
international action which ensures the annihilation of terrorism,
the security and stability of societies and the sovereignty of
states," it said.
</P>
<P>
GCC also called for "adopting all international legal measures
to combat terrorism and face the parties who provide safe heaven
to terrorists," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which was read by GCC Secretary General Jamil
Hujeilan, condemned the bombings and terrorism regardless of its
origins.
</P>
<P>
It called for denying refuge to terrorist and extremist
elements and barring them from using the lands and laws of the
countries they are in to practice subversive acts.
</P>
<P>
The statement voiced regret and concern over the fact "some
states, which are bound by friendly ties and common interests
with GCC states, are giving shelter and sometimes political
refuge to these elements."
</P>
<P>
During their two-day meeting, the GCC foreign ministers also
discussed the Middle East peace process, the relations with Iran
and the latest crisis between the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic group, comprises
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Qatar.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday received an unqualified vote of support from black civil
rights activists in Oak Bluffs, Massachusettes.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, my friend, my brother... I will stand with you

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Urged to Help Resolve Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Greek Deputy Foreign Minister
Yiannos Kranidiotis urged Saturday the European Union (EU) and the
United States to help settle the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the European Socialist Party's "Summer University"
in Halkidiki, northern Greece, Kranidiotis stressed the need of an
international initiative to defuse tension, restart intercommunal
dialogue and reduce armaments on the divide island, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU and the U.S. must work toward a solution of
this international problem, which stems from the continued
occupation by Turkey of northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis accused Turkey of transforming Cyprus into "a major
area of instability and conflict" and turning northern Cyprus into
"the most militarized zone of the world."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus's entry into the EU, he said, could serve as a catalyst
in the effort to find a just and viable solution to the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Greek-Turkish relations, the minister
reiterated that Athens is willing to resolve peacefully its
differences with neighboring Turkey within the framework of
international law and treaties.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey are at odds for decades over their disputes
in the territorial waters, air space limits, the delimitation of
continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Currently, tensions on the island have risen markedly as the
planned deployment date for the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles approaches.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has warned that it will use force to prevent the
installation of the missiles because they threaten the security in
both Turkey and northern Cyprus, which declared independence in
1983 but is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Despite continued pressure from Washington and Turkey for the
cancellation of the deployment, leaders of Greece and Cyprus
announced here this week that they have not made any decision to
postpone the installation of the missiles. In the meantime, both
leaders said that they are ready to confront jointly any threat
from Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Jiashi Residents Master Tremors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A typical day in Jiashi County
sees children swimming and the canal, housewives completing chores
in earthquake shelters, carts drawn by donkeys plodding slowly
down the road and Uygur farmers hawking local specialties such as
fruit, vegetables, sheep and cattle in local bazaars.
</P>
<P>
The daily routine in Jiashi, located in the western part of
China's remote Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, appears normal..
</P>
<P>
The calm demeanor of local residents makes it hard to believe
that the county has experienced more than 30,000 earthquake
tremors, including 11 quakes measuring six or above on the Richter
Scale, since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The most recent quake, measuring 6.6 on the Richter Scale, hit
the area on Thursday, killing three villagers and destroying over
3,000 houses. None the less not one of the 290,000 local residents
exhibited fear or fled for life.
</P>
<P>
Local villagers nonchalantly talk about earthquakes as if they
were nothing more than an unruly and sometimes destructive child.
</P>
<P>
"Earthquakes are natural disasters which are beyond our
control," said Emar, adding "that we can, however, rebuild
collapsed houses."
</P>
<P>
Mamuti was back to work in his cotton field the day after the
quake. "We're accustomed to earthquakes which have hit frequently
in recent years," he said, adding that he hopes to earn 20,000
yuan from this year's cotton crop. He said part of the money will
used to rebuild his house.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Amat jokes: "Outsiders consider people here to be
somewhat weird since they remained perfectly calm during such a
strong earthquake." However, he points out that the calmness has
resulted from years of experience with earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
He said, many local residents enjoy teaching visitors how to
survive an earthquake, "Don't be worried during an
earthquake. Tremors normally last less than 10 seconds," according
to Amat.
</P>
<P>
Always remember:Never try to run from your home since you might
be hit by falling tiles and bricks. The best way to survive an
earthquake is to find shelter under a table and a bed. Otherwise,
shelter inside a small toilet to avoid flying debris.
</P>
<P>
When outside, simply stay put until the tremor stops.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- This year's eighth flood crest
along the Yangtze River will reach Yichang, Hubei Province, on
August 31, 1998, according to today's circular issued by the State
Anti-flood and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
High water levels resulting from torrential rainfall continues
to haunt areas in the upper reaches of the river, according to the
41st official circular released by the headquarters. Heavy
rainfall has caused rampant flooding along the Jinshajiang,
Minjiang, Tuojiang and Jialingjiang rivers, major tributaries in
the upper reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The flood crest passed the Cuntan Hydrological Station in
Chongqing in the upper reaches of the river at 08:00 today, with a
maximum flow rate hitting 56,200 cu.m./second, and the water level
once again surpassed the flood stage.
</P>
<P>
The water level in the Shishou-Yichang Section, Hubei Province,
rose today, while flood waters in the middle and lower reaches of
the river either remained at yesterday's levels or dropped slowly.
</P>
<P>
The flow rate at Yichang hit 54,000 cu.m./second by 14:00
today. The water level in Shishou was up 0.10 meters with the
level in Shashi rising by 0.02 meters. Water levels in Dongting
Lake and Poyang Lake remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Songhua River flood crest advanced on Fujin in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province today, with the water level rising
to 61.10 meters, thereby breaking the old record by 0.08 meters.
</P>
<P>
However, the water level in Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang
Province, dropped to 120.18 meters by 14:00 today, with the flow
rate standing at 13,400 cu.m./second.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Officials on Alert Against Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has held discussions with senior security
officials on preventing possible attacks on Israeli leaders by
Jewish ultra-rightists, Israel Radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Decisions were made during the discussions on measures to foil
any attempts by ultra-wing Jewish activists to attack the prime
minister, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and other senior
government officials, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports said that some Jewish underground groups are
planning to attack, even assassinate, top Israeli leaders in an
attempt to head off a possible agreement with the Palestinians
over the next Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The extremist groups are also attempting to launch "massive
murder attacks against Arabs in the West Bank" and attack Arab
holy sites to provoke Palestinian retaliation and create "a
spiral of violence that will sabotage the Middle East peace
process," the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources have said that the General Security
Service has given top priority to stopping the Jewish terrorists
rather than Arab terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorist action by our zealots against Muslim shrines is
a hundred times more dangerous for Israel than Muslim car
bombs in downtown Tel Aviv," the sources were quoted as
saying, referring to an explosion in Tel Aviv Thursday which
injured dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
The only English language newspaper The Jerusalem Post quoted a
report as saying Thursday that Mordechai has been singled out for
assassination because he is considered to be the leading moderate
within the government.
</P>
<P>
"I feel in my bones that Yitzhak Rabin's assassination was
not the last political murder in Israel," a security source
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rabin, former premier of the Labor Party that pioneered the
Israeli-Arab peace process, was shot dead in late 1995 by a Jewish
ultra-rightist who opposed his policy of making peace with the
Arabs.

<HEADLINE> Community Forces Attack Bandits in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The strengthened community
forces has launched a massive raid against the heavily-armed
bandits in south Mogadishu, Somalia.
</P>
<P>
During the hour-long attack Friday afternoon, 13 bandits were
caught and 10 guns were confiscated, said a spokesman of the
Islamic Court and the business communities Saturday.
</P>
<P>
One civilian was killed and a bandit was wounded, the
spokesman said, adding that the captured bandits will be tried
according to the Islamic Sharia laws.
</P>
<P>
He warned the bandits at large against their evil activities
before it is too late.
</P>
<P>
Among the bandits caught in the step-up operation is Ali Aden
Gedi, or Ali Peanuts, who is well known for his banditry and
abduction activities.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that more than seven cases of high-profile
kidnapings had been carried out by the man himself in the past
two year. The victims include three workers of the relief
groups.
</P>
<P>
During the raid Friday, both sides used all weapons they
possessed including double-barrel anti-aircraft guns, heavy
machine guns, rocket propelled grenades and assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the anti-bandit operation was prompted by
the merciless killing of a small restaurant owner by bandits.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors told reporters that a group of gunmen had
stormed into the restaurant and ate what they could find and
subsequently killed the owner who asked them to pay.
</P>
<P>
A mall branch of the Islamic Court had tried to fight against
the gunmen, but they could hardly do anything about them until a
major reinforcement arrived to help.
</P>
<P>
Recently, banditry activities occurred rampantly in southern
parts of the war-torn African country.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Reclassify Loss-making State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China has pledged to remove
loss-making state-owned enterprises continuing to incur losses at
the end of this year from the list of key enterprises.
</P>
<P>
All key state-owned enterprises operating in red will be
required to reduce deficits by the end of this year and enter a
profit-making mode during 1999 in order to qualify as key
enterprises, according to Sheng Huaren, minister in charge of the
State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
The total sales of China's 512 key enterprises account
for 61 percent of the total for the nation's industrial sector, as
well as 83 percent of taxes paid and 211 percent of total
profits. Said enterprises also contribute close to 88 percent of
the nation's annual industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that 156 key enterprises operated in the
red during the first half of this year, with certain enterprises'
losses in the billions of yuan. Some enterprises have, in fact,
failed to earn profits for two consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Loss-making key enterprises must be reclassified since their
poor performance prevents them from qualifying as backbones of
the national economy, according to Sheng.

They said they were moved to learn that more than four million

won victories over a series of flood crests and protected the
safety of the property and lives of people along the Yangtze and
Nenjiang rivers.

CPC organizations at different levels have also played an extremely
important role as a bastion in the battle against flooding,
according to the signatories..

The letter disclosed that staffers in the Chinese embassies and
consulates in foreign countries throughout the world have already
donated 3.3 million yuan (397,590 US dollars) to the flood relief
program and plan to donate at least one million yuan (120,481 US
dollars) more to flood-stricken areas.

WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Boris N. Yeltsin asserted on Russian national television
that he would serve out his term as President and that, for him,
resignation was impossible. U.S. President Bill Clinton promised
that the United States would help Russia's leaders and its people
"get through this dark night" of economic and political chaos if
Moscow would do "the disciplined, hard things they have to do to
reform their country."
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the resignation of a
senior American weapons inspector in Iraq had raised "disturbing
questions" about President Bill Clinton's policy and suggested
that Clinton had misled Congress about his commitment to
uncovering the extent of Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chen Cites Significance of Advice Solicitation Program (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chen Ziying, deputy director of
the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, today
cited Macao's September advice solicitation program regarding
formation of the Selection Committee as a significant event in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"Seeking advice represents an important task in forming the
Selection Committee" which will be responsible for forming the
first government of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR),
said Chen, also secretary general of the Preparatory Committee for
the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Prior to leaving for Macao to participate in the solicitation
program, Chen told Xinhua that the Selection Committee, which will
be composed entirely of permanent residents of Macao, will be
critical to the overall situation regarding the return of the
region to China and protecting the interests of all local
residents.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the principle of "catering for the needs of and
relying on Macao people" must be carried out to the letter while
soliciting opinions from local residents from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress (NPC) has stipulated that the
Preparatory Committee for the Macao SAR will be responsible for
forming the Selection Committee for the first SAR government. The
decision also stipulates that Selection Committee will choose the
candidate for the SAR's first chief executive by means of
consultations and nominations after consultation, and will report
to the said selection to the Central Government for appointment.
</P>
<P>
The political subcommittee decided to hold the advice
solicitation program between September 3-6 in Macao to obtain the
opinions of local residents from all walks of life, and guarantee
broad representation in terms of committee membership in accordance
with the NPC decision.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Save $35M in Civil Service Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government could
save some 700 million Zimbabwean Dollars (about 35 million U.S.
Dollars) in salaries per annum by slashing thousands of posts in
civil service, a report reaching here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Zimbabwean Public Service Commission
Chairman Mariyawanda Nzuwan as saying Friday that over 10,000
posts will be frozen in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that 90 percent of the earmarked posts are
occupied while 10 percent of them are still vacant.
</P>
<P>
As part of the restructuring program for its 171,000-strong
civil service, Nzuwan said, his government has rationalized six
ministries, including education, environment and tourism, local
government and national housing, lands and agriculture, and
foreign affairs ministries.
</P>
<P>
The government is also privatizing, commercializing,
sub-contracting services as well as decentralizing its social
services to urban or rural councils, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce costs at Zimbabwe's missions abroad, he
said, 72 foreign posts under the ministry of foreign affairs has
been cut.

<P>
He said participants in the program's 10 meetings will include
representatives from various social organizations registered prior
to the establishment of the Macao SAR Preparatory Committee on May
5, 1998, as well as former political figures, Macao deputies to
the NPC and members of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Chen noted the program will pay special attention to several
key issues, including the principle of forming the Selection
Committee, verification of the qualifications of members and
specific methods involving the formation process.
</P>
<P>
The political subcommittee has sent letters of invitation to
more than 600 social organizations in Macao, said Chen. adding
that other organizations and local residents will also be
permitted to submit opinions to the Preparatory Committee through
other channels both during and after the program.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life in the region are eligible to
submit both verbal and written opinions and suggestions to the
secretariat of the Preparatory Committee and its Macao office,
according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
He said the political subcommittee will use the opinions as the
basis for in-depth analyses and discussions while formulating and
drafting the specific method for forming the Selection Committee
for the first government of thee Macao SAR. The final draft will be
submitted to the plenary session of the Preparatory Committee for
approval.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed the belief that the program will arouse the
enthusiasm of majority local residents to participate in
discussing issues related to the forthcoming transition and will
increase their devotion to the preparations for the Macao SAR.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Futures Exchange Implements New Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Futures Exchange
 (HKFE) will introduce three new measures to prevent the market
from being manipulated and make sure the market will operate in a
fair and orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
The measures will come into force on August 31, 1998, the HKFE
announced at a news conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Exchange will impose a margin surcharge of 150 percent on
all Hang Seng Index futures and options positions of any account
in excess of 10,000 contracts.
</P>
<P>
It means that for those who hold more than 10,000 contracts,
the margin rate on each contract will be raised from 80,000 HK
dollars (about 10,000 U.S. dollars) to 120,000 HK dollars (about
15,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, the HKFE will require members to report their
large open positions at the level of 250 contracts, down from 500
contracts.
</P>
<P>
The third measure is to ask members to identify the holders of
large open positions at the time of reporting to the exchange.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Geoffrey Yeh, chairman of the HKFE, said at the press
conference: "The new measures are introduced because the Exchange
has recently become concerned about the fair and orderly operation
of the Hang Seng Index futures and options markets."
</P>
<P>
Throughout the month of August, the open positions in the
markets were growing at an abnormal rate to very high levels, said
the chairman.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the measures will reduce the chance of market
manipulation, and at the same time, they are balanced and
minimally intrusive on the operation of the markets.
</P>
<P>
The Exchange will continue to monitor its markets closely, and
evaluate whether a futures equivalent position limit of 10,000
contracts is warranted, Yeh added.
</P>
<P>
The new measures were unveiled on the heels of a Friday
showdown, in which the government successfully repelled
international speculators who attempted to profit from massive
selling of August Hang Seng Index futures. A two-week government
intervention frustrated their scheme by pushing the Hang Seng
Index up about 1,200 points.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: Malaysia Will Not Impose Capital Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here Saturday his government will not impose
restrictions on the movement of capital in and out of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention of controlling capital movement," he said
at a press conference after closing the seminar on financial
services products here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir admitted that the resignations of Bank Negara (State
Bank) Governor Ahmad Mohd Don and his deputy Fong Weng Phak were
due to disagreement with the government over monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
"Well, we have some differences, the government has never
agreed to the idea that we should raise the interest rates and dry
up the credit (by the banks) because this would cause contraction
and we have seen the second quarter Gross Domestic Product
figures," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's GDP growth declined by 6.8 percent in the second
quarter this year, much worse than expected, against a 1.8-percent
fall in the growth for the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
The bank governor and his deputy both resigned Friday.

<HEADLINE> Overweighted Audina Little Chance in Asian Games: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Overweighted Indonesian
shuttler Mia Audina will have little chance to make remarkable
performance at the upcoming Asian Games badminton tournament, a
local newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Audina, 165 centimeters high, weighs 65 kilograms, six
kilograms heavier than the ideal 59 kgs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Audina lost to China's Gong Zhichao in mid-August Singapore
Open, where she won the first game 11-0, but surrendered in the
last two.
</P>
<P>
More weight will sap her energy quicker than her agile and
slim Chinese opponents, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Audina's physical trainer hinted that she did not follow the
training plans set by the coaches and hence "take in more
calories than those consumed" the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Games are slated from December 6-20 in Bangkok,
Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa Threatened by Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- After a turbulent week in
the financial market, South Africa now stands on the brink of an
economic recession following another interest rate hike by major
banks.
</P>
<P>
Standard, Absa and NBS Boland banks, three leading banks in
the country, Friday raised their prime overdraft rate from 1.5
percent to 25.5 percent, the highest since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Absa and Standard hiked their home loan rate by a similar
margin to 23.5 percent while NBS Boland lifted its mortgage rate
by two points to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
South Africans now face the bleak prospects of soaring
bankruptcies, worsening unemployment and crippling debt as some
economists warned of an economic recession which could be worse
than the height of sanctions before the demise of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Economists have predicted further rate hikes this year. High
interest rates will mean that people will have less money to
spend and companies will sell less, which will result in cutback
on expansion plans or even lay-off of workers, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless interest rates come down soon, I am quite sure we are
heading for a recession," a senior economist said.
</P>
<P>
Actually, he said, "We are already very close to a recession
since the economic growth stood at 0.25 percent only in the past
year."
</P>
<P>
A recession is defined as two successive three-month periods
of negative economic growth, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate hike came at the end of a hectic week in
which shock waves from political and economic turmoil in Russia
hit South Africa and other emerging markets across the world.
</P>
<P>
The South African currency was sent spinning to new lows
Friday but recovered at the close of trading to 6.41 Rand to the
U.S. Dollar and 10.76 Rand to the British Pound.
</P>
<P>
The recovery came after the Reserve Bank of South Africa
tightened its stance and hitched up its lending rates to the
commercial banks to 21.85 percent from its previously steady
level at 21.37 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rescue measures of the central bank and its
knock-on effect on the commercial banks, the value of shares on
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) was down by 17 percent on
the week and a stunning 40 percent since its highs in April.
</P>
<P>
That put the JSE close to levels last seen in the jittery
period just before the 1994 election. The exchange has lost 210
billion Rand (32.8 billion U.S. Dollars) of its value in the past
week as investors fled to safer havens.
</P>
<P>
And gold, a key product and export of South Africa, which is
usually a safe harbor in times like this, plummeted Friday to a
19-year low of 273.4 U.S. Dollars an ounce. Other commodities
also took a knock.
</P>
<P>
Bond yields, which show how much the government and
state-owned companies such as power utility Eskom must pay for
money they borrow, reached record levels of 21.76 percent Friday
as foreigners bailed out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Since March, the Rand weakness has prompted the Reserve Bank
to raise its lending rate several times, from 14 percent to the
present 21.85 percent. Commercial banks, reeling from the rising
cost of money, also raised their prime rates from 18 percent in
late May.
</P>
<P>
The interest hikes have raised fears that South Africa's
economic growth this year will be throttled back even further
from current forecasts of around 0.5 percent. The government
target is three percent.
</P>
<P>
Adding gloom to South Africa's prospects, the Customs and
Excise announced that the country recorded a 252-million-Rand
(39.4 million U.S. Dollars) deficit in its trade account in July
after two large surpluses in May and June.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's economic growth slowed down to a meager 0.3
percent in the second quarter this year from 0.5 percent in the
first.
</P>
<P>
Consumer inflation accelerated sharply to 6.6 percent in July
from 5.2 percent in June, and further rises were expected in the
following months this year as prices of imported goods rise.
</P>
<P>
With no end in sight for the pandemonium in world markets,
South Africa, part of the global emerging markets, remains
vulnerable to any world financial turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Regulation on Protecting Old Trees Adopted in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua)-- Beijing's legislature has
recently adopted a regulation on protecting its ancient trees
which are suffering the urban expansion programs.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Beijing, capital of China, to issue
legal ordinance to protect the ancient trees instead of publicity
campaigns and measures on fines.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation stipulates that trees over 100 years old are
old trees and those more than 300 years old are first class
ancient trees. Besides, rare trees and trees with special
historical value are labeled as trees of "unique group" under
protection.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Beijing municipal government shows there
are 22,673 trees over 100 years old in downtown areas of the city,
among which 3,800 are more than 300 years old. The suburbs and
surrounding counties have about 40,000 ancient trees.
</P>
<P>
An official of Beijing Bureau of Parks and Woods said that many
of the ancient trees in the city are now suffering heat radiations
from surrounding construction sites and worsening air pollution.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the problems, he said, the Municipal Government has
some buildings removed from the trees or some protecting fences
installed.
</P>
<P>
In Yanqing County in the northern part of Beijing, over 100
gardeners were assigned for its 142 ancient trees and they are
responsible for taking care of them.

<HEADLINE> NAM Senior Officials Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, S.Africa, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The senior officials
meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) opened here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the session, South African Foreign Minister Alfred
B. Nzo paid tribute to Colombian President Ernesto Pizano and the
people of Colombia "for the way in which they have guided our
movement during the challenging and important period of
Colombia's tenure as the movement's chair."
</P>
<P>
Nzo said the challenges that the new century thrusts on the
NAM are more complex than ever.
</P>
<P>
The primary challenges include the globalization and
liberalization of the world economy, sustainable development,
good governance, poverty eradication, the peaceful resolution to
disputes and the deepened interdependence of states, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The new millennium affords us the opportunity of ensuring that
the NAM takes up its rightful place and ensures that the
interests and ambitions of the South are placed firmly on the
agenda of the international community," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is followed by the 12th NAM summit which will
start here on September 2.
</P>
<P>
The Non-Aligned Movement, emerged in the wake of the cold War,
was formed in 1961 in Belgrade with its first meeting attended by
representatives from 25 countries led by then Indian Prime
Minister Jawaherla Nehro, Egyptian President Gemal Abdel Nasser
and Yugoslavian President Josep Tito.
</P>
<P>
The NAM is the biggest demonstration of unity of the world's
nations and their ongoing struggle to attain freedom and assure
their right to social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The main characteristics of the NAM countries are their
opposition to the division of the world into different blocks and
alliances.
</P>
<P>
The movement not only reflects the needs and interests of its
113 member states, but those who aspire, through struggles for
independence and equal rights, to take their proper places among
nations in international venues.
</P>
<P>
It has always been in quest for peace, peaceful coexistence
among nations and active cooperation based on mutual respect for
their interests.
</P>
<P>
The movement has also been striving for the goal of
eliminating the sources of tension and confrontation in
international relations.
</P>
<P>
The NAM has 17 observer countries including China.

their private deposits would be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that the Cabinet and the Central Bank are

</P>
<P>
The worsening financial crisis has sparked panic among
Russians, many of whom feared that the crisis might wipe out their
life savings and rushed to the banks to draw their deposits.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin pointed out that the ruble, which has fallen
drasticly against the U.S. dollar due to the crisis, will be
convertible and that no restrictions on conversion are planned.
</P>
<P>
Russia has already entered into the world economy, the acting
premier said, and there will be no return to the past.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the government was not planning to close
the exchange offices. He added that a black market, in which
nobody pays taxes for currency conversion, will emerge if the
exchanges are closed.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that it was necessary to put a barrier
against illegal currency outflows from the country.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Fate of Missing Diplomats to Influence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has warned that the fate of the missing Iranian diplomats
will influence the relations between Tehran and Islamabad, local
daily Tehran Times reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the warning in a message delivered by Iran's
deputy foreign minister for Asian-Pacific affairs Mohsen Aminzadeh
to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday, Iran's
ambassador to Islamabad Mahdi Akhonzadeh revealed to the daily.
</P>
<P>
"Given Iran-Pakistan close relations, the Iranian nation
expects the government of Pakistan to spare no effort to release
the Iranian diplomats and citizens from the clutches of the
Taliban in Afghanistan," Khatami's message read.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh arrived in Islamabad Friday morning following a
visit to Tehran by the Pakistani Minister of State for foreign
affairs Mohammad Siddique Kanju who delivered a message of Sharif
to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Sharif told Khatami that Pakistan does not want its relations
with Iran to be overshadowed by the issue of Afghanistan, Tehran
Times said. Khatami in reply said that Iran also does not want
this to happen, but "all depends on Pakistan in this regard."
</P>
<P>
"The fate of Iranian diplomats and citizens who were abducted
by the Taliban will influence Iran-Pakistan relations if Pakistan
does not take appropriate measures to ensure their release,"
the Iranian president said in his message.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly demanded the release of 11 Iranian
diplomats, one reporter of the official news agency IRNA and 35
truck drivers allegedly kidnaped by the Taliban earlier this
month in Mazari Sharif, northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban admitted the arrest of 35 truck drivers but denied
knowing the whereabouts of the Iranian diplomats and reporter.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh reiterated on Friday that the recorded contact
between the Iranian consulate in Mazari Sharif proved the
presence of the Iranian diplomats when the Taliban forces were
trying to break into it.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official did not rule out the possibility for Iran
to use force for the release of its nationals, stressing that
Tehran has the right to "resort to any means" for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
(IRGC) Yahya Rahim Safavi announced on Saturday that the IRGC
will launch a grand military maneuver in the northeastern province

<HEADLINE> Iran to Launch Massive Military Maneuver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Amid growing tension between
Iran and the Afghan Taliban militia, Tehran announced on Saturday
to launch a grand military maneuver in northeastern province of
Khorasan bordering Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Commander of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Yehya Rahim Safavi said that
the military exercises would show Iran's determination to
safeguard its land against any possible aggression.
</P>
<P>
Showing the map of the maneuver codenamed as "Ashura-3" to
reporters, Safavi said the war game would be held in an area of
600 square kilometers with the participation of 70,000 troops in
the Torbat-e Jaam region, some 200 kilometers away from the
strategic city of Herat in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC commander said the maneuver would start in the coming
days, but he did not give the exact date of the maneuver and how
long it would last.
</P>
<P>
"It will be the first and the largest maneuver held by the IRGC
in the hot desert region since the victory of the Islamic
Revolution" in 1979, he said.
</P>
<P>
The maneuver is regarded as an obvious warning to the Taliban
militia, who have allegedly kidnaped 11 Iranian diplomats, one
reporter and 35 truck drivers from Mazari Sharif on August 8 when
they seized the city from the Iran-backed opposition the Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Top Iranian leaders have repeatedly warned that Tehran would
not tolerate the captivity of Iranian citizens by the Taliban and
urged the Afghan fundamentalist group to release kidnaped
Iranians as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban denied the captivity of any Iranian
diplomats, but only admitted the arrest of 35 Iranian drivers who
were accused of transporting weapons to the Northern Alliance
headed by the ousted Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Some reports reaching here said that the Taliban forces had
also deployed more than 30,000 troops along the Iranian border to
prepare for any possible attack by Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, Safavi ruled out the possibility of any military
conflicts between Iran and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"Iran will not recognize the Taliban militia, a group
supported by certain foreign countries," he said, "and the group
does not deserve much attention of the IRGC, which has good
experiences from its campaign against the U.S. in the Persian Gulf
and the war with Iraq (1980-88)."
</P>
<P>
Safavi said that the maneuver was aimed at promoting the
IRGC's military knowledge and expertise in defensive planning,
testing the systems and weapons newly introduced in the IRGC.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Tehran followed the tension-reducing policy and
sought for peace, tranquillity and security in all regions,
particularly the Middle East, the Central Asia and the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the insecurity in certain point or
certain country would spread to whole region and other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Gets $1.18M from Treasury Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
has raised nearly seven billion Shillings (some 118 million U.S.
182-day Treasury Bills at the weekly auctions.
</P>
<P>
The largest amount sold was for the popular 91-day bills with
which CBK had raised 6.9 billion Shillings by this week, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The average yield on the 91-days bills was 23.1 percent. CBK
received bids for bills worth 8.2 billion Shillings but only
accepted bids for bills worth 6.9 billion Shillings.
</P>
<P>
There were bids for 182-days bills worth 550 million Shillings
but CBK accepted bids for bills worth 21 million Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The average yield on the 182-days bills was 23.4 percent
slightly lower than the 12 weeks moving average rate of 24.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
CBK has already advertized for the sale of another lot of
Treasury bills to raise eight billion Shillings for the
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Shilling continued to trade within a narrow
band pegged at 59.45 Shillings against one U.S. Dollar in a
balanced market.
</P>
<P>
A reduced appetite for forwards from importers was said to be
responsible for the strengthening of the Shilling. Dealers said
apart from those who are required to hedge against policy, most
corporate customers are taking chances on the spot market.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the majority have already factored in the
Shilling's stability expectations.
</P>
<P>
Rumors were said to be rife that withheld donor aid might
revert before the end of the year and this could have a positive
effect on CBK's efforts to reduce interest rates to manageable
levels.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the rates could drop to around 21-22
percent down from the current 25 percent range.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Warlord Asks Turkey to Use Influence on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Afghan warlord Abdul Rashid
Dostam had asked Turkey to persuade Pakistan against supporting
the Afghan Taliban militia, local Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Dostam arrived here Tuesday to seek support from Turkey for his
Afghan National Islamic Movement.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the newspaper, Dostam said
clashes between his forces and the Taliban have been going on for
more than 50 days, causing many casualties.
</P>
<P>
Dostam, a former general of the Uzbek militia which supported
the former pro-Soviet Afghan government, turned to back Afghan
President Burhanuddin Rabbani after the Taliban forces drove his
government out of the Afghan capital Kabul in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We lost more than one thousand of our men, and we captured 180
Taliban militia. Surprisingly, 72 of them were Pakistani," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Dostam criticized Pakistan and Saudi Arabia of supporting the
Taliban and accused an imbalance in power in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Dostam held talks on Wednesday with high-ranking officials of
the General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces, the Foreign
Ministry and the Organization of the National Intelligence on the
latest developments in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has urged Pakistan, Taliban's strong supporter, to
prevent the Taliban militia from harming the civilians and
innocent people in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said new attacks would be launched against the Taliban
forces.

<HEADLINE> Four Nairobi Bombing Suspects Released: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police have released
four suspects in connection with the August 7 bombing at the U.S.
embassy in Nairobi as two others remained in custody for further
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Among those released is James Muiruri Ng'ang'a, the general
manager of Nairobi's Hill Top Hotel where had lodged some key
suspected bombers and their link-men, the Kenyan police said
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Ng'ang'a, who was released Friday, had been detained for ten
days for interrogation by both the Kenyan Criminal Investigation
Department officers and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
agents in the city.
</P>
<P>
Two key suspects, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali and Mohamed
Saddik Odeh (Howaida) were flown from the Kenyan capital to New
York on Wednesday and Thursday respectively and now are facing
charges by a U.S. federal court with murder and for scheming with
a violent extremist group called al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
The group is believed to be run by Osama bin Laden, an exiled
Saudi-born multi-millionaire accused by the U.S. of financing
numerous acts of violence, including the bombings in Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
If the two suspects are convicted, they could face life in
prison or possibly even the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
The bomb raids in the two east African capitals killed more
than 250 people including 12 Americans, leaving about 5,000
injured.
</P>
<P>
On August 20, the U.S. fired cruise missiles at what it called
"terrorist" training camps in Afghanistan and a plant in the
Sudanese capital of Khartoum in retaliation for the bombings it
blamed on bin Laden.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Public Opinions Incorporated in Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- When Associate Prof. Wang Ziwen
from Zhejiang University came to know that her suggestion was
incorporated in the land management (amendment) law adopted by
China's top legislature today, she described the state of her mind
as "overjoyed."
</P>
<P>
She once wrote to the legislature that adverse ecological
effects should be taken into account in the course of planning
land-use and the adaptability of varying types of lands to cope
with different pollutants should be differentiated.
</P>
<P>
"My proposal, as written into the new law, will create huge
economic and environmental benefits in land-use," she claimed in a
telephone interview today.
</P>
<P>
The draft law on land management has been the first publicized
by the newly inaugurated legislature, the Standing Committee of
the ninth National People's Congress (NPC), to solicit public
views.
</P>
<P>
It was adopted by the legislature here today after repeated
revisions by legislators, including major alterations based on
good suggestions from the general public gathered since May.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said that,
after the law was passed, the pooling of wisdoms from the masses
of people in legislation embodies a form of bringing public
participation into play in running the country.
</P>
<P>
"It enables the law to reflect more of the popular will and
ideas, helps us to make a still better law and further increase
our work efficiency," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts say this new move shows that China is taking a
great leap forward in democratic and scientific legislation.
</P>
<P>
According to conventional practices, a new code is firstly
drafted by legal experts, forwarded to related government bodies
and localities to ask for opinions, and then submitted to
legislators for deliberation. It is then promulgated after several
more revisions.
</P>
<P>
"This procedure can ensure that all the interests are evaluated
and included in the law," Wang Chaoying, section chief of a law
authoring and revision body of the NPC Standing Committee, said.
</P>
<P>
"However, after reading hundreds of letters from society at
large, including professors, farmers and officials at local
levels, we can realize for sure what their common concerns are and
what calls for immediate attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some revisions were made after drawing on useful suggestions of
the letters, for instance one concerning the prohibition of tree
felling for the sake of reclaiming land on mountain slopes, so as
to curb soil erosion, according to him.

<P>
"The Land management (amendment) law is a real law for us
farmers," said Cai Wanneng, chief of Nanfu Village in Shunde City
of Guangdong Province, who was just as excited as Associate
Prof. Wang because his suggestion was, too, included in the new
statute.
</P>
<P>
He cited in his letter the original definition on the rights
and duties of land owners and users as "ambiguous." And in the
final version, and there is an separate chapter in the law that
provides for detailed specifications on land ownership, land
leasing and procedures in settling land disputes.
</P>
<P>
An local official from Guizhou, as well as other people, said
that protection of farmland should be stated as "a fundamental
national policy." Now, these words have been written into the
third article of the new law.
</P>
<P>
There is a host of instances to list. An official with the NPC
Standing Committee said that they have received over 670 mails
from the public, whose advocacies have been classified into some
1000 categories. Since the law has undergone too many revisions,
no one in his office can enumerate how many good ideas have been
included in the final code.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, still more public opinions have been incorporated
into the chapters concerning the protection of farmland, time
limit on land leasing and procedures in authorizing the land use.
</P>
<P>
According to legal experts, China's top legislature has
publicized six other draft laws since 1982, including Draft
Amendments to the Constitution, Draft Law on Administrative
Procedures and the Draft Basic Law on the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
These laws have been considerably improved by the public, they
say.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that allowing the public to directly participate
in the legislation is also a process to educate the public on the
rule of law and is conducive to the improvement of the public
understanding of the law.
</P>
<P>
"Such practices should be adhered to in the years ahead and
further improved with experience accumulated," Li said.

BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, China's top legislature, today
ratified a State Council bill on issuing 100 billion yuan (12
billion US dollars) in treasury bonds.
</P>

China's infrastructural projects in a bid to increase the domestic

Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said that the

projects currently under construction in the use of funds. It also
stressed the projects with important bearing on economic growth,
ecological improvement and anti-flood effort.
</P>

The committee said that the system of strict responsibility
should be established with regard to the use of funds, and the

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Minister Calls for Cease-Fire in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has reiterated
the need for a cease-fire in the raging civil strife in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), calling for a dialog between
the rebel forces and the government.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Defense, Edgar Maokola-Majogo, told a press
conference in Dar es Salaam Friday that "when conflicts occur in
a country it is wise to accumulate joint forces from neighboring
countries for an immediate cease-fire and a political dialog."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister explained that Tanzanian troops did not
get involved in the war between the rebels and DRC President
Laurent Kabila's troops because wherever there is a war there are
innocent people who lose their lives.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tanzania is a peaceful country and is always on
the forefront to maintain peace and tranquility in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he noted, Tanzania would like to suggest warring
parties conduct peace dialog just like the Tanzania proposed
cease-fire in the war-torn Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Maokola-Majogo said that recently President Benjamin Mkapa
sent his foreign minister to present Tanzania's views on
cease-fire at the meetings held in Zimbabwe and South Africa
which were convened by leaders of the 14-nation Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has withdrawn more than 600 soldiers who helped train
the national army of the DRC, in oreder to avoid getting involved
in the civil war of the central African country.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, Maokola-Majogo said that his ministry
will pay greater attention to the influx of refugees from the DRC
and Burundi to make sure that they enter without bearing any
weapons which may threaten the security of Tanzanians.

<HEADLINE> Talks Break, US Northwest Pilots Begin Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Northwest Airlines'
1,700 flights that affect about 150,000 passengers a day were
grounded as the airlines' pilots launched a strike on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The strike, ordered by the union representing 6,200 pilots of
Northwest, began after the talks between the union and the
management on new contract broke off.
</P>
<P>
Tentative agreements had been reached on most contract issues,
but not on job security and compensation.
</P>
<P>
"Northwest management has refused to seriously negotiate,"
Steve Zoller, chairman of the Master Executive Council for the
Northwest branch of the Air Line Pilots Association, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said the company would remain at
the negotiating table as long as it takes.
</P>
<P>
The airline held a news conference prior to the strike
announcement and said it had proposed a "fair offer". But the
offer was rejected by the union.
</P>
<P>
Northwest, a major passenger airline of the United States.
controls 75 percent to 82 percent of the airline seats into
Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis.
</P>
<P>
The hub airports in Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis were calm,
since Northwest announced earlier in the week it was canceling 400
flights on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said that President Bill
Clinton will not intervene, but he urged the parties to stay at
the table to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president has the power to halt a strike for 60 days
if it would deprive any section of the country of essential
transportation service.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Leader Announces Ceasefire With Turkish Government, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan unilaterally declared a
ceasefire with the Turkish government late Friday night, local
newspaper Milliyet reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that addressing the London-based MED TV
controlled by the PKK, Ocalan said that the ceasefire takes
effective as of the "World Peace Day" on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was quoted saying that his organization, after years of
armed struggle, chose a sacred road like peace.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the PKK troops, which suffered a heavy
loss by government forces, are now "in the difficult situation in
fighting against the Turkish Armed Forces."
</P>
<P>
But he said "we will defend ourselves" from any "provocations"
from the government forces.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, set up in April 1979, was declared illegal following
the 1980 military coup. It has staged armed struggle for
independence in southeastern Turkey since August 1984, while the
government troops launch frequent attacks on it.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 PKK members have been killed since the Turkish
government declared state of emergency in southeastern Turkey in
1987.
</P>
<P>
Many PKK members are taking shelters abroad. Ocalan is
reportedly in Syria, but Damascus denies. Some 2,500 PKK members
have been taking shelters in northern Iraq since Baghdad was
rendered ineffective in controlling the area in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also accuses Syria, Greece, Russia, Cyprus and other
countries of providing support for the PKK.

<HEADLINE> Fourth Meeting of NPC Standing Committee Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Two laws concerning higher
education and land management (amendment) respectively were passed
at the Fourth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) today along with a number of
other resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The two laws will both become valid on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The law on higher education, comprising 69 articles, has
specific stipulations on the basic system of higher education, the
set-up of institutions of higher learning, faculty, students and
guaranteed input for education.
</P>
<P>
The law on land-use has concrete specifications on the right to
land ownership and use of land, overall planning, protection of
cropland and land for capital construction.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over
the closing meeting today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the adoption of the law on higher education is of
great significance in terms of the development of China's higher
education and the implementation of strategy of revitalizing the
nation through science and education, both serving the carrying
out of the country's socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He called the land management law a vital one which has a great
impact on the interests of millions of farmers, the subsistence of
the upcoming generations and sustained growth of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also adopted a resolution to approve of the State
Council's issue of state bonds and readjustment of the central
financial budget.
</P>

<HEADLINE> India to Seek Counter-Trade Possibilities With ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- India will explore the
possibilities of counter-trade and trade in local currencies with
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as part of its
strategy to boost the country's trade and investments with ASEAN,
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A business delegation led by India's Commerce Secretary P. P.
Prabhu is currently on a tour of ASEAN countries and is holding
talks with officials of Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines on
the extension of the line of credit of Exim Bank of India.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Indian delegation are having one-to-one meetings
with their counterparts in these countries on such areas as
agricultural commodities, gems and jewelry, chemicals and
pharmaceuticals, software, electronic goods and any other area of
business interest.
</P>
<P>
India's commitment to strengthening trade and investment
relations with ASEAN was made evident by Indian Commerce Minister
Ramakrishna Hegde's recent visit to Singapore, during which he
said India would like to encourage trade on a barter basis.
</P>
<P>
India's trade deficit with ASEAN has risen to more than one
billion U.S. dollars amid worries that India may have to import
more from the regional grouping following the devaluation of some
East Asian countries' currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Indian business delegation's current visit to the region
was aimed at arresting the fall in Indo-ASEAN trade, which dropped
by 2.49 percent in April-May 1998 compared with the corresponding
period of 1997, Indian officials said.

<P>
NANJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors has recently
used a mechanical liver function support system to complete a
successful 11-hour liver transplant for a male patient suffering
from acute hepatic coma.
</P>
<P>
The fact that doctors from the Nanjing Gulou Hospital in
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, successfully
completed the complicated procedure, the first of the kind in the
nation, indicates that the China ranks among the world leaders in
terms of liver transplantations.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the doctors performed the liver transplant on
Xu Xi, 32, a young worker suffering from hepatic cirrhosis and
acute hepatic failure.
</P>
<P>
The doctors used the mechanical system to remove large amounts
of toxic materials and stablize the patient's bodily functions
prior to transplanting the new liver.
</P>
<P>
Xu has regained normal liver functions and is able to both eat
and walk normally. Doctors say Xu will be discharged in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that death rate for patients suffering from
acute hepatic coma stands at over 80 percent.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Men's tennis will ban the
use of androstenedione, the strength-building substance,
according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Health reasons were cited for the decision by Bill Norris,
medical trainer for the ATP, who said the subject became
pertinent after baseball player Mark McGwire acknowledged using
the testosterone-building substance.
</P>
<P>
Norris said Thursday the ban was being put into effect on the
recommendation of Managed Athletic Testing Service, the tour's m
edical consultant. He said he requested an opinion after players
on the tour asked him about the substance.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the substance causes enough potential
side effects, including brittle joint ligaments.
</P>
<P>
People can purchase androstenedione without a prescription. It
has been banned by the NFL, NCAA, the IOC and high school
athletics associations. Norris said the players will be informed
of the ban on Monday when the U.S. Open begins. A ban on the
substance already exists in Grand Slam tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Androstenedione can enhance strength and the ability to
recover from rigorous training and injuries.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Gets WB Loan to Fight Arsenic Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) --The World Bank (WB) has approved a
loan of 32.4 million U.S. dollars to help Bangladesh tackle its
arsenic pollution, The Bangladesh Observer reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to implement the "Fast-track Project," an
arsenic mitigation project designed to provide alternative water
supplies and emergency relief to people living in areas where the
groundwater is contaminated by arsenic.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, the project will initially survey 4,000
arsenic-affected villages, where shallow and deep tube wells,
ponds with filters and rainwater harvesting systems will be
installed. In urban areas, it will monitor water quality in
at-risk cities and support local authorities with remedial
strategies such as alternative water supply and treatment
facilities.
</P>
<P>
At a total cost of 44.4 million dollars, the project will be
jointly funded by the World Bank, Switzerland and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Much of the groundwater in Bangladesh is contaminated with
arsenic, with wells in more than half of the country's 64
districts reportedly having been contaminated with arsenic, mainly
in the southwestern, central and northeastern parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 cases of chronic "arsenicosis" have been reported
in Bangladesh, with at least 1.2 million people exposed to arsenic
poisoning and one-third of the country potentially exposed to
arsenic crisis, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Arsenic poisoning takes between eight to 14 years to become
visible and the effects of arsenic contamination can be treated
and reverse before a certain point.
</P>
<P>
The effects of arsenic poisoning vary from skin pigmentation to
development of warts and ulcers during initial stages of skin,
liver and renal diseases.

PHNOM PENH, August 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 23 people have died
this week of drinking contaminated rice wine in Phnom Penh, the
capital of Cambodia, according to official reports Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances were shuttling between the affected area of Dangkao
district and the center of Phnom Penh, rushing the patients to
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
At Calmette Hospital alone, up to 50 patients were being
treated late Friday afternoon while additional wine victims kept
arriving.
</P>
<P>
Authorities had confiscated wine sold by vendors in the area,
said the police.
</P>
<P>
Dizziness and sweating are main symptoms of poisoning, and in
extreme cases death can occur within hours from respiratory
failure.
</P>
<P>
Investigation was still under way and the results of laboratory
test were not available yet. Some officials thought the
intoxication was most likely caused by insecticide, often added by
retailers and drinkers to increase the effect of alcohol. Yet
other health officials suspected the wine had been tainted with
methyl alcohol.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Hit By World Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Argentina has started to
feel the impact of the world financial crisis, which has been
intensified by the recent devaluation of the Russian currency.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine stock market could not escape the global fears of
a sudden deceleration of economic growth following major losses in
most of the world's stock markets.
</P>
<P>
The Merval Index, which rates the leading stocks in the local
market, dropped more than 10 percent on Thursday, from 605.74
points to 361.05, over 40 percent since July 27.
</P>
<P>
Another negative sign is that now it is almost impossible to
get credit because of high interest rates for loans. Some banks
have already started changing the rules for mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers report that some banks increased the rate
charged to loans in pesos, while others decided to cancel credits
in local currency and only work with dollars.
</P>
<P>
The impact has also been reflected in industrial production,
which fell to 5.9 percent in the first seven months of this year
from 8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, reduction in sales and an increase in inventories
could cause more production cuts in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The most glaring example is that of the Siderar firm, the most
important steel company in the country, which shutdown part of its
production plant because of the accumulated inventory.
</P>
<P>
This firm is a supplier of raw material for other industries,
so an accumulation of inventory reflects less activity in other
branches of manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The immediate consequence is stagnation in the labor
market. Employment in the first seven months this year registered
a drop of almost three percent, meaning a loss of more than
100,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Although many people insist in the firmness of the country's
financial system, the economy ministry has already warned of a
reduction in the growth of the economy this year and the next,
which may result in a budget cut because of the international
crisis and the economic stagnation.

<HEADLINE> India to Import More Edible Oils, Soybean seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
decided to import more edible oils and soybean seeds to ease
rising prices of daily essential goods, official sources said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The government has already decided to import 150,000 tons of
edible oil for distribution through the public distribution
system," an official spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The government has also allowed the import of soybean seeds in
split form and sunflower seeds through open general license.
</P>
<P>
To keep wheat prices under check, the Civil Supplies Ministry
has been asked to sell wheat in the open market at the appropriate
time. The government is expected to procure about 12.6 million
tons of wheat during the current season, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, prices of daily essential commodities
such as wheat, rice, edible oils, vegetables and fruits have risen
sharply, causing great concern among politicians and the public.
Some opposition parties and mass organizations took to the streets
protesting the price rises and criticizing the government's apathy
about people's hardship.

<HEADLINE> Central America, Chile To Start Free-Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Central American countries will
start talks with Chile for a free-trade agreement on September 2,
Foreign Trade Vice-Minister Anabelle Gonzalez said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be held in Miami, where the commerce ministers of
Western hemisphere countries will begin negotiations for the
Free-Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Central American countries and Chile
exchanged drafts of their treaty last week in Managua.
</P>
<P>
However, the negotiations about norms for exception and periods
of tariff reductions could be more complicated. Agreements may not
necessarily be made between Central America and Chile, because the
two sides are in different stages of their development.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said they will try to negotiate the agreement in less
than one year. During that period Foreign Trade Ministry officials
will concentrate on the negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, negotiations will be held between Central American
countries and Chile. Talks about the FTAA, the updating of the
existing trade agreement among Central American countries, and the
settlement of a treaty with the Dominican Republic will also be on
the schedule.

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan-China Cooperation to Reach New Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASHKHABAD, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation between
Turkmenistan and China is certain to reach a new and higher level
in the 21st century, Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov said on
the eve of his August 30 visit to China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese correspondents, the 58-year-old
president answered questions on Turkmenistan-China relations and
his country's social and economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The friendship between the peoples of Turkmenistan and China is
long-standing and well established, Niyazov said, adding that the
great "Silk Road" long ago had linked the two peoples together.
</P>
<P>
Today, strengthening Turkmenistan-China cooperation bears
direct impact on the reviving of the ancient "Silk Road," and the
road, as it used to be, will help peoples of all nations to
cooperate peacefully and come closer together, he said.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov visited China, a "beautiful country" both "young and
ancient" in his view, in November 1992. He said he had talks with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Shanghai and felt the meeting was
very beneficial.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to draw upon China in all fields," he said, noting
that China is going through fruitful and comprehensive reforms
with its own characteristics, and the successful reform practice
has set an example for Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The president believes China is wise in adopting a policy of
treating small countries like Turkmenistan as an equal. The
principle guiding the two countries' cooperation is
mutual-respect, equality and mutual benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his viewpoint, the base for the two countries' achieving a
productive partnership is that the two sides share identical or
similar views on a series of matters related to a country's
development. The two have consensus on all important issues
concerning peace, cooperation and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov said that to maintain and develop long-standing stable,
neighborly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation not only
can serve the two peoples' interests, but also is conducive to
Asia's peace and stability. He reiterated that his country is and
will go all out to advance the two countries' political and
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
On the two countries' economic cooperation, the president
acclaimed it as a "model of an equal and mutually beneficial
partnership."
</P>
<P>
To develop bilateral cooperation, China and Turkmenistan have
signed 18 inter-government documents, including an economic and
trade cooperation treaty and a treaty on encouraging and
protecting investment.
</P>
<P>
Currently, trade between the two countries has exceeded 50
million U.S. dollars. Textile industries of the two countries have
established close cooperation. Turkmen oil and gas enterprises are
repairing and improving their facilities with the assistance of
Chinese workers and experts. Meanwhile, six Chinese or
Sino-Turkmen enterprises have registered in Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov believes his country and China will establish a 21st
century-oriented economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The president also gave a brief introduction to Turkmenistan's
economic outlook. Since its independence from the former Soviet
Union several years ago, Turkmenistan has spent 10 billion
U.S. dollars on economic reforms. It is rich in oil and its
natural gas reserves rank fourth in the world.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government Dismisses Peso Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government dismissed Friday a mass devaluation of the peso, which
has lost 5.54 percent of its value against the dollar in the last
three weeks amid a national economic crisis and the turbulence of
the international stock markets.
</P>
<P>
"There are no reasons for shock measures," said Finance
Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo Salazar, who presided over the
Central Bank Directive Board meeting on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that despite the "jump" of the peso-dollar
parity, the currency is still within the exchange band.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the peso will have 14 percent devaluation in
1998, since the accumulated devaluation up to the eighth month of
the year amounts to 11.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that up to now it has been possible to
maintain the dollar within the proper parameters without the
Central Bank resorting to the massive sale of dollars from
international reserves or raising interest rates.

detection.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Records Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria saw a trade deficit of
155 million U.S. dollars in the first half of this year, which
makes it difficult for the country to fulfill this year's economic
plan.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency quoted the latest statistics
from the National Statistics Office as saying the export volume
was about 2.2 billion U.S. dollars, a drop of 9 percent from the
same period last year, while the import volume rose 5 percent to
some 2.35 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria recorded a visible trade surplus of 400 million
U.S. dollars in 1997. The government expected a trade surplus this
year to maintain a 4 percent growth rate in gross domestic product
(GDP) and pay back one billion U.S. dollars of its external debt.
</P>
<P>
Since Bulgaria has established a currency control board which
pegs its currency Lev with the Deutsche Mark, Bulgarian leaders
and economists said the latest financial turmoil in Russia will
not affect financial stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, they acknowledged that the export and tourism sectors
will be hit inevitably.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Son-in-Law Prabowo Leaves for Pilgrimage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Indonesian president
Soeharto's son-in-law Prabowo Subianto has left the country on a
pilgrimage to Mecca, the Indonesian Observer reported on Saturday,
quoting a military officer close to Prabowo's family.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo met his wife, Soeharto's daughter Siti Hediati Prabowo,
in Singapore earlier this week and then flew on to Mecca for an
"Umroh", a minor form of the Hadj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage,
the officer said.
</P>
<P>
No date has been set for his return, the officer added.
</P>
<P>
The military career of Prabowo, former commander of the Army's
elite special forces unit Kopassus, has been terminated by
Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) Commander Gen. Wiranto on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"He (Prabowo) is a civilian, he has a valid passport, and he's
free to travel," a spokesman for Army headquarters was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
While 11 other officers of the Kopassus that Prabowo commanded
are still under investigation for their role in the abductions,
Prabowo has already been punished and he's no longer part of the
probe, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
There is no need to restrict his movements for now, the
spokesman said. "If at any time we need to do so, we can slap a
travel ban on Prabowo, but for the time being it's not necessary."
</P>
<P>
Prabowo commanded Kopassus for more than two years before he
was appointed commander of Army Strategic Reserves Command in
March.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo was removed from his post one day after Soeharto
announced his resignation from the presidency on May 21. He had
admitted his wrong-doing in the abduction of more than 20
political activists early this year and said he would be
responsible for the cases.
</P>
<P>
Some local newspapers reported that Prabowo may have also been
involved in other criminal cases such as riotings in May in
Jakarta and other cities, during which about 1,200 people were
killed and more than 5,000 shops and buildings were burned or
damaged.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) has tried its best to overcome the current
economic crisis, including offering some "ASEAN measures", the
organization's secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN itself is working out some measures to dealing with the
crisis. We have proposed the surveillance mechanism and the
territory used by ASEAN currencies for ASEAN intra-trade," Rodolfo

</P>
<P>
The current crisis was complicated and ASEAN could not handle
the problem by itself, Antara News Agency Saturday quoted Saverino

In efforts to deal with the deepening crisis, ASEAN had

about ASEAN's future.
</P>
<P>
"Early next year we are going to have political consultations
with China and it would go more deeply on economic matters,"
Saverino said.

reserves as of August 21 totaled 25.8 billion U.S. dollars, a 200
million drop from the week before, according to the Bangkok of

the central bank was quoted Saturday by the Bangkok Post as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Price Under Control in Central, Northeast China's Flood Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Sharp price fluctuations
triggered by the disaster have been kept under control in China's
flood-hit areas, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Hunan Provincial Price Administration put a cap on the
market price of grain, edible oil, pork, vegetables, medicines,
agricultural materials and disaster-relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Changsha, Yueyang and Changde have allocated 10.3
million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) emergency money to
reconstruct the vegetable-producing bases and transport grain and
vegetables from other cities to the province, said local price
official Zhang Zheng in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The money come from a special "price adjustment fund," which is
only used when market prices see sharp fluctuation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang acknowledged that the price of rice rose by 30 percent
and that of vegetables by 60 percent in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
"The province's general price situation is normal now," he said.
</P>
<P>
When Jiujiang of Jiangxi Province faced its most serious flood
situation at the end of last month, some residents started panic
buying of rice and staple foods.
</P>
<P>
Local price officials intervened in the market by using the
grain reserves to stabilize market demands and ease people's panic.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the grain price quickly returned to the normal
level, according to price official Yang Meilai.
</P>
<P>
Government officials organized business people to purchase
fresh vegetables from neighbouring provinces and the city's
vegetable wholesale market sought help from business partners in
other provinces through its information network.
</P>
<P>
A total of 150,000 kilograms of vegetables was transported to
Jiujiang within 24 hours, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last month, Jiangxi Province had provided three
million yuan (360,000 US dollars) from its price adjustment fund
to stabilize the market.
</P>
<P>
Hubei provincial government has urged price administrations
along the Yangtze River to strengthen their market monitoring on
the price of food, clothes and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices are also normal in northeast China's
Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces
</P>
<P>
A price official in Harbin said the price of eggs, meat and
vegetables remained stable.
</P>
<P>
In Changchun, local price official Ye Hao said the floods made
no difference to the cost of rice as there was an abundant grain
supply thanks to last year's harvest.

<HEADLINE> Police Outnumbered by Crowds in May Riots: Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Jakarta Police chief Maj.
Gen. Hamami Nata said the absence of police officers during the
May riots was caused mainly by an imbalance between the small
number of police and the huge size of the angry crowds.
</P>
<P>
Hamami was quoted by Saparinah Sadli, a member of the Joint
Fact-Finding Team investigating the riots that racked the capital
in May, during a three-hour hearing with the team at the Jakarta
Police headquarters Friday.
</P>
<P>
"He (Hamami) said that the police fulfilled their duties in
line with existing procedures but the crowds were too enormous
compared to the number of personnel," Sadli said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hamami, the number of people involved in the riots
was estimated at about one million. That was probably why the
police seemed to be "missing" during the three days of rioting,
Sadli was quoted by national newspapers Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, it was also revealed that the police
experienced communications difficulties with other military
forces during the unrest, said Bambang W. Soeharto, another member
of the Joint Fact-Finding Team.
</P>
<P>
However, Bambang expressed his bewilderment at the police
revelation that 22 police posts were torched during the riots.
</P>
<P>
"We had not heard about this before. This (fact) certainly
corroborates the police story that the situation was very bad," he
said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 1,200 people were killed and over
5,000 shops and homes damaged or burnt during the May 13-15 riots
in Jakarta and some other cities. Human rights activists say 168
ethnic Chinese women were raped.
</P>
<P>
Hamami was the third government official to testify to the
Joint Fact-Finding Team, which was set up by the government last
month.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday and Wednesday, the team questioned Jakarta Governor
Sutiyoso and former Jakarta military commander Maj. Gen. Sjafrie
Sjamsoeddin respectively.
</P>
<P>
Bambang said the team will soon question Head of the Armed
Forces Intelligence Maj. Gen. Zacky Anwar Makarim, in an effort to
gather additional information from the intelligence unit.
</P>
<P>
Expressing hopes that the team would reach a final assessment
in November, Bambang said they are currently undertaking an
analysis of the case and are collecting data and testimonies from
several of Jakarta's high-ranking city officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Bonnie regained
strength and slashed the Virginia coast Friday, peeling off roofs,
flattening trees and knocking out power to 300,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
The storm, which had degraded to a tropical storm Thursday
night, again became a Hurricane Friday, unleashing intense winds
and heavy rains directly onto the shore.
</P>
<P>
On Virginia Beach, shop and hotel windows were blown out. Small
trees and limbs lay along the sides of the road. It also lifted
the roof off some houses and businesses.
</P>
<P>
By late Friday afternoon, the storm again was downgraded to a
tropical storm when winds dropped below hurricane-force to 110
kilometers per hour. The storm was 424 kilometers south-southwest
of Nantucket Island in Massachusetts and moving to the northeast
at 23 kph.
</P>
<P>
Tropical storm warnings were in effect from Watch Hill, Rhode
Island, to Plymouth, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Bonnie landed East Coast of the United States on Wednesday
night with 185 kph winds, downing trees, tearing off roofs and
flooding roads in North Carolina and South Carolina. It caused one
billion to two billion U.S. dollars in damage, including that of
farms, in North Carolina, and at least 27 million U.S. dollars in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The Insurance Information Institute estimated Friday the
industry will pay 375 million dollars in claims from Bonnie,
mostly in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
A 12-year-old girl was killed in North Carolina's Currituck
County, near the Virginia state line, when a tree fell on her
house Thursday night, and a 50-year-old man in Myrtle Beach, South
Carolina, was electrocuted Wednesday while checking his generator
after his apartment lost power.
</P>
<P>
As the storm was moving north and off the mainland, North
Carolina residents enjoyed a brilliant blue sky Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, out in the Atlantic, another hurricane, Danielle, was
closing to the coast, 500 kilometers north of San Juan, Puerto
Rico, and strengthening with 145 kph winds. It was moving
west-northwest at 255 kph toward the U.S. East Coast.

PRAGUE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Share prices of the Czech

crisis.
</P>

On Thursday, a day called by traders "black Thursday," 50 PX
stocks on the Prague stock market plummeted by 6.83 percent. Among
them, the trading of the Czech Savings Bank stocks was forced to
close after a 24.06-percent slump.

At present, pessimism and panic are prevailing on the Prague
stock market. Investors are taking a wait-and-see manner out of
fears that the crisis may go on and spread.

<HEADLINE> Maturana Could Return to Coach Colombia's National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Francisco Maturana, who coached
the Colombia's national team between 1987 and 1994, could return
to the job, soccer federation sources said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Maturana, who was replaced by his assistant Hernan Dario
Gomez, is currently top of the list of candidates for the job.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Jorge Luis Pinto, Dutchman Leo Beenhaker, Romanian
Angel Iordanesu and Yugoslav Slobodan Zecevic are also believed
to be in the running.
</P>
<P>
Maturana, who was recently coach of Ecuador and narrowly
failed to get them to their first World Cup finals, had helped
Colombian soccer make important strides.
</P>
<P>
The country, which had only played at the World Cup once
before he took over, qualified for the last three World Cups,
although their performances in Italy, the United States and
France were all disappointing.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Benefit from Volunteers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Poor farmers and their children
in remote areas of China will benefit from a huge increase in the
number of young volunteer workers this year, reported Saturday's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
In the next few days, 60 poor counties are to welcome 1,500
volunteers who will serve for 12 months as teachers, doctors and
technicians.
</P>
<P>
They have been chosen from 10,000 candidates across the
country, Jin Siyu of the Chinese Youth Volunteers Association
(CYVA) was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is a massive expansion compared with the first group of 22
volunteers in 1996 and 20 last year, said the CYVA official.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to cover all the country's 592 poor
counties in the coming five years, for it has been warmly welcomed
by local people, Jin noted.
</P>
<P>
The college-educated volunteers will be sent to counties near
their homes to keep the scheme within budget. CYVA is planning to
establish a volunteer fund, which is urgently needed when the
program is growing so quickly, Jin indicated.
</P>
<P>
The association pays each volunteer 400 yuan (about 48.2 US
dollars) a month for living expense.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen volunteers from Guangdong Province left for nearby
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region yesterday for a one-year term in
Mashan, one of the region's poorest counties.
</P>
<P>
The 16, aged between 22 and 30, were chosen from more than 600
candidates registered for the program. All of them have college
degrees, mostly in medicine, mathematics or English.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Further Housing Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to increase
economic housing construction in the rest of this year to help
achieve its target of eight percent growth in gross domestic
product, according to Saturday's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The country will build an additional 105.5 million square
meters of economic housing in the remaining months, Vice-Minister
of Construction Song Chunhua said.
</P>
<P>
The new housing will demand a total investment of 80.58 billion
yuan (9.7 billion US dollars), 38.05 billion yuan (4.58 billion US
dollars) of which will come from China's commercial banks and the
remainder from local governments and real estate firms.
</P>
<P>
Song made these remarks at a telephone conference to launch the
third batch of this year's economic housing construction and
credit plans in Beijing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
China announced the first and the second batches in the first
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Those plans suggested that China build economic housing
totalling 106.94 million square meters with a total investment of
89.75 billion yuan (10.8 billion US dollars), figures which have
now doubled.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the State-owned firms started
residential housing construction of 366 million square meters and
finished construction of 42.8 million square meters in the first
seven months, up 15.5 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively, from
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Investment for commercial housing totalled 77.52 billion yuan
(9.3 billion US dollars)in the first seven months, up 22.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 29.79 million square meters of housing was sold
during the first seven months, up 55.26 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The major reason for the rapid development in housing
construction is that the central government has listed the sector
as a new growth area of the national economy," said Song.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide housing reform which put an end to the direct
housing distribution system is another major reason which
propelled the country's housing construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi's investment in the housing sector increased by 62
percent in the first seven months over the same period of last
year because the province halted the direct housing distribution
system last year.
</P>
<P>
Local government's favorable policies towards economic housing
construction, as as exemption of the land leasing fee, and a drop
in the price of housing gave impetus to housing construction, Song
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, U.S. Companies to Build Hydropower Station in Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese company from southwest
China's Guizhou Province and a firm of the United States will
jointly spend 60 million U.S. dollars to build a hydropower
station in Guizhou and a cooperative agreement to this regard was
signed here today.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for Guizhou Province, which abounds
in hydro-electric power resources, to use foreign capital to build
large hydropower stations, said a local official.
</P>
<P>
The projected Huanghuazhai hydropower station will sit on Getu
River inside Changshun County, and will be third tiered hydropower
station on the main stream of Getu River when completed.
</P>
<P>
The new hydropower station will have a generating capacity of
45,000 kw. The SB &AMP; A company from Minnesota of United States will
bear 70 percent of the entire financing, while the Chinese
partner, Zhongteng Industrial Co. Ltd. of Guizhou Province, will
cover the remaining sum.
</P>
<P>
The two investors have agreed to set up a joint company which
will be held responsible for construction and operation of the
projected hydropower station.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the new hydropower station will be able to
generate 200 million kwh of electricity and to produce a pre-tax
profit of over five million U.S. dollars annually when it becomes
operational. The investment will be recovered in less than ten
years' time, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He added that the construction of the hydropower station will
also help ease power shortages in the areas inhabited by the
people of ethnic groups in this remote southwest China province.

<HEADLINE> Gullit Promises Good Prospect for Newcastle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Dutch international Ruud
Gullit promised to bring better times to St James's Park after
being officially unveiled as the new manager of Newcastle United.
</P>
<P>
The former Chelsea manager said he had little doubt that he
could turn things around for the club, however, he hoped the fans
should not expect quick progress in the club.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this club wants to go too quickly. You need to take it
a step at a time," he said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the speculation linking him with Tottenham
had been false.
</P>
<P>
"Tottenham never approached me and all the speculation linking
me with them was a smokescreen."
</P>
<P>
Gullit expressed sympathy for Kenny Dalglish after his speedy
departure and said: "That is a part of football that I don't li
ke, but you just have to accept it."
</P>
<P>
"As a player, one day you could be here, one day you could be
there."
</P>
<P>
"Kevin Keegan and Kenny Dalglish did a very good job, and I'll
try and continue that, and even try to do something more."
</P>
<P>
Gullit claimed he would not make any assessments about the
Newcastle players until he has seen them in action.
</P>
<P>
"I will wait and see them on Sunday (against Liverpool)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I have my opinion about them, but I'm not going to say what
it is to the Press, " he added.
</P>
<P>
The former AC Milan star denied suggestions that Newcastle's
large base of foreign stars would be increased.
</P>
<P>
He said: "When I worked at Chelsea I liked to bring youngsters
into the team and I would like to do that also at Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
"But they must be good enough. For me it is not important to
buy all the time from abroad, just that my players are good
enough," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou Section of Grand Canal To Be Cleared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 29 (Xinhua)-- The Hangzhou-Beijing Grand Canal
has become polluted at its Hangzhou section in east China over the
years, but a Hangzhou environmental official says the city will
strive to clear up the waterway by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wubiao, director of the Hangzhou Urban and Rural
Construction Committee, said that a clean-up project with an
investment of 710 billion yuan (85.75 million U.S. dollars) is
being carried out in the region and is expected to be completed
within three years.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Canal, starting in Hangzhou in east China and ending
in Beijing, was built some 1,300 years ago, and has been a major
navigation line linking south and north China ever since.
</P>
<P>
Lacking comprehensive waste-water treatment facilities, the
city discharges 410,000 tons of untreated water a day into the
canal. This has turned the canal water in the Hangzhou section
foul and has killed off the fish and shrimps. Sometimes the
pollution extends to the lower reaches where it causes fishing and
agricultural production hazards.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates put annual economic losses caused by
pollution at more than 600 million yuan (72.3 million U.S.
dollars). Worse still, the contaminated water poses a major health
threat to some 120,000 rural people who drink it.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, the pollution clean-up project is the
largest urban project in the city, along with a sewage-water
treatment facility with a daily capacity of 600,000 tons which
will be built on the adjacent Qiantang River.

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- World Formula One champion
Jacques Villeneuve walked away unscathed Friday from a high-speed
crash that stopped the opening session of the day's practice
session at Spa-Francorchamps before Sunday's Belgian grand prix.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian appeared to have lost control of his car halfway
through the Eau Rouge corner at a speed of 280 kilometers per hour
and spun backwards into the tyre barriers.
</P>
<P>
The impact badly damaged the rear end of Villeneuve's car but
the driver was able to climb out of the cockpit unaided.
</P>
<P>
"It was perhaps my best crash in Formula One so far," said the
Canadian driver who beat his archrival Michael Schumacher to take
away last year's Formula One championship title.
</P>
<P>
He added that he just lost control but was confident he would
be able to complete Saturday's practice runs.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher, from Germany, finished the day's practice session
at first place with a clocking of one minute 51.895 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Mika Hakkinen of Finland was second at 1:51.906, followed by
David Coulthard and Damon Hill both from Britain at 1:52.629 and
1:53.100 respectively.

<HEADLINE> European Super League Chiefs Hit Back at UEFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Officials planning a breakaway
European Super League on Friday hit back at accusations that they
were offering clubs "fantasy money".
</P>
<P>
Media Partners, a Miland-based company involved in talks with
major clubs to set up the league, said that their financial
experts had done their sums properly on the project.
</P>
<P>
Leading UEFA official Gerhard Aigner was reported on Friday as
saying that top clubs were being lured by money that could not
generated in the present market.
</P>
<P>
Clubs in the 2 billion pound (3.35 billion U.S. dollars)
league are said to be guaranteed at least 17 million pounds (29
million U.S.dollars) each season.
</P>
<P>
"Our project to deliver an exciting new European Football
League (EFL) for the fans and the clubs is extremely financially
robust," EFL project leader Peter Ekelund said.
</P>
<P>
"We have spent over 12 months intensively planning and
finalizing the financial details of the project. There is also a
rigorously tested business plan to support every aspect of this
project.
</P>
<P>
"We have successfully contracted (leading U.S. investment
bank)JP Morgan as our financial adviser to work with us on
providing the solid financial support for the European Football
League."
</P>
<P>
The posturing between European governing body UEFA and Media
Partners is likely to come to a head in the next few days as
leading UEFA officials meet in Monaco to discuss the future of
the European game.
</P>
<P>
Media Partners want their league to be organized by the
leading clubs with UEFA acting as a regulatory body. The firm
claims UEFA has agreed to review its plans.
</P>
<P>
But the governing body stated this week that it had no plans
to work with Media Partners on the league. It may merge the
European Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Cup and change the present
Champions' League to head off the Super League threat.
</P>
<P>
"UEFA's competitions are the commercial goldmine of
international football but this mine cannot be exploited
endlessly," Aigner said before the Monaco meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We can promise reform of the current competitions but no
revolution. There will be no El Dorado in football. We are not
willing to promise more than what we can actually deliver.
</P>
<P>
"We will soon be in a position to present new solutions to
you. They will not be ordained by pure profit-related a
spirations."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week senior football officials from eight
countries had unanimously rejected the Super League plans and
mandated UEFA to reform the competitions.
</P>
<P>
But sources close to Media Partners claim that there is a
serious debate going on within UEFA about their Super League
proposals and the situation is not as clear-cut as the European
body has suggested.

<HEADLINE> Jones Beats Arron at Memorial van Damme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- World titlist Marion Jones
proved just a bit too much for the newly-crowned European champion
Christine Arron on Friday at the Memorial van Damme Golden League
international track and field meet.
</P>
<P>
The American sprinter, who was third out of the starting
blocks, sped to the front after one third of the women's 100-meter
race and led thereafter to the finish line, beating the French
woman rival to second place.
</P>
<P>
Jones clocked 10.80 seconds for the win while Arron, who won
the European championship a week ago in Budapest of Hungary, was
0.15 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
Before Friday's race, Arron said that she wanted and ready to
defeat the reigning world champion in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Though three world records were threatened by as many athletes
before the day's races started, none of the athletes made the most
of the overcast chilly weather condition.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Komen of Kenya, though heavily guarded and well-paced by
three compatriot runners, finished an unexpected second after
Ethiopia's Assefa Mezgebu who came home in 12 minutes 53.84
seconds in the men's 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Komen who set a world mark for the same event last year on the
same track only managed a timing of 12:54.82.
</P>
<P>
Countryman Paul Tergat, who aimed at the 10,000-meter record
for men, fared just better by winning the longer race but well
outside the listed world record.
</P>
<P>
Tergat clocked 26:46.44 for the title.
</P>
<P>
Maria Mutola required to add a women's 1,000-meter race to
Friday's program in an attempt to break the world mark of the race
but she could not maintain her early pace only to get home on
2:31.55.
</P>
<P>
The current world record for the 1,000-meter event is 2:28.98
held by Russia's Svetlana Masterkova who won Friday's 1,500 meters
in 3:58.96.

WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will resume their
talks early next week, State Department officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
They said U.S. special envoy Charles Kartman and DPRK Vice

The officials refused to give further details about the

"total range of issues" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the State Department said the two sides
talked about the 1994 U.S.-DPRK agreement on nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
Another issue on agenda was possible resumption of four-party
peace talks on the Korean Peninsula, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Michel Camdessus, managing
director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Friday urged
Russia to stick to its market-oriented reform program.
</P>
<P>
While speaking to a press conference, Camdessus indicated that
Russia will not receive a 4.3 billion U.S. dollar second
installment of the loan package on September 15 unless the Russian
parliament adopts tough economic measures.
</P>
<P>
He requested urgent steps to be taken to restore financial
stability and lay the basis for the resumption of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief also urged the Russian government to "push ahead
forcefully" with structural reforms aimed at encouraging private
sector development. "The sooner these reforms can start, the
better," he stressed. "There is no time to waste if the adverse
impact of the crisis on the Russian population is to be minimized
and growth restored."
</P>
<P>
The IMF approved financial support totaling some 11.2 billion
dollars for Russia. The financing consists of an augmentation of
Russia's extended arrangement by the equivalent of about 8.3
billion dollars to support the Russian government's economic
program for 1998 and about 2.9 billion dollars under the
Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility to compensate for
a shortfall in export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Talking about financial shortage for potential crisis in other
regions, Camdessus stated, "We still have both normal Fund
resources available to help out members, as well as under
appropriate circumstances, resources from the GAB (the General
Arrangement for Borrowing)." "If a country asks for our assistance
in support of a strong program, we will recommend to the Executive
Board the normally justified level of support," he added.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said that the IMF has invited finance ministers and
central bank governors from the Western Hemisphere to Washington
next week for two days of meetings on avoiding potential crisis
and strengthening regional surveillance.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Russia to Stick to Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday
urged the Russian authorities to continue reforms while President
Bill Clinton determined to go next week to Moscow to show his
support.
</P>
<P>
It would be a serious error for Russia to revert to a policy of
central control of its economy, said Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers at a background briefing on President Bill
Clinton's trip to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"It is our belief that a move back towards centralized planning
based on price controls and administrative allocation of goods and
systematic controls would be a serious policy error and very
unfortunate with respect to Russia's economic prospects going
forward," Summers told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Clinton said in a speech on the Martha's
Vineyard island, Massachusetts, that the U.S. would continue to
support Russia if it stuck to bold reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We should tell them that if they'll be strong and do the
disciplined, hard things they have to do to reform their country,
their economy and get through this dark night, that we'll stick
with them," said the president, who is on a vacation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton held a half-hour telephone conference call with Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, in Moscow for summit
preparations, and Summers.
</P>
<P>
Talbott reported that President Boris Yeltsin personally
assured him that he did not intend to resign and would serve out
his full term until 2000. Yeltsin himself said on Russian
television that he would not resign.
</P>
<P>
While some Russia analysts say it doesn't make much sense for
Clinton to meet with Yeltsin amid questions whether Yeltsin's
government will survive, Clinton expressed determination to go.
</P>
<P>
The six-day trip, including stops in Northern Ireland and
Ireland, will be Clinton's first overseas trip since his
embarrassing acknowledgment of an extramarital affair with a
onetime White House intern.
</P>
<P>
"We have an enormous stake in Russia's future, in its
continuation on a path of democracy and market reform," Sandy
Berger, Clinton's national security advisor, told the briefing in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Berger indicated that Clinton "intends to reinforce the
fundamental importance, to Russia and the world, of holding fast
to basic objectives of democracy and economic reform in the face
of new challenges."
</P>
<P>
"The challenges it (Russia) faces now certainly are no less
daunting, but the United States needs to do our best to be
helpful," he told reporters. "In the final analysis, the choices
are theirs, but we must be ready and prepared to be of help if
they make the right choices."
</P>
<P>
"America has a strong interest in preventing Russia from
backsliding and in promoting its stability and success," said
Berger.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there were "important foreign policy and security
challenges which continue, where Russia must play a key role."
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can agree to some concrete and specific steps that
will reduce further the threats left by post-Cold War military
arsenals," he added.
</P>
<P>
On economy, Summers stressed that Russia should take "sound
budget measures," address "in a strong way the problems in the
banking system," and take "the legal and administrative steps
necessary to provide a framework in which a market can
satisfactorily operate."
</P>
<P>
"It becomes ever more important that a framework in which there
isn't pressure to create excessive currencies and in which markets
and property rights and entrepreneurs can function be put in
place," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed the importance of Russia's policy choices, adding
that the U.S. would provide support through international
institutions, instead of bilateral ways.
</P>
<P>
"The international financial institutions, with our support, are
certainly prepared to provide support to Russia... measured with or
based with the pace of reform on the basis of strong policy
measures," he said.

<HEADLINE> Second Suspect of U.S. Embassy Bombing Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, a second
suspect in the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Kenya has been
charged with murder in U.S. district court in Manhattan Friday.
</P>
<P>
Odeh, 33, was brought to the U.S. from Kenya Thursday, when the
first suspect, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali, was charged at the
same court.
</P>
<P>
A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) complaint said Odeh
asserted that he did not take part in the bombing but accepted
responsibility as a member of the terrorist group called Al-Qaeda
led by Islamic militant Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Like Owhali, Odeh was charged with murder, conspiracy for
murder and use of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Odeh was arrested on the day of the bombing in Karachi,
Pakistan, and had been detained by Kenyan authorities since August
14.
</P>
<P>
Odeh, said to be from Jordan or Palestine, obtained Kenyan
citizenship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
On August 7, bombing in the U.S. embassy in Kenya killed 257
including 12 Americans and wounded more than 5000.
</P>
<P>
Owhali told the FBI that on the day of the bombing he rode in
the passenger seat of bomb-laden vehicle to the embassy in Nairobi
and tossed a grenade-like device at the embassy guard.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Urges Clinton to Resume Aggressive Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- House Speaker Newt Gingrich
Friday urged President Bill Clinton to resume support for
aggressive U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I am writing to express my deepest concern about current U.S.
policy on Iraq," Gingrich said in a letter to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the recent resignation of U.N. weapons inspector
Scott Ritter, who said that the Clinton administration and the
United Nations were abandoning a firm approach toward Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein in weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich wrote that the United States would destroy its
credibility over its confrontation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We must resume our policy of supporting aggressive UNSCOM
(U.N. Special Commission) inspections," Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
The House speaker said Clinton had softened his stance from an
initial threat to carry out a military strike against Iraq weapons
inspectors were not allowed access to suspected sites.
</P>
<P>
When Iraq denied inspectors access earlier this month, "our
weak response was not to take action as promised but to `let the
U.N. decide.' The U.N. has unfortunately decided -- not to take
firm action," Gingrich said.

DURBAN, South Africa, August 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
Durban is now in Top security as thousands of senior officials
and journalists from every part of the world are flocking to the
coastal city to attend the 12th Non-Aligned Movement Summit.
</P>
<P>
Ben Van Deventer, head of Security for the NAM Summit, said
earlier in the day that the security arrangements South Africa
have made for the one-week world conference to be held from
August 29 to September 3, is of the highest international
standard.
</P>
<P>
Security becomes a focus of attention in South Africa, and
actually the whole world, after a terrorist blast hit a
U.S.-franchised restaurant in Cape Town Tuesday, following the
deadly August 7 blasts in the capitals of Kenya and Tanzania,
which claimed 263 lives and injured over 5,000.
</P>
<P>
"The many months of detailed planning will be put into effect
when more than 1,200 policemen arrived in Durban to bolster
existing police force in the port city," he said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with accepted international practice, Van
Deventer said secure "islands" have been created where heads of
state from NAM member states will reside.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued Friday, at least 59 heads
of state or government have confirmed their participation of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The NAM, established in September 1961 when 25 countries held
the first summit meeting of the organization in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, has been expanded to 113 member states, the majority
of which are the third world countries.
</P>
<P>
Van Deventer said the heads of state would start arriving in
Durban next week when at least 10 luxury hotels in the city would
be sealed-off until they leave on September 4.
</P>
<P>
He said routes which would carry heads of state from the
airport to the city, the hotels and the International Conference
Center (ICC) would be clearly flagged and will be manned by
policemen providing route protection including overhead bridges.
Besides, he said, alternative emergency routes have also been
planned.
</P>
<P>
For now, people can find that the most heavily guarded places
are the ICC and the Durban Exhibition Center (DEC) where the
summit and Committee Working Sessions for senior officials and
delegates will be held.
</P>
<P>
Drivers have seen the installation of concrete barricades
around the ICC and the DEC where only the heads of state
motorcades and delegates buses are permitted to and fro.
</P>
<P>
At the North Plaza of the DEC, a special search area has been
designated where every vehicle which requires access to "secure"
areas like the ICC and the luxury hotels has to be searched and
then escorted to their destination by police.
</P>
<P>
"No person or vehicle will be permitted to enter secure areas
without the necessary document," Van Deventer said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, emergency procedures for the supply of
electricity and water have been put in place and dedicated lines
into all control rooms have been installed to ensure rapid
reaction.
</P>
<P>
A disaster control center is also up and running which will
cope with any civic emergency, he said.
</P>
<P>
An informed source, who asked not to be identified, told
Xinhua that a car bomb was found Friday afternoon near Holiday
Inn Crown Plaza, one of luxury hotels at the side of the beach.
</P>
<P>
A police officer, who was on duty outside the hotel, said he
had no information about the car bomb, but he confirmed that the
hotel did receive a bomb threat later in the day.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team to Go to China for Aid Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. humanitarian aid
agency will send a team to flood affected areas in China for aid
assessment, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The team from the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs (OCHA) "will be dispatched shortly to carry out on-site
visits in some of the worst affected provinces and to assess the
mobilization of resources from international community in response
to this natural disaster," he said.
</P>
<P>
The OCHA move is at the request of the Chinese Government for
the deployment of a U.N. disaster assessment and coordination team
in the context of deteriorating floods situation there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Flooding damage caused by heavy rains along Yangze River and
rivers in North China in the past two months is officially
estimated at 20.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The disaster has affected 223 million people and 21 million ha
of lands, claiming 3,004 lives and destroying nearly 5 million
houses.
</P>
<P>
According to OCHA, the International Federation of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has received cash and in-kind
contributions totaling 1.7 million U.S. dollars for China aid
purpose.
</P>
<P>
Japan pledged a further 500,000 U.S. dollars and the provision of
relief goods valued at 347,000 dollars, OCHA said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) has pledged 50,000 dollars,
it added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Russia to Take Action in Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday urged Russia to take disciplined action in economic reform,
promising to continue to support it if it does so.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks during a speech at the event to
commemorate the 35th anniversary of Martin Luther King's "March on
Washington" speech.
</P>
<P>
"We should tell them that if they'll be strong and do the
disciplined, hard things they have to do to reform their country,
their economy and get through this dark night, that we'll stick
with them," Clinton said on Martha's Vineyard, the Massachusetts
island where he is on vacation.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said he would not
resign and would finish his term, which ends in 2000. But he
indicated that he would not run for another term.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will travel to Moscow early next week and meet with
Yeltsin on Russia's economic crisis and a series of security
issues, particularly another round of talks on reducing the
nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
"We have an enormous stake in Russia's future, in its
continuation on a path of democracy and market reform," Sandy
Berger, Clinton's national security advisor, told a background
briefing at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Berger indicated that Clinton "intends to reinforce the
fundamental importance, to Russia and the world, of holding fast
to basic objectives of democracy and economic reform in the face
of new challenges."
</P>
<P>
"The challenges it (Russia) faces now certainly are no less
daunting, but the United States needs to do our best to be
helpful," he told reporters. "In the final analysis, the choices
are theirs, but we must be ready and prepared to be of help if
they make the right choices."
</P>
<P>
"America has a strong interest in preventing Russia from
backsliding and in promoting its stability and success," said
Berger.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are "important foreign policy and security
challenges which continue, where Russia must play a key role."
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can agree to some concrete and specific steps that
will reduce further the threats left by post-Cold War military
arsenals," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will leave on August 31 and start his visit to Russia
on September 1. He will then visit Ireland and the British
province of Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Closing European Stock Market Indices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) - Russia's financial chaos kept
European stock markets in uproar on Friday, condemning shares to
another miserable session and scuppering early gains by Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
Most European bourses closed with losses of around two percent,
having recovered from savage early falls of up to five percent as
dealers opted to cover some short positions before the weekend and
some bargain-hunting emerged.
</P>
<P>
The following are closing indices of major European stock
markets on Friday:
</P>
<P>
LONDON - The FTSE 100 index tumbled to its lowest close for
seven months as continuing fears over the financial crisis in

since last Friday.

percent.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen Car Sales Hit New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Volkswagen AG said Friday
that its worldwide car deliveries in the first seven months of
this year reached the record of 2.7 million units, up 4.8 percent
from the previous record registered in the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
In July alone, Volkswagen's car deliveries weres 415,700, also
the record for the month in the company's history.
</P>
<P>
The strongest growth was achieved in North America, where
239,283 Volkswagen vehicles were sold in the first seven months,
up 57.7 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Volkswagen's car deliveries to Western Europe also
soared 9.7 percent to a total of 1,664,812 units.
</P>
<P>
In the Asian-Pacific region, however, the company's car
deliveries dropped 3.7 percent to 220,479 units, mainly due to the
recent financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The difficult economic situation in South America and Africa
also led to a dramatic 25.3 percent decline in Volkswagen's car
deliveries to the two regions, which together imported about
324,000 Volkswagen vehicles in the first seven months of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Conflicts, Crises to Top NAM Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, South Africa, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The non-aligned
nations will kick off the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) meeting this
weekend against a backdrop of bomb blasts in African states,
including host South Africa, and more upheavals on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda for the leaders of the developing world will
be the recent anti-American terrorist attacks in east Africa, the
retaliatory attacks by the United States and the current
rebellion in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), said
observers here.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the summit said at a new briefing here Friday
that 89 countries have promised to send their delegates to attend
the 12th NAM summit due to open next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the summit, a two-day senior officials meeting and a
two-day foreign ministers meeting will be convened.
</P>
<P>
The delegates started arriving in South Africa this week
shortly after a bomb explosion on Tuesday night in Cape Town
which killed one person and injured up to 27 at the Planet
Hollywood Restaurant. The blast followed twin bomb attacks on
August 7 at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam which
killed 263 people and injured over 5,000 others, the majority of
whom are Africans.
</P>
<P>
The Americans retaliated with missile attacks on Afghanistan
and Sudan, killing 15 people.
</P>
<P>
The tragedies are certain to top the agenda for the NAM
summit, which is mainly a forum concerned with defending and
promoting the cause of developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the observers said, it is notably pressing for a
reform of the United Nations Security Council to allow greater
access to developing nations, for partial or total cancellation
of debts for the poorest countries and measures to halt the
proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
While the latter issue remains crucial in the wake of recent
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, both the NAM member states,
the others are likely, in the absence of a formal agenda, to be
eclipsed by the rash of crises and conflicts afflicting several
of the organization's members.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. missile attacks on suspected "terrorist" sites in
Sudan and Afghanistan, two NAM states, have triggered vehement
protests in the Arab and Moslem world which is strongly
represented in the NAM.
</P>
<P>
In the heart of Africa, the civil war in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) involves the NAM countries exclusively:
Angola and Zimbabwe which are backing Congolese President Laurent
Kabila, and Rwanda and Uganda which are allegedly backing the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela has tried to mediate a
settlement in his capacity as acting Chairman of of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), of which Congo is a member.
</P>
<P>
But the SADC is divided on their opinions, with Zimbabwe
increasingly resentful of South Africa's dominant role in
regional diplomacy, said the observers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Russia to Stick to Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers said on Friday it would be a serious
error for Russia to revert to a policy of central control of its
economy.
</P>
<P>
Summers made the statement during a background briefing on
President Bill Clinton's trip to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"It is our belief that a move back towards centralized planning
based on price controls and administrative allocation of goods and
systematic controls would be a serious policy error and very
unfortunate with respect to Russia's economic prospects going
forward," Summers told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Clinton said in a speech in Martha's
Vineyard, Massachusetts, that the U.S. will continue to support
Russia if it sticks to bold reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We should tell them that if they'll be strong and do the
disciplined, hard things they have to do to reform their country,
their economy and get through this dark night, that we'll stick
with them," Clinton said on Martha's Vineyard, the Massachusetts
island where he is on vacation.
</P>
<P>
Summers stressed that Russia should take "sound budget
measures," address "in a strong way the problems in the banking
system," and take "the legal and administrative steps necessary to
provide a framework in which a market can satisfactorily operate."
</P>
<P>
"It becomes ever more important that a framework in which there
isn't pressure to create excessive currencies and in which markets
and property rights and entrepreneurs can function be put in
place," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
"We have an enormous stake in Russia's future, in its
continuation on a path of democracy and market reform," Sandy
Berger, Clinton's national security advisor, told the same
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Berger indicated that Clinton "intends to reinforce the
fundamental importance, to Russia and the World, of holding fast

<HEADLINE> Dataquest: Japanese Consumers Opt for Low-Cost PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese consumers are
following their American counterparts in opting for low-cost PCs,
according to a newly released market research.
</P>
<P>
The California-based market analysis firm Dataquest said that
during this year's second quarter, almost 40 percent of consumer
PC buyers in Japan purchased systems costing less than 1,400 U.S.
dollars. Another 10 percent went for systems below 1,050 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the so-called sub-1,000-dollar computers
became popular about the same time a year ago. Eventually as much
as 40 percent of all PC purchases dropped below this price point,
setting off major industry repercussions.
</P>
<P>
The price of corporate PCs, which Dataquest says comprise more
than 70 percent of the Japanese market, held steady during the
second quarter. This indicates that businesses are not following
cost-conscious consumers, Dataquest said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese PC shipments during the period fell 12 percent, to
1.67 million units. The yearly total of PC shipments is likely to
be flat or nominally higher in 1998, the firm said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Dataquest said that the Japanese PC market may be
limping along with the troubled economy, but better days are
ahead. The market was then projected to reach 15.68 million units
in 2002, with a compound annual growth rate of 14.5 percent
through 2001.
</P>
<P>
The PC industry continues to be one of the promising industries
in the Japanese economy in quagmire, the firm said, with two-digit
growth potential in the long run.
