OTTAWA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Parts of Quebec are being hit by
a record heavy snow at this time of the year for the past decade,
said local media reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
At least five centimeters of snow blanketed Sherbrooke early
Monday, causing power failure in the city and the surrounding
area.
</P>
<P>
Traffic between Sherbrooke and Granby is slowing down because
of the poor visibility while several accidents have been reported
along local Highway 112.
</P>

Sherbrooke recorded a snowfall of 5.6 centimeters on October 4,
1987, when most of southern Quebec was whitened during the first

<HEADLINE> 10 Women Ministers Urge Bar on Human Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Women ministers from 10
countries, including the United States and South Africa, have
called for the early completion of a U.N. convention against
transnational organized crime and an additional document
specifically dealing with trafficking in people.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, which is
published here Monday, the women ministers said, "On the edge of
the 21st century, it is unacceptable that human beings around the
world are brought and sold into situations, such as sexual
exploitation, domestic servitude and debt bondage, they are little
different from slavery."
</P>
<P>
They said that they were writing "as foreign ministers of 10
nations, and as concerned women, to affirm our strong support for
the struggle to end the repulsive trafficking in human beings,
predominantly women and children."
</P>
<P>
"Together, we call for the earliest possible completion and
full implementation of the convention and protocol," now being
negotiated, and "commit ourselves and our governments to doing all
that we can to achieve this goal," they said.
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by foreign ministers Maria Eugenia
Brizuela de Avila of El Salvador, Tarja Balonen of Finland, Andrea
Willi of Lietchtenstein, Lydie Plofer of Luxembourg, Lila
Ratsifandrihamanana of Madagascar, Rosairo Green Macias of Mexico,
Aichatou Mindaoudou of Niger, Nkosazana Zuma of South Africa,
Annan Lindh of Sweden, and Madeleine Albright of the United
States.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Physicians attending
Tanzanian former president Julius Nyerere, who is suffering from
leukemia at St. Thomas Hospital in London, took away the life
support system for him as the 77-year-old man has begun to breathe
himself.
</P>
<P>
However, Nyerere, who was admitted to the hospital 10 days ago,
is still in critical condition, although his health made slight
improvement, a press release from the Tanzanian State House said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by presidential press secretary Geoffrey
Nkurlu, quoted doctors as saying various tests have indicated that
Nyerere's jaundice complications are subsiding and his liver is
getting better.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prayers for Nyerere's quick recovery continued all
over the country Monday as anxiety grips the nation.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam, prayers were conducted at
the St. Peter and St. Joseph Roman Catholic churches.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian Embassy in Dar es Salaam also conducted prayers
for Nyerere, who is the international facilitator for peace talks
in Burundi, which borders Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961 and masterminded its union Zanzibar isles in 1964 to form
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring as president in 1985, he played an advisory role
in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Protests U.N. Opening of Pristina Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Monday
complained to the United Nations that the decision to open the
airport in Pristina, capital of Kosovo province, violated
Yugoslav civil air traffic security.
</P>
<P>
In letter to the president of the 15-nation U.N. Security
Council, Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav
Mission to the United Nations, voiced his concern at this "new
unilateral and arbitrary decision" and called for it to be
revoked.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Kosovo was an "autonomous province of the
Yugoslav constituent Republic of Serbia," the senior Yugoslav
diplomat said that under the rules of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), Yugoslavia "has the sole
responsibility and rights in its undivided airspace."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia accordingly expected that the decision by the United
Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo to open the airport "will
be revoked and that the question of the opening of Pristina
airport for commercial flights be resolved in cooperation with the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia" on the basis of the rules and
regulations of the ICAO convention, of which Yugoslavia is a
signatory.
</P>
<P>
In another letter, Jovanovic protested that a mortar attack on
a market in the town of Kosovo Polje on September 28 which killed
two Serb civilians and wounded 42 was "a terrorist act which
exposes the charade" behind the U.N. decision "to `demilitarize'
and `transform' the terrorist Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) into
the Kosovo Protection Corps."
</P>
<P>
The KLA, a guerrilla force which battled Yugoslav troops and
police for the independence of the Serbian province, signed an
agreement with the NATO-led international peacekeeping force in
Kosovo, known as KFOR, last month during the former rebel group
into a civilian body responsible for dealing with disasters and
other emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said that the Security Council should immediately
annul the decision establishing the Kosovo Protection Corps and
immediately disband "that mono-ethnic organization which threatens
the multi-ethnic and multi-religious character" of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Date of Khatami's Paris Visit Not Set: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi said here Monday that President Mohammad
Khatami's visit to France is on the agenda but the exact date is
not set yet.
</P>
<P>
Khatami will visit the European heavy-weight at the invitation
of President Jaques Chirac, and the two countries are discussing
the issue, Asefi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
France will be the second European country Khatami visits since
assuming presidency in August 1997. He has paid a visit to Italy
for a thaw in relations with European countries marred by Iran's
insistence on the execution of a death sentence against British
writer Salmon Rushdie for his "blasphemous" novel "The Satanic
Verses."
</P>
<P>
The moderate president has been pursuing a policy of detent in
an effort to improve relations with world countries and
effectively break Iran's isolation since the victory of 1979
Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said that since Khatami's visit is very
important, all aspects should be taken into consideration, and the
exact date will be announced after the two countries reach
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the trend of Tehran-Paris relations over the past
few years has been "positive", and there are bright prospects for
the two countries' cooperation.
</P>
<P>
There is also a bright future for the relations between Iran
and the European Union, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asefi also told reporters that Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
is due to leave for Vienna on Thursday to attend a three-day
meeting of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has been accused by the U.S. and its Western allies of
seeking nuclear capability, a charge it denied. It insists that
peaceful use of nuclear energy is an unalienable right of every
country.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi will address the meeting to explain Iran's stands
regarding the issue, Asefi added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced Monday that it has approved an equity
investment of 10 million U.S. dollars in Mobile Systems
International Cellular Investments Holdings, B.V. (MSICIH), a
cellular operating company with multiple cellular networks in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
MSICIH has five cellular operations in Egypt, Hong Kong,
Malawi, Uganda and Zambia. Over the past year, the company
acquired four new licenses through open international competitive
bidding in Chad, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
MSICIH said that it has bid for the third cellular license in
South Africa and intends to bid for licenses in other countries in
Africa as opportunities arise.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's equity investment will help finance the construction,
expansion and operation of mobile cellular telecommunications
networks and at the same time spur modernization of
telecommunications in these African countries, said Declan J.
Duff, director of the IFC's Telecommunications, Transportation and
Utilities Department.
</P>
<P>
To date, the IFC has approved investments of 2.3 billion
dollars in telecommunications projects worldwide, of which 1
billion dollars were for the IFC's own account.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the IFC, part of the World Bank Group, is to
promote private sector investment in developing countries, which
will reduce poverty and improve people's life.

LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets surged
Monday despite impending decisions on U.S., Europe and UK
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
London's benchmark FTSE 100 pushed through the 6,000 mark in
morning trade and advanced further to close up 82.2 points, or
1.38 percent, at 6,052.90.
</P>
<P>
Telecoms, oils and banks all did well. The most active stock
was Scottish &AMP; Soutern Energy, which bounced 4.8 percent on hefty
volume of 40 million shares.
</P>
<P>
However, Richard Crehan, UK equity strategist at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, said, "It is a technical rebound rather than any
great show of strength."
</P>
<P>
"The impression is that the authorities should raise interest
rates but they probably won't do so just yet," he added.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax rebounded from its recent weakness, soaring
122 points, or 2.38 percent, to close at 5,246.52 as investors
went bargain hunting.

<P>
The CAC 40 in Paris ended 52.67 points, or 1.16 percent, higher

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Positive Climate for Sudan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Monday called on Sudanese government and the opposition
to create a better climate for the proposed dialog aimed at
forging national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
A positive climate would help bring the disputants in Sudan to
dialogs based on an initiative put forward by Libya and Egypt or
the proposals of the East African Inter-Governmental Authority for
Development (IGAD), Moussa told reporters after meeting with
Libyan Assistant Foreign Minister Ali Treiki.
</P>
<P>
Such atmosphere is also needed to maintain Sudan's territorial
integrity, promote national reconciliation and alleviate
Sudan-related tensions, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed a five-point peace plan early last
month, which includes a permanent cease-fire between the Sudanese
government and the opposition, and a dialog to forge national
reconciliation. IGAD sponsors the peace talks between the Sudanese
government and the southern Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
</P>
<P>
SPLA, which has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy
in the mostly Christian and animist south of Sudan, has united
with northern Muslim opposition parties under an umbrella group -
National Democratic Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the timetable for a preparatory meeting on an
inter-Sudanese reconciliation conference, Moussa said a suitable
atmosphere should be created ahead of the step.
</P>
<P>
Under the Egyptian-Libyan plan, the preparatory meeting was to
have opened last month in Cairo. But SPLA refused to accept the
plan, saying that it preferred IGAD's mediation role.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he has sent a message to his Kenyan counterpart,
whose country is holding the presidency of IGAD, to coordinate the
two sides' efforts to help realize peace and stability in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Sudan's northern neighbor, is keen on helping Sudan
maintain territorial integrity for fear that a possible separation
of southern Sudan would endanger the Nile River, its major water
source.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Says Abkhaz Elections Illegitimate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council said Monday that the self-styled presidential
election and referendum held on October 3, 1999 in Abkhazia,
Georgia, was unacceptable and illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
A statement read to the press by Council President for the
current month Sergei Lavrov of Russia said Council members
considered that the holding of such elections would only be
possible after the determination through negotiations of the
political status of Abkhazia respecting the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally
recognized boders.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the voting could take place only within
the framework of a comprehensive political settlement, and with
the guaranteed possibility of full participation for all refugees
and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed its deep concern that such actions are
unhelpful and detrimental to efforts to reach settlement to the
conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, and underlined the necessity for
both sides to refrain from any action that could heighten tension.
</P>
<P>
The Council reaffirmed their commitment to the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Georgia, within its internationally
recognized boders, and underlined the unacceptability of any
action by the Abkhaz leadership in contravention of these
principles.
</P>
<P>
A purported presidential election and referendum was held
Sunday in Georgia's region of Abkhazia, which has administered
itself as an independent state since the end of a 1992-1993
conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Sees No Progress in Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government said Monday it
does not think that any concrete progress has been achieved in
efforts over the Cyprus issue from last week's meeting in
Washington between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Turkish Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said Ecevit's
acceptance of a visit to the region by United States Presidential
emissary Alfred Moses "does not constitute progress."
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
"concrete progress was made" in the Clinton-Ecevit meeting on the
Cyprus peace effort.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou was also dissatisfied with the postponement of
Moses' visit to Nicosia, Athens and Ankara, which was initially
expected to take place this week.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Ecevit has asked for the
postponement in view of his visit this week to Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no further official information on the visit.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou reiterated that the Greek Cypriot side is willing
to participate in talks over Cyprus but will not accept the
preconditions set by the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the international community has been trying to
bring the two sides to negotiate for reunification through a
bicommunal settlement. But no tangible progress has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side insist that the talks would
take place only after the breakaway state in northern Cyprus be
recognized and it talks with Nicosia on a state-to-state basis.

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers Threaten Boycott of French Produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- British farmers' leaders urged
Britons Monday to boycott French produce after Paris decided to
defy the European Commission and maintain its ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has lifted its ban on exports of
British beef and warned France last Friday that it was legally
bound to lift the ban and could face court action if it refused.
</P>
<P>
British National Farmers' Union President Ben Gill met the
French ambassador to Britain to challenge the French decision, a
Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
"This illegal action by the French throws into question the
very basis of EU law and the credibility of the European Union.
That is why it is important that we resolve this incident at the
earliest opportunity," Gill was quoted as saying. "In the
meantime, I have no doubt that British consumers will re-consider
whether to buy French produce. I am confident they will support
our country's farmers."
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Nick Brown vowed not to buy any
French produce himself, but stopped short of calling for a
nationwide boycott of French food and drink, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
Brown, speaking at an agricultural conference in Devon,
southwest England, was asked whether he would buy French produce
in the light of France's refusal to allow imports of British beef.
</P>
<P>
"No. I think what they have done is very wrong and personally
I'm not going to," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would drink French wine, he said, "I'm a great
fan of Australian and New Zealand wines. There are also some nice
English wines."

<HEADLINE> AL Urges Israel to Recognize Palestinian Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid Monday called on Israel to recognize the
Palestinians' legitimate rights, including the right to establish
an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid made the call ahead of the anniversary of the
Arab-Israeli war on October 6, 1973, during which Egypt and Syria
ripped open Israel's defense lines on two fronts in the initial
stage.
</P>
<P>
It is unacceptable that Israel continues occupation of Arab
territories, especially Arab East Jerusalem, and violation of the
Palestinians' rights, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want to establish an independent state with
East Jerusalem as its capital. But Israel insists that Jerusalem
is its "eternal and undivided capital." The two sides have begun
the final status talks, which include the two thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum said the Arabs are
capable of liberating their lands by thwarting Israel's schemes to
maintain occupation.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid called on the Arabs to counter Israel's plots to
evade obligations under the peace agreements signed with the
Palestinians and resumption of the peace talks with Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli negotiations came to a halt in early 1996
and the two sides are disputing over the future of the Golan
Heights that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
War.
</P>
<P>
After the moderate Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, was
elected in May, the two sides have expressed readiness to resume
the peace talks.

ABUJA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and South Africa must
rapidly put their troubled histories behind in a bid to enable
them to fulfill the " destiny thrust on them by nature," Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo told a visiting South African
delegation in Abuja Monday.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries went sour during the reign
of late Nigerian military dictator General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria and South African must rapidly put their troubled
histories behind them and start fulfilling the greatest destinies
thrust on them by nature for the good of their citizens and the
rest of Africa," the Nigerian president told the delegation led by
South African African Vice-President Jacob Zuma.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said that with democratization and the restoration of
majority rule in Nigeria, the two countries had incentives for
increased cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He told the South African delegation in Nigeria for two days of
talks on a joint commission that both countries must build on
existing "excellent relations" to harness their abundant human and
material resources for the benefit of their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Zuma praised Nigeria's contribution to ending apartheid in his
country, saying that history would not forgive the leaders of both
countries if they failed to seize the momentum of their relations
for boosting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Zuma listed possible areas of cooperation as agriculture, power
and energy, solid minerals, science and technology, trade and
commerce, telecommunications, air transport and customs and
immigration.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Atiku Abubakar is leading the Nigerian team to
the talks expected to provide a framework for the joint commission

Sankoh will have the rank of vice-president and head a strategic

<HEADLINE> Rome Court Grants Ocalan Political Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A Rome civil court Monday granted
political asylum to Abdullah Ocalan, the head of the Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK), who was sentenced to death by a Turkish
court since abandoning Italy in February.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan asked for political asylum here with his arrival at
Rome's international Fiumicino airport on November 12 last year at
the end of a flight from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
With his application still pending, the rebel leader left the
country in February. Later in the same month, Ocalan was captured
by Turkish special forces in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He was convicted on the charge of treason and sentenced to
death on June 29 but the Turkish parliament still has to ratify
the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Italian-Turkish relations soured in the wake of Ocalan's
arrival in Italy and over Rome's refusal to hand him over to
Ankara, which holds the outlawed PKK chief responsible for a
14-year-long conflict in which more than 30,000 people have died.
</P>
<P>
One of Ocalan's lawyers in Italy, Luigi Saraceni, said that
"not only as a defense attorney but also as a citizen I am
pleased" with the ruling handed down by the Rome court.
</P>
<P>
"This measure indicates the high level of Italian
jurisprudence. There were judicial authorities in Italy with the
capability and independence for recognizing an unalienable right,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Leading Drugs Companies Threaten Pulling out of UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The British Government has been
warned that leading drugs companies will consider pulling out of
Britain if it adopts an "antagonistic" attitude towards the
pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
The warning came on Monday from the chairman of Glaxo Wellcome
as the latest broadside in the row over the rejection of the
anti-flu drug Relenza for National Health Service prescriptions.
Glaxo Wellcome, a leading pharmaceutical company, threatened legal
action against the government after the drug was rejected for
prescriptions on the NHS.
</P>
<P>
The company wants a judicial review after the decision by the
National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice), the body which
assesses new treatments. The institute said there was not enough
evidence that Relenza, a powder spray inhaled through the mouth
and costing 24 pounds a time, was cost effective.
</P>
<P>
Glaxo Wellcome chairman Sir Richard Sykes, speaking to BBC on
Monday, said: "If (the government) continues to make the
environment antagonistic to this industry then obviously it will
start to move elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Sir Richard Sykes said ministers should bear in mind that Glaxo
Wellcome does 50 percent of its research in Britain even though 94
percent of its business was outside the UK.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Health Secretary Frank Dobson published in the
Sunday Telegraph, Sir Richard Sykes said the decision represented
"a very serious threat to the future of one of the UK's most
successful international industries."
</P>
<P>
Relenza is said to reduce the length and severity of flu if
taken at the right time. But Nice warned that the drug could cost
the NHS 115 million pounds (about 180 million U.S.dollars ) if
there was a flu epidemic.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that it hoped Austria's Freedom Party would continue the
tradition for equal rights for all minorities if it becomes part
of the government.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that U.S.
officials, who held talks with Freedom Party leader Joerg Haider
after his party won a second place in weekend parliamentary
elections, emphasized "strong opposition to any statements or
polities that could be interpreted as sympathetic to the Nazi
regime or is xenophobic."
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the remarks as Haider once praised Adolf Hitler's
employment policies and called veterans of the Nazi Waffen SS "men
of character."
</P>
<P>
Rubin declined to predict the impact on Austrian-American
relations if the Freedom party becomes part of a coalition
government for Austria.
</P>
<P>
"This is a parliamentary election, and a coalition hasn't yet
been formed, and so I don't want to pre-criticize comething that
has not happened yet," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Network Product Support Worldwide Hot Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide spending for
network product support will be close to 6.5 billion U.S. dollars
in 1999, up more than a billion dollars from last year, U.S.
market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
By 2003, IDC estimated, vendors that provide these services
will collectively make almost 8.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the hot markets in terms of technology are
gateways, remote access concentrators and private wide area
network (WAN) switches. These technologies are expected to grow at
an annual rate of 62 percent, 32 percent and 30 percent
respectively between 1998 and 2003, compared with just 10 percent
growth of revenues in the overall market.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the remote access space has been fueled by the
increase in branch and home offices connected to corporate local
area networks (LANs), the growth of corporate Internet
connectivity, and the purchase of access equipment by global
telecommunications carriers and Internet service providers, IDC
said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of activity, IDC said, the fastest-growing areas will
be electronic support and remote diagnostics.
</P>
<P>
Declining technology areas for network product support services
will include network interface cards, multiplexers, communications
processors and channel extenders.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 100,000 people have fled
Chechnya as tension escalated in the breakaway Russian republic in
the past few weeks, the Federal Migration Service said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government of Ingushetia reported the arrival of 99,029
Chechen refugees in the tiny republic of 30,000 people, the
Interfax news agency quoted the service as saying.
</P>
<P>
Authorities of Daghestan, another republic bordering Chechnya,
estimated the number of refugees there at 3,200.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 2,129 people, mostly Russians, fled to the
republic of North Ossetia.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Monday ordered the
creation of a commission to tackle the Chechen refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
"Today, a state commission will be set up for accommodation of
refugees and returning life to normal on the territory of
Chechnya's areas that are in control of federal troops," Putin
told reporters after his meeting with President Boris Yeltsin
early Monday.
</P>
<P>
Consignments of humanitarian aid have been reaching the regions
near Chechnya, but local authorities said the assistance was far
from enough.
</P>
<P>
"There is a bad need for temporary housing, tents, warm cloths
and food at the moment," Interfax reported, quoting Magomet
Gireev, acting head of the migration service of the Ingush
republic.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Never Hampers U.S. Company in Iran: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of Mines and
Metal Eshaq Jahangiri said here Monday that Tehran has never
hampered activities of U.S. companies in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Rather, he said in an interview on the sidelines of the 25th
Tehran International Trade Fair, it was the U.S. government that
has prevented American firms from taking part in commercial
activities in Iran it regarded as a "rouge state."
</P>
<P>
Washington severed its diplomatic relations with Tehran in 1980
after its embassy there was occupied by radical students and
embassy staff held hostage in the heydays of Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had been trying to "contain" this "hostile state" by
imposing an economic and military embargo against it. And
Washington even vowed to punish any Western company that invests
heavily in Iran's oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
Although tensions between the two countries have been easing
since the moderate President Mohammad Khatami came to power two
years ago, the wall of mistrust has never been broken.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said Tehran is eager to attract direct
foreign investments, and for this purpose, the first international
gathering on investments in mining and metals projects is to be
held on October 19-20 in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"the gathering is to offer 100 projects worth 10 billion
U.S. dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 foreign companies from Europe, Canada, Japan and an
American company along with 100 domestic firms have applied for
participating in the gathering, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign companies can invest up to 100 percent in the
projects or choose to enter into partnership with Iranian
companies, he said, quoted by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
But the law stipulates that any foreign company willing to
invest in a project wants to use over 50 percent of foreign
facilities and capabilities, it should first get approval from
Iran's economy council.
</P>
<P>
Among 100 projects to be offered at the meeting, 20 are related
to steel, 14 to copper, 10 to aluminum and nine to ferroalloy
sectors, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Greek Foreign Minister's Visit to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that it was encouraged by Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou's visit to Turkey and hoped it would help jump-start
talks between the two countries over the disputed island of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The visit ... is part of the improved climate between Turkey
and Greece," State Department spokesman James Rubin said. "We
hope these kinds of visits will have a positive impact."
</P>
<P>
Papandreou who came to Ankara on Sunday was the first top Greek
official since relations thawed after both nations suffered from
earthquakes a few weeks ago and rushed to one another's aid.
</P>
<P>
The United States hopes the visit "also helps our efforts to
jump-start comprehensive Cyprus negotiations without
preconditions under U.S. auspices," Rubin told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"What's important here is that discussions on how to improve
Greek-Turkish relations are now under way in Turkey," he added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects Election in Georgia's Abkhazia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Monday that it
considers the presidential polls on Sunday in the Georgian
republic of Abkhazia as "unacceptable and illegitimate."
</P>
<P>
Russia's attitude to "the so-called election in Abkhazia,
Georgia" is "expressed in the July 30 resolution of U.N. Security
Council," Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia is a constituency within Georgia, and like the rest of
the world community, Russia has not acknowledged its independence,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, President Eduard Shevardnadze
said the Abkhazian elections were by no means democratic, as it
were held after "ethnic cleansing" directed against ethnic
Georgians in Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
The actual status of Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba will
not change after these elections, Shevardnadze said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that while Tbilisi wants to use every means to settle
the Abkhazia problem peacefully, it could still play the military
card.
</P>
<P>
While praising the Russian Foreign Ministry's stance on the
Abkhazia polls as constructive, Shevardnadze lashed out at the
Russian State Duma's dispatching its members to act as observers
in the Abkhazian elections. This was "still another unfriendly
step" against Georgia, he said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes for Better Relations With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said on Monday that he hoped for a bright future in
relations between Greece and Turkey based on dialog and assistance
of politicians who were interested in peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of Istanbul University's 1999-2000
academic year, Papandreou, who arrived in Istanbul on Sunday,
said the peoples of both countries were in favor of peace and
would bring about it despite different interpretations on the
meaning of world peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Papandreou said no double standards should be
applied in Turkey's application for membership in the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Noting that Greece, a EU member, was adopting a single standard
on this issue, he stressed that Turkey should equally apply a
single standard.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou rejected the notion that the EU was a "Christian
Club" which was closed to other countries where religions were
practiced by the majority. Turkey is a dominantly Muslim-populated
country with a secular regime.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Greece strongly supports Turkey's
Europeanization and wants Turkey in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The thorny Turkish-Greek ties went through a severe crisis in
February when Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
leader Abdullah Ocalan surfaced at the Greek Embassy compound in
Nairobi, Kenya. Turkey had long been accusing Greece of supporting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, their relations warmed up dramatically after Athens
and Ankara lent helping hands to each other immediately after both
countries were hit by strong quakes.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), have long been at odds over air space,
sovereignty over some Aegean islands and the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Failures on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Business failures in Britain have
increased to their highest level in seven years, as a new survey
showed that 11,741 firms went bust in the three months July to
September, the worst figure since 16,000 failed in the Summer of
1992.
</P>
<P>
"Although there has been a rise in business confidence amongst
almost all sectors of the economy, these figures illustrate the
downside of the very tight profit margins under which many
companies are having to operate," said Philip Mellor, senior
analyst at Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, which undertook the survey.
</P>
<P>
The number of business failures has been accelerating, with the
underlying rate rising by 13.2 percent for the nine months of this
year, compared to 10.7 percent for the first six months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, 33,000 businesses have failed, about 850
every week, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Although the UK economy is now improving, with economic growth
predicted to reach 1.5 percent this year, it is clear that pricing
pressures are putting many firms' profits at risk.
</P>
<P>
With inflation at 2.1 percent, companies are finding that
customers are refusing to pay higher prices in the shops. And the
availability of cheap imports from abroad, helped by the high
pound, has also pushed down manufacturers' margins.
</P>
<P>
The figures will add to pressures for the Bank of England to
refrain from further interest rate rises when its Monetary Policy
Committee makes its decision on Thursday, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
However, the picture for manufacturing industry remains mixed.
Recent surveys of business confidence suggest that most British
companies are becoming more optimistic about the future.
</P>
<P>
There are strong regional variations in the rate of business
failure, with the relatively prosperous South-East contrasting
with high rates of failure in Wales, the Midlands, and the
North-East.
</P>
<P>
In London there was actually a decline in business failures,
with 4.8 percent fewer firms going bust. And in the South-East,
there were only 6.8 percent more failures, half the national
average.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, there was a massive 35 percent increase in Welsh
firms failing so far this year, compared with the previous nine
months.
</P>
<P>
Also hard hit was the East Midlands, where failures increased
by 25.9 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Urged to Work Together on Human Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government Monday
urged all stake-holders to work together in an effort to improve
the living condition in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
"I urge private sector, civil societies and other stake-holders
in Kenya to forge partnership and facilitate undertaking of
housing projects," Kenyan Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Center for Human Settlement (Habitat) Mary Odinga said at
a ceremony marking the World Habitat Day in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's World Habitat Day on October 4 is
"Cities for All", which means that all urban residents are
entitled to basic facilities, urban management and planning.
</P>
<P>
In oder to address the problems associated with rapid
urbanization, the Kenyan government is concentrating on the
eradication of poverty as a first step to improve urban living
environment, said Andrew Kiptoon, Kenyan Minister for Roads and
Public Works.
</P>
<P>
"The government is also undertaking other corrective measures
to solve urbanization problems. These steps include the
preparation of national housing policy, revision of building laws
and setting up of land use commission," said Kiptoon.
</P>
<P>
Due to the prevailing urban poverty, more than 50 percent of
Kenya's urban residents live in slums, where essential facilities
like clean water, power, health care are not adequate.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's urban population is expanding by seven percent each
year and by the year 2000 a quarter of Kenyans will be living in
cities.
</P>
<P>
The rapid urbanization in the country is reportedly attributed
to influx of refugees, increasing poverty in rural areas and
migration to cities for job opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Falls with Profit Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices fell back from
recent highs on Monday, but apparently not enough to convince
dealers that the long rally was over.
</P>
<P>
International benchmark Brent for November delivery finished
down 69 cents at 22.98 U.S.dollars a barrel on Monday, about 1.30
U.S. dollars below 33-month highs touched last week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers put the losses down to a bout of selling from the
speculative fund buyers who have gambled correctly on oil price
rises and are now looking to pocket the gains, a Reuters reports
said.
</P>
<P>
"It's just nervous profit-taking. Fundamentals remain unaltered
and we're definitely not seeing the big turnaround," Christopher
Bellew, a director at brokers Prudential Bache International, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have more than doubled over the past eight months
after leading crude producers agreed to withdraw some two million
barrels per day (bpd) of supply to force prices higher.
</P>
<P>
Wary of renewed falls, export cartel OPEC last month declared
that supply curbs would stay in place until March 2000 at least as
they replenish state revenues cleared out by last year's price
slump, according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
Key producers are keeping in close contact as they seek to
ensure that the oil price rally has a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
Producers want to ensure they do not lose market share by
keeping supply curbs too long or tip the market back into
oversupply by restarting too much too soon.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts estimate that world demand growth could be high
enough to allow three million bpd more OPEC output. Others say
that rebounding production outside the cartel will keep OPEC's
rises down to barely one million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Mild losses now could actually help sustain oil's strength
longer term, as it would help make the market less vulnerable to a
sudden mass exit by speculators, a Reuters analysis said.

LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- World wheat production is
estimated to be 4 million tons higher than August at 573 million
tons, according to the latest figures released by the
International Grains Council (IGC).
</P>
<P>
Revisions include higher figures for Australia, Canada, Russia

The forecast for world wheat trade is unchanged at 100 million
tons. The increase of 5 million tons from last season will consist
mostly of milling quality grains.
</P>
<P>
World wheat consumption is forecast 2 million tons higher than
the August figure at 585 million tons, mainly reflecting an
increase in feed use in the European Council.
</P>

The world wheat stocks projection is unchanged at 115 million
tons, a decline of 12 million tons from last year.

<HEADLINE> S. African Currency Firm As Gold Price Keeps Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The South African currency
rand was firmer at midday Monday on the back of a 12-U.S. dollar
an ounce surge on the gold price from its London morning fix.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement in the gold price, the rand is once again
hovering at the 6.00 rand to the dollar level.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the gold price was still pretty volatile, helping
the rand strengthen whenever it goes higher. However bullion's
volatility would make it difficult for the rand to stabilize below
the 6.00 level again.
</P>
<P>
The rand was expected to find its base at the technical 6.00
per dollar level. But if the gold price keeps on going higher, it
is going to breach the technical level, said some dealers.
</P>
<P>
The rand was last at 6.0060 per dollar from a previous close of
6.0130. The currency touched a best level of 6.0001 Monday as the
bullion price went higher than 310 dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
The gold price was last at 313.50 dollars an ounce from Monday
morning's London fix of 301 dollars an ounce and a previous New
York close of 304.25 dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
The South African Reserve Bank's gross gold and foreign
exchange reserves rose to 39.2 billion rand (6.53 billion dollars)
at the end of September from 37.3 billion rand (6.21 billion
dollars) at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The forward book fell to 19.2 billion dollars at the end of
September from 20.2 billion dollars at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the better gold price had contributed to the
reserves improvement.
</P>
<P>
They expect the rand to continue trading between 6.00 and 6.02
Monday.

Exchange (IPE) announced Monday that from now on it is possible to
trade gas, oil and natural gas futures up to three years ahead,
improving the long-term risk management service available at the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Previously gas and oil futures could be traded up to 18 months
ahead and natural gas traded 15 months ahead (15 individual months
as well as balance of the month and daily contracts).
</P>
<P>
The extensions bring gas, oil and natural gas futures into line
with Brent Crude, which has traded out for three years since
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The IPE now lists 12 consecutive months, four quarter months
and two half year months (a total of 18 contract months) for gas
and oil futures. An additional seven quarter months have been
added for natural gas futures.
</P>
<P>
Trevor Christmas, vice president of Business Development at the
IPE, said, "We are pleased to be able to offer this additional
service to our members and users. The extraordinary price
volatility experienced over the last two years has clearly
demonstrated the benefits of hedging."

<HEADLINE> UNEP Guidelines to Identify Sources of Organic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Guidelines are now available at
the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) for helping
countries identify sources of poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to
safeguard public health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Although out of production today but still found in a variety
of electrical equipment and materials, PCBs were used as additives
to oils in electrical equipment, hydraulic machinery and other
devices, according to a UNEP press release available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Toepfer, UNEP Executive Director, noted that PCBs are
among the most widespread environmental pollutants on the planet,
saying that they have been detected in all environmental media,
including surface and ground water, soil, food and air.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP guidelines give specific details on how to tell the
equipment contains PCBs, a knowledge gap that is vital to fill
because various manufacturers assigned their own names to the PCBs
they produced.
</P>
<P>
"Countries are determined to respond to this problem, and these
 guidelines will be valuable as a tool in identifying sources of
PCBs, with the ultimate goal of establishing management priorities
and strategies," Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that PCBs are persistent, capable of being
transported long distances and soluble in fat. They
bio-accumulate as they move higher in the food chain. "Europe,
along with the rest of the world, got a wake-up call only a few
months ago when chicken, eggs, and other meat products had to be
removed from the market because of contamination from dioxins and
PCBs," Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
Covering basic identification techniques, the document also
cites more than 90 trade names and synonyms for PCB mixtures and
lists dozens of transformer and capacitor manufacturers that used
PCBs.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines are part of continuing efforts by the UNEP to
assist countries in dealing with PCBs and the other 11 persistent
organic pollutants (POPs) which are the focus of the legally
binding international treaty now being negotiated, Toepfer added.

<HEADLINE> Barak Urges Assad to Advance Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak on Monday urged Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to move the
Israeli-Syrian peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
"The door of opportunity is opened today and let us make
painful decisions to solve the problems between Israel and
Syria," Barak said in his policy address to the 15th Knesset
(parliament) which opened its winter session after a two-month
summer recession.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's policy for a settlement of the Golan
Heights issue, Barak said realizing peace with Syria will be
based on security arrangements between the two sides, and this
principle also applies to a settlement of the Lebanese issue.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Israel will pull out its troops from
south Lebanon by July next year, no matter what happens.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks, he
said Israel will conduct such talks with the Palestinians under
the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
But he said Israel sticks to its policy on solving key issues
with the Palestinians: no return to the 1967 border lines, no
return of the Palestinian refugees to the Israeli controlled
territories, no dismantlement of the Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem to remain as Israel's
united capital.

<HEADLINE> British Asked to Explain to Deportation Of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The British High Commission in
Zimbabwe has been asked to explain to the upsurge in deportation
of Zimbabweans wishing to enter Britain, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans
Association and the Zimbabwe Indigenous Economic Empowerment
Organization Monday met British High Commission officials and
asked the high commission to investigate the deportations.
</P>
<P>
Scores of Zimbabweans, including students, business people,
holiday makers and even children, have allegedly been harassed for
hours before being turned away.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two groups said they were disturbed by the
number of Zimbabweans being turned away at Heathrow and Gatwick
airports after being said not to meet stipulated requirements.
</P>
<P>
"We are not saying that the British should allow everyone, even
 criminals to enter their country. However, those with genuine
reasons for entering Britain should be allowed to do so," said
Paddington Japa of the Zimbabwean indigenous organization.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was ironic that English citizens wanting to
get into Zimbabwe were not exposed to the rigorous questioning
that was done to Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
He said the British, as the ones who preached democracy, should
uphold this principle by treating Zimbabweans fairly.
</P>
<P>
Chenjarai Hunzvi of the veteran association said that the
treatment of Zimbabweans at British airports was worrying. "The
harassment must definitely stop," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jim Liddell, an official at the British High Commission, said
that authorities would investigate why some Zimbabweans had been
refused entry into England.
</P>
<P>
"Many Zimbabweans are living in the United Kingdom and we
appreciate their contribution to the economy," Liddell said.
"Last year alone more than 32,000 Zimbabweans visited Britain and
they enjoyed their stay."

<HEADLINE> EU to Postpone Ostrich Imports From Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
waived for a year the requirement which should have been in force
by the end of the month for Southern African Development Community
(SADC) states to export livestock products free of the Newcastle
disease.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Veterinary Department announced this in Harare
Monday, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Services Director of the department, Stuart Hargreaves, said
that the SADC states had raised concerns over the regulation.
</P>
<P>
It was difficult for the southern African countries to comply
with the directive, Hargreaves said.
</P>
<P>
The new rule called for the slaughter of all livestock or
poultry in an affected area once there was an outbreak of
Newcastle in poultry and a six- month ban on the export of such
products.
</P>
<P>
If stock is not slaughtered, the region could face a blanket
three-year ban.
</P>
<P>
"It appeared more like a trade barrier and is not based on any
scientific factor. Therefore by postponing the introduction of
this directive, the EU will accept poultry or ostrich exports on
the basis of risk assessment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle was difficult to eradicate because of the rapid life
cycle of the birds, and therefore such a directive would curtail
the export of both ostrich and poultry products to the highly
lucrative EU market, said the Zimbabwe veterinary official.
</P>
<P>
He said the SADC region had conducted a risk management
assessment which revealed that some ostrich and poultry being
produced under certain conditions had very low risk of contracting
the disease.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and South Africa are leading exporters of ostrich meat
to Europe.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Concerned About Environmental Degradation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
expressed concern at the rate at which the environment is being
degraded as a result of deforestation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The general populace should notice that there is definite
climatic change in Zambia evidenced in the prevalence of disease,
increased temperatures and sudden changes of the weather, William
Harringtone, Environment and Natural Resources Minister, said in
Lusaka Monday.
</P>
<P>
When officially opening the training of Leadership for the
Environment and Development Southern Africa, Harringtone said it
is for this reason that the government has implemented the Zambia
Forestry Action Plan, which is a master plan for sustainable
forestry management that should allow the government reverse the
loss of biological diversity obtaining in protected forests.
</P>
<P>
The organization is made up of six members: Zambia, Malawi,
Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa and the meeting is
the first of its kind in Zambia and the participants are expected
to tour major environmental sites in the country.
</P>
<P>
Harringtone appealed to the associates to take a keen interest
in the new approaches in environmental conservation, which include
community participation because it is at the heart of the
community where poverty is prevalent and it is at this level that
mechanisms and methodologies for participation should be
developed.

<P>
KAMPALA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A big chimpanzee sanctuary was
launched on Lake Victoria in Uganda's Mukono district by Ugandan
First Lady Janet Museveni Sunday, a press release issued by the
President's Office said Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Welhelm Moeller, Director of the Uganda Wildlife Education
Center, said at the launching function that the chimpanzees are
brought to the center after being retrieved from animal dealers or
poachers.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has about 3,000 chimpanzees left in the wild and tourism
is now becoming one of the key foreign exchange earners for the
land-locked country.
</P>
<P>
The first lady called on wildlife personnel to actively engage
in educating the population about the importance of wildlife which
she said plays an important role in the well-being of the people
and the country.
</P>
<P>
The ministries of education and tourism were urged to put more
efforts into supporting wildlife clubs in schools so that the
children of the country can grow up appreciating and respecting
their natural environment.
</P>
<P>
She appealed to the community on the island in Busanga parish
where the wildlife sanctuary is located, especially their leaders,
to learn as much as possible about chimpanzees and act as natural
guardians and protectors of the sanctuary.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Recrudescence of the Angolan
civil war and regional conflicts in southern and central Africa
dominated the just-ended meeting of the Angolan-U.S. Consultative
Commission, official news agency Angop reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, which marked an official creation of the
 bilateral commission, paid great attention to the current fierce
battle in the central plateau of Angola, the area under long-term
control of the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Angop quoted Samuel Burger, U.S. presidential advisor on
national security, as saying that the U.S. is cooperating with the
United Nations in reinforcing the fulfillment of the multilateral
sanctions against the UNITA led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Burger also said that U.N. is making efforts to find a way for
ending the illegal trade of diamonds with the UNITA, which has
been providing the rebel organization with the main source of
revenue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting held in Washington starting from September 30,
attended by high-ranking officials of both governments, also
discussed the future of the bilateral relations and the
reinforcement of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral consultative commission is an organization
established by Angola and the U.S. for discussing issues with
common concerns and promoting bilateral relations, according to
Angop.

<HEADLINE> EU To Help Neighbors Crackdown On Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here Monday that it is going to launch a 4.5 million euro (4.8
million U.S. dollar) program of assistance to help the countries
of Central and Eastern Europe tackle drug trafficking, money
laundering, car theft and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
The assistance will be given through a system of modules
targeted towards a group of so-called "change-agents" such as
police and government officials who are in a position to
contribute to the progress of their national systems in order to
meet the standards of the European Union and its member states,
the commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Four modules will deal with police ethics, management, police
cooperation in Europe, and training. In addition, 13 specific
modules will cover the problems of control of migration flows,
drug trafficking, financial crime and money laundering, stolen
art, car theft, trade in human beings, trafficking in weapons and
radioactive materials, environmental crime, methods of technical
crime investigation, prevention of criminality, maintaining public
order, policing a multicultural society, and dealing with extreme
phenomena.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive body said modular training courses will be
organized for groups of eight high-ranking officers from the
police or governmental departments. The participants are expected
to have sound knowledge of their national legislation and
regulations in the field of the specific module.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the courses, trainers and trainees will draft
joint reports on the similarities and differences between EU
standards and those in the candidate countries. "The Central
European participants will then apply the newly gained knowledge
in their daily work in order to reduce any gaps that might have
been identified," it added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Launches 1st Comprehensive Study on Older </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Monday
launched the first comprehensive study to consider the situation
of the older persons in Pakistan, as part of the celebration of
the International Year of Older Persons and the International Day
for the Elderly, which falls on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Information Center launched a 90-page study entitled
"Growing Old in Pakistan: Challenges for the New Millennium" in
Islambabad in the first comprehensive attempt to examine the
situation of senior citizens in all parts of the country and to
offer a number of recommendations to improve their condition, U.N.
officials said here.
</P>
<P>
Funded by the United Nations Population Fund, the report is
meant to document the living conditions of the elderly in
Pakistan, and to provide an objective analysis of their economic,
health and social needs.
</P>
<P>
It suggests possible directions and policy options to improve
the lot of the older people in the country. Special efforts were
made to listen to the elderly themselves, through focus group
discussions organized in four provinces of the South Asian
country.
</P>
<P>
The exercise offered them the opportunity to voice out their
concerns and fears, their aspirations and expectations and to
share their legitimate wishes and dreams. A total of 28 practical
recommendations conclude the report.
</P>
<P>
The world's elderly population, aged 60 or above, reached 251
million in 1950 and 488 million in 1990. It will reach 1,250
million in 2025, representing an increase of 146 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of the current and future increases will take place in the
developing countries, in Asia and South Asia in particular.
</P>
<P>
"South Asia will experience dramatic increase of its elderly
population by nearly nine times between 2010 and 2025 when life
expectancy will increase to 75 years for men and 82 years for
women," a news release of the U.N. Information Center said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is one of the countries where the number and
percentage of elderly people is set to increase significantly
because of higher life expectancy and a decline in the population
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Based on the 1998 national census, the estimate of the
population of Pakistan in 1999 is around 133 million, of whom more
than 7.3 million are in the age bracket of 60 and above.

UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Monday decided to raise the ceiling of Iraq's oil
export for the current phase from 5.256 billion U.S. dollars to

</P>
<P>
Under the "oil for food" deal with the United Nations, Iraq is
allowed to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six

the Security Council decided to raise the amount to 5.256 billion
early last year due to the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest report from the United Nations, Iraq is
likely to export 7 billion dollars worth of oil in the current
phase which will expire in November.

<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Financial Services Authority
(FSA) Monday outlined an ambitious initiative to educate the
public about investing.
</P>
<P>
In his first Consultation Paper on Comparative Information,
Howard Davies, chairman of the regulator, said the plans for a
comprehensive system of league tables were designed to lead people
to the best value in investment and pensions.
</P>
<P>
The paper sets out the results of feasibility work carried out
by the FSA looking particularly at a range of five savings and
investment products.
</P>
<P>
But comparative information on a much broader range of
products, including for example mortgages and retail banking
services, could potentially be included, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The FSA has been working on the project since the budget last
March, when Gordon Brown, chancellor of the Exchequer, ordered the
watchdog to set up league tables that would enable savers to avoid
the mis-selling perils of the past.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the FSA said that although the proposals
would be comprehensive, they were not set in stone. "This is a
consultation paper and we are looking for a wide range of feedback
to make sure it works," she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) Monday announced it will establish a Y2K liquidity
scheme to help meet temporary Y2K-related liquidity needs of banks
and finance companies.
</P>
<P>
The liquidity scheme will be available for a two-month period
from November 29, 1999, to January 28, 2000, said the MAS, that
functions as the central bank of the city state, in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
Under the liquidity scheme, MAS will provide funds in Singapore
currency to banks and finance companies facing temporary
Y2K-related liquidity shortages through repurchase transactions
(repose) of Singapore Government Securities and bonds issued by
Singapore Statutory Boards.
</P>
<P>
The repose will be priced at 1.5 percent above applicable
market rates of the previous working day and the tenure of repose
will be up to 3 months.
</P>
<P>
MAS said that the liquidity scheme would be an additional
measure to provide temporary assistance to banks and finance
companies in the unlikely event that they are unable to obtain
funding in the market during the available period.
</P>
<P>
Banks and finance companies are required to put in place
appropriate liquidity management processes and detailed
contingency plans to maintain adequate liquidity that may be
needed for the Y2K cross-over period.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Make Int'l Year Meaningful for Older Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Deputy
Secretary-General Louise Frechette Monday voiced the U.N.
determination to make the International Year of Older Persons more
meaningful for senior citizens around the world.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is determined to play its part in ensuring
that the International Year of Older Persons continues to bear
fruit," she said.
</P>
<P>
She made the statement at the plenary meeting of the 54th
General Assembly session, which began here Monday to consider the
follow-up to the International Year of Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
"We have undertaken a number of long-term initiatives, such as
the Research Agenda on ageing for the 21st century and a database
for national programs and policies that is accessible on the
Internet," she said.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Year, 99 national committees and innumerable
other actors from all sectors -- governments, non-governmental
organizations, academic institutions and the corporate world, not
to mention the U.N. family -- convened conferences, organizing
campaigns, launched studies, held cultural events and created
Internet pages, "all in pursuit of one goal: highlighting the
issue of ageing and raising awareness of the implications of the
demographic revolution for individuals and societies all over the
world," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Another important fact the Year has brought to light is that
although Europe is projected to remain the major area of the world
affected by ageing, future changes will be more dramatic in the
less developed regions," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The Year also helped put the ageing revolution in a more
positive perspective," she said. "Extending life expectancy is, we
have been reminded, something humanity has always striven for."
</P>
<P>
"The International Year has helped us to realize that,
throughout the 21st century, policies dealing with older persons
have been developed in the context of young societies," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have collectively realized our dream of a longer
life, we must adapt to that reality," she said. "When it comes to
policies, infrastructure and the distribution of resources,
governments will have to find ways of addressing that concern
other age groups."
</P>
<P>
"The financial security and health of older persons will
continue to be among our foremost concerns," she said. "At the
same time we must look much further than this, and in particular
at issues such as lifelong learning, the promotion of healthy
lifestyles from early childhood, family networks, relations
between generations, the special situation of women, labor
policies and the link between ageing and socio-economic
development," she said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the General Assembly proclaimed 1999 as the
International Year of Older Persons, with the theme "towards a
society for all ages."
</P>
<P>
Globally, one out of every 10 persons is aged 60 or over; by
2020, the corresponding figure will be one out of every eight; and
by 2150, every third person will be over 60, Frechette said.

<HEADLINE> China Gives High Priority to Issue of Elderly Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat
said here Monday that the Chinese Government has given high
priority to the issue of the elderly persons and made active
efforts in the fields of legislation and social welfare as the
nation is facing a growing elderly population in the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the statement at the plenary meeting of the
54th General Assembly session, which opened here as part of the
celebration of the International Year of Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
"With the development in the economic, scientific and
technological, educational, cultural and health care in China and
the improvement of living standard for the Chinese people, the
average life expectancy of the Chinese population has been rising
and now reached around 70 years old," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, both the sheer number of our aged population and
its proportion in our overall population are on the rise," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is projected that by the year 2020, the population of the
elderly in China will stand at 230 million, about 15.6 percent of
the nation's overall population, and the number will continue to
rise and reach 410 million by the year 2050, Shen said. "By then,
the proportion of the population of the elderly will make up 27.4
percent of the whole population."
</P>
<P>
"Such a huge elderly population and such rapid speed of growth
of this portion of the overall population will pose a severe
challenge to a developing country like China whose economy is
still not very developed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government has given high priority to the issue
and made active efforts in the fields of legislation and social
welfare," he said.
</P>
<P>
China formulated the "China Development Plan of Work on
Ageing," in which the Chinese Government "set specific goals for
the work, that the elderly people being supported, enjoying
medical care, contributive to the society, engaging in life-long
learning and enjoying a happy life," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Gradually, a social welfare system suited to the China'a
national conditions is taking shape, which consolidate the part
of the government, the community, the family and individual
elderly," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Humanity is moving to the new millennium," he said. "The
ageing of the population will become a major social issue in the
new millennium and it is a more complicated issue in developing
countries."

MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia warned Monday that it
would reconsider its participation in the Kosovo peacekeeping
operation, including withdrawing, if the course toward the
province's secession from Yugoslavia continues, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russia "cannot help being concerned" by actions of the Kosovo
operation leaders and statements by Western officials. They
"suggest that certain people are attempting to review the existing
agreements concerning Yugoslavia's territorial integrity and
sovereignty," Interfax quoted diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The course for Kosovo's secession would lead "to extremely
serious consequences in the region and in Europe," they said.
</P>
<P>
"Normal cooperation between Russia and the West is based on the
spirit and letter of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244," a
resolution that reaffirms the international community's
recognition of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Unless an understanding is reached, Russia would have no other
option but to withdraw from the peacekeeping operation," they
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said, "this is an extreme step and Russia
will do everything it can to prevent the international effort from
collapsing."
</P>
<P>
Russia has some 3,600 troops in Kosovo as part of a 40,000
multinational peacekeeping force led by NATO.

The researchers, from U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence

CAIRO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Monday
denounced the recent Turkish military incursion into northern Iraq
as violation of Iraq's territorial integrity.
</P>

JOHANNESBURG, October 4 (Xinhua) -- About 15,000 workers
employed in the civil engineering sector could down tools
Wednesday in support of wage demands by the Construction and
Allied Workers' Union and the Building Construction and Allied
Workers' Union.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Construction and Allied Workers' Union
Thabo Morale said Monday that both unions were demanding an
increase of 90 cents an hour, the South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
The South African Federation for Civil Engineering Contractors
(SAFCEC) was digging in its heels on its 35 cents an hour increase
offer, Morale said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the unions decided to down tools after they
deadlocked with management on two occasions during arbitration.
</P>
<P>
As a result, workers in the civil engineering sector of the
construction industry, had decided to strike from October 6.
</P>
<P>
Another point of contention between the employers and the
unions was SAFCEC's refusal to implement overtime at
one-and-a-half times normal pay as prescribed by the labor
relations act, Morale said.
</P>
<P>
SAFCEC was currently paying one-and-a-third for overtime.
</P>
<P>
Morale said that while the unions were willing to enter into
further discussions with the employers' federation, the strike
would begin Wednesday and continue until their demands were met.

MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Russian veterinary service
has lifted its ban on the sale of over 2,000 tons of Belgian meat
imposed in June on the suspicion that it was contaminated by the
carcinogen dioxin, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of this amount, 330 tons were received as European Union food
aid, Interfax quoted veterinary department chief Vyacheslav Avilov
of the Russian Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Avilov said that 1,100 tons of meat inspected for dioxin had
been sent for processing and 1,200 tons will be used for feed at
fur-bearing animal farms.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia had banned the sale of a total of 3,800 tons of
Belgian meat and animal feed, 450 tons of the pork received as
food aid. All the meat was confiscated, sealed and refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
He said the future of the remaining meat, 120 tons of it pork
from food aid found to contain dioxin in laboratory tests in
Italy, is being decided.
</P>
<P>
Russia may consider lifting its June 16 ban on livestock
products from Belgium only after all problems with the potentially
dangerous meat are resolved and new veterinary certificates are
signed for pork, beef, processed meat and dairy products drafted
by the veterinary services of Russia and Belgium in August, Avilov
said.
</P>

The documents contain provisions requiring that each
consignment of food imported from Belgium be inspected for dioxin,

LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Northern Ireland's
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein President Gerry
Adams broke up after less than an hour on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Trimble left the venue at Castle Buildings on the Stormont Estate
in the Northern Ireland capital of Belfast without talking to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Adams said that "no real progress" had been made but they had
agreed to meet again, probably next week.
</P>
<P>
This was the second meeting between the party leaders as part of
the review of the Good Friday Agreement's failure to deliver a
devolved government for Northern Ireland. The review was chaired by
former U.S. Senator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
At the weekend the two leaders outlined their positions at
conferences of the youth wings of their parties.
</P>
<P>
Trimble had a meeting with his party's Young Unionists section
which passed a motion saying Sinn Fein should be excluded from the
political process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the BBC's On the Record program on Sunday, Trimble
called for a "cast iron guarantee" from republicans that IRA
weapons decommissioning would start.
</P>
<P>
But he did not rule out an order of events that would allow a
power-sharing executive to be formed in Belfast days before a
handover of paramilitary guns.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's peace process has been stalled for months
by wrangling between politicians from the Protestant majority

<HEADLINE> Italy to Meet Its Year 2000 Growth Target, Says EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said Monday
that Italy is on track to meet its year 2000 growth forecast and
that in spite of certain weaknesses its economy could not fail to
be pulled along by strengthening recovery in the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Italy's forecast for growth of 2.2 percent and a 1.5 percent
deficit-GDP ratio for the year 2000 is "realistic and even
cautious," sources in Brussels at the European Commission said to
Italian news agency Ansa after a preliminary examination of the
Italian government's latest budget bill.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission also confirmed its previous forecast
that Italy's deficit-GDP ratio could narrow to 2 percent by the
end of 1999, in line with the requirements of the Stability Pact,
the deficit-cutting accords signed by Italy and its euro area
partners.
</P>
<P>
In spite of determined weaknesses, the commission said, the
Italian economy can't fail to be pulled along by the strengthening
economies of the eleven euro zone nations.
</P>
<P>
"The most important fact is that Italy has entered a period of
growth and will feel the effects of the now certain recovery in
Euroland," the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Panama Rejects U.S. Military Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 4 (Xinhua)-- Panama's President Mireya
Moscoso said Monday her government rejects any U.S. proposal of
military assistance, although civil help will be studied.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants any more military presence in our country and we
haven't said that should be military those who help this country
to build roads, schools or health centers", she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mireya said the American proposal will be assessed by her
cabinet, but Panama hasn't accepted it so far.
</P>
<P>
"It's a proposal we are studying and will publish at the
moment we take a decision," said President Moscoso, who rose to
power on September 1.
</P>
<P>
The head of state added that if accepted, the assistance will
have to be civilian and not military.
</P>
<P>
Panama and the United States have enjoyed a traumatic bilateral
relationship since the past century, due to military intervention
and spillings of blood, so the Panamanian people have shown their
rejection of a continuing American military presence in the
country after year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the Torrijos-Carter accords, United States is
obliged to withdraw its personnel form Panama the last day of
this year, when delivery of Panama Canal to Panama's authorities
will conclude.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Global Traffic Demand to Drive Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Optical networking is still
in its early stages and is a multi-billion dollar market
opportunity for investors worldwide, according to a report
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The optical networking is a large and growing market in the
United States, with capital expenditures by carriers set to exceed
70 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, said the report from Banc of
America Securities, a subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation
and an investment bank and brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
Outside the U.S., more than 30 billion U.S. dollars will be
spent on optical networking equipment this year, a number that
will grow by 30 percent through 2001. Moreover, worldwide spending
on active optical components is more than 1.9 billion dollars this
year, and is set to grow by 69 percent through 2001, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the optical networking market is very
diverse and offers investors opportunities in several sectors,
including carriers, optical systems and both active and passive
optical components.
</P>
<P>
The report anticipates no slowdown in the market as the cycle
of bandwidth deployment continues to escalate. The Internet will
continue to be a factor in increasing traffic and competition
between carriers is continuing to reduce the cost of bandwidth to
subscribers. Cheaper bandwidth generates more subscribers who are
willing to pay for faster access to new service offerings. These
new users and services then foster the demand for more bandwidth
and higher speed networks, the report explains.
</P>
<P>
There will be eventually public networks shift to all-optical
networks to provide additional capacity and flexibility to
carriers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
An all-optical network is one in which all public network
functions -- access, transport, multiplexing, switching and
amplification -- are accomplished optically rather than
electrically.
</P>
<P>
Such networks are not yet a reality but the report says that
they will begin to emerge by 2002 due to advances in optical
systems and components.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Germany Agree on Turkey's EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Germany agreed Monday
to find ways to help Turkey become a possible candidate country
for the European Union (EU) by the Helsinki summit in December.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks Monday night, German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, who is in Athens on a working visit, said that
both sides wished to seek a path in order to have a positive
decision adopted on Turkey's accession in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Germany would do all it could in that direction, he said,
adding that negotiations with the candidate countries of the
so-called second wave to proceed without delay.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said that he
set out to his German counterpart the known Greek position
according to which there must be certain moves by Turkey for the
Helsinki summit to be able to arrive at a positive outcome.
</P>
<P>
They also talked bilateral relations and cooperation in the
Balkans, agreeing on the need to promote a stability pact for the
region.
</P>
<P>
As for the forthcoming special EU summit in Tampere, Finland,
Simitis said that for Greece the formulation of a comprehensive
view in dealing with the problems of illegal and mass immigration
from Balkan countries was particularly important.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder fully agreed with Simitis on the need for a fair
distribution of burdens among all member-states and not just those
with external borders.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have come close to war
three times in the past 25 years over territorial disputes and the
Cyprus problem. Athens has repeatedly said that Ankara can not
join the EU unless it improves its human rights record and its
relations with Athens, but the recent earthquakes in Turkey and
Greece have provided the two neighbors a good chance to better
their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Greece has since softened its opposition to Turkey's eventual
membership in the EU, but Simitis stressed once again Saturday
that a country with territorial claims against Greece should not
be allowed to join the EU.

NAIROBI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- An unexpected increase in tea
supply lowered prices of medium and lower tea grades Monday at
Kenya's weekly auction, although better quality tea prices
maintained their upward trend, traders said.

Traders said prices could drop over the next few weeks as crop
production recovered after better weather in some regions.

"Supply in Uganda and western Kenya is up, although not in

JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators concluded their meeting here Monday evening and
reached an agreement on the opening the sage passage linking Gaza
Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, minister of local government of the Palestinian

what has been agreed upon, saying only that they have to report to
their respective leadership about the outcome of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Since Saturday, the Israeli-palestinian negotiators have met
three times to iron out their differences over the opening of the
safe passage. The main disagreements between the two sides were
who will issue of magnetic cards for Palestinians using the
passage and Israel's demand of having the right to arrest
Palestinians suspects traveling on the passage.
</P>
<P>
The passage had been scheduled to to open on Sunday, but the
two sides were unable to wear out disagreements over the thorny
issues.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials in Gaza told Xinhua that Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat has approved the agreement which has been
reached with Israel a short while ago, but the official did not
say when the passage will be open to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The passage, which will link Gaza and the West Bank city of
Hebron, will allow the Palestinians to travel between the two
parts of the territories under their control.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Pick 2nd Cellular Phone Provider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Communications Commission of
Kenya announced Monday that it will choose a second mobile phone
provider to compete with Safaricom, the sole state-owned operator,
by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Chepkong'a, Director-General of the telecommunications
regulatory body, said that six pre-qualified bidders will present
their final bids on November 1 for the commission to complete
assessment by November 20.
</P>
<P>
The winner is expected to get a license in March 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We are on schedule and expect the second mobile provider to
start operation next July," Chepkong'a said.
</P>
<P>
The six bids include joint ventures between big international
players such as France Telecom and South Africa's MTN with local
companies.
</P>
<P>
Chepkong'a said the second mobile provider will boost Kenya's
mobile capacity to 400,000 lines in the next five years from the
current 9,000 lines, and tariff rates would come down.
</P>
<P>
Currently, cellphone services in Kenya are provided by
Safaricom, a subsidiary of state-owned Telkom Kenya, and tariff
rates are extremely high compared with other countries in the
region where competition has already been in place.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges More Foreign Investment in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin on Monday called for more foreign investment in his country
and predicted that Russia will see an annual growth of 3-5 percent
from next year.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is not only not lost to investors, but is a very
promising region of the world," Putin told participants of the
11th session of the government's consultative council on foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
He said industrial production was up 6 percent year-on-year in
the first eight months of 1999 and that the government expects an
output growth of 7-8 percent in comparison to 1998 in the year as
a whole, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin said "ensuring political stability remains a top priority
for all power branches," adding that Moscow's actions to stamp out
rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya have won
understanding from the international community.
</P>
<P>
"Understanding can also be expected from the world business
(community)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of accumulated foreign investments in the Russian
economy totals 27.8 billion U.S. dollars, including 11.7 billion
dollars of direct investments, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked foreign investors for deciding to stay on in Russia
after the 1998 August financial crisis and for their trust in the
Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pledged to do everything possible to improve
the investment climate, to develop a system for ensuring
investments and to improve the laws and regulations governing the
investment sphere.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also urged the investors to move more capital to
Russia's regions, adding that special regulations have been
formulated in many regions to protect and encourage investors.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 49.4 percent of the total volume of foreign
investments get accumulated in Moscow, the capital, Putin said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects Mediation Offer With Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday rejected an
offer by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) to help mediate between Moscow and the breakaway republic
of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Moscow "does not need mediators in talks with the constituent
members of the Russian Federation," Deputy Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Gusarov said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Gusarov's meeting with earlier Monday
with OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut
Vollebaek, who had made a stopover in Moscow on his way from
Central Asia to Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek said in Moscow's Sheremetyevo-2 airport that the OSCE
two days ago officially offered the Russian government
humanitarian aid for the victims of the recent terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 people were killed in four apartment building
explosions in Moscow and two other Russian cities. The government
has blamed Chechen-base rebels as behind the blasts and launched
an air campaign on rebel targets inside Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Some ground fighting are also reported inside the North
Caucasus province.
</P>
<P>
Gusarov said "European organizations have offered humanitarian
aid to Russia" and that "Moscow did not ask for such assistance,
but as the offer has been made we stem from the belief that this
aid must go to all victims of terrorism in Russia."
</P>
<P>
He said that this humanitarian aid will be distributed by the
Russian federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
"We can state with satisfaction that the OSCE is confirming in
clear and unambiguous terms the principle of Russia's territorial
integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is ready to cooperate with the OSCE "in what concerns
humanitarian aspects, including the work of the OSCE's group in
Chechnya," Gusarov said.
</P>
<P>
"But the mandate of this group has no indications and cannot
have any of mediation or good services," he said.

MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior military officer in
Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya said Monday that a federal
warplane was shot down Monday evening, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Su-25 attack aircraft was hit by a Stinger missile and
crashed in Chechnya's Urus-Martan district, Interfax quoted deputy
chief of the general staff Colonel Islam Khasukhanov as saying.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock rose
sharply Monday on the prospect that the Federal Reserve will
leave the interest rates alone when it meets Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 128.23 at
10,401.23.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 21.79 at 1,304.60 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 59.12 at 2,759.97.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied as most economists are betting that the
Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates to cool off the
economy when it meets in Washington on the monetary policy.
Concerns with the higher rates left the Dow index more than
1,000 points below the record closing high of 11,326.04
set on August 25.
</P>
<P>
Investors were also encouraged by corporate merger
announcements. BellSouth decides to join a bidding war with
MCI WorldCom for Sprint, the third largest U.S. long-distance
carrier while Clear Channel Communications plans to buy AMFM
Inc. for 16.7 billion U.S. dollars in an effort to create a
company dominating the airwaves with 830 radio stations across
the nation.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 8.11 at 600.59 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 3.30 at 789.83. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 3.08 at 426.61.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,729 up, 1,263 down and
523 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 795.93 million shares from 891.87
million in the previous session.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's Defense and
Aviation Minister Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz will pay an
official visit to France and the United States early November.
</P>
<P>
Sultan is expected to hold talks with French President Jacqes
Chirac and U.S. President Bill Clinton on a number of issues of
mutual interest and means to promote bilateral relations in
political, economic and defense fields, Kuwait News Agency quoted
Western diplomatic sources based in Riyadh as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sultan, who is also Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister, will
also meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as well
as his U.S. and French counterparts, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard was reportedly due to
visit Saudi Arabia next Saturday for talks on defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Western sources also expected U.S. Defense Minister
William Cohen will pay a visit to Riyadh prior to Sultan's trip to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and the U.S. strengthened bilateral relations,
especially in the defense field, after the 1991 Gulf war triggered
by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Gulf kingdom is still
harboring bases used by U.S. forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh and Paris also saw a boost in recent years in the
development of their economic ties, as well as defense
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Proves Reliability to Donors: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister Mahesh
Acharya said Tuesday that Nepal proved its reliability to its
donors at the 54th joint annual meeting of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Acharya, who returned here Monday after chairing the joint
meeting in Washington D.C., the United States, told reporters here
that as he represented a country where more than 42 percent of the
people live below the poverty line, he stressed the need for the
World Bank to direct its programs toward poverty alleviation and
the development of poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the meeting appreciated the issues related to
poverty alleviation, debt relief and the development of poor
countries raised on behalf of Nepal at the forum, Acharya said. He
added that U.S. President Bill Clinton had, in his address to the
joint meeting, talked about the global economic crisis and rampant
poverty in the world.
</P>
<P>
Acharya said Clinton announced a debt relief facility for poor
countries in his address.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also observed that the meeting was very fruitful as
Nepal projected its reliability before the donor countries and
agencies, Acharya said.
</P>
<P>
The 54th annual meeting of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund was held from September 26 to 29.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Take Out of Competition Doping Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Soccer's world governing body
FIFA announced on Tuesday that it will start out-of-competition
doping tests in Europe next year.
</P>
<P>
According to FIFA, the tests will begin next spring and the
world's top players will be subject to such testing by a FIFA-
managed team of doping experts.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Sepp Blatter said:"We want to improve our fight
against doping by starting out-of-competition testing. We have to
show we are clean."
</P>
<P>
The doping testing system will start during the preparation
campaigns of the 16 teams which will take part in the 2000
European Championships slated for June 10 to July 2 in Belgium and
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said doping in soccer was not as easy as in many other
sports. There had been only one major drug scandal in soccer when
Diego Maradona of Argentina was kicked out of the 1994 World Cup
for taking a cocktail of illegal substances.

<HEADLINE> China, DPRK Congratulate on Anniversary of Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of China and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Tuesday exchanged
messages of congratulations on the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to top DPRK leaders, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, Chairman of the National People's Congress Li Peng and
Premier Zhu Rongji said that the friendly relations between China
and the DPRK are deeply rooted and that the establishment of
diplomatic ties on October 6, 1949, shortly after the founding of
the People's Republic of China, opened a new historic chapter in
their bilateral relations and a broad prospect for the development
of such relations.
</P>
<P>
"The past 50 years have convincingly proved that developing
friendly relations and cooperation is fully in the fundamental
interests of our two countries and peoples," the Chinese leaders
said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders pledged that China will continue to consolidate and
develop its relations with the DPRK and believed that the Chinese-
Korean friendship will grow further in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a reciprocal message sent to their Chinese counterparts, top
DPRK leaders described the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the two countries as a historic event that has brought the
traditional Korean-Chinese friendship into a new phase of all-
round development.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to mutual support and cooperation, the friendly
relations have been growing in the past 50 years and have
effectively promoted the socialist construction in both countries,
said the DPRK leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the traditional friendly Korean-Chinese
relations of cooperation, under common efforts made by the peoples
of both countries, will inevitably pass on from generation to
generation, and will be further consolidated and will further
develop," the DPRK leaders said in the message.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK message was co-signed by Jim Jong Il, General
Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, Chairman of the National
Defense Commission of the DPRK and Supreme Commander of the Korean
People's Army; Kim Yong Nam, President of the Supreme People's
Assembly of the DPRK; and Hong Song Nam, Premier of the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Rios, Chang Advance in Shanghai Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Marcelo Rios of Chile
almost shed no sweat here on Tuesday when he thrashed Italian
Laurence Tieleman 6-2, 6-1 in the first round of the Shanghai Open
tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Chilean has endured his fair share of injuries
through 1999 and even though he said he was still not fully
confident with himself on court, he maintained that things were
slowly turning the corner. It took him only 47 minutes to finish
the romp.
</P>
<P>
While Rios breezed through his match, defending champion
Michael Chang was made to work for his place in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Chang, once ranked No. 2 in 1997 but now slipping to 61, had to
overcome a case of jitters when he rallied back from two breaks
down in the first set and then required five match points before
defeating Brian MacPhie 7-5, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
Rios started the match positively and put the Italian under
pressure with his first serve. He then broke him to take a 3-1
lead and broke again in the eighth game for the set. The top seed
again broke for 3-1 in the second and once more for 5-1 before
serving out the match.
</P>
<P>
"It is my first easy match for a long time," said Rios. "I
played solid and I served well and hit the ball well from the
baseline, but I don't think I am feeling 100 percent yet. I am
playing better and physically I am better after my (leg) injury."
</P>
<P>
"I played pretty good from the beginning and never gave him a
chance at all," said Rios.
</P>
<P>
Chang admitted that he had to call on quite a few resources to
get through MacPhie who never really let up through the two sets.
</P>
<P>
"Brian played some tough tennis, particularly at the beginning -
I didn't want to get down two breaks so quickly, but it does feel
great to get the first match," said Chang.
</P>
<P>
The sixth seed has won at least one title every year since 1988
and the last event he won was last year's Shanghai Open. He has
won a dozen titles in Asia and said playing here had always made
him feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
"I definitely get great support and I don't have to make any
real adjustments when I play in Asia," he said. "When I come on
court there is a great sense of enthusiasm and I have had some of
my best success in Asia. I hope I can keep my run going and do
well in Shanghai and Singapore and end the year on a positive note.
"
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Swede Magnus Norman was a quick winner - in 55
minutes he defeated Toumas Ketola 6-1, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
But the third seed Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands met his
Waterloo as he lost to Andreas Vinciguerra of Sweden, 6-4, 6-4,
posting the first upset of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Another player working hard to get the confidence levels back
was Todd Woodbridge. The stop-gap of his double partner Mark
Woodforde, who decided to pull out due to an arm injury, lost in
the final round of qualifying.
</P>
<P>
But he took advantage of his good luck and reached the second
round with a 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4) win over the left handed Dane
Kenneth Carlsen.
</P>
<P>
Probably the most ironic part of the situation, however, is the
fact that Woodbridge now has to play Hyung-Taik Lee of South Korea
who beat him in that final round of qualifying. Lee defeated Ramon
Delgado of Paraguay 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 to reach the second round.
</P>
<P>
"It's a funny opportunity and I have never been in a situation
like this before," said Woodbridge. "I didn't play great against
him the first time but I have to go for it. It was a good effort
on his part with the match he played today."

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Sign Agreement on Opening Passage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) signed here Tuesday an agreement on
opening the safe passage linking the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached Monday night and approved later by both
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat,
was inked by PNA Civil Affairs Minister Jamil Tarif and Israeli
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that all Palestinians and foreign
visitors to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank areas will be allowed
to travel between the two Palestinian territories within the
framework of the safe passage.
</P>
<P>
Viewed as a big step forward in the peace process, the opening
of the passage will end the decade-long separations among the
Palestinians in the two territories and is expected to enhance
their social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The safe passage consists of two routes. Individuals will use
the Eretz-Tarkumiyah (near the West Bank city of Hebron) route and
the passage of goods will be through the Karni-Tarkumiyah route.
</P>
<P>
The passage, to be open in the next few days, will operate
between 07:00 and 17:00 local time and will be closed during the
hours that Palestinian laborers leave for work in Israel. Ninety
minutes prior to the closure of the passage, private vehicles,
taxis and buses will be barred from using the routes.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians who want to travel via the passage will apply to
the PNA and once the applications are examined by the PNA, a list
of applicants will be transferred to Israel. Israel will return to
the PNA the approved list within two days.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians who want to use their private vehicles will attach
their driving license, vehicle registration and insurance policy
to their applications. Approved applications will be examined by
Israel and returned to the PNA within five days.
</P>
<P>
The PNA will regulate the traffic of Palestinians to Israeli
crossing in conjunction with Israel so as to prevent traffic
problems along the passage.
</P>
<P>
Those prevented from entering Israel will approach the passage
from the Palestinian regulation station, where they will undergo a
security check and depart for the passage on a bus escorted by
police. At their destination, these passengers will be re-checked.
</P>
<P>
The allotted time for passage is 90 minutes for private
vehicles and two hours for buses. Those whose travel time exceeds
the allotted time will be detained for investigation and, when
necessary, the Israeli police is authorized to take measures
against those in question.
</P>
<P>
All those using the passage route will be subject to the laws
of Israel, and law enforcement will remain at the hands of the
Israeli police.

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Peace Process Under Threat: U.S. Politician </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. senator George
Mitchell warned Tuesday that the Northern Ireland peace process is
fragile and under "great stress."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference of international bankers in the Irish
Republic capital of Dublin, Mitchell said it was no exaggeration
to say there was a real threat of it not proceeding.
</P>
<P>
He said the result of the agreement breaking down completely
would be "entirely unpredictable," the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who is mediating talks in Belfast to try to break a
deadlock between Northern Ireland's main parties, said there was
no alternative to the Good Friday agreement for the Northern Irish
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement represents the best hope in a long time... If it
is not implemented, people there face a highly uncertain future,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there had been any movement in the recent round-
table talks, Mitchell told reporters, "If by movement, you mean
reaching agreement, the answer is no. But there is a clear
understanding of what is necessary."
</P>
<P>
"The parties are still in substantial disagreement," Mitchell
said.
</P>
<P>
Following the conference, Mitchell returned to the Northern
Ireland capital of Belfast to chair a meeting between Ulster
Unionists and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party (
SDLP).
</P>
<P>
After that meeting, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said
that the two parties had a "very useful exchange of views."

<HEADLINE> Canada Warned of Poor Economic Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite growth reported for the
past several months, Canada is still facing a risk of sliding
productivity and declining living standard, a research group said
in a report published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its fourth annual assessment of Canada's social and economic
performance, the Conference Board, a non-profit research group,
said that Canada is a poor economic performer compared with the
United States, Germany, Japan, Australia Sweden and Norway.
</P>
<P>
The trend is "particularly" obvious in areas of the new economy
driven by the computer and communication industries, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Canadian way is at risk. We believe Canadians will have
to change significantly or we will not be able to sustain our high
quality of life in the next century," James Nininger, the board
president, was quoted by the National Post newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board is joining the recent voices of the
Business Council on National Issues, the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce and the Alliance of Manufactures and Exporters in raising
the issue of productivity.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Accepts Cabinet Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Tuesday accepted the resignation of the cabinet submitted by
Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
Under Egypt's constitution, the cabinet must resign to pave the
way for a new cabinet in the wake of a new presidential term in
office.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was sworn in earlier in the day for a fourth six-year
term at an extraordinary session of the parliament, the People's
Assembly, after winning overwhelming "yes" votes in a yes-or-no,
uncontested referendum on September 26.
</P>
<P>
The president may ask El-Ganzouri to form a new government or
appoint a new prime minister. The new cabinet is expected to be
announced and sworn in on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Local media have anticipated a substantial reshuffle of the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Reports of pro-government newspapers, which usually reflects
the thinking of the leadership, have criticized the government for
failing to fulfill what the people had hoped for when it was
formed in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
The influential Al Gomhuria daily indicated that El-Ganzouri is
on his way out.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria, whose editor-in-chief Samir Ragab maintains close
relations with Mubarak, heaped criticism on El-Ganzouri's
inability to implement the economic reforms that began in 1991 and
to achieve the ambitious goals set by the president.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also criticized the government for its increased
arrogance, factionalism and selfishness, which it said has
shattered the people's hopes.

JERUSALEM -- Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
signed here Tuesday an agreement on opening the safe passage
linking the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached Monday night and approved later by both
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat,
was inked by PNA Civil Affairs Minister Jamil Tarif and Israeli
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that all Palestinians and foreign
visitors to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank areas will be allowed
to travel between the two Palestinian territories within the
framework of the safe passage.
</P>
<P>
Viewed as a big step forward in the peace process, the opening
of the passage will end the decade-long separations among the
Palestinians in the two territories and is expected to enhance
their social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The safe passage consists of two routes. Individuals will use
the Eretz-Tarkumiyah (near the West Bank city of Hebron) route and
the passage of goods will be through the Karni-Tarkumiyah route.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Index Falls In August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Index of Leading Economic
Indicators in the United States fell 0.1 percent in August, after
rising in the past three straight months, the Conference Board, a
U.S. prominent research group, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said in a report that with the decrease of
0.1 percent in August, the leading index stands at 107.9. During
the six-month span through August, the leading index rose 0.7
percent, and eight of the 10 components advanced, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said this strong performance during the summer
suggests that the economic expansion has enough strength to become
the longest on record in February 2000.
</P>
<P>
The report said five of the 10 indicators that make up the
leading index rose in August. The most significant positive
contributor to the composite leading index in that month is
average weekly claims for unemployment insurance and money supply.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the decrease to the two successive rises
in interest rates. The rises have now started to show some impact
such as a dip in housing starts, a slight drop in average workweek
and a narrowing in the interest rates spread, it added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Criticizes U.S. for Anti-Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday sharply
criticized the United States for its recent anti-missile test
against an unarmed Minuteman strategic ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
This test, carried out in the framework of a program for
creating a national anti-missile defense system, "violates the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty," Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Article 1 of the treaty "bans the very creation of the
foundation for such a defense system," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that such moves would lead to violations of
the key provisions of the ABM Treaty "with all the ensuing
negative consequences, the responsibility for which will lie with
Washington," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Russia's Supreme Commander of the Strategic
Missile Forces, Colonel General Vladimir Yakovlev, warned that
possible U.S. withdrawal from the ABM could "bring down the entire
system of strategic stability in the world."
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. kills the 1972 ABM Treaty, it will, in fact, be
the villain in the disruption of the nuclear arms limitation
process and endanger all the signed treaties and those being
prepared."
</P>
<P>
As a result of such a step by Washington, Yakovlev said, "
Russia and the U.S. will become unpredictable to each other."
</P>
<P>
"We will fully abandon all inspection measures and will bar
anyone from our arms," he said. "Russia will not know what is
going on in the U.S. The Americans will be in the dark on what is
going on in Russia," he said in an interview published Tuesday by
the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said that "in purely military terms," Russia would take "
countermeasures."
</P>
<P>
"Two dozen measures are under consideration, which Russia can
put into practice without significantly increasing expenditures,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I will name just a few of them. Combat rail complexes may
start patrolling combat tracks. The Topol missile complex has a
number of possibilities currently limited by understandings linked
with START-1. We can abandon these limitations and thereby
basically change Topol both in the sphere of ABM penetration and
in its missiles combat possibilities. There also are asymmetric
measures," the commander said.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM: One-Third of Chechnya Under Federal Troops' Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops are in
control of nearly 30 populated areas on approximately one-third of
the territory of the breakaway republic of Chechnya, Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Four servicemen were killed and 22 wounded in the fighting but
the "federal troops are well-positioned from the military point of
view," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The operation is not over yet. We have only gone through one
of its stages. The ultimate goal is to eliminate the terrorists
and their bases in Chechnya completely," the Interfax news agency
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The government does not plan to use force in tackling
political problems, including Chechnya's status," he said, "This
will be done through political negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Putin said that local governments and interior agencies will
be restored in the Chechen districts controlled by the federal
forces and that schools and hospitals will also be restored and "
wages will be paid there."
</P>
<P>
"We will put the main emphasis on working together with the
local population. We have established good working contacts.
People are tired of the bandits and do not want to let them into
their villages," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also reiterated the government's pledge to
help refugees fleeing Chechnya, who are reportedly flowing in the
tens of thousands into neighboring Russian regions.
</P>
<P>
In the tiny republic of Ingushetia, the number of Chechen
refugees has risen to 105,271 by Tuesday morning. Together with
refugees who arrived earlier in the republic from the Ossetian-
Ingush conflict zone and the Chechens who left their homes during
the last war in 1994-1996, the total number of refugees stood at
122,482.
</P>
<P>
Ingush President Ruslan Aushev said only about 8,000 of the
refugees have been provided with temporary housing in tents and
trailers, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are badly in need of tents, trailers or other temporary
housing for these people. Some of them are staying with local
residents," Aushev said.
</P>
<P>
"The refugees are receiving free bread. But Ingushetia lacks
other food, baby food, blankets and warm clothes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aushev said Ingushetia has restricted movement of people
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. in an attempt to strengthen security.
"This is not a curfew. Nevertheless traffic is prohibited at that
time," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president has also banned the sale of alcohol throughout
the republic to maintain law and order in anticipation of more
refugees as federal troops move deeper into Chechnya, Interfax
reported.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Website to Boost Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Bureau of Foreign
Employment on Tuesday launched a website in a bid to become the
main supplier of foreign labor in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to host the website with a view to becoming more
competitive and to procuring more jobs for our youth in
particular," said Jayantha Liyanage, the bureau's chairman.
</P>
<P>
He said the bureau, the sole authority in charge of foreign
employment in the country, will be able to get more foreign job
opportunities for Sri Lankan job seekers by minimizing
shortcomings and delays in communication.
</P>
<P>
The website, www.slbfe.lk, aims to make Sri Lankans and
foreigners aware of the foreign employment industry and manpower
available and to make use of modern technology to obtain more jobs
to ease unemployment.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.2 million Sri Lankans working abroad, 80
percent of them female as housemaids.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the scope of the foreign employment industry
will be widened as jobs available on the Internet are mostly for
non-domestic sectors.

Shabelle, Bay and Bakol as well as the border region of Gedo have
received food, clothes and seeds.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross halted its aid to the African Horne country
since May last year when ten of its staff members were abducted in
north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to reports received through the VHF field radios, the
ICRC has provided 950 tons of beans, maize and seeds as well as
8,000 blankets, 8, 000 plastic sheets and 8,000 miscellaneous
household utensils.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the ICRC is also providing aid to the
Middel Jubba and Hiran regions to relieve the rampant droughts and
diseases there.
</P>
<P>
The international organization is also undergoing projects in
rehabilitating water wells and medicine supply for the
conflict-torn southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. World Food Program also started its food
distribution in the border region of Gedo.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the aid distributions are
going smoothly and without incidents with the help of local
authorities and traditional elders.
</P>
<P>
The aid has come in the most crucial moment, though is the
food and clothes could hardly satisfy less than 15 % of the needs.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities said the operation has still a long way
to go before reaching the majority of the local destitute families
displaced by the local conflicts and droughts.
</P>
<P>
In the central regions, where the grip of the droughts,
diseases and lack of water are still claiming lives, no assistance
has been arrived yet.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- China plans to promote high-
tech product exports to improve its export structure and stimulate
foreign trade, said Shi Guangsheng, minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, in Shenzhen, in south China, today.
</P>
<P>
Shi told a national conference that several ministries have
jointly worked out a plan to support 166 high-tech enterprises in
China's 55 new-and high-tech industrial development zones in the
fields of information science, medicines, new materials, and
electric appliances.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that foreign trade enterprises should provide
information on international markets for companies and research
departments and make the best of e-commerce and said that
encouraging high-tech product exports is an important way to
decrease risk in China's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
China's high-tech exports were worth 11.28 billion U.S. dollars
in 1998, up 18 percent on an annual basis, but the country's
exports increased a mere 0.5 percent. High-tech exports were still
doing well in the first seven months of this year.

NEW DELHI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday decided not to
respond to the U.N. secretary-general's intimation for
participation in a special conference on facilitating entry into
force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
An External Affairs Ministry spokesman said, "Given India's

of CTBT will be a priority for the new government, the decision
(not to attend) is both logical and consistent."

<P>
The conference will begin in Vienna on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As on September 23 this year, 154 states had signed the CTBT,
45 of which have ratified it. CTBT will enter into force when it

<HEADLINE> Israel Strikes Hezbollah Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Jet fighters and helicopter
gunships of the Israeli Air Force launched air raids against
Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon Tuesday morning, the Israeli
army said.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes were centered on the Hezbollah targets in
areas north of the security zone and all Israeli planes returned
to their bases safely, the army added.
</P>
<P>
The army did not mention whether the air strikes have caused
damage or casualties on the Hezbollah side. But this was the first
time in recent weeks for the Israeli helicopter gunships to join
air operations against Hezbollah targets in the security zone.
</P>
<P>
The strikes were launched after Hezbollah, or Party of God,
shelled several positions of the South Lebanese Army (SLA) inside
the security zone during which at least five SLA soldiers were
wounded, said the army.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been intensified during the last two months in
the security zone between Hezbollah and the SLA. In September,
seven SLA members, including an intelligence chief of the central
sector of the security zone, were killed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the military escalation in the security zone, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak promised to pull out the Israeli troops
from the security zone next July.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli troops
out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Recovering From Heart Surgery in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa is recovering Tuesday from a successful emergency heart
surgery he underwent in Beirut's American University Hospital
(AUH), Lebanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
"The minister's health is in a stable condition, but he still
needs to stay in the intensive-care unit for observation for two
or three days," Lebanese Health Minister Karam Karam said at AUH.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa, 59, was suffering from aortic dissection. He was
first admitted to a private hospital in Damascus on Sunday
evening with chest pains during a reception for Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
After he was diagnosed, he decided to take an operation in the
famous AUH.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a team of seven doctors, including Karam, also a
doctor, conducted the surgery which was announced to be very
successful.
</P>
<P>
The AUH's 10th floor where Sharaa's room is located has been
flooded by Lebanese well-wishers, including Prime Minister Salim
Hoss and a long line of ministers and parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is stationing a 350,000-strong force in Lebanon,
is a undisputed power broker in the country.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa, who has been Syrian Foreign Minister since 1984, has
been a key figure in shaping Syria's foregin policy under
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
His sudden illness sparked widespread concerns for the current
peace process, which is expected to be revived after Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak came to power in July.
</P>
<P>
The United States was among the first to wish Sharaa a speedy
recovery, wary that the Syrian minister is an integral cog in
restarting peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We do wish him a successful treatment and a speedy
recovery,"said U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Later, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called Karam to
get a personal update on Sharaa's condition.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Promises to Strive for Better Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
pledged on Tuesday to spare no efforts in working for a better
future for the country and its people.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the promise during a speech after he was sworn in
for a fourth consecutive six-year term at an extraordinary session
of the parliament, the People's Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"I thank everybody who voted for me in the hope for a better
future and I promise to do my utmost with you to realize our great
hopes and national ambitious goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that he will be a "president of all Egyptians" and
safeguard the interests of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was re-elected in the September 26 referendum by
winning about 94 percent "yes" votes after staying in office for
18 years.
</P>
<P>
He was first elected president in 1981 after former president
Anwar Sadat was assassinated by Islamic radicals. He was
re-elected in 1987 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, Mubarak expressed hope and confidence
that he will get help, counsel and advice from the people, saying
that under the umbrella of Egyptian nationalism, "there is no
difference between supporters and opposers" of him, as all are
Egyptian nationals.
</P>
<P>
Even if views differ on ways of realizing national interests,
it is the democratic choice that must be respected and deepened,
the president said.
</P>
<P>
The nation has gone through difficult times, but has managed,
with genuine determination and joint efforts, to escape the
bottleneck for better conditions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is witnessing a surging economy, which enables the
country to realize comprehensive development for all segments of
the society and steer the capabilities and qualities to new
levels, Mubarak stressed.
</P>
<P>
During the past 18 years, Mubarak has managed to improve the
economic landscape of Egypt by carrying out a privatization
program, which has helped the country maintain one of the best
economic performances in the Middle East. He is appreciated for
his role as guardian of stability and architect of economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
In the international community, he has also made a fame of a
key peace mediator by helping push forward the peace process
between Arab countries and Israel.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Russian air force's search-
and-rescue service has located the pilot of the plane that crashed
in Chechnya on Monday and taken him to an area controlled by
federal troops, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which fell into a field near the village of Tolstoi-
Yurt, did not explode and is lying rightside up, Interfax said,
quoting Khumid Dalayev, department chief of the Chechen Border and
Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
The Russian air force has acknowledged earlier Tuesday that
two federal warplanes had failed to return to their bases in the
previous two days following missions over the breakaway republic
of Chechnya, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Radar control lost trace of a Su-25 fighter plane during an
air surveillance mission at 09:46 Moscow time (05:46 GMT) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A second plane, a Su-24, again lost contact while on a search
and rescue mission for the first missing aircraft on Monday, Tass
said, quoting the press service of the Russian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
One of the planes was believed to have been shot down by a "
Stinger" missile.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federal Security Service, the main successor to
the Soviet KGB, said Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev may have
purchased the U.S.-made shoulder-fired "Stinger" anti-aircraft
missiles from Taliban movement in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We have information that Basayev sent emissaries to
Afghanistan to negotiate the purchase of arms and ammunition for
his units in August," Interfax quoted an FSB source as saying
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A large consignment of Stingers at 80,000 U.S dollars apiece
was discussed, among other things. However, the matter was not
settled and Taliban provided Basayev's emissaries with four
Stingers for testing as "sponsor support," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Stingers are believed to have been illegally transported
across the southern boundaries of Russia, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Seeks Investment in Power Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has urged foreign
 companies to invest in the country's vast energy market.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Energy and Minerals Manju Msambya told the
East African Power Industry Convention here Monday that Tanzania
has harnessed only 10 percent of an estimated hydroelectric power
potential of 4,780 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Gas fields on the Songo Songo island have proven recoverable
reserves of about one trillion cubic feet while Mnazi bay in the
Mtwara Region in the south has similar quantities of gas.
</P>
<P>
In order to exploit coal resources of about one billion tons
lying in southern regions, the government plans to build a 200 mw
power plant near the Mchuchuma coal mine, Msambya said.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports Tuesday, the deputy minister said
so far only 10 percent of more than 30 million people in the
country have access to electricity.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is committed to undertaking reforms in the power
sector and encourages private sector role in development and
operation of the power industry. Potential investors should take
advantage of the reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government plans to provide electricity to 40
percent of the population by the year 2015 under a new power
industry structure mainly managed by the private sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said the present vertically integrated
utility will be divided into generation, transmission and
distribution segments.
</P>
<P>
At present, the state-owned Tanzania Electric Supply Company
(TANESCO) produces about 98 percent of the 600 megawatts generated
in the country while the remaining two per cent are produced by
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Outlining investment potentials, Msambya said power demand was
expected to grow at an annual rate of eight percent up to the year
2015.
</P>
<P>
The forum attracted over 200 delegates from Australia, Canada,
Germany, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, Britain, the United
States, Zimbabwe and the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Pledges not to Yield to IMF Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad pledged that his country would not yield to the demand of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and accused foreign powers
for seeking monopoly in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the third Southern African International Dialogue
(SAID) held in Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls on Tuesday, Mahathir said
his country has adopted affirmative actions to prevent foreigners
from obtaining privatized projects, Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said these actions have aroused worries of
the big powers because most of the highly profitable privatised
projects went to the indigenous entrepreneurs in which they are
interested.
</P>
<P>
The big powers often labelled those indigenous companies as
cronies of the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said,"we are not about to give up formula
simply because the IMF and the western media think we should do
so. Our growth had not been stunted because of the political and
social agenda intricately bound with our economic agenda," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Asks Thailand to Control Refugee Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Tuesday demanded that the
Thai government strictly control refugee camps on the Thai side of
 the two countries' border.
</P>
<P>
The demand was made by Colonel Thein Swe, head of the
Department of Office of Strategic Studies of the Myanmar Defense
Ministry at a press conference here Tuesday afternoon following
the peaceful end of the siege of the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok by
Myanmar armed men last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said there are 24 refugee camps along the Myanmar-Thai
border where members and their families of different anti-Myanmar
government armed groups such as the All Burma Students' Democratic
Front (ABSDF), Kayin National Union (KNU) and Democratic Alliance
of Burma (DAB) are living and conducting military and "terrorist"
training there involving foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the seizure of the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok and the
taking of hostages by Myanmar armed men, he stressed that the
receiving country should take up the responsibility for the
security of an embassy stationed there.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that five armed men -- three from the ABSDF, one
from the KNU and the remaining one from the God's Children Army
-- were involved in the incident last Friday.
</P>
<P>
He added that the armed men demanded that the Myanmar
government release all political prisoners, recognize the results
of the 1990 general election and reshuffle the government.
</P>
<P>
After a 25-hour tense standoff, the five Myanmar armed men
Saturday ended their siege of the Myanmar Embassy and freed all
the 38 hostages before they were flown to the Myanmar border in
Ratchaburi in the company of Thai Deputy Foreign Minister
Sukhumbhand Paribatra.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Plans to Use Valucard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)
has set a 10-year target to reduce cash in circulation in the
country by 40 percent through introduction of an electronic purse
of Valucard.
</P>
<P>
Valucard serves as alternative payment instrument and seeks to
replace cash and coins for everyday transactions to the largest
possible extent, The Guardian Tuesday quoted Managing Director of
Smart Card Nigeria John Patrick Merino as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Merino, the introduction of Valucard into the
financial market in the most populous African country has been
designed for implementation under three phases: live test
operation, pilot test and nationwide introduction.
</P>
<P>
The first phase was a presentation made to the participating
banks in June this year by the company's management; the second
phase called the pilot test began about seven weeks ago with 25
banks participating in the pilot scheme.
</P>
<P>
The last phase is the nationwide introduction which is expected
to start early next year.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the CBN indicated that currency in
circulation at the end of December last year stood at 172.379
billion Naira (about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Merino said that the CBN had explained "holding of Naira notes
and coins had become rather burdensome as average daily
transactions took too much volume of Naira to handle".
</P>
<P>
Aside from reducing cash handling, he noted, Valucard provides
sufficient security, reduces the risk of fraud and theft, makes
better record of transaction and accountability.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More Attention to Root Causes of Refugee Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- China Tuesday called on the
international community to pay attention to the root causes of the
refugee problem while strengthening refugee protection.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Chinese delegation, Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai, made
the remarks here at the 50th session of the Executive Committee of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
"It should be particularly pointed out that, a few months ago,
NATO bypassed the United Nations and conducted air bombardment
over the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a sovereign state, for
over two successive months, which resulted in not only grave
losses of property and civilian lives, but also a heavy exodus of
refugees, making the situation in the Balkan region even more
complicated," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only when countries stick to the principles like equality in
sovereignty, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial
integrity of states, non-interference in each other's internal
affairs, peaceful means to settle international disputes among
states and other basic principles of international law, can they
reduce and eliminate the tension and conflicts among countries,
and thereby create favorable conditions to reduce the world
refugee population," Qiao pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also called on the international
community to uphold and implement the principle of "international
solidarity and burden sharing," adding that countries of origin,
asylum countries, resettlement countries and donor countries
should set up the cooperative partnership of mutual trust and
mutual understanding based on that principle.
</P>
<P>
Reminding the meeting of the fact that it has cost the
developing countries heavily to host and protect the majority of
refugees for many years, Qiao said that the developed countries
should provide assistance actively, avoid the adoption of highly
restrictive asylum policies and shoulder their responsibilities to
accept more refugees for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
"As a country of asylum, China fulfills its international
obligation and has provided effective protection for 280,000 Indo-
Chinese refugees over the past 20 years with its limited resources,
" Qiao told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
China has friendly and fruitful cooperation with the UNHCR for
a long time, he said. The Chinese government would like to further
strengthen the cooperation with the UNHCR and other countries and
make its own contributions to solving refugee issues.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee of Geneva-based UNHCR began its current
session on Monday. The meeting on "Strengthening Partnership to
Ensure Protection and Security" will end on October 8.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Tourist Arrivals Up 11.6 PCT in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's international tourist
arrivals in the first seven months of 1999 rose 11.67 percent over
the same period last year to 4.94 million, a press release from
Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from East Asian countries were 19 percent higher than
for the same period last year at 2.87 million while the number of
European arrivals was at 1.2 million, the same as a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Japan is still the largest source for Thai tourism industry,
with 596,066 Japanese tourists visiting Thailand from January to
July this year, an increase of 10.34 percent over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by Malaysia with 572,280 arrivals, up 4.25
percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand saw a sharp increase of Chinese visitors, standing at
502,255 in the first seven months of this year, up 48.8 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, visitors from the United States rose 12.2 percent to
264,132.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of many East Asian economies is believed to be the
reason for the surge of tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
The TAT projected 8.28 million tourist arrivals for the whole
of 1999 and more than 300 billion baht (7.5 billion U.S. dollars)
in foreign exchange earning.

<HEADLINE> Debate on Zambian President's Term Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The debate continues over if
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba should run for a third term in
2001 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Some activists of the ruling Movement for Multi-Democracy (MMD)
in the north of the country Monday urged Chiluba to ignore demand
he run for the third term, according to Times of Zambia Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted former Nkana constituency youth chairman
Leonard Mwanang'ombe as saying in Kitwe that Chiluba should set a
precedent of respecting the constitution for democracy to thrive.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will be retrogressive to follow the demand as
the opposition will take advantage of it and criticize the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
"Let us not be like UNIP ( the opposition United National
Independence Party led by former President Kenneth Kaunda) which
changed the constitution to suit individuals, President Chiluba
has already done a lot for the country and MMD," said
Mwanang'ombe.
</P>
<P>
There are lot of capable leaders in MMD who would take over
from Chiluba and these will obviously pursue MMD policies, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition United Party for National Development
(UPND) warned MMD of the consequences of amending the constitution
to suit one individual's interest, The Post newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba repeatedly stated that he would not run for a third
term.
</P>
<P>
Recently some MMD officials, especially youth wing, urged
Chiluba to run for a third term and called for a constitutional
amendment to allow him to do so.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional amendments adopted in 1996 do not allow
those with foreign parentage and those who have already served two
five-year terms of the presidency to stand for elections any more.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 elections Kaunda was barred from contesting because
he was born of Malawian parents and ruled the country for 27 years
since Zambia's independence in 1964 until 1991, when he was
defeated by Chiluba.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Uzbekistan Tuesday
issued a 12-point joint statement on cooperative partnership
oriented toward the 21st century after a summit here.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and his
Uzbek counterpart Islam Karimov agreed to take measures to further
enhance bilateral relations in political, economic, cultural and
other respects.
</P>
<P>
Karimov expressed his support for Seoul's engagement policy
toward Pyongyang to demolish legacy of the Cold War on the Korean
peninsula while Kim promised to help Uzbekistan modernize its
textile industry and provide 36 million U.S. dollars for the
central Asian nation's education.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to push for early conclusion of
treaties on criminal extradition and judicial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Uzbek president's visit will help increase mutual
complementary economic cooperation between the two nations, with
South Korea providing capital and technology and Uzbekistan
natural resources and labor, said a South Korean official.
</P>
<P>
During his third trip in South Korea, Karimov, who arrived here
Monday for a three-day visit, is expected to meet other South
Korean political and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
The two states established diplomatic ties in 1992 and since
then they have maintained good relations, particularly in the
economic field.
</P>
<P>
Currently, South Korea is Uzbekistan's second largest trading
partner and the largest foreign investor.
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade volume between the two countries hit 520
million U.S. dollars and South Korea invested a total of 910
million U.S. dollars as of 1998, mainly in auto and textile
industries in the central Asian country, which has some 240, 000
ethnic Koreans, most of who are descendants of Koreans relocated
from the Far East in 1937.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Urges Kenya to Adopt Sex Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has urged Kenya's Education Ministry to include sex
education in the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF country representative Chrispin Wilson said Monday
that it was essential to provide information about HIV/AIDS to the
youth in order to curb the spread of the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
"Using schools as the means to reach children aged between five
and 14 to induce behaviour change through HIV/AIDS education are
some of the best methods to try to stop the spread of the virus,"
said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
Kenya will have about 850,000 AIDS orphans by the year 2000,
according to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
The newly infected were young people in Kenya, where the HIV
infection rate has reached 13 to 14 percent, said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
He observed that the age group most at risk was between 15 and
24 and girls aged between 15 and 19 were at a much higher risk of
contracting the virus than boys.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Catholic church leaders and some politicians are
strongly against adolescent sex education citing it would mislead
young people.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Increase Bank Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is going to beef up the capital reserves
of the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) Bank to 5.4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is aimed at transforming the regional financial institution
into a major player in the economies of the member states.
</P>
<P>
Acting COMESA Secretary General Sindiso Ngwenya told Zambian
newspaper Financial Mail Tuesday that the bank would always
endeavor to serve the interests of all member states so that they
could develop at a pace appreciated by all.
</P>
<P>
"Don't look at COMESA as a single sector driven grouping. The
entire institution has several establishments which are all
working towards the development of the region. One such cardinal
institution is the PTA Bank whose main objective is to promote and
provide project financing and trade financing."
</P>
<P>
However, he did not specify when the bank capital expansion
from 540 million U.S. dollars to 5.4 billion U.S. dollars would be
done.
</P>
<P>
On the fears expressed by some member states that they were
likely to be adversely affected by zero rating on trade tariffs,
Ngwenya said COMESA would come up with a comprehensive solution.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the attainment of the Free Trade Area (FTA)
on October 31 of 2000 would greatly benefit COMESA member states.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Buy Grain for Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
allocated two billion shillings (26.6 million U.S. dollars) to
purchase maize and other cereals this year for strategic reserve.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper said Tuesday that the National
Cereals and Produce Board would also purchase wheat and beans from
the farmers.
</P>
<P>
The board had already bought 5,000 bags of beans (90 kgs per
bag) from the North Rift in western Kenya and plans to purchase
nearly one million bags of maize and half a million bags of wheat
from farmers this year.
</P>
<P>
Justice Kemei, public relations manager of the board, said that
Kenya needs nearly three million bags of the grain for strategic
reserves, and there are only 280,000 bags left over from 2.3
million bags bought by the board last season.
</P>
<P>
Kemei noted that his board has commercialized its activities
since 1996 and only carried out functions such as maintenance of
strategic food reserve, famine relief distribution and market
intervention when directed by the state or after receiving
funding.
</P>
<P>
A shortage of two million bags of maize is expected in the
country this year following the worm invasion and drought.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urged to Use Gas Resources in Bigger Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday urged the
ASEAN Council on Petroleum (Ascope) to consider setting up an
ASEAN Gas Center and build up the expertise in the pipeline
business existing in the region.
</P>
<P>
The future challenge for Ascope would be to look into the
viability of using natural gas resources in a bigger way
particularly in view of the stiffer environmental targets to
undermine long-term growth in oil demand and the favoring of
demand for cleaner fuel, Malaysian Energy, Communications and
Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie said.
</P>
<P>
"With substantial natural gas resources available and the need
for governments to comply with pressing international
requirements on environment, the implementation of the Trans-ASEAN
Gas Pipeline and Power Grid may well become an urgent
infrastructure necessity for ASEAN countries," he said at the
opening of an Ascope forum on Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline and Power
Grid here.
</P>
<P>
The three-day forum with the theme "Ensuring Greater Energy
Security for ASEAN into the Next Millennium" is to chart the
roadmap for ASEAN's energy sector in the new millennium. And the
Ascope has set a target of transforming the Trans-ASEAN Gas
Pipeline and Power Grid into a reality by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that ASEAN countries should be united in
their commitment to create a stable and prosperous future as the
economies were moving towards greater independence.
</P>
<P>
Gas producing countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and
Thailand have already established and developed their gas pipeline
networks and it was logical to link the existing infrastructure to
create a regional network, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that on the demand side, member countries have to
encourage the wider use of gas in the various economic sectors so
that there is sufficient demand for the viable supply of natural
gas via pipelines.
</P>
<P>
A concerted effort has to be made by all member countries to
strike a comprehensive mix where economies of scale together with
competitive cost levels will be vital to ensuring the successful
implementation of the proposed Grid, he said.

<HEADLINE> Refugees Caused by Conflicts: Kenyan Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A large number of refugees in
Africa result from numerous conflicts and civil strifes that have
rocked the continent throughout the post-colonial era, said
Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of a two-week workshop on conflict
prevention, management and resolution in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi Monday, Godana said there were over 6.5 million refugees
in Africa out of the estimated 21. 1million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that during the past three decades, there
have been nearly 30 cases of civil strifes in Sub-Sahara Africa
and last year alone, at least 11 major conflicts were recorded in
the continent.
</P>
<P>
Local media Tuesday quoted the minister as saying the high rate
of conflicts in Africa has been partly caused by poor governance,
lack of sound economic management and security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Godana pointed out that the proliferation of conflicts has had
a negative impact on the continent's development capacity and
undermined the efforts to improve the living conditions of the
people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that African states had made sustained efforts in the
search for peaceful solution to the conflicts, such as the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The minister identified economic development through
cooperation and integration, and collective security based on
unity and solidarity as two key issues needed to be addressed.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rejects Italy's Asylum Offer to PKK Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government has ridiculed
an Italian offer to grant political asylum to now imprisoned
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Cumhuriyet (Republic) Tuesday quoted Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit as saying that "I do not know what will this action
(of Italy) mean in practice. Because Ocalan is in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Second Appeals Court of Rome decided to grant
political asylum to Ocalan, who was sentenced to death in Turkey
on June 29 for his separatist struggle in which over 37,000 people
were killed.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels have been fighting a guerrilla war since 1984
for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Luigi Saracenli, one of the attorneys of Ocalan, said the
outlawed PKK leader was granted political asylum by the Rome court
under the 10th article of the Italian Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish commandos in Kenyan capital
Nairobi in mid-January after being denied shelter by a number of
countries, including Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish rebel leader had been arrested by Italy authorities
upon his arrival in Rome on a flight from Moscow on November 12
last year, under international arrest warrants issued by Germany
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Italy refused to turn over Ocalan to Turkey on account of
Italian law which forbids extradition to countries where the death
penalty is in force, and allowed him to depart from Rome to Russia
on January 16.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Italy and Turkey rifted after the Italian
rejection of Turkey's extradition request.

<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's former Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine
told opposition Conservative leader William Hague Monday night
that hard-liners were pushing him towards the "incalculable folly"
of withdrawal from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Hague Monday came close to declaring permanent opposition to
European monetary union with a policy statement that euro-zone
interest rates would probably never be right for the UK.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The race for Labor's nomination for mayor of London was
thrown into confusion Monday when it was confirmed that Frank
Dobson, the health secretary, would stand for the post.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>

election after opposition Conservative leader William Hague

<P>
The Guardian:

<P>
-- Britain's most powerful pensions body called on the
government to raise the state pension age from 65 to 70. The
National Association of Pension Funds said increased longevity
meant that the way pensions are paid for was not sustainable in

PARIS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French National Assembly will start on Tuesday the
debate on the second law on 35 hour work week, which will oblige
all French enterprises to adopt the new system. About 25,000
employers demonstrated on Monday in Paris against the law, while
the national union Confederation Generale du Travail staged a
counter-demonstration in support of the law.
</P>
<P>
-- Austria has from now on accepted the extreme-right Freedom
Party led by Joerg Haider as a "normal party" after it became the
second largest party of the country by winning 27.2 percent of the
votes in the legislative elections on Sunday. Israel has called on
10,000 Austrian Jews to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- From 25,000 to 30,000 French employers gathered on Monday at
the Porte de Versailles in Paris in a defiance of the government
which is launching the parliament debate on the second 35-hour
work week law, which the employers said is against them. Meanwhile,
thousands of union militants demonstrated in Paris and other
cities asking the government "to improve the law to make it real
creator of jobs."
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac started his visit to Spain
on Monday, the first by a French head of state since 1913. In an
interview with Le Figaro, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
said that he is continuing to do everything to bring about a "
lasting and irreversible peace" with the Basque separatist group
ETA. He also said that the Franco-Spanish cooperation in fighting
terrorists is "fully satisfying".

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Corruption is a major obstacle
to Lebanon's economic recovery, the Daily Star Tuesday quoted a
survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Lebanese Center for Policy
Studies on 250 companies, showed that 85 percent of the firms
blamed corruption for hampering their business and 62 percent
admitted having paid bribes to facilitate certain transactions.
</P>
<P>
This figure nearly doubled the average percentage in similar
surveys on other Middle East countries, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent firms surveyed know in advance the amount of
bribe they will have to pay to complete a transaction where
contact with civil servants is involved and believe that once the
bribe was paid, the delivery of service was secured.
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than half of the companies surveyed said they
gave up making significant additional investments because of
problems related to compliance with government regulations.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six percent of the respondents said that they had to
spend at least 15 percent of their working time on negotiations
with government officials in order to get results.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the firms surveyed said they would not use the
courts to settle disputes because of the drawn-out procedures.
</P>
<P>
There are also concerns about a lack of clearly defined
government policies toward the sectors of industry, tourism,
agriculture and to a lesser extent banking.

world's No. 5 automaker, said Monday that it was giving consumers
extra incentives to buy several 1999 and 2000 model-year cars and
light trucks.
</P>
<P>
For the 2000 model year, the German-U.S. automaker has added a
1,000 dollar rebate on the Chrysler Concorde mid-sized sedan and
Dodge Ram conversion van, and a 750 dollar rebate on the Ram cargo
van and Ram wagon, according to a report from the company.
</P>
<P>
It increased rebates on Dodge Stratus, Plymouth Breeze and
Chrysler Cirrus small cars by 250 to 1,250 dollars each. It is
giving 250 dollars more in rebates on all short-wheel-base
minivans for a total of 750 dollars. An extra 250 dollars in
rebates on long-wheel-base minivans brings the total on those
vehicles to 1,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In model year 1999, DaimlerChrysler boosted by 500 dollars on
select models of the Ram conversion van (to 2,500 dollars) Dakota
with 4-cylinder engine (to 1,500 dollars), and Ram cargo van and
wagon (to 1,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
With extra incentives to consumers, such as rebates and low
interest rates, DaimlerChrysler said Friday its sales in September
rose 7.3 percent to 208,544 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
However, Fahnestock &AMP; Co. analyst Richard Hilgert said the
generous consumer incentives may cost automakers later.
</P>
<P>
"We are probably pulling a little volume out of 2000," he said.

<HEADLINE> 67 Killed in Heavy Fighting in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing heavy fighting in the
southern Philippines between government forces and the rebel Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) guerrillas has claimed the lives
of 67 rebels since October 2, a military report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report received by Armed Forces chief of staff General
Angelo Reyes said the fighting centers in towns of Shariff Aguak
and Datu Pianga in Maguindanao province where MILF rebels have
attacked Army detachments since last week.
</P>
<P>
The MILF also occupied Hill 150 located at the border of Datu
Piang and Shariff Aguak which the military considers a strategic
area because it overlooks Camp Omar, a major guerrilla base in
Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
The report said 16 Army troopers were wounded in the first four
days of fighting, but the number could rise as the fighting
continued to rage without letup.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the intense fighting broke out on
October 2 when an undetermined number of MILF guerrillas fired at
soldiers in the said area and the soldiers fought back
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The MILF declared Tuesday that it will withdraw from the peace
talks with the government scheduled to open on October 25, but the
government insists the counter-offensive will not stop until Hill
150 is retaken or abandoned by the MILF.

<HEADLINE> COMESA, SADC Merger Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has rejected suggestions that it merges
with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) since the
two regional groups are duplicating each other's work, a Zambian
newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jochem Krebs, head of the European Union (EU) delegation in
Zambia, said recently that EU would have preferred that the two
institutions merged.
</P>
<P>
Justice Jasaphat Kanywanyi, president of the COMESA Court, said
in an interview with Financial Mail that there was no conflicts
between the two organizations' activities.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the all for COMESA and SADC to unify cannot be
accommodated as the two are different organizations and they do
not duplicate each others' work," Kanywanyi said.
</P>
<P>
He said COMESA and SADC were very important organizations which
should not be interrupted in their efforts to bring development
and peace to Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"I can just say the two organizations should try to reconcile
their difference if there are any and harmonize ways of
interaction," Kanywanyi said.
</P>
<P>
Both SADC and COMESA are working towards achieving a Free Trade
Area although they have set different dates for attaining it.
</P>
<P>
Some observers have questioned the relevance of having the two
separately instead of merging.
</P>
<P>
Kanywanyi however, advised the two secretariats to work on a
formula which would enable them to avoid the alleged duplication
of their roles from becoming reality.

<HEADLINE> 16 Jordanian Women Die in Honor Killings in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Three Jordanian women died in the
latest incidents of alleged honor killings in the past week,
bringing the total of women killed for the same reason to 16 this
year, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A 34-year-old married woman died Monday after she was shot
three times in the head by her brother, who killed the Muslim
sister only because she was married to a Christian and she had a
"poor reputation", the Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
In the second honor-related crime, a 12-year-old girl from the
northern Irbid district died of internal bleeding after her
54-year-old father and 13-year-old brother tied her up and beat
her with chains and sticks for "she often goes out and walk in the
street".
</P>
<P>
In the Wadi Seer area of Amman, a 26-year-old man shot dead
his sister for she was nine-month pregnant out of the wedlock.
</P>
<P>
The latest incidents brought the total of women killed for
honor-related crimes to 16 so far this year as against 22 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The alleged honor killers often benefit from Article 340 in
the penal code which either pardons or hands down lenient prison
terms ranging from two months to two years for men who killed
their wives or female relatives for illicit relationship with men
out of the wedlock.
</P>
<P>
Human rights and pressure groups have long campaigned to
abolish Article 340 to stem the crime killings in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh
has agreed to lift the article and is expected to propose the
amendment to the lower house of parliament for approval during
its next ordinary session in November.

<HEADLINE> EDS-With More Details Obuchi Reshuffles Cabinet, Launches Tripartite Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi reshuffled his cabinet Tuesday and launched a new
tripartite coalition government comprising his Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP), the Liberal Party (LP) and the New Komeito party.
</P>
<P>
It is Obuchi's second cabinet reshuffle since he took office in
July 1998, following the formation of the LDP-LP coalition
government in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet reshuffle is aimed at bringing the New Komeito,
Japan's second largest opposition party, into the current
coalition between the LDP and the LP.
</P>
<P>
The three-party coalition would give the ruling bloc 357 seats
in the 500-seat House of Representatives (lower house), and also a
majority in the House of Councilors (upper house).
</P>
<P>
Obuchi had initially planned to launch the coalition last
Friday, but postponed the start after Japan's worst ever nuclear
accident occurred Thursday in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The three-party coalition was formed after Obuchi, LP leader
Ichiro Ozawa and New Komeito head Takenori Kanzai signed a
memorandum of agreement on Monday on key policy issues including a
proposal to use some revenue from the consumption tax for social
welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
New Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki announced the new
cabinet lineup and a list of 32 parliamentary vice ministers at a
news conference in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Economic Planning Agency
head Taichi Skaiya retained their posts.
</P>
<P>
Yohei Kono, a former LDP president and former Japanese foreign
minister, was appointed foreign minister again.
</P>
<P>
Aoki said the new cabinet will have one member each from the LP
and the New Komeito.
</P>
<P>
The LP's Toshihiro Nikai was named transport minister, while
the New Komeito's Kunihiro Tsuzuki, a former vice governor of
Tokyo, became head of the Management and Coordination Agency.
</P>
<P>
Former LDP General Council chief Takashi Fukaya became
international trade and industry minister, while former Economic
Planning Agency head Michio Ochi headed the Financial
Reconstruction Commission.
</P>
<P>
Former Defense Agency chief Tokuichiro Tamazawa was appointed
agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister, and Masaaki Nakayama,
former posts and telecommunications minister, became construction
minister.
</P>
<P>
Former Education Minister Kosuke Hori took the post of home
affairs minister, and former Health and Welfare Minister Yuya Niwa
got a second stint in the post.
</P>
<P>
The justice portfolio went to former Defense Agency chief Hideo
Usui, while former Construction Minister Tsutomu Kawara became
defense agency chief.
</P>
<P>
Hirofumi Nakasone, son of former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone, was among first-time cabinet members, taking the
education portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Takamori Makino was given the post of labor minister, while
Eita Yashiro became posts and telecommunications minister.
</P>
<P>
Kayoko Shimizu, a House of Councilors member who was named new
Environment Agency chief, is the only woman in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The new ministers will be formally appointed after attending an
attestation ceremony at the Imperial Palace later in the day.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to issue Arrest Warrant Against Myanmese Hostage Takers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, October 5 ( Xinhua ) -- The Thai authorities will
soon issue an arrest warrant against the five Myanmese students
who seized Myanmar's Embassy in Bangkok last Friday and held 96
people as hostages, The Thai News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A senior Thai police officer was quoted as saying that after
the arrest warrant was issued, if the five Myanmese students
entered the Thai soil again in the future, they would face legal
actions on criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
The charges would include making other people to lose freedom
by taking them as hostages, holding unauthorized weapons and
robbery, as they seized guns from Thai security officers during
the two-day incident, the police officer said.
</P>
<P>
The incident ended peacefully on Saturday after the Thai
authorities agreed to the students' demand by using a police
helicopter to send them off at the Thai-Myanmese border, with Thai
Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra giving himself as a
key hostage in exchange for safe freedom of all the hostages held
by the armed group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar's Embassy in Bangkok opened for business
for the first time Monday following the incident, but contacts
were restricted through only the backdoor.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Police Probed for Flesh-trading Involvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus police has launched an
emergency probe into allegations that police officers were in
cahoots with underworld gangs forcing foreign cabaret girls into
prostitution, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is expected to include close relatives of
some of Cyprus' top political figures, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Among them is Pambos Anastassiades who has worked as a labor
agent specializing in the import of foreign workers. He is the
brother of Nicos Anastassiades, leader of the ruling Democratic
Rally party.
</P>
<P>
Investigation concerning allegations and information that
policemen are involved in flesh-trading and are being paid to
supply fake residence permits for foreign women in Cyprus is
underway, the police confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has acquired a bad reputation for importing female
cabaret dancers who are then allegedly forced to work as
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Nicos Anastassiades was at pain to insist that his brother, if
proven guilty, would not get off because of his political
influence.
</P>
<P>
"I will not accept or tolerate disruption of the
investigations in order to cover up anyone's possible
responsibilities, including my brother's," said the party leader
in a letter to the chief of police Andreas Angelides.
</P>
<P>
Angelides vowed that any officers found guilty of involvement
in the alleged scandal would face the full penalty under law.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Summoned to Court Over Issue of Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has been summoned to the
 International Court of Justice over charges that it invaded the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Attorney General Bert Katureebe at the
Parliament Monday after a Parliament member demanded that Uganda
remain in the DRC, the Monitor newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the DRC has filed a case against Uganda at the
international court and Uganda has been given summons to appear on
October 19.
</P>
<P>
Uganda sent troops to the DRC for security reasons soon after
a rebellion erupted in August, 1998. However, the DRC government
has accused Kampala of backing the rebels and invading a sovereign
country, a charge Uganda has roundly denied.
</P>
<P>
The DRC government filed a suit against Uganda at the
international court several months ago, demanding a full
withdrawal of Ugandan troops from the DRC and a severe punishment
for its invasion.

<HEADLINE> Anwar Not Arsenic Poisoned: Medical Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's former deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim did not suffer from acute or chronic
arsenic poisoning, according to a medical report made public
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report by Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan (National
University) Malaysia, dated October 4 and read out in the High
Court here Tuesday, said Anwar did neither have diseases like HIV,
kidney failure, diabetes, thyrotoxicosis, chronic anaemia,
tuberculosis or cancer which could cause the symptoms he had.
</P>
<P>
Tests on Anwar's urine, hair and nail specimens showed that the
arsenic level did not exceed the permissible level, said the
report signed by several specialists.
</P>
<P>
It said that because the cause of the patient's health problem
could not be confirmed from the tests carried out for several
diseases and from the arsenic level test, it was recommended that
the hospital continue to monitor the patient's health status.
</P>
<P>
Justice Arifin Jaka rejected an application by Anwar's counsel,
Karpal Singh and Christopher Fernando, to call doctors involved in
the examination to testify, saying it was not necessary because
Anwar was healthy based on the report.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was discharged from the hospital Monday evening with the
approval of the hospital where he has been undergoing tests after
his lawyers alleged that Anwar was suffering from arsenic
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The former Deputy Prime Minister, who is serving a six-year
jail sentence for corruption and is currently on trial for sodomy,
was admitted to the hospital on September 10 on the order of the
High Court.

<P>
MANILA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' rebel Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) declared Tuesday that it will
withdraw from the formal peace talks with the government scheduled
on October 25.
</P>
<P>
The official Philippine News Agency (PNA) said that the MILF
made the decision after a week-long conflict with government
forces in Maguindanao province in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted MILF deputy chief for political affairs Ghadzali
Jaafar as saying that their latest move was based on the decision
made by the rebel group's central committee chaired by MILF
chieftain Hashim Salamat.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar did not mention as to when the MILF would return to the
negotiating table, the PNA reported, adding that the government's
chief negotiator Orlando Soriano is on his way to the southern
Philippines to save the shaky peace negotiations with the MILF.

</P>
<P>
Of the total during the period this year, Myanmar's imports

ADDIS ABABA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's export income
decreased by 14.8 percent to 3.54 billion birr (440 million U.S.
dollars) in 1998 compared with the previous year, the Ethiopian
Herald newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The volume of its export also showed a 16.4 percent drop from a
year earlier, the Ministry of Trade and Industry was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Surplus supply of the Brazilian coffee on world markets and the
 subsequent cut in the price resulted in the reduction in
Ethiopia's export earnings, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is the third largest coffee producer in Africa.
Coffee export accounts for around 60 percent of its foreign
exchange earnings.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Undergoes Successful Surgery in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa has undergone a successful emergency heart surgery in
Beirut's American University Hospital (AUH), the Daily Star
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The minister underwent a successful operation. He is in the
recovery room and will be taken to the intensive-care unit," said
Lebanese Health Minister Karam Karam after the operation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa, 59, was suffering from aortic dissection, which can
be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly.
</P>
<P>
Karam, who is himself a doctor at AUH, said there had been a
30 percent risk of the aorta rupturing during the two-hour
operation.
</P>
<P>
He said he had informed Lebanese President Emile Lahoud of
Sharaa's condition and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad had been
notified that the operation had been successful.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss, House Speaker Nebih Berri,
and a long list of ministers and parliament members converged on
AUH to express their wishes for Sharaa's quick recovery.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is stationing a 350,000-strong troop in Lebanon,
is a undisputed power broker in the country.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa, who has been Syria's Foreign Minister since 1984,
has been a key figure in shaping Syria's foregin policy under
president Assad.
</P>
<P>
His sudden illness sparked widespread concerns for the current
peace process, which is expected to be revived after Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak came to power in July.
</P>
<P>
The United States was among the first to wish Sharaa a speedy
recovery, wary that the Syrian minister is an integral cog in
restarting peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We do wish him a successful treatment and a speedy recovery,"
said U.S. State Department Spokesman James R.Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Later, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called Karam
to get a personal update on Sharaa's condition.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Attract More Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Regional Tourism Organization
of Southern Africa (RETOSA) has embarked on a global marketing
strategy to increase the flow of tourists to the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) region.
</P>
<P>
RETOSA Executive Director Shepherd Nyaruwata said the strategy
had been designed to prop up the image of southern Africa as the
ultimate tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambian newspaper quoted him as saying Tuesday the
share of tourist in-flow to the region was not very encouraging
despite the vast potential it had to become Africa's first choice
tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for vigorous marketing, information and
promotional strategies to highlight the tourist attractions which
the SADC region has," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nyaruwata said RETOSA would ensure increased flow of tourists
into the region while developing an efficient marketing and
promotional strategy.
</P>
<P>
RETOSA was formed to spearhead the promotion and development of
tourism among the 14 SADC members.

<HEADLINE> South Pacific Forum Renamed Pacific Islands Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The 30th South Pacific Forum,
which began on October 3rd in Palau, an island territory north of
Timor, concluded its meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the 16-member group have agreed to rename the
grouping "the Pacific Islands Forum" in recognition of the fact
that forum countries come from all over the Pacific, the New
Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The leaders have endorsed in principle a free trade agreement
for the region and asked officials to draw this up.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that negotiations would take two years for an
agreement that would see larger countries, such as Fiji, cut
tariffs in eight years with the time frame for smaller countries
set at 10 years.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand and Australia have been excluded from taking part
in until after that time.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, who attended the
meeting, was quoted as saying her country and Australia's
exclusion from the Free Trade Agreement was "quite
understandable".
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much outside as in excluded, it is a timing and
phasing issue, and New Zealand accepts that most of these
developing economies have to get tax systems, for example, in
place rather than using excise as the main form of collection of
government revenue," Mrs. Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
According to NZPA, the participants have promised to do what
they can to support the peacekeeping mission in East Timor. In
addition, the forum said it will meet next year with Japan over
the continued shipments of nuclear waste through the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Forum chairman, Palau's President Kuniwo
Nakamura would meet Japanese representatives next April about the
shipments.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting also discussed environmental issues and
other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Prime Minister Shipley has arrived in
Darwin, Australia from Palau to visit some of the New Zealand
peacekeepers to East Timor.

<HEADLINE> Human Resources Services Outsourcing Hot Market in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Fueled by the increasing
complexity of human resources process and programs, the human
resources outsourcing services are becoming a hot market in the
United States, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies spent 7.3 billion dollars on these services, and
by 2003, that amount will soar to 10.2 billion dollars, said the
report from U.S. market research firm International Data
Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
The creation of innovative benefit programs, self-service and
Web-enabled human resources systems and training programs has
placed new pressures on the already-strained human, technological
and financial resources within most human resources departments,
said IDC, explaining the market growth. In response, many
companies are outsourcing increasingly complex human resources
processes and functions.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, companies that purchase human resources
outsourcing services will increasingly demand comprehensive, end-
to-end solutions. As a result, vendors will have to expand their
service offerings either organically or through partnerships and
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
IDC divides the overall human resources services market into
processing services and business process outsourcing. The former
segment, which includes activities such as payroll processing and
benefits claims filing, is the largest segment of the market.
However, the latter, which includes managing employee benefits and
other human resources administration duties, is growing at a rate
almost three times faster than the processing services segment.

<HEADLINE> Intel Renames Its Fastest Chip "Itanium" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Computer chip giant Intel
Corp. has selected "Itanium" as the brand name for its next
generation of microprocessors, previously code-named Merced,
according to a report from the company Monday.
</P>
<P>
Itanium is the company's first chip to use its new IA-64
architecture, which will process data in chunks of 64 bits, rather
than the 32-bits that chips like the Pentium III processors today.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the new chip is designed to run workstations --
machines with the ability to create sophisticated digital products
such as movie special effects -- and servers, which are the
traffic cops and information storers of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"When we went through the naming process, the intent was to
come up with a name that would connote the strength of the IA-64
technology," said Jami Dover, vice president of Intel's worldwide
sales and marketing group. She said Intel also wanted to have a
suffix that would connect with its Pentium brand.
</P>
<P>
Intel is moving to break into the Internet networking business
as sales of its core chips for desktop PCs slows and competition
keeps profit margins down.
</P>
<P>
Intel said the first samples of the chips had already been
delivered to its customers, with full-scale shipping scheduled for
mid-2000.

<HEADLINE> Excessive Pesticides Harmful in Nepal: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Growing use of chemical
pesticides among large number of unaware and ill-informed farmers
has become an imminent threat to Nepalese agriculture, health and
environment, the Rising Nepal quoted experts as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Agrochemical pesticides can cause damage to human health by
causing bronchial cancer, alteration of brain waves, neurological
abnormalities or sterility, and will also cause imbalance to
ecology, warned the experts.
</P>
<P>
Senior scientists of the Nepal Agriculture Research Council
(NARC) said at a workshop Monday that one million pesticide
poisoning cases occur every year in Nepal, causing 20,000 deaths
annually.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that excessive and inappropriate use of
pesticides can adversely affect the environment and in the long
run create a detrimental impact on the environment and human life.
</P>
<P>
According to a study by scientists, an average use of pesticide
per unit area in Nepal is estimated to be 142 gram per hectare,
which is much more than required. Uninformed Farmers in Nepal
prefer toxic and powerful pesticides because of immediate results.
</P>
<P>
As a result, pests have developed their resistant power,
thereby jeopardizing the agriculture sector. Even if the quantity
of pesticides is steadily on rise, the agricultural yield remains
stagnant.
</P>
<P>
Experts stressed on the use of natural pesticide in a bid to
curb the risk of chemical pesticide. They believe that natural
pesticides will not only help save the environment but protect
human health as well.

Birendra Bir Basnyat, chief of the fertilizer unit of the
Ministry of Agriculture, said fertilizers are not as hazardous to
environment as pesticides, but they can create changes in the
environmental balance of Nepal which has highly fragile
mountainous ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
According to Basnyat, fertilizer use in Nepal by nutrients per
hectare of arable land is one of the lowest in the region (around
35 kg per hectare). However, the available statistics show the use
of fertilizers in Nepal has increased at the rate of 73 percent
over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to use balanced quantity of organic and
inorganic fertilizers. "The proper balancing is an issue of
conservation since the wrong ratio will reduce the efficiency of
nutrient uptake and have an adverse effect on soil quality," he
said.

<HEADLINE> AMD Unveils 700 Megahertz Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Inc. on Monday unveiled an even speedier version of its new Athlon
computer chips in a bid to stay one step ahead of its archrival
and industry leader Intel Corp., according to a report from the
company.
</P>
<P>
AMD said its 700 megahertz chip will operate a computer far
better than Intel's most advanced chip in the market -- the 600
megahertz chip Intel offers for its Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
These new chips, which are typically sold in 1,000-unit batches
to computer makers, will sell for 849 U.S. dollars each. AMD also
said IBM and Compaq Computer Corp. had already been committed to
selling the new chips in their speediest computers, while retailer
Best Buy said it would immediately offer the chips through its
made-to-order computer-selling program.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts, however, said AMD is unlikely to overtake Intel,
which will begin shipping its faster 700 megahertz Pentium III
chip this month. Moreover, Intel typically responds to new
challenges by slashing the prices of its older chips to spur sales.
</P>
<P>
AMD has had production problems in the past, the analysts noted.

<HEADLINE> Tourism of Ho Chi Minh City Booms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The tourism of Vietnam's largest
city Ho Chi Minh City (HCM City) started to boom as the number of
arrivals jumped up nearly 26 percent, local English daily Vietnam
News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign arrivals passing through HCM City's Tan
Son Nhat International Airport and Saigon Port reached over
226,000 in the third quarter, a year-on-year increase of nearly 26
percent.
</P>
<P>
The most of the arrivals were from Asian countries, with
visitors from Hong Kong up 250 percent, from Thailand up 59
percent, and from Japan up 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Visitors from the United States and the United Kingdom were up
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
the rise in visitors pushed the tourism revenues of the
Vietnam's largest city up to 2,160 billion Vietnamese dong (VND)
(about 155 million U.S. dollars) for the first three quarters of
1999, with the department reporting 644,000 arrivals over the
first three quarters, up 16 percent over the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, more tourists are choosing to use domestic travel
agencies, with business up 29 percent at 100,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
The hospitality industry has also benefited from the rise with
state-owned hotels reporting 54 percent occupancy rates.
</P>
<P>
However, revenues have not been as high as expected because of
stiff competition in the hotel sector, which has seen room rates
fall by up to 20 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Joint venture hotels and private mini-hotels reported that
business was still sluggish, with respective occupancy rates of 45
percent and 30 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of heroin addicts is
rising sharply in Bangladesh at an alarming rate of over 3%
yearly, a local newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by Department of Narcotics
Control (DNC), heroin addicts account for 66.89% of all the drug
users, The New Nation said, adding the latest figure for January
to August 1999 is based on the statistics of admission of addicts
to the hospitals.

<P>
The report quoted Mudabbir Hossain Chowdhury, director general
of DNC, as saying that Bangladesh has no dependable figure
relating to drug dealers.

COLOMBO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has set up a joint
venture with Australia to introduce embryo transfer technology
into the tropical island country to raise high quality purebred
heifers, press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new company Lanka Genetics AB (Pvt) Ltd., launched with an
investment of 20 million rupees (280,000 U.S. dollars), is the
result of a five-year research study, the official Daily News
quoted the company's Managing Director Ravi Randeniya as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the steady growth in demand for fresh milk from
all consumer groups in Sri Lanka is estimated at 50 million
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The director said the embryo transfer technology is designed to
pay high dividends by increasing the milking herd and the quality
of milk. Additionally it is easy to adopt a local animal to the
climatic conditions and diseases here.
</P>
<P>
In the long run the company aims at becoming a leading supplier
of quality genetics to Sri Lanka's expanding dairy industry, he
added.

JAKARTA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia finally withdrew from
the bidding for the 2006 Asian Games, and supported Malaysia's
bidding, State Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Agung Laksono
said.
</P>
<P>
Laksono was quoted by the Media Indonesia on Tuesday as saying
that the decision was made by cabinet meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
He said President B.J. Habibie told the meeting that Indonesia
must support Malaysia bidding for the 2006 Asian Games.

<P>
Earlier September, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad
asked Habibie during their meeting in Kuala Lumpur to reconsider
Indonesia's bid for the Asiad and throw its support behind
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mahathir expressed Malaysia's desire not to
compete against Indonesia in the bidding, preferring instead to
have Indonesia's support in a show of ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) unity.
</P>
<P>
Besides Malaysia, Qatar, Syria, India, Hong Kong and Uzbekstan
also expressed their willingness to host the 2006 Asian Games. The

<HEADLINE> Japanese Ministers Resign to Pave Way for Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese cabinet ministers
resigned en masse Tuesday morning to pave the way for Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi to reshuffle his cabinet and launch a new
tripartite coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet reshuffle, which is expected to be announced early
this afternoon, is aimed at bringing the New Komeito, Japan's
second largest opposition party, into the current coalition
between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Liberal
Party (LP).
</P>
<P>
The three-party coalition would give the ruling bloc over 350
seats in the 500-seat House of Representatives, the lower house of
Japan's parliament, as well as a majority in the opposition-
controlled House of Councilors, the upper house.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi had initially planned to launch the new coalition last
Friday, but postponed after Japan suffered its worst nuclear
accident one day before the plan.
</P>
<P>
It is Obuchi's second cabinet reshuffle since he took office in
July 1998, following one in January when he launched the LDP-LP
coalition by bringing an LP member into the cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Inflation Rises to 5.7 Pct in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' year-on-year
inflation rate increased slightly to 5.7 percent in September from
5.5 percent in August, the National Statistics Office (NSO) said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices rose 0.5 percent month-on-month in September,
versus the 0.3 percent rise in August, said the NSO.
</P>
<P>
Economists said poor agricultural harvests due to typhoons
triggered a domino effect that drove up food prices in September.
</P>
<P>
They noted that fuel prices and the peso's depreciation in the
last two weeks of September also helped jack up prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the NSO, the annual inflation rate for food alone
ticked up to 3.3 percent in September from 3.2 percent in August
due to higher rates in the prices of fish, fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
However, lower rates were recorded in the prices of meat, rice,
dairy products and eggs while miscellaneous foods declined to -0.1
percent from 1.4 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
By region, the inflation rate for Metro Manila rose to 4.7
percent in September from 4.2 percent in August, while inflation
in other areas remained at 6.0 percent, the NSO said.
</P>
<P>
On a month-on-month basis, prices in Metro Manila increased to
0.7 percent in September from 0.4 percent in August while prices
in other regions rose to 0.5 percent in September from 0.3 percent
in August.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Sign Barkley, Waive Eddie Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Houston Rockets re-signed
Charles Barkley to a one-year contract today, and that proved at
least the team does not think the superstar is selfish or fat.
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed, but the deal is believed to be worth
eight figures. The team also waived veteran forward Eddie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the signing came just hours after former Rocket
Scottie Pippen held a news conference with his new team, the
Portland Trail Blazers. Last week, Pippen blasted Barkley as a
teammate and reiterated his demand for a trade.
</P>
<P>
Barkley said he was "disappointed" in Pippen for asking for a
trade after just one season with the Rockets. Pippen labeled
Barkley as "selfish" and "fat". On Saturday, the Rockets dealt
Pippen to the Trail Blazers for six players.
</P>
<P>
Barkley, 36, averaged 16.1 points and 12.3 rebounds last season,
his 15th in the NBA and third with the Rockets. He was second on
the team in scoring and second in the NBA in rebounding.
</P>
<P>
One of the NBA's Greatest Players, Barkley played for $1
million last season to create salary cap room for Pippen, who had
a five-year, $67.2 million contract.
</P>
<P>
One of just three players with 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds
and 4,000 assists, Barkley has averaged 22.3 points and 11.7
rebounds in 1,053 games. He was selected fifth overall in 1984 by
Philadelphia and spent his first eight seasons with the 76ers
before he was traded to the Phoenix Sunds.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992-93 campaign, Barkley earned league Most Valuable
Player honors and led the Suns to the NBA Finals. Three years
later, he was dealt to the Rockets for four players.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets have been busy of late. They acquired rookie guard
Steve Francis from Vancouver in a three-team, 11-player deal and
signed free agent swingman Shandon Anderson before dealting away
Pippen.

<HEADLINE> Semiconductor Industry Poised for Big Upswing: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide semiconductor
industry is in the midst of a significant upswing driven by both
supply and demand, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
While the 1995 downturn in the industry was supply-driven, the
current upturn, which began in the fall of 1998, is driven by
supply and demand, said the report from Bank of America Securities,
a subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation and an investment bank
and brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
The current upward trend was inhibited by personal computer
downsizing, but led by the growth of the communications industry,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The first half of 1999 was marked by a tightening supply of
semiconductors and improved demand, and, in fact, margins were
increasing as early as spring. Continuing this trend, the second
half of 1999 was characterized by a supply shortage in all major
product categories and surging broad-based demand.
</P>
<P>
The report said the current tightening of supply is the result
of low capital expenditure between 1996 and 1999, aging
fabrication plants and process transitions. New technologies are
needed for high-speed networks and data forms.
</P>
<P>
The supply balance was apparent in the first quarter of 1999,
with shortages occurring in the first half of 1999 and increasing
in the third quarter. The shortage list in the third quarter
includes all nonvolatile memory.
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor production is also experiencing an aging capacity
base, the report noted. In the last up cycle, the industry had
difficulty in transitioning to new technologies, and the scenario
is replaying itself today as most fabrication facilities are
incapable of manufacturing 0.21 micron and 0.18 micron chips.
</P>
<P>
In addition, demand is surging, primarily as a result of the
growth of the communications industry, especially high-speed
digital networks. Servers, storage area networks (SANs), wireless
communications, personal productivity instruments and low-priced
PCs are also contributing to the demand for semiconductors, the
report said, but PCs are no longer the cycle driver.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that the worldwide semiconductor market
will grow into a market of 300 billion U.S. dollars by 2002,
assuming a nine percent compound aggregate growth rate in
computing hardware and 15 percent in communications hardware.

<P>
YANGON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar exported 28,800 tons of
rice in the first four months of this year, an increase of 58.24
percent over the same period of last year which was 18,200 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the country's
Central Statistical Organization, Myanmar exported 111,700 tons of
rice in 1998, increasing by 572.89 percent compared with 1997
which was 16,600 tons.
</P>
<P>
Despite certain increase of the rice exports in recent years,
Myanmar's population grows by 2 percent annually. The country's
rice export remains unoptimistic.
</P>
<P>
In the pre-Second World War period, Myanmar annually exported
over 3 million tons of rice. It dropped to 1 million tons after
entering the 1950s and kept falling to the lowest figures of
16,600 tons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
To meet the food demand of the daily increasing population, the
Myanmar government started leasing in January this year a great
deal of vacant and virgin lands to be run by private
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's cultivable land covers 18.22 million hectares, of
which 9.31 million hectares have been utilized and there still
remains 8.91 million hectares of such land unreclaimed.

<HEADLINE> Contraceptives Easier to Get in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A survey done at five institutes
of higher learning in Beijing showed that although 54 percent of
the 1,310 students surveyed expressed that pre-marital sex must be
prohibited, 15 percent of the male students and 13 percent of
female students confessed that they had sex and only 42.2 percent
used contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Beijing Medical University, also
finds that male students had their first sexual experience at the
age of 18, 19 for female, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon has caught the attention of family planning and
health officials, and in fact they are experimenting with
different ways to make contraceptives easily obtainable to
youngsters and other groups of people who cannot obtain
contraceptives via the governmental distribution network.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some 20 cities including Beijing, Shanghai,
Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Nanjing have installed
5,000 self-services condom vending machines in residential
quarters and other public areas as a supplement to the present no-
charge contraceptive distribution system in China, said Guo
Zhongmin, director of the market department with Chinese Center
for Family Planning Contraceptive Research and Development.
</P>
<P>
Except for Beijing and Shanghai where the machines are
installed by the government, all the other cities are funded by
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The China/UN joint program has so far installed a total of 90
condom vending machines in urban areas of Beijing and Shanghai
since mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Such machines have also appeared in some universities such as
Qinghua in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Guo, his center is planning to install another 1,
000 condom vending machines in all provinces before the end of the
year to help young people prevent unwanted pregnancies and
sexually transmitted diseases.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Argentina to Resume Trade Negotiations in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will resume trade
negotiations with Argentina next year, when the new Argentine
president is elected, Brazilian Foreign Minister Luis Felipe
Lampreia said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with entrepreneurs from the Brazilian Textile Industry
Association (ABIT) in Sao Paulo, Lampreia expressed optimism on
the eventual elimination of trade barriers placed by Argentina on
Brazilian textile exports.
</P>
<P>
Trade relations between the two countries have soured since the
devaluation of the Brazilian currency in January. In July, the
Argentine authorities announced import limits on textile products
from Brazil for fear of huge surges because of lower prices.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia pointed out that no significant increase has so far
been observed in Brazil's textile exports to justify Argentina's
protectionist measures.
</P>
<P>
According to the ABIT, Argentina exports 70 percent of its
textile products to Brazil, while Brazil exports 30 percent of its
products to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said the government's position in the forthcoming
talks with the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) consists in
maintaining openness, but with a cautious defense of national
interests.
</P>
<P>
Both Brazil and Argentina are members of Mercosur, which also
includes Paraguay and Uruguay with Bolivia and Chile as associate
members.
</P>
<P>
Referring to an accord reached between Brazilian and Argentine
footwear sectors on September 29, Lampreia said the agreement will
strengthen Mercosur and improve its international image.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Former Nazi Officer Receives 20-Year Jail Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A Croatian court on Monday

<HEADLINE> Large Number Of Historical Relics Found In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 5 (Xinhua) -- In the past 20 years, Chinese
archaeologists have discovered more than 102,000 historical relics
in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Since China began its reforms in 1978, the province has had 2,
214 excavation projects on 260,000 square meters of historical
sites, with 21,000 tombs unearthed, producing an abundance of rare
relics like the 500,000-year-old fossilized teeth of ape- man,
China's oldest flute, and a dragon-shaped clam carving.
</P>
<P>
The country's only three township ruins of the Shang Dynasty (
1600-1100 B.C.) are all in Henan, according to a local
archaeologist. Tombs of ancient dynasties have been found there as
well.
</P>
<P>
To provide more information about the archaeological
discoveries of Henan, the province will soon publish two series of
books on historical relics and sites.

<HEADLINE> Pak-China Friendship to Become Stronger in New Century: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister for
Information and Culture Mushahid Hussain said Monday that the
relationship between Pakistan and China will become stronger in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"This is an all weather friendship, which has withstood good
times and bad times, and that is what sincere friendship is all
about," he told the media late Monday night on his return from his
one-week visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Mushahid visited China from September 26 to October 4,
attending the Golden Jubilee celebrations of China as the leader
of the Pakistani delegation.
</P>
<P>
The importance attached to the Pakistani delegation indicated
the level, depth and substance of Pakistan's relationship with
China, said Mushahid.
</P>
<P>
"My delegation's visit together with the media delegation (from
Pakistan) contributed substantially to strengthening what has been
a long standing binding relationship," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
To a question on China's determination for peaceful unification
of its motherland, Mushahid said, "China has pursued a very wise
and correct policy."
</P>
<P>
He noted that China will be celebrating Macao's reunion with
the motherland in coming December after the peaceful return of
Hong Kong two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We feel the day is not far off when Taiwan will certainly be
reunited with the motherland, as it should be because this was an
historical injustice and historical wrong, which will finally be
righted," Mushahid said.
</P>
<P>
The policy of one country, two systems has succeeded in China,
and it has provided an experiment which is quite unique in the
history, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the parade he saw in China, Mushahid said he
considered himself among the fortunate few who had the opportunity
to witness "the truly magnificent spectacle parade with
precision."
</P>
<P>
The parade gave a view of the Chinese history. The discipline
and substance of the parade showed the economic, cultural and
military might of new China, and what China has achieved in 50
years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the celebration of Pak-China Friendship Week
launched by the Pakistani government, the minister said it was the
first time Pakistan celebrated a week of friendship with any
country.
</P>
<P>
"This is a special gesture towards our great friend, China," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mushahid noted that the friendship week was participated by
people from all walks of life, along with the three delegations
from China with celebrations in all the provinces.
</P>
<P>
"This was a very broad-based celebrations, based on the special
relationships," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Spitting Vieira Swallows His Pride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal striker Patrick Vieira
has apologised for spitting at Neil Ruddock and said he is ashamed
of his actions at Upton Park.
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal midfielder has been charged with misconduct by the
Football Association over the outburst which followed his sending-
off at West Ham on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He is now staring at a lengthy ban and a large fine if he is
found guilty and faces a police investigation about an alleged
clash with a policeman in the players' tunnel as he returned to
the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
Vieira said: "My behaviour after being sent off was inexcusable.
Although I was subjected to provocation, I am ashamed of my action.
</P>
<P>
"Spitting at a fellow professional is something I sincerely
regret. It was a reaction in the heat of the moment, and I
apologise to everyone involved in the incident."
</P>
<P>
Vieira lost his head after he was sent off by ref Mike Reed in
the 84th minute. It was the fourth red card of his stormy Arsenal
career.
</P>
<P>
The combative midfielder was upset by Reed's decision to give
him his second yellow card of the game for a foul on Paolo Di
Canio but admitted his reaction was out of order.
</P>
<P>
BBC Match of the Day cameras clearly showed the Frenchman spit
at Ruddock during an angry exchange before he was pulled away by
team-mate Gilles Grimandi and led from the field by physio Gary
Lewin.
</P>
<P>
Arsene Wenger, after the game, accused Di Canio of diving to
get Vieira sent off - but Arsenal branded the reaction of their 23-
year-old midfielder "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Gunners said: "Although Patrick Vieira was
severely provoked during the game and at the time of the incident,
his response to being sent off yesterday was wrong."

<HEADLINE> Dalglish Settles Differences with Newcastle United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Newcastle United have agreed to pay Kenny Dalglish
compensation for sacking him as manager more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The figure is being kept secret but Dalglish, now Celtic's
director of football operations, said in a statement that he was
happy with the outcome of the tribunal, which was arbitrated by
the Premier League.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that everything has been resolved amicably," said
Dalglish, who has been chasing compensation since being replaced
as manager at St James' Park by Ruud Gullit last year.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to thank the players and staff who worked with me at
Newcastle for their support and dedication."
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to thank John Barnwell of the League
Managers' Association and my trade union, MSF, who supported my
claim.
</P>
<P>
"I wish Bobby Robson and the Newcastle team every success and
look forward to concentrating on fulfilling the ambitions of
Celtic for the future."
</P>
<P>
Dalglish and Newcastle issued a joint statement outside the
Premier League headquarters with both camps saying they were
satisfied with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
"Kenny Dalglish and Newcastle United Football Club want to
announce that they have reached an agreement to the satisfaction
of both parties on the legal matters relating to Kenny Dalglish's
departure from the club," read the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The terms of the agreement will remain confidential and no
further comment will be made."
</P>
<P>
The outcome means a financial settlement has been reached with
the former Newcastle boss, although only Magpies chief executive
Freddie Fletcher was at the hearing.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Efforts for "Cities for All" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday called upon the international community to
make more efforts to build cities for all, regardless of class,
race and ethnic background.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement in his message to the World Habitat
Day, which falls on October 4.
</P>
<P>
"Most of today's cities are sharply divided along class, race
or ethnic lines -- or even all three at once," he said. "Many
millions of people live in overcrowded slums and squatter
settlements, without access to basic services."
</P>
<P>
"Millions of the most vulnerable are women," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Countless examples show that when people are given security of
tenure, they are more likely to invest in creating better homes,
better neighborhoods and ultimately, better communities," he said.
"And that when local governments work in genuine partnership with
civil society -- including the urban poor -- the entire
environment thrives."
</P>
<P>
"On this last World Habitat Day of the 20th century, let us
recommit ourselves to making the Habitat Agenda come true and to
ensuring that all people living in cities -- young and old, rich
and poor, men and women -- have a say in the decisions that affect
their lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Habitat Day this year is the 14th one, which is
celebrated to promote concerted efforts in all countries to better
living environment and deal with problems arising from the
urbanization.
