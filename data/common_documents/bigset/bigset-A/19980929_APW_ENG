Earthquake rocks Indonesian islands, no injuries reported
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A magnitude 6.3 earthquake centered
beneath the Indian Ocean shook the eastern end of the main island
of Java and the neighboring tourist island of Bali Monday night,
seismologists said Tuesday.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
	   However, residents and local radio reports said some buildings
and homes were damaged in the towns of Blitar and Bantur on Java,
about 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Many residents, fearing that aftershocks might bring down their
houses, slept in the open overnight.
	   The Department of Meteorology and Geophysics said the quake's
epicenter was beneath the ocean floor about 89 kilometers (55
miles) south of Blitar, the hometown and grave site of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno.
	   ``I've never felt anything like it in my life. I and my family
were shocked. Everything was shaking for a couple of minutes,''
said Endah, a telephone operator in Blitar.
	   The quake was felt over a wide area, including in Denpasar on
Bali. However, there were no reports of damage to resorts. Bali
residents said the quake lasted only a few seconds.
	   The department said the quake was recorded at 8:34 p.m. (1340
GMT) Monday.
	   A magnitude 6 earthquake can cause severe damage if centered in
an urban area.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which sits on the so-called
Pacific ``Ring of Fire,'' a series of volcanoes and fault lines
that stretches from North America through Japan and Southeast Asia
to the South Pacific.

Another affiliate of Long-Term Credit Bank goes under

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese automobile leasing company has filed for
bankruptcy with nearly 126 billion yen (dlrs 930 million) in debts
after the failure of its parent company left it without support,
company officials said Tuesday.
	   The Japan Leasing Auto Corp. filed for protection from creditors
with the Tokyo District Court late Monday, said company spokesman
Osamu Sugita.
	   The action comes after its parent company, Japan Leasing Corp.,
took a similar measure in the nation's largest ever corporate
bankruptcy with debts of 2.18 trillion yen (dlrs 16 billion).
	   Japan Leasing is affiliated with the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan, the bank at the center of political debate over what to do
about the nation's mounting bad debt problem.
	   Analysts predicted the fall of Japan Leasing was also likely to
affect reconstruction plans for other LTCB affiliate.
	   In a separate development Tuesday, a regional textile maker
Longchamp Co., based in western Japan, has filed for court
protection, with debts estimated at 9 billion yen (dlrs 66
million), according to a private credit research agency Teikoku
Databank Ltd.
	   Longchamp is listed on the Osaka Stock Exchange's second
section. Its main lender is Sanwa Bank Ltd., also a major
shareholder in the company.

Cubs 5, Giants 3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Now, Steve Trachsel will be remembered for more
than giving up a historic home run. He's pitched those lovable
losers, the Chicago Cubs, into the playoffs.
	   With a home run boost from castoff Gary Gaetti and two key
singles by Sammy Sosa, the Cubs beat the San Francisco Giants 5-3
Monday night to win the frenetic one-game playoff for the NL
wild-card spot.
	   They survived despite a three-run rally in the ninth by the
Giants. Barry Bonds, who grounded out with the bases loaded to end
the seventh, came up again with the bases loaded but managed only a
sacrifice fly.
	   The Cubs haven't been to a World Series since 1945 and haven't
won one in 90 years, yet they're going to the postseason for the
first time since 1989.
	   And now it's on to Atlanta, an extension of one of the most
exciting seasons in their storied, sometimes laughable, always
eventful, history. The Cubs, who won six of nine from the Braves,
play Game 1 Wednesday.
	   Trachsel (15-8), who surrendered Mark McGwire's 62nd home run,
didn't give up a hit until pinch-hitter Brent Mayne singled with
one out in the seventh.
	   Trailing 4-0, the Giants went on to load the bases with two outs
and brought Bonds to the plate. But the three-time MVP, who has
struggled in the postseason, grounded out against reliever Felix
Heredia and slammed his helmet to the ground.
	   In the ninth, reliever Kevin Tapani gave up a pair of leadoff
singles. That brought on Terry Mulholland, who went eight innings
and threw 121 pitches Sunday.
	   Stan Javier hit an RBI single and pinch-hitter Ellis Burks
walked, loaded the bases with no outs and the score 5-1. But Bonds
flied out, and then Rod Beck earned his 51st save, getting Jeff
Kent on an RBI forceout and retiring Joe Carter on a popup.
	   It was Carter's final at-bat in the majors. At 38, the hero of
the 1993 World Series is retiring.
	   The Cubs nearly did not get this far, losing six of their
previous eight games, including Sunday's finale in Houston. But
they were saved when Colorado rallied from a 7-0 deficit to beat
the Giants 9-8, forcing the first one-game playoff in the NL since
1980.
	   Trachsel and Giants starter Mark Gardner kept it scoreless until
the fifth inning.
	   Henry Rodriguez singled and then the balding Gaetti lifted a
two-run homer to left, his 19th of the season and eighth since
joining the Cubs on Aug. 19 _ his 40th birthday _ after his release
by St. Louis.
	   Gaetti raised his arms in triumph as the ball landed in the
left-field seats and after a delay as fans littered the field, he
emerged from the dugout for a Sosa-like curtain call.
	   Singles by Lance Johnson and Sosa drove out Gardner (13-6) in
the sixth. Rich Rodriguez relieved and after Grace walked to load
the bases, Matt Mieske, called up from the minors earlier this
month, lined a two-run single to right for a 4-0 lead.
	   Sosa went 2-for-4 with a pair of singles, scoring in the eighth
on Jose Mesa's wild pitch.
	   Sosa finished the regular season, because this game's numbers
counted, with 66 home runs, trailing McGwire's 70. But Sosa gets
something McGwire doesn't _ a chance to play into October.
	   Trachsel hadn't won since Aug. 28 and had given up eight homers
in his previous four starts.
	   The slow-delivering right-hander, whose long pauses between
pitches served to take the charged-up crowd at Wrigley out of the
game, struggled with his control.
	   He loaded the bases by hitting a batter and walking two in the
fourth before slipping a called third strike past Brian Johnson. By
the end of five, he'd already thrown 96 pitches.
	   Trachsel allowed just one hit in 6 1-3 innings, walking six and
striking out six.
	   After Mayne singled, Trachsel walked pinch-hitter Armando Rios
and was replaced by Matt Karchner.
	   After another reserve, left fielder Orlando Merced, reached into
the seats to pluck Javier's foul fly, ex-Cub Shawon Dunston got an
infield single to load the bases.
	   But Bonds bounced out to end the threat. Bonds, a career .200
hitter in four postseason series, went 0-for-4 with a sacrifice
fly.
	   Monday night's game was the first one-game playoff in the
National League since 1980 when the Houston Astros beat the Dodgers
7-1 to win the NL West. In 1995, Seattle beat the Angels 9-1 in a
one-game showdown for the AL West.
	   The Cubs beat the Giants _ then the New York Giants _ in 1908's
final game for the NL pennant and a trip to the World Series. They
beat the Detroit Tigers in five games _ the Cubs' last World Series
win.
	   That was the season of the famed ``Merkle Boner'' when the
Giants' Fred Merkle failed to advance from first to second on an
apparent two-out, game-winning hit.

U.N. year of older persons in 1999 isn't politically sexy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations is about to launch The
International Year of Older Persons. As the new millennium
approaches, it should be a sexy issue. After all, the world is
aging rapidly.
	   But the U.N. Trust Fund on Aging, which relies on voluntary
contributions from U.N. members, is almost broke. And the U.N.'s
aging unit only has three people to oversee year-long activities in
1999.
	   ``The problem with this issue is that there is no political
will,'' Ambassador Julia T. Alvarez of the Dominican Republic, a
champion of senior citizens in the United Nations for many years,
lamented Monday. ``I think the United Nations member states tend to
react to crises.''
	   The aging crisis hasn't arrived yet, but it's on the way.
	   One out of 10 people today is now aged 60 or older _ and every
month 1 million people around the globe turn 60, over 80 percent of
them in developing countries. By the year 2050, one out of five
people will be over 60. And the older population itself is also
aging. By 2050, 27 percent of senior citizens will be over 80,
according to U.N. figures.
	   Increased longevity will so profoundly alter society, Alvarez
said, ``that we could be left with institutions organized to deal
with a world that has passed.''
	   The United Nations has agencies devoted to children and
population issues, and a development fund for women. What
campaigners are hoping is that The International Year of Older
Persons in 1999 will put the age boom on the global agenda.
	   Alexandre Sidorenko, the U.N. official in charge of coordinating
preparations for the year's activities, said society has not
absorbed the impact of the demographic changes. For example, more
than 20 years has been added to the average lifespan from 1950 to
1995, he said.
	   ``What are individuals supposed to do with these additional
years? In some countries it's more than 30 years living after
retirement,'' he said. ``It's a challenge for the individual, but
it's also a challenge for the society.''
	   Sidorenko spelled out some of the challenges at a news
conference ahead of the official launch by U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan on Thursday, the eighth observance of The International
Day of Older Persons.
	   How can society support the growing number of older people in
their advancing years? How can their added years be a time of
fulfillment and contribution to society _ not of misery struggling
with disability and illness?
	   Ambassador Alvarez said the U.N. Trust Fund, which initially had
1 million dollars, is now down to about dlrs 5,000. Voluntary
organizations have formed a Committee on Aging to help promote
activities around the theme for the year _ ``Towards a society for
all ages.''
	   ``Wherever possible, older persons are eager and willing and
many times prepared to share with their fellows of all ages and of
all generations,'' said Helen Hamlin, a committee member and social
worker who is a fellow at Hunter College in New York.
	   ``When people used to reach the age of 60 or 65, (it was)
goodbye. Oh no, we are not saying goodbye. We are saying we are
here. We can contribute. We must contribute. You need us, just as
we need you,'' she said.
	   Education is essential ``to counter negative attitudes and myths
regarding aging, which still persist globally,'' she said. ``Ageism
has not died and will not die unless we all take a role in pursuing
... changes.''
	   Alvarez admitted that it was risky to focus attention on a group
by proclaiming a year in their honor.
	   ``When the International Year of Older Persons ends, will they
be discarded, just like last year's calendar?,'' she said.
	   ``By Dec. 31, 1999, if we are serious about creating `a society
for all ages,' we will have gone beyond the calendar to put older
people on the map,'' Alvarez said.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A court Tuesday began hearing
charges against Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister who was
brought to a courthouse for the beginning of what could be a
landmark legal case in this Southeast Asian nation.
	   Anwar was led into the the Jalan Raja Court 15 minutes before it
was scheduled to open and taken into a magistrate's courtroom after
a nearly three-hour wait in the court's judicial lockup.
	   Anwar was to be charged by police on nine counts of corruption
and ``unnatural'' sex acts, the national news agency, Bernama,
reported. The punishment for each count could be several years
imprisonment.
	   A tenth charge will be brought against him in another court in a
Kuala Lumpur suburb on Wednesday, Bernama said, quoting a statement
by the Attorney-General's Chambers.
	   Hundreds of policemen threw a ring around the colonial building
to prevent his supporters from thronging the area for a glimpse of
their leader not seen since his arrest on Sept. 20.
	   Anwar was marched off by armed police under the harsh Internal
Security Act. He faces accusations ranging from illegal homosexual
acts to treason.
	   After he was fired on Sept. 2 by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, Anwar had led a campaign against his former boss, who has
ruled Malaysia for 17 years.
	   Since Anwar's arrest, Kuala Lumpur has been rocked by street
protests demanding his release and Mahathir's resignation.
	   On Monday, riot police chased a few thousand pro-reform
activists through the neon-lit streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur as
protesters defied warnings to gather for a second consecutive week
near the courthouse.
	   Chanting ``Reformasi'' or ``Reforms,'' the demonstrators marched
from a courthouse, carrying banners that said, ``Free Anwar.''
	   At least 16 of Anwar's associates have been held under a harsh
security law that allows indefinite imprisonment without trial.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were politically
motivated.
	   Mahathir has promised that Anwar would be given a speedy and
fair tried in an open court.

Korean-American college president held in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Korean-American college president
has been held in North Korea for two weeks for political reasons,
South Korea's intelligence agency said Tuesday.
	   Kim Jin-kyong, 63, president of Yanbian Engineering College in
China's Yanbian province bordering North Korea, has not been
allowed to leave the North since Sept. 16, the Agency for National
Security Planning said.
	   ``It has been confirmed that he has been held there against his
will, and the reasons appear to be political,'' one agency official
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Kim, a South Korean-born U.S. citizen, has been active in recent
years in promoting humanitarian and educational exchanges with
North Korea. He set up Yanbian Engineering College in the late
1980s with South Korean donations.
	   Kim entered North Korea in early September, along with a
Christian pastor from Seoul, for a 10-day stay.
	   The pastor was allowed to leave North Korea at the end of the
trip but Kim was not, the South Korean intelligence official said.
	   Local media said the two planned to discuss building a dental
hospital in Pyongyang, the capital, and an engineering college in
the North's free trade zone in Rajin-Sonbong.
	   A major South Korean newspaper, JoongAng Ilbo, reported that Kim
was questioned by Pyongyang officials about whether he had given
bribes to North Korean officials.
	   In August, a Korean-American Christian pastor was released after
being held for four months on spy charges in North Korea. His
release was arranged by the U.S. government.
	   After his release, the pastor, Lee Kwang-dok, 73, from Lomita, a
suburb of Los Angeles, denied the North Korean charges.

Japan finance, real estate sectors fall from list of highest paid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Workers in the finance and real estate sectors
failed to top the list of Japan's highest paid for the first time
in 48 years as the bank crises and a stagnant property market
dragged down salaries, a government report said Tuesday.
	   The average annual wage in the finance and property sectors was
5,584,000 yen (dlrs 41,058) per worker last year, down 0.8 percent
from a year before, the National Tax Administration Agency said.
	   The total amount paid in the two sectors fell behind that of the
petrochemical industry, whose workers received 5,682,000 yen (dlrs
41,779) on average last year, the report said. The annual wages
included monthly salaries, allowances and twice-a-year bonuses.
	   Bonuses are usually considered part of a worker's wages in
Japan.
	   It was the first time wages in the finance and real estate
sectors lagged behind another industry since the agency began
taking statistics in 1949, the report said.
	   Businesses in the two sectors have remained in a slump in the
wake of the collapse of the highly speculative ``bubble economy''
of the late 1980s.
	   All industries included, the average annual wage actually rose
by 1.4 percent to 4,673,000 yen (dlrs 34,360) last year from the
previous year, the report said. It was the first year-on-year rise
in annual wages above 1 percent in five years.
	   A short-lived pick-up in the nation's economy in early 1997 was
seen as contributing to the overall rise in salaries.
	   The number of wage-earners in the private sector totaled 45.26
million people last year, up 0.8 percent from a year before, the
agency said.

Cayless gets call up for Kiwis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Young Australian-born prop Nathan
Cayless was named Tuesday in New Zealand's rugby league squad for
the Oct. 9 second test against Australia.
	   Cayless, 20, qualifies for the Kiwis because both his parents
were born in New Zealand. ``I've always thought of myself as a Kiwi
and I've always wanted to represent New Zealand,'' said Cayless.
	   He is one of five newcomers to the 23-strong squad from which
the final 17 will be chosen to face the Kangaroos in Brisbane.
	   Prop is one of the problem positions for the Kiwis, with the
unavailability of John Lomax, Terry Hermansson and Jason Lowrie
through either suspension or injury.
	   The other uncapped players are Canberra winger Lesley Vainikolo,
Canterbury centre Willie Talau, Penrith forward Tony Puletua and
Auckland Warrior prop Ali Lauitiiti.
	   British-based players Henry and Robbie Paul and Richie Blackmore
have also been included, but whether they are ultimately available
depend on whether their clubs are still in the English club
playoffs.
	   Kiwi coach Frank Endacott admitted that he did not know until
two weeks ago that Cayless was eligible for New Zealand selection.
	   ``I did some homework on him and watched some tapes of him,''
Endacott said. ``I found out that he was interested in playing for
New Zealand rather than Australia, so I got on the case straight
away.''
	   New Zealand won the opening test of the series in April.
	   New Zealand squad: Matthew Ridge (Warriors), Sean Hoppe
(Warriors), Lesley Vainikolo (Canberra), Richard Barnett (Sydney
City), Nigel Vagana (Warriors), Kevin Iro (Warriors), Ruben Wiki
(Canberra), Willie Talau (Canterbury), Richard Blackmore (Leeds),
Robbie Paul (Bradford), Gene Ngamu (Warriors), Stacey Jones
(Warriors), Henry Paul (Wigan), Syd Eru (Warriors), Joe Vagana
(Warriors), Quentin Pongia (Warriors), Nathan Cayless (Parramatta),
Tony Puletua (Penrith), Stephen Kearney (Warriors), Jarrod
McCracken (Parramatta), Logan Swann (Warriors), Tony Iro
(Adelaide), Ali Lauitiiti (Warriors).

	   Hundreds of policemen threw a ring around the colonial building
to prevent his supporters from thronging the area for a glimpse of
their leader not seen since his arrest.
	   Anwar was marched off by armed police under the harsh Internal
Security Act. The start of legal proceedings for the corruption and
homosexuality charges were independent of Anwar's detention under
the Internal Security Act, the government's law office said.
	   After he was fired on Sept. 2 by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, Anwar had led a campaign against his former boss, who has
ruled Malaysia for 17 years.

Astrodome &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Cubs' win &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Win or lose, it's going to be a tough day for the Stottlemyres.
	   Todd Stottlemyre will pitch the first-round AL playoff opener
for Texas on Tuesday night. The opponent? The New York Yankees,
whose pitching coach is his father, Mel.
	   ``I get chill bumps even thinking about it,'' Texas manager
Johnny Oates said Monday during a workout at Yankee Stadium. ``We
always want to do well for our dads. I thought about sitting there,
rooting against your son. I don't know if you can do that.''
	   Two other series start Tuesday, both featuring attractive
pitching matchups.
	   In the NL, Randy Johnson will start for Houston against Kevin
Brown of the San Diego Padres at the Astrodome. In the AL, Pedro
Martinez will pitch for the Boston Red Sox against Jaret Wright at
Cleveland.
	   The other best-of-5 NL series became set when the Chicago Cubs
beat San Francisco 5-3 in a one-game playoff for the wild-card
spot. The Cubs advanced to face Atlanta in Game 1 at Turner Field
on Wednesday.
	   David Wells will pitch for the opener for the Yankees, who set
an AL record with 114 wins. The Rangers' only other playoff
appearance came in 1996, when New York eliminated them in the first
round.
	   Todd Stottlemyre, traded from St. Louis to Texas on July 31, won
at Yankee Stadium in mid-August. The game marked the first time Mel
had watched from a major league dugout when his son pitched.
	   ``He probably knows me as well or better than anybody,'' the
pitcher said of his dad. ``From an emotional standpoint, he
understands me better than anybody. There are no secrets.''
	   When Todd pitched at New York last month, his mother, Jean _
Mel's wife _ felt so uncomfortable that she abandoned her usual
seat in the Yankees' family section so she could cheer for her son.
	   ``I'm hiding my feelings,'' Mel said. ``I'm keeping them to
myself. I'm keeping my family and my feelings out of this.''
	   At Houston, the Astros are thinking this might be the year they
reach the World Series for the first time. A lot of that confidence
is because of Johnson, who went 10-1 after being acquired from
Seattle.
	   ``I'm much more at ease. I still have fun,'' the Big Unit said.
	   The Padres had trouble in September, even though they had no
problem clinching the NL West. In Brown, they have a pitcher who
helped the Florida Marlins win the World Series last year.
	   ``Well, there is no question you never want to struggle coming
into the playoffs. Then again, there have been teams playing great
going into the playoffs and lost four straight or not fared well,''
Brown said. ``And vice versa, a team can come in struggling and
turn it around in a series. You can't read too much into it.''
	   At Jacobs Field, two teams will try to erase the memories of
painful postseasons.
	   The Red Sox have lost 13 straight postseason games since winning
Game 5 of the 1986 World Series. The Indians have not won the World
Series since 1948, coming within a double play grounder of the
title last October at Miami.
	   ``The postseason is an absolutely new ballgame, a clean slate
and you approach it as such,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said.
	   ``Records are 0-0,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said. ``You
start all over.''
	   At Atlanta, the Braves could do little Monday but wait to see
who they would play as the Cubs and Giants met. In fact, some
players weren't even in a rush to find out who won at Wrigley
Field.
	   ``I don't think I'll even watch the game,'' Braves closer Kerry
Ligtenberg said. ``I don't know who to root for. I don't know who I
want to play. I'll just take the night off and relax. I'll probably
be watching `Ally McBeal.'''

	   Since Anwar's arrest, Kuala Lumpur has been rocked by street
protests demanding his release and Mahathir's resignation.
	   On Monday, riot police chased a few thousand pro-reform
activists through the neon-lit streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur as
protesters defied warnings to gather for a second consecutive week
near the courthouse.
	   Chanting ``Reformasi'' or ``Reforms,'' the demonstrators marched
from the courthouse, carrying banners that said, ``Free Anwar.''
	   At least 16 of Anwar's associates have been held under a harsh
security law that allows indefinite imprisonment without trial.
	   Among those present in the courtroom were Anwar's wife, Azizah
Ismail, and his father and father-in-law.
	   Anwar has throughout denied the charges, saying they were
politically motivated.
	   The Attorney-General's office said that all the charges against
Anwar had been based on a police probe into accusations contained
in a book titled ``50 reasons why Anwar cannot become PM.''
	   The book was widely distributed at this year's annual convention
of the governing United Malays National Organization party, where
Anwar's allies had campaigned for political reforms.
	   Anwar's trial is expected to be shifted to the High Court soon.

Chinese dissidents issue plea for peaceful change
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Calling China primed for change, a group of
dissidents is urging Chinese citizens to force the ruling Communist
Party to protect basic freedoms and enact political reforms.
	   In two declarations on civil rights and social justice, the five
campaigners said market-oriented reforms have loosened the party's
totalitarian grip but the communists seem bent on holding on to
power.
	   ``If the authorities continue to cling obstinately to such a
course, mistaking people's patience for acquiescence, people will
reach the limit of endurance and will have every reason to resist
those in power, to remove the shackles imposed upon them,'' said
the tracts, copies of which were released Tuesday by New York-based
Human Rights in China.
	   The declarations _ put together by three academics, a private
businessman and a former Communist Party official _ are part of an
attempt by the persecuted dissident community to use courts, laws
and international rights treaties to make Chinese leaders
accountable.
	   Already police have moved to intimidate the drafters. Two of
them were detained last week for questioning and then released.
Jiang Qisheng, the spokesman for the group, said Tuesday that
police took him to a scenic spot northwest of Beijing and held him
for 24 hours.
	   ``They were concerned about the documents,'' said Jiang, a
doctoral candidate at People's University before he was kicked out
for leading the 1989 democracy demonstrations on Tiananmen Square.
	   In the past 2 1/2 weeks, police have also moved against other
dissidents, especially democracy campaigners trying to set up a
political opposition party.
	   Qin Yongmin and Chen Zhonghe, who were both detained briefly
last week, tried again Tuesday to register Qin's ``China Human
Rights Observer'' but Hubei province officials rejected the
application, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement reported.
	   Courts in Wuhan and Suining cities have also rejected lawsuits
filed in recent weeks by dissidents against security forces
alleging mistreatment, the Information Center reported.
	   Since publishing the declarations through carefully watched
printing houses is unthinkable, Jiang said the group was
photocopying the lengthy documents and passing them on to friends.
	   Human Rights in China has put them on its web sites, but because
those are frequently blocked by China's Internet police, Jiang said
``other ways'' would be found to make use of the computer network.
	   The tracts describe 49 years of communist rule as a horror _
from radical political campaigns that targeted class enemies to
curbs on freedom of religion and the outlawing of private property.
	   ``This is a disgrace to the entire 20th century and to all of
humanity,'' one of the declarations said.

Sosa's spectacular regular season draws to a close
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout including end of race between Sosa and
McGwire &QL; 
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Forget the home run title. There's more
Sammy-mania in store.
	   Sosa lost the greatest home run derby ever, finishing four
behind Mark McGwire with 66. But he helped his Chicago Cubs into
the playoffs for the first time since 1989, and that means more to
him than any individual title.
	   ``I never thought this would happen to me. I'm never going to
forget it,'' said Sosa, who was 2-for-4 in Monday night's 5-3
victory over the San Francisco Giants in the NL wild-card
tiebreaker.
	   After running into the locker room to get his wild-card
champions T-shirt, Sosa went back on to the field to party with his
teammates and adoring fans.
	   ``It felt great. It's been unbelievable,'' he said. ``Tonight, I
forgot about the home run. I just wanted to win.''
	   The whole city of Chicago has had a bad case of Sosa fever this
summer, including Michael Jordan. Chicago's other favorite athlete
showed up to throw out the first pitch Monday wearing a Cubs jacket
and Sosa's No. 21 jersey.
	   Sosa laughed as Jordan honored him with his own, chest-thumping,
finger-kissing salute. Then Sosa hunkered down behind home plate as
Jordan, who played minor league baseball for a season during his
brief retirement from basketball, wound up. But Jordan's throw
sailed far above Sosa's head, and Sosa had to run back to grab the
ball.
	   Jordan walked off the mound laughing as he greeted Sosa with a
hug. The two, who've become friends during Sosa's spectacular
season, walked off the field arm in arm.
	   McGwire's five home runs in his last three games gave him the
home run title. But Sosa said all season he was chasing the
playoffs, and if you ever doubted what was more important, you
weren't listening.
	   ``I've been saying all year that he's `The Man,''' Sosa said
again Sunday. ``(But) Mark McGwire is going to go home ... and
maybe go to the beach. And I'm going to play.''
	   The Chicago fans still held out hope Sosa might catch McGwire.
One fan posted a sign along the first-base line reading, ``Hey
Sammy! Gimme 5!''
	   Sosa fell short in his first at-bat, grounding into a double
play on check swing to end the first inning.
	   ``I cannot go out there and think about hitting home runs,''
said Sosa, who didn't talk before Monday's game. ``I have to get
base hits.''
	   Who'd have thought in spring training _ in May, even _ that Sosa
would have this kind of year? Sure, he had 30-homer seasons the
past few years, but this, this has been, to use one of Sosa's
favorite words, unbelievable.
	   ``They're both pretty humble about what has happened,'' said
Gary Gaetti, who started the season with the Cardinals and finished
with the Cubs. ``It doesn't even look right. It doesn't look right
at all for one guy to have those numbers.''
	   When the year began, the money was on McGwire and Ken Griffey
Jr. to challenge Roger Maris' season record of 61 homers. Sosa, who
trailed McGwire 24-9 in late May, wasn't even on the radar.
	   Then came June 1. Sosa hit two homers off the Florida Marlins,
and he was off on a binge. By the end of the month, he'd hit 20
home runs and the chase for Maris was a three-man race.
	   Since then, it's been all Sammy, all the time. An entire city
thrills to see his little home run hop, and his teammates are
constantly amazed. Even manager Jim Riggleman, who's been asked
hundreds of times what Sosa has meant to the Cubs, can only shake
his head.
	   ``You can't hardly put it into words. It's just been so
unbelievable what he's done,'' Riggleman said. ``He's been huge for
the city, for the organization, for his teammates. It's just been
an unbelievable story, the '98 season, with Sammy Sosa leading the
way.''
	   And nobody's enjoyed it more than Sosa. While McGwire
occasionally chafed under the glare of the spotlight, Sosa would
ask reporters why they didn't have more questions for him.
	   He cracked jokes like a comedian, and was genuinely humbled by
the growing adoration.
	   ``I'll have to say I had a good year,'' he said. ``The
appreciation from everybody makes me satisfied. As a human being,
I'm very happy.''
	   But Sosa's done more than just hit homers. His 158 RBIs led the
majors and fourth-best in NL history. His 416 total bases also led
the majors, as did his 133 runs scored. After starting the season
having never hit a grand slam, he's now hit three.
	   If all of that doesn't add up to an MVP year, Riggleman doesn't
know what does.
	   ``The MVP award is going to be the icing on the cake for him, a
statement of what he's really done,'' Riggleman said. ``In a year
that a man hit 70 home runs, Sammy Sosa is going to win the MVP.
That in itself has to be one of the biggest statements anyone can
ever make about how great a year somebody had.''

Ousted Malaysian deputy premier pleads innocent to charges

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday pleaded innocent to nine charges
of corruption and illegal sex acts, Bernama News Agency reported.
	   Anwar made the plea after being brought to a courthouse early
Tuesday morning for the beginning of what could be a landmark legal
case in this Southeast Asian nation.
	   Anwar was led into the the Jalan Raja Court 15 minutes before it
was scheduled to open and taken into a magistrate's courtroom after
a nearly three-hour wait in the court's judicial lockup.
	   Anwar, arrested on Sept. 20, faces nine counts of corruption and
``unnatural'' sex acts. The punishment for each count could be
several years imprisonment.
	   A tenth charge will be brought against him in another court in a
Kuala Lumpur suburb on Wednesday, said a statement by the
Attorney-General's office.
	   Hundreds of riot policemen threw a ring around the colonial
courthouse building to prevent his supporters from thronging the
area for a glimpse of their leader, who had not been seen since his
arrest.
	   At the time of his arrest, Anwar was marched off by armed police
under the harsh Internal Security Act that allows for imprisonment
without trial.
	   The start of legal proceedings for the corruption and
homosexuality charges were independent of Anwar's detention under
the ISA, the government's law office said.
	   After he was fired on Sept. 2 by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, Anwar had led a campaign against his former boss, who has
ruled Malaysia for 17 years.
	   Since the arrest, Kuala Lumpur has been rocked by street
protests demanding his release and Mahathir's resignation.
	   On Monday, riot police chased a few thousand pro-reform
activists through the neon-lit streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur as
protesters defied warnings to gather for a second consecutive week
near the courthouse.
	   Chanting ``Reformasi'' or ``Reforms,'' the demonstrators marched
from the courthouse, carrying banners that said, ``Free Anwar.''
	   At least 16 of Anwar's associates have been held under the ISA.
Nearly 300 people were detained in the series of protests. Many of
them, have however, been released.
	   Among those present in the courthouse were Anwar's wife, Azizah
Ismail, and his father and father-in-law.
	   Anwar has throughout denied the charges, saying they were
politically motivated.
	   The Attorney-General's office said that all the charges against
Anwar had been based on a police probe into accusations contained
in a book titled ``50 reasons why Anwar cannot become PM.''
	   The book was widely distributed at this year's annual convention
of the governing United Malays National Organization party where
Anwar's allies had campaigned for political reforms.
	   Anwar's trial is expected to be shifted to the High Court soon.

One killed when strong earthquake rocks Indonesian islands

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with deaths, damage; CHANGES overline

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At least one person was killed when a
magnitude 6.3 earthquake demolished or damaged at least 100 houses
on the eastern end of the main island of Java, officials said
Tuesday.
	   Monday night's quake was centered beneath the Indian Ocean and
was also felt on the neighboring tourist island of Bali, where
there were no immediate reports of damage.
	   The worst hit area was the district of Malang on Java, about 650
kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta, where a 35-year-old woman
was found dead under the ruin of her flattened house.
	   A local government official, Sucipto Hadi, said some people had
been injured, but the number was not immediately available.
	   He said 38 houses had collapsed and 62 others were damaged.
	   Many residents feared that aftershocks could bring down their
houses and slept in the open overnight.
	   The Department of Meteorology and Geophysics said the quake was
centered beneath the ocean floor about 89 kilometers (55 miles)
south of Blitar, the hometown and gravesite of Indonesia's founding
President Sukarno.
	   ``I've never felt anything like it in my life. I and my family
were shocked. Everything was shaking for a couple of minutes,''
said Endah, a telephone operator in Blitar.
	   The quake was felt over a wide area, including in Denpasar on
Bali, where residents said it lasted only a few seconds.
	   The department said the quake was recorded at 8:34 p.m. (1340
GMT) Monday.
	   Seismologists said a series of four other undersea quakes,
ranging in magnitude from 4.5 to 5, were recorded Monday night
south of Talud island, about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles)
northeast of Jakarta. There were no immediate reports of injuries
or damage.
	   A magnitude 6 earthquake can cause severe damage if centered in
an urban area. A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which sits on the so-called
Pacific ``Ring of Fire,'' a series of volcanoes and fault lines
that stretches from North America through Japan and Southeast Asia
to the South Pacific.

Philippine Airlines workers protest management-union accord
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ About 1,000 Philippine Airlines
workers demonstrated at the Department of Labor and then marched to
the presidential palace Tuesday to protest their union's approval
of a management-proposed plan to reopen the national flag-carrier.
	   The agreement with management, reached Monday by a majority of
the union's board, was brokered by Labor Secretary Bienvenido
Laguesma and President Joseph Estrada.
	   Asia's oldest airline, which owes creditors dlrs 2.1 billion,
closed last Wednesday after failing to convince its ground crew
union to accept the rescue plan. Its closure left much of the
Philippines without air service.
	   The board agreed to accept a 10-year suspension of the union's
collective bargaining agreement in exchange for continued
management recognition of the union and a guarantee of no cuts in
salaries or health benefits.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with its radical
wing saying a suspension of the CBA would violate workers' rights
and expose them to management abuses.
	   Abel Capili, a union board member opposed to the plan, said
protesters prefer a government takeover of PAL or a moratorium on
strikes of up to 10 years, but not a CBA suspension.
	   ``They are asking us to jump into a fire or a sea full of
sharks. We're given no other options,'' Capili said.
	   The agreement must still be formally approved by workers,
regulators and PAL's creditors. The union will hold a signature
campaign on Wednesday in which workers will be asked to sign their
names if they support the plan, union president Alex Barrientos
said.
	   A majority of the nearly 7,000 union members must approve the
agreement, he said.
	   The recovery plan would give workers 20 percent of the company's
stock in exchange for the 10-year suspension of their collective
bargaining agreement.
	   PAL officials said they can restart domestic flights on Oct. 7
and international flights two weeks later if the workers approve
the agreement.
	   PAL has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency crisis. It
says creditors have insisted on the CBA suspension before they will
accept a restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Estrada flew to the central Philippines on Monday aboard an
inaugural domestic flight by Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways,
which he enlisted to help fill the vacuum left by PAL's closure.
	   Air force planes have also been enlisted to fly vital cargo,
including medicine, mail and newspapers.
	   Estrada says the government is unable to take over PAL because
there is no money in public coffers to underwrite daily losses of
up to 45 million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization and refleeting program, greatly inflating the
amount of money it must repay to overseas creditors.
	   The Philippine flag carrier also was badly crippled by a 22-day
pilots' strike in June.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday pleaded innocent to nine charges
of corruption and illegal sex acts, Bernama news agency reported.
	   Anwar, who, according to a lawyer, had visible bruises from
police violence, made the plea after being brought to a courthouse
early in the morning for the beginning of what could be a landmark
legal case in this Southeast Asian nation.
	   A defense lawyer said that the 51-year-old politician, who is
leading a campaign against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
17-year-rule, had asked the court for an independent medical
examination.
	   Anwar replied ``Not guilty, I claim trial'' as each charge was
read out before Judge Hasnah Hashim.
	   Among those present in the courthouse were Anwar's wife, Azizah
Ismail, and his father and father-in-law.
	   Anwar was led into the the Jalan Raja Court 15 minutes before it
was scheduled to open and taken into a magistrate's courtroom after
a nearly three-hour wait in the court's judicial lockup.
	   Anwar, arrested on Sept. 20, faces nine counts of corruption and

	   The start of legal proceedings for the corruption and

the ISA, the government's law office said.
	   After he was fired on Sept. 2 by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, Anwar had led a campaign against his former boss, saying
Malaysia needed a more liberal and clean government.
	   Since his arrest, Kuala Lumpur has been rocked by street
protests demanding his release and Mahathir's resignation.
	   On Monday, riot police chased a few thousand pro-reform
activists through the neon-lit streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur as

One Nation calls police to evict media from meeting

<TEXT>
	   GATTON, Australia (AP) _ The right-wing populist One Nation
party's chief strategist and New South Wales Senate candidate,
David Oldfield, called police to the party's official campaign
launch Tuesday to kick out reporters.
	   The media had refused to leave the senior citizens' center at
Gatton, west of Brisbane, after party officials failed to release
promised documents spelling out how its programs would be paid for.
	   Oldfield told about 150 supporters he had called police to evict
about 25 journalists.
	   Following the formal proceedings, during which One Nation Leader
Pauline Hanson delivered a party statement predominantly about
jobs, Oldfield asked reporters to leave the hall.
	   The media complied with the request but went back inside when
promised policy costing documents were not produced.
	   In July, Hanson had a reporter and photographer ejected from a
news conference and launched an attack on the media, saying she was
fed up with ``biased reporting.''
	   The independent member of Parliament from Queensland spoke at a
news conference at her electorate office after having a reporter
and photographer from The Queensland Times escorted from the
building by security guards.
	   Hanson told about 20 reporters she had the Queensland Times
journalists evicted because she believed biased reporting by the

Vietnamese Prime Minister: Agriculture vital to stability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's Prime Minister believes
agricultural and rural development are the keys to avoiding the
social unrest Asia's economic crisis has sparked in some nations,
state-run media reported Tuesday.
	   ``Our social economic situation will face unforeseen
difficulties if we don't have a stable agricultural and rural
foundation,'' Prime Minister Phan Van Khai was quoted as saying by
Nan Danh newspaper.
	   His comments come as recently released economic statistics show
the economic crisis is taking a toll on Vietnam's economy, with
exports and foreign direct investment plummeting this year.
	   Khai said food security would allow Vietnam to advance, despite
adversity, by keeping farmers happy.
	   ``Rural stability is vital to national security,'' he said.
	   An economic crisis that started in Thailand in 1997 and spread
rapidly across Asia has hit some countries in the region
particularly hard.
	   Riots in Indonesia helped topple the 32-year authoritarian rule
of former President Suharto. Demonstrations have erupted in
Malaysia over the firing of Anwar Ibrahim, formerly the deputy
premier, who differed with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad over
economic policy.
	   Khai outlined a series of measures to limit the effects of the
downturn and keep Vietnam stable. The Communist Party has ruled the
country with little challenge for decades.
	   The measures include tight financial and monetary policy,
promotion of investment and exports and speeding up administrative
reform.
	   Khai said Vietnam's gross domestic product growth was 6.1 to 6.3
percent for the first nine months of this year, down from the
average annual growth of 8.5 percent from 1991-1997. Foreign
economists expect GDP growth to be about 4-5 percent for 1998.
	   The country's exports to Southeast Asia have dropped by 26
percent so far this year. Direct foreign investment is expected to
fall this year to about dlrs one billion from dlrs 2.4 billion in
1997.
	   In 1999, Vietnam could receive as little as 500 million dlrs in
actual, as opposed to pledged, foreign investment, the Asian
Development Bank said Friday.
	   Total export growth has slowed to about 4 percent, down from
about 22 percent in 1997.
	   Khai said Vietnam has lost dlrs 800 million so far this year
because of lower prices on the world market for its main export
items such as crude oil, seafood, garments and rubber.

Quake rumor empties buildings, schools in northern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGUIO, Philippines (AP) _ A rumor that a major earthquake would
hit Tuesday in Baguio, a mountain city devastated by a quake eight
years ago, caused panic among residents, emptying many schools and
buildings.
	   Streets were filled with people, including parents rushing to
schools to pick up their children, as the rumored 11 a.m. time for
the earthquake drew near.
	   Felizardo Gacad Jr. of the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources said Baguio residents remain traumatized by the
earthquake that struck in 1990.
	   Nearly 2,000 people, many of them in Baguio, were killed when a
magnitude 7.7 earthquake rocked the northern Philippines on July
16, 1990.
	   Guests at the Prime Hotel, one of the buildings damaged in that
quake, waited on the sidewalk Monday as the rumored time came and
went.
	   Some schools suspended classes and then tried to recall the
students, but parents refused to send their children back into the
classrooms.
	   One worried mother, told by a reporter that no way has been
discovered to predict an earthquake, said, ``I don't care. I just
want to be sure my children are safe.''
	   Even college students at the University of Baguio, where many
were killed in the 1990 earthquake, left their classrooms.
Authorities later announced classes at the university would resume
in the afternoon.
	   The rumor spread early Tuesday from the village of Urbano where
local village watchmen went house-to-house warning residents,
saying a foreign television news network had reported that an
earthquake would strike Baguio.
	   In a radio broadcast from Manila, Raymundo Punongbayan, chief of
the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, tried to
calm Baguio residents.
	   ``Let us not believe those things,'' he said. ``There is no
person, no instrument or technique that can predict an earthquake.
If we believe those things, we will really be traumatized.''
	   He lamented the low level of scientific knowledge even among
school teachers.

Sun, sand and solitude beckon for McGwire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By R.B. FALLSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire is tired of hitting baseballs. Now
it's time to hit the beach.
	   On Monday, that was the destination of the 70-homer man, back in
Southern California after carrying the burden of unreal
expectations for six months and then achieving something few could
have imagined.
	   ``I'm like in awe of myself,'' McGwire said.
	   Why not? This year, everybody else in baseball played in his
huge shadow.
	   ``He's provided moment after moment after moment after moment,''
St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. ``It's been
unbelievable theater.''
	   And now he'll steal some time for himself. Don't look for
McGwire to be hawking shaving cream or pickup trucks, or having a
book ghost-written, or to be spending time on the banquet circuit.
	   ``He's going to be real hard to find,'' La Russa said.
	   McGwire's needs are simple: He wants to spend a lot more time
with his 10-year-old son, Matthew, who lives most of the year in
California with McGwire's ex-wife. Maybe he'll get to tool around
in the 1962 red Corvette which has been sitting in his garage since
he broke Roger Maris' home run record.
	   And oh yes, he'll try to work on that pasty complexion.
	   ``I don't have a tan,'' McGwire said. ``So they'll say, `Who's
the guy from the East Coast?' ''
	   Of the numerous endorsement offers he's already received,
McGwire said, ``Nothing's really turning my crank.''
	   ``I won't allow anything to take me away from my winter,'' he
said. ``I don't do any personal appearances. If you get caught up
into that stuff, the next thing you know it's spring training, and
I don't want that to happen.''
	   He's definitely against seeing a movie made about the season.
	   ``The whole country already saw the movie, so why would they
want to do one?'' McGwire said. ``They saw the whole thing
happening. That's the real thing, there's no Hollywood get-up.''
	   Since arriving in St. Louis on July 31, 1997, McGwire has had
enough attention for an entire career. September was a blur of
sellout crowds standing in anticipation and seldom leaving
disappointed.
	   He scaled a Mount Everest of homers, with their distance this
year alone totaling an estimated 29,598 feet (9021 meters). He was
an equal-opportunity destroyer, hitting them off 65 pitchers.
	   His good-natured duel with Sammy Sosa enthralled fans down the
stretch. McGwire ended his season four ahead of Sosa.
	   All this, despite McGwire's strict, almost religious adherence
to the strike zone. During one frustrating stretch, La Russa
predicted McGwire would top Babe Ruth's 1923 record of 170 walks by
Sept. 1. McGwire ended at 162 walks, one for every game of the
season.
	   McGwire earned every bit of the dollar-a-head bonus the
Cardinals gave him for every paying customer past 2.8 million,
leading the team to a franchise attendance record of 3,195,021.
	   And when the pressure was on, he got even better. After Sosa
tied him at 66, McGwire hit five homers in his final 11 at-bats.
	   ``I've amazed myself that I've stayed in such a tunnel for so
long throughout what I had to deal with as far as the media, the
expectations, almost every eye in the country watching,'' McGwire
said.
	   Led by McGwire, the Cardinals won 11 of their final 14 games and
finished 83-79, 10 wins better than last year but 19 games behind
Houston, the NL Central champion.
	   ``What the second half shows is a lot about the 1998 team and a
little bit about 1999,'' La Russa said.
	   At the top of the offseason shopping list for general manager
Walt Jocketty is a proven shortstop (Barry Larkin?) and a No. 1
starter (Andy Benes?). The Cardinals needed a closer, but may have
discovered one in Juan Acevedo, who finished the year with 15 saves
and 16 consecutive scoreless outings.
	   Outfielder Brian Jordan and second baseman Delino DeShields both
can be free agents, and both may leave. Jordan, despite a strong
comeback season from wrist and back injuries with a .316 average,
has been expendable since the Cardinals chose J.D. Drew in the
first round of June's amateur draft.
	   Drew certainly looked ready to step in and be a star in
September with a pair of two-homer games, a .417 average and 13
RBIs in only 36 at-bats.
	   DeShields made dlrs 3 million this season and the Cardinals,
especially if they can acquire Larkin from Cincinnati, might have
to get by with lower-paid talent such as Pat Kelly or Placido
Polanco.
	   Whatever the Cardinals do, they know McGwire wants to return to
the postseason for the first time since 1992 with Oakland.
	   ``Without a doubt, everybody plays this game to get a team to
the playoffs and World Series,'' McGwire said. ``Maybe next year.''

Indian, Pakistani soldiers trade fire; nine intruders killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ At least nine armed men allegedly trying to
cross into Indian territory from Pakistan were killed as Indian and
Pakistani border guards exchanged fire for an hour Tuesday,
officials said.
	   The men started firing at paramilitary soldiers when challenged
and Indian posts returned fire, a spokesman of the Border Security
Force told The Associated Press.
	   The spokesman, on customary condition of anonymity, said
Pakistani troops along the border also started firing to give cover
to the intruders.
	   The post is in the Ramgarh area about 50 kilometers (31 miles)
southwest of Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu-Kashmir state.
	   New Delhi regularly accuses Pakistan of arming Muslim guerrillas
and letting them sneak across the border with India to help the
nine-year-old insurgency in Indian-held Kashmir, the only
Muslim-majority state in this predominately Hindu country.
	   Officially Islamic Pakistan denies the charge, saying it only
gives ideological support to the dozens of rebel groups in Kashmir
who are fighting Indian forces for freedom or a merger with
Pakistan.

Parliament session delayed as Cambodian parties negotiate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The official opening of Cambodia's
parliament will be delayed as the nation's sparring political
parties negotiate over who will control key positions in the
assembly, a prominent politician said Tuesday.
	   The National Assembly, scheduled to convene on Wednesday after a
ceremonial opening last week, will probably not hold an official
session until early next week because the agenda has yet to be set,
said Chan Ven, deputy secretary general of the last parliament.
	   Chan Ven said he hoped the agenda would be decided by Cambodian
leader Hun Sen's party and the main opposition party FUNCINPEC, led
by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, during working group sessions set to
begin Tuesday afternoon at the National Assembly building.
	   ``The next meeting of the parliament depends totally on a
consensus being reached by the two parties. No one has the legal
power to reconvene or postpone,'' Chan Ven said.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the July 26
election, claiming 64 seats of the 122 seats in parliament, a
majority but not the two-thirds needed to form a government.
	   FUNCINPEC, the winner of 43 seats, has claimed that Hun Sen's
victory was achieved through fraud and intimidation. It has
resisted forming a coalition government with its rival until the
allegations are thoroughly investigated.
	   Hun Sen's party said Tuesday that the first priority of the
working group will be to reach an agreement on the leadership
positions in the National Assembly, including the parliament's
presidency, coveted by both the ruling party and the opposition.
	   ``We will discuss how to form the structure of the National
Assembly,'' CPP negotiator Sok An said. ``If we can succeed, after
this we will discuss about the government.''
	   A quick agreement between the ruling party and the opposition
appeared doubtful as both have already failed to agree on the
participation in the talks of the junior opposition party led by
former finance minister Sam Rainsy, winner of 15 seats in
parliament.
	   Sok An said the CPP expected the talks to be limited to the two
major parties, but the opposition has contended that all three were
invited to the talks last week held at the end of negotiations led
by King Norodom Sihanouk, the country's constitutional monarch.
	   A Sam Rainsy Party spokesman said its delegation would show up
at the parliament and expected to attend.
	   ``FUNCINPEC wants us there so we decided to go,'' spokesman Rich
Garella said.

	   MOSUL, Iraq (AP) _ People in Mosul have their own theory on why
their 838-year-old downtown mosque tower bends like a banana: It is
making a graceful bow to Islam's Prophet Mohammed.
	   Iraqi antiquity officials cite more scientific reasons for the
tilt of the Nurid mosque's minaret, and fear that without quick
restoration it may eventually collapse into a pile of bricks.
	   The 165-foot (50-meter) tower is now eight feet (2.44 meters)
off perpendicular and the government has ordered urgent studies on
how to stop the tilt. By comparison, the famous tower of Pisa leans
13 feet (4 meters).
	   Mosul University's Engineering Consultancy Bureau is formulating
a plan for the minaret _ known as al-Hadba, ``the humped'' _ that
has brought fame to this city 250 miles northwest of Baghdad.
	   ``We want to reverse man's and nature's doing against the
historic structure,'' said Mouyyad Damerji, a senior antiquities
official.
	   The bombs that hit Mosul during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war _ soon
after an Italian company finished restoring the minaret _ broke
underground pipes, allowing sewage to collect in pools and weaken
the soil under the minaret.
	   Since the Fondedile firm of Rome shored up the minaret in 1981,
it has leaned an extra 16 inches (40 centimeters).
	   Various theories are offered for why the minaret started to tilt
in the first place, probably shortly after it was built in 1160.
	   While some say steady northwesterly winds were the cause, others
blame weak gypsum used to hold the bricks together. Damerji
maintains the sun was the culprit.
	   The cylindrical minaret is encased in baked bricks and the ones
exposed to the sun expanded, crunching those in the shade until the
whole trunk leaned south, he said.
	   The local story about the minaret bowing to Mohammed is based on
faith, not fact. Mohammed never visited Iraq _ and he died more
than 500 years before the minaret was built.
	   The minaret is at the northwest corner of a mosque ordered built
by Nureddeen Zengi, a 12th-century Turkish ruler of Mosul.
	   Mosque and minaret sit along a busy street and among rickety,
200-year-old houses, themselves standing at precarious angles.
Running between the alleyways _ and descending towards the minaret
_ are rivulets of gray water.
	   The mosque is a square, plain affair not as pretty as its
minaret. The minaret's inner layer is made with stone bricks and
its exterior is decorated with mud bricks set in a stitch-like
patterns.
	   Now, the minaret's body shows spidery cracks and the small,
white-plastered dome has gaps one can wedge a fist in.
	   The tilt is so alarming that a sheik no longer climbs up to give
the call to prayer from the top. Still, children climb the steep,
interior staircases in daily acts of bravery, and men go up for the
view over Mosul and the River Tigris.
	   Trying to stop the minaret's leaning, the Italian company
Fondedile planted steel braces inside with underpinnings that
branch off below ground like tree roots.
	   The company, which has since folded, used the same technique in
the 1960s to save the Burano bell tower in Venice, which inclines
nearly five feet off perpendicular.
	   Damerji says saving the minaret could take less than a year if
it only involved hardening the surrounding soil with concrete. The
work would take far longer ``if we have to open it up, take the
bricks out one by one and number them.''
	   ``We will work to maintain this structure and strengthen its
base so it does not move again for many generations to come, God
willing,'' he said.

	   DHAKA, Bangladsh (AP) _ Supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina and an estranged ally fought with bombs and revolvers on the
outskirts of the Bangladesh capital, killing at least one person
and injuring 150, police said Tuesday.
	   Police said Monday's clash lasted nearly three hours. It
reportedly started when Hasina's supporters manhandled activists of
the Jatiya Party, led by former President Hussain Mohammed Ershad
in Narayanganj, 16 kilometers (10 miles) east of Dhaka.
	   The injured included four policemen.
	   Ershad's party quit the governing alliance four months ago. He
has been demanding that an all-party national government replace
Hasina's coalition.

New Age guru Ira Einhorn faces start of new extradition test

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Under a renewed threat of extradition to
the United States, American fugitive Ira Einhorn was to make his
case Tuesday for a court to set him free from a second stint in
jail.
	   The hearing was the start of a new effort by U.S. justice to end
the nearly two-decade-long flight of Einhorn, once at the vanguard
of the 1960s New Age movement and wanted for the 1977 murder of his
girlfriend.
	   Einhorn, 57, was sentenced in absentia to life in prison in
Pennsylvania for the murder of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux -- a crime he
denies even though police found her corpse stuffed in a trunk in
his closet.
	   But in December a French court refused to extradite Einhorn,
arrested earlier that year in southwest France, one of his many
homes while on the run.
	   The ruling, based on a French law that would have required
Einhorn be retried in Pennsylvania, infuriated U.S. lawmakers and
Maddux's friends and family.
	   At the time, Pennsylvania did not allow for such retrials. But
this year authorities there passed a law that would give Einhorn a
new trial if extradited.
	   The United States has since filed a second extradition request
and Einhorn was re-arrested on Sept. 20.
	   Einhorn, whose trademark was dirty clothes and an unkempt beard,
was a prominent anti-war campaigner in the 1960s.
	   Known as ``The Unicorn'' because his name means ``one horn'' in
German, he was courted by an international network of scientists,
corporate sponsors and wealthy benefactors drawn to his vision of a
New Age. He became a consultant for Bell Telephone of Pennsylvania
and was later a Harvard fellow.
	   Maddux, a former cheerleader from Tyler, Texas, repeatedly tried
to end her relationship with Einhorn, friends said. When she
disappeared, Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.
	   But when neighbors 18 months later told police of a stench
coming from Einhorn's apartment, her battered remains were found.
Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.
	   Weeks before he was due to be tried, Einhorn -- granted bail
after wealthy contacts packed a courtroom to vouch for his
character -- fled the United States.
	   Using a false name, he went to Ireland, later to Sweden and
finally France, where he lived in a centuries-old converted mill in
the town of Champagne-Mouton, near Bordeaux, in the heart of French
wine-growing country.
	   It was there that police tracked him down.
	   Neighbors said they thought Einhorn, then sporting a clean-cut
look, was a British author seeking seclusion.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's strategic missile forces launched a
Kosmos class military satellite on Tuesday from a remote northern
base, officials said.
	   The satellite was launched atop a Molnia-M booster rocket at
3:41 am Moscow time Tuesday (2341 GMT Monday) from the Plesetsk
launching pad, the strategic forces command said, according to
Russian news agencies.
	   The terse statement said only that the satellite would be used
``in the interests of Russia's defense ministry'' and contained no
further details.
	   The Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 500 kilometers (312 miles) below
the Arctic Circle in northwestern Russia, is used mostly for
military satellite launches.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Unionized employees called off a
strike at South Korea's nine major banks Tuesday after reaching a
deal with management on the size and terms of layoffs.
	   With the eleventh-hour agreement, some 35,000 employees returned
to their jobs, some in time for regular opening hours, others a few
hours later.
	   By early afternoon, nearly all branch offices of the nine banks
were back in normal operation.
	   ``We apologize to the people for causing trouble, however
briefly,'' said Chu Won-su, head of the Korea Federation of Bank
and Financial Unions.
	   Chu's group called the nationwide strike after overnight talks
broke down. But the strike immediately fizzled when employees at
seven of the nine banks accepted management offers.
	   Later, representatives of the umbrella group reopened talks with
management and reached a deal covering employees at all nine banks
that superseded the earlier individual agreements.
	   The settlement will allow the banks to cut manpower by 32
percent by the end of the year, with dismissed workers getting
additional severance pay equal to 11 months of salary.
	   The unions initially demanded that the layoffs be spread over
three years with greater financial compensation.
	   They backed down when management agreed to drop all lawsuits
against labor leaders accused of organizing illegal union
activities.
	   The nine financially shaky banks have been ordered by the
government to restructure or face closure or merger. A key part of
the restructuring involves layoffs.
	   Five banks were closed earlier this year as part of a
restructuring process South Korea promised in exchange for a dlrs
58 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
	   South Korean banks maintained cozy relations with past
military-backed governments. Their lending was frequently affected
by political and government policies.
	   When dozens of financially weak businesses collapsed late last
year, many banks were left with piles of non-performing loans. That
eroded investor confidence, fueling a flight of foreign capital.

Report: Japan criticizes U.S. over Pentagon security accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's top government spokesman criticized the
United States on Tuesday for its handling of an accident at the
Pentagon in which Japan's defense minister was slightly injured, a
news report said.
	   ``The cause (of the accident) still has not been made clear, and
those involved haven't been dealt with,'' Kyodo News agency quoted
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka as telling a Cabinet meeting.
	   Defense Agency Director General Fukushiro Nukaga injured his
ankle Sept. 21 when his limousine slammed into a security barricade
that popped up as his motorcade entered the grounds of the
Pentagon.
	   The defense minister ``is the man responsible for the security
of an entire nation, and the incident occurred on route to official
talks. Something should be done under these circumstances,'' Nonaka
was quoted as saying.
	   The U.S. Defense Department has said it would investigate to
find out what caused the barrier to unexpectedly pop up.
	   Five others in the car with Nukaga were also injured in the
accident. All were treated and released from a local hospital.
	   A Cabinet spokesman was unable to confirm the reported remarks.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A moderate lawmaker on Tuesday was selected as
Russia's new tax chief, a Russian news agency reported.
	   Georgy Boos, 35, a member of the parliament's budget affairs
committee, belongs to the pro-government Our Home Is Russia
faction.
	   On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov introduced Boos
to the workers of the State Tax Service as their new chief, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Boos replaces Boris Fyodorov, who was dismissed by President
Boris Yeltsin on Monday.
	   Boos' appointment was not immediately confirmed by Yeltsin's
office.
	   Fyodorov, a strong proponent of free-market reforms, advocated
tough monetary policy and has taken tough action against tax
dodgers in an effort to boost government revenue.
	   He recently suggested that Russia firmly link money supply to
its hard currency reserves as a way to overcome the economic crisis
and opposed those who proposed printing money to pay off state
debts.

Scientists: Antarctic hole back early, and bigger than ever
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ The ozone hole over Antarctica
that lets dangerous ultraviolet light reach the Earth formed early
this year and is bigger than ever, scientists said Tuesday.
	   Preliminary satellite data from the U.S. National Aeronautic and
Space Administration found it is the largest on record at 10.4
million square miles (27 million sq. km.), 5 percent larger than
the previous record set in 1996, the government agency Antarctica
New Zealand said in a statement.
	   The hole is actually an area of thinned ozone, where the gas is
depleted by chemical reactions in air trapped over the South Pole
during the Antarctic winter.
	   Ozone helps block damaging ultraviolet rays from the sun, and
scientists have been concerned that, if it becomes depleted, there
could be an increase in skin cancer and cataracts. Certain
chemicals believed to damage the ozone have been banned, including
the chlorofluorocarbons widely used as aerosol propellants and in
refrigerators and air conditioners.
	   The area of reduced ozone expands at this time of year _ spring
in the Antarctic _ as sunlight returns to that region.
	   Like the 1996 hole, this year it developed more rapidly in late
August and early September than in previous years.
	   The area of reduced ozone covers most of Antarctica.
	   Measured in ``Dobson Units,'' NASA satellites found the ozone
cover fell below 100 units, close to the all-time low of 88 units
measured in 1994, Antarctica New Zealand said.
	   ``The ozone hole has probably reached its greatest area extent
for this year, but the lowest amounts of ozone are likely to be
seen in the next week,'' the statement said.
	   Ozone can normally range from 250 units to more than 500 units
over various parts of the world.
	   The hole, first observed in the 1980s, has reappeared each
Antarctic spring when cold temperatures combine with the sun's rays
to create the conditions for maximum ozone depletion.

Government abandons proposed law on freedom of expression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Single name for Wiranto is correct &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government Tuesday
abandoned a proposed law to control protests and demonstrations
that critics had said would curb newfound freedom of expression
following the end of the authoritarian Suharto regime.
	   Armed forces commander and Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto
announced the withdrawal of the controversial bill at a session of
the 500-member Parliament.
	   The proposed law would have placed limits on the size and scope
of demonstrations, rallies and public gatherings outside the
presidential palace in Jakarta as well as places of worship and
military installations across the nation.
	   It had demanded that organizers of rallies with more than 100
participants obtain prior written permission from the police before
staging a protest.
	   Pro-democracy activists had called on legislators to reject the
bill after it was put forward by Suharto's successor President B.J.
Habibie.
	   Critics say it contradicted repeated claims by Habibie that he
wants to introduce greater democratic freedom and human rights.
	   Habibie came to power in May after Suharto resigned amid riots
and protests over his 32-year authoritarian rule. About 1,200
people were killed in the violence.
	   Since then Habibie himself has been targeted by a series of
protests over the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Wiranto said the government will soon submit an alternative bill
that he said would protect freedom of expression while guaranteeing
law and order.

Japanese stocks, dollar lower in afternoon trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mid-afternoon trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks ended lower Tuesday on growing
concerns over the credit risks of domestic companies. The U.S.
dollar fell against the yen ahead of a Federal Reserve Board policy
meeting.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 87.94 points,
or 0.63 percent, ending the day at 13,821.43. On Monday, the Nikkei
gained 185.53 points, or 1.35 percent.
	   Concerns about credit risks in Japan are growing after news that
Japan Leasing Corp., a nonbank affiliate of the troubled Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., filed for court protection under
bankruptcy laws Sunday.
	   On Tuesday, an auto leasing subsidiary of Japan Leasing also
filed for bankruptcy. LTCB shares ended the day at 14 yen (10
cents), unchanged from Monday's finish.
	   Also, many investors stayed out of the market ahead of a U.S.
Federal Open Market Committee meeting later in the day, traders
said.
	   The FOMC is widely expected to cut U.S. interest rates in a bid
to revive the global economy. Such a move could push New York
stocks higher and have a positive impact on Japanese share prices
as well.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 0.62 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,062.90
points. The TOPIX closed up 13.59 points, or 1.29 percent.
	   In currency trading, strong expectations that the U.S. is set to
reduce interest rates weighed on the dollar for most of the
morning, traders said.
	   The U.S. currency bought 135.24 yen at mid-afternoon, down 0.48
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 135.85 yen overnight. Earlier Tuesday, the currency rose
as high as 136.40 yen.
	   Lower interest rates likely would weaken support for the U.S.
currency in the short term by reducing yields on dollar-denominated
assets.

Chinese courts execute eight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Courts in two Chinese cities have executed eight
people, one of them a 19-year-old who stole 60 yuan (dlrs 7), a
human rights group reported Tuesday.
	   After a mass sentencing rally Monday, the Nine Dragon Hill
district court in southwestern Chongqing city ordered seven people
immediately taken out and shot, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement reported.
	   The group said it learned of the executions from Xu Wanping, a
dissident who spent eight years in prison for taking part in the
1989 democracy movement. Xu reportedly said all district courts in
Chongqing held rallies Monday and about 50 people may have been
executed.
	   The Information Center provided no other details about the
19-year-old and did not mention the crimes of the other six
executed.
	   Also Monday, a court in the southern provincial capital of
Nanchang upheld the death sentence of Zhou Changping, who posed as
an official to cover smuggling and other illegal activities, the
official China Youth News reported. He too was shot after the
hearing.
	   China uses the death penalty more frequently than any other
nation. London-based Amnesty International recorded 1,876
court-ordered executions last year, more than the combined total of
the rest of the world.

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A huge explosion apparently set off
by LP gas blew the front out of a restaurant in Melbourne's eastern
suburbs Tuesday, injuring a man and a woman.
	   With most of Victoria state without natural gas due to a
refinery fire and explosion Friday, restaurants are turning to
bottled LP gas to fuel their stoves.
	   The explosion at Skandies restaurant in Malvern blew the front
of the restaurant onto the road about 2.30pm.
	   A man in his fifties who was working in the area suffered
second-degree burns to his face and arms and was taken by ambulance
to Alfred Hospital, the ambulance service said.
	   A woman waiting in a car while her husband had a haircut
suffered severe shock when the explosion blew out the car's side
window.
	   Metropolitan Ambulance Service group manager Roger Williams said
the woman was sitting almost in line with the explosion and watched
debris fly past her.
	   ``When our guys first arrived they thought someone would have
been killed. It was quite huge,'' Williams said.
	   ``If it had happened with the restaurant full, the injury would
have been quite massive,'' he said.
	   Metropolitan Fire Brigade spokeswoman Heather Stockton said that
two 100-pound (45 kilo) LPG gas cylinders were found at the scene
and were being drenched.

Report: Russian company held employees in cages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A construction company in Russia's northern
Yakutsk region regularly held its employees in cages as a
punishment for poor performance, a Russian news report said.
	   The report by the ITAR-Tass news agency said several dozen
people had suffered the punishment, but only three agreed to
testify against the company's managers.
	   The manager and two assistants have been charged with depriving
people of their freedom and violent behavior, the report said.
	   The manager, whose name was not given, has been previously
convicted of murder and other crimes, the report added. He often
recruited homeless men who were willing to work for food, shelter
and little pay.
	   When one employee tried to warn the police, he vanished and his
body was found three months later, the report said.

	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Under a renewed threat of extradition to
the United States, American fugitive Ira Einhorn was to make his
case Tuesday for a court to set him free from a second stint in a
French jail.
	   The hearing was the start of a new effort by U.S. justice to end
the nearly two-decade-long flight of Einhorn, once at the vanguard
of the 1960s New Age movement and wanted for the 1977 murder of his
girlfriend.
	   A date for a hearing on the extradition request was expected to
be set at Tuesday's session, and is likely a couple months away,
according to Einhorn's French attorney, Dominique Delthil.
	   Tuesday's hearing was to be devoted to Einhorn's request to be
freed from jail, Delthil said, expressing confidence. ``We have a
very good dossier,'' he said.

Top defense official demoted over scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a largely symbolic gesture of contrition, a top
Japanese defense official was demoted Tuesday to take
responsibility for a scandal centered around overpayment for
military equipment.
	   The scandal has led to the arrests of two former senior Defense
Agency officials as well as nine executives and senior officials at
major Japanese electronics maker NEC Corp. and its affiliate, Toyo
Communication Equipment Co.
	   They are suspected of arranging a reduction in reimbursement to
the Defense Agency for the purchase of military equipment in return
for plush jobs at the affiliate for retiring defense officials.
	   Masayuki Fujishima, director of the Secretariat at the agency,
was demoted to counselor, Defense Agency chief Fukushiro Nukaga
told reporters. The Secretariat's director acts as a coordinator on
defense matters. His post is one of the highest at the agency.
	   The Defense Agency also demoted two deputy heads at its central
procurement office.
	   Fujishima was among several agency officials who were questioned
by prosecutors earlier this month on suspicion of allegedly burning
or hiding agency documents that were key evidence in the scandal.
	   Also Tuesday, Nukaga told a parliamentary committee that the
agency will ask the NEC affiliate to return the overcharge to the
agency. Prosecutors say it totals nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 12.5
million).
	   The key figure in the scandal is Kenichi Ueno, former deputy
director of procurement at the agency, who was arrested Sept. 3 on
suspicion of conspiring with others to trim the reimbursement.

Military not opposed to Megawati's party congress in Bali
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian military said Tuesday
it was not opposed to a planned gathering of a political faction
led by opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri next month on the
tourist island of Bali.
	   However, Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto said the organizer
of the mass gathering should be able to guarantee security and
order, considering Bali's role as the main Indonesian destination
for foreign tourists.
	   Wiranto's signal came as the organizers, defying threats from
police, vowed to go ahead with the three-day meeting with or
without a permit from authorities.
	   Thousands of supporters and a number of foreign diplomats are
expected to attend the congress of Megawati's faction of the
Indonesian Democratic Party, or PDI.
	   The Oct. 8-10 meeting will be held at a beach resort hotel on
the ``Island of the Gods,'' known as a major source of badly needed
foreign exchange.
	   The armed forces have ``no objection to the congress as long as
Megawati can guarantee the security there since Bali is a lucrative
tourism site and source of government income,'' Wiranto said.
	   The government has suggested Megawati move the congress amid
fears of violence that could scare away foreign tourists.
	   Bali is a Hindu enclave in otherwise Muslim-dominated Indonesia,
now enduring its worst economic downturn in decades.
	   Megawati, the eldest daughter of Sukarno, Indonesia's founding
president, downplayed the prospect of trouble in Bali, saying her
supporters, mostly common people, were not rioters.
	   She was ousted from the party in June 1996 by a rebel party
congress sponsored by the government. Dozens of her supporters were
killed or injured in a clash with police and troops in the capital,
Jakarta, the following month.
	   She accused former President Suharto of being behind her ouster
and maintained she was still the legal party chairwoman.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, still refuses to
recognize Megawati as the PDI chief.

Vietnamese prime minister: Agriculture vital to stability
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name of newspaper, graf 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's prime minister believes
agricultural and rural development are the keys to avoiding the
social unrest Asia's economic crisis has sparked in some nations,
state-run media reported Tuesday.
	   ``Our social economic situation will face unforeseen
difficulties if we don't have a stable agricultural and rural
foundation,'' Prime Minister Phan Van Khai was quoted as saying by
the newspaper Hanoi Moi.
	   Recently released statistics show the region's economic crisis
is taking a toll on Vietnam's economy, with exports and foreign
direct investment plummeting this year.
	   Khai said food security would allow Vietnam to advance, despite
adversity, by keeping farmers happy.
	   ``Rural stability is vital to national security,'' he said.
	   An economic crisis that started in Thailand in 1997 and spread
rapidly across Asia has hit some countries in the region
particularly hard.
	   Riots in Indonesia helped topple the 32-year authoritarian rule
of former President Suharto. Demonstrations have erupted in
Malaysia over the firing of Anwar Ibrahim, formerly the deputy
premier, who differed with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad over
economic policy.
	   Khai outlined a series of measures to limit the effects of the
downturn and keep Vietnam stable. The Communist Party has ruled the
country with little challenge for decades.
	   The measures include tight financial and monetary policy,
promotion of investment and exports and speeding up administrative
reform.
	   Khai said Vietnam's gross domestic product growth was 6.1 to 6.3
percent for the first nine months of this year, down from the
average annual growth of 8.5 percent from 1991-1997. Foreign
economists expect GDP growth to be about 4-5 percent for 1998.
	   The country's exports to Southeast Asia have dropped by 26
percent so far this year. Direct foreign investment is expected to
fall this year to about dlrs 1 billion from dlrs 2.4 billion in
1997.
	   In 1999, Vietnam could receive as little as dlrs 500 million in
actual, as opposed to pledged, foreign investment, the Asian
Development Bank said Friday.
	   Total export growth has slowed to about 4 percent, down from
about 22 percent in 1997.
	   Khai said Vietnam has lost dlrs 800 million so far this year
because of lower prices on the world market for its main export
items such as crude oil, seafood, garments and rubber.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, pleaded innocent Tuesday to nine charges
of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   Anwar, who, according to a lawyer, had visible bruises from
police violence, made the plea after being brought to a courthouse
early in the morning for the beginning of what could be a landmark
legal case in this Southeast Asian nation.
	   A defense lawyer said the 51-year-old politician, who is leading
a campaign against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule,
had asked the court for an independent medical examination.
	   Anwar replied, ``Not guilty, I claim trial,'' as each charge was
read out before Judge Hasnah Hashim.
	   Wearing brown trousers and a checked shirt, Anwar smiled as he
entered the courtroom. He then embraced his wife, Azizah Ismail,
two of his daughters, and his father.
	   Anwar pointed to large bruises above his left eye and on his
neck and rolled up his shirtsleeves to show his family the scars of
police beatings on the first night of his custody, witnesses in the
courtroom said.
	   Asked by someone how long he could withstand police violence,
Anwar replied: ``As long as it takes.''
	   He appeared pleased when his wife showed him copies of
international newsmagazines that had featured cover stories on his
movement.
	   Anwar's case was transferred from the lower sessions court to
the High Court at the prosecutor's request.
	   Anwar was led into the Jalan Raja Court 15 minutes before it was
scheduled to open and taken into a magistrate's courtroom after a
nearly three-hour wait in the court's judicial lockup.
	   Anwar, arrested on Sept. 20, faces nine counts of corruption and
``unnatural'' sex acts. The punishment for each count could be
several years imprisonment.
	   A 10th charge will be brought against him in another court in a
Kuala Lumpur suburb Wednesday, said a statement by the
Attorney-General's office.
	   Reporters jammed the narrow courthouse corridor for a glimpse of
Anwar, but the jailed leader was sneaked into the courtroom through
a back door. Only a few of the reporters could get inside the small
courtroom.
	   Outside, hundreds of riot policemen threw a ring around the
colonial courthouse building to prevent his supporters from
thronging the area for a glimpse of their leader, not seen since
his arrest.
	   At that time, Anwar was marched off by armed police under the
harsh Internal Security Act, which allows for imprisonment without
trial.
	   The start of legal proceedings on the corruption and
homosexuality charges was independent of Anwar's detention under
the ISA, the government's law office said.
	   After he was fired Sept. 2 by the prime minister, Anwar had led
a campaign against his former boss, saying Malaysia needed a more
liberal and clean government.
	   Since his arrest, Kuala Lumpur has been rocked by street
protests demanding his release and Mahathir's resignation.
	   On Monday, riot police chased a few thousand pro-reform
activists through the neon-lit streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur as
protesters defied warnings and gathered for a second consecutive
week near the courthouse.
	   Chanting ``Reformasi,'' or ``Reforms,'' the demonstrators
marched from the courthouse, carrying banners that said, ``Free
Anwar.''
	   At least 16 of Anwar's associates have been held under the ISA.
Nearly 300 people were detained in the series of protests. Many of
them have since been released.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were politically
motivated.
	   The Attorney-General's office said all the charges against Anwar
had been based on a police investigation into accusations contained
in a book titled ``50 reasons why Anwar cannot become PM.''
	   The book was widely distributed at this year's annual convention
of the governing United Malays National Organization party, where
Anwar's allies had campaigned for political reforms.
	   Mahathir has denied that a challenge to his leadership forced
him to fire Anwar, a man he had until last year described as his
successor. He said Anwar's sexual activities were intolerable.
	   ``Anwar's wish was for me to step down so that he would get away
without being tried,'' Mahathir said Tuesday in Parliament, which
met as Anwar was being arraigned in court.

U.S. official calls on Indonesia to honor power plant contracts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior U.S. trade official added
weight Monday to calls for crisis-ridden Indonesia to honor
contracts with independent power producers or risk damaging the
prospects for future foreign investment.
	   ``The important thing to keep in mind is that the way (the
government) resolves this will have a significant bearing on how
quickly it emerges from this'' crisis, Alan Larson, U.S. assistant
secretary of state for economic and business affairs, told a news
conference.
	   The sprawling Southeast Asian nation is enduring its worst
economic crisis in 30 years. Dozens of big infrastructure projects
have been shelved or abandoned.
	   ``When there are contractual obligations, it's important, where
possible, to honor them,'' Larson said. ``When it's impossible to
do that, (renegotiations) must be done in an open, fair and
transparent manner.''
	   Larson, in Jakarta on a five-nation Asian tour, is the latest
U.S. official to urge the Indonesian government to honor the power
plant contracts and be transparent in its negotiations with the
producers.
	   Pushed to the brink of bankruptcy by the rupiah's dramatic
plunge against the dollar last year, state-owned electricity
provider PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara wants to renegotiate payments
or reach agreement to terminate contracts with its 26 independent
power producers.
	   Larson noted that any government moves to unilaterally cancel or
alter payment would bode badly for investor confidence in the
country.
	   ``In other parts of the world, (there's been) a very significant
loss of confidence if it appears the government is pre-emptively''
changing contracts, he said, pointing to Russia as an example.
	   On Monday, former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher
raised the power plant contracts issue when he met President B.J.
Habibie in Jakarta.
	   Christopher is chairman of the executive committee of Edison
International, the parent company of Edison Mission Energy.
	   Edison Mission is leading a consortium building two units of the
giant Paiton electricity complex.
	   The urgency of the negotiations became clearer Tuesday when
Moody's Investors Service downgraded three independent power
projects in Indonesia: CE Indonesia Funding Corp., DSPL Finance
Company B.V. and P.T. Paiton Energy Funding B.V.. It cited PLN and
state energy company Pertamina's failure to pay for electricity.
	   The rating agency concluded that the failure by the government
to honor its support obligations means it's inevitable that similar
contractual breaches will occur in other independent power projects

	   Larson was in Jakarta for one day and was to meet several
government ministers as well as representatives of business and
private organizations.
	   Having praised Thailand and South Korea's implementation of
their International Monetary Fund programs, Larson noted that
Indonesia was further behind in its economic reform program.
	   ``First of all, I think Indonesia is facing a more challenging
situation and it's taking a bit more time,'' he said.
	   He said a team from the U.S. Treasury is in Jakarta to look at
the corporate debt situation. Indonesian corporations are saddled
with some dlrs 80 billion in foreign debt.
	   ``We're trying to examine ways the U.S. can do more,'' he said.

Israelis and tourists flock to Jericho casino
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Standing on his tiptoes, 22-year-old
Leo Elior struggled to catch a glimpse of his luck over a throng of
shoulders crowded around a roulette table.
	   Elior's friend managed to squirm his way to the front before the
wheel was spun to place the bets and relay the results back to him.
	   For thousands of Israelis like Elior, the newly opened Oasis
casino on the outskirts of Jericho has broken a psychological
barrier, bringing them back in droves to a Palestinian city in the
West Bank that Israeli troops left four years ago.
	   Israelis love to gamble, but it is illegal in Israel and until
now they've had to travel outside the region to place a bet.
	   More than 25,000 people have passed through the casino's doors
since it opened 12 days ago. During last week's two-day Jewish New
Year holiday, an overflow crowd lined up on the front steps waiting
to enter.
	   Casino staff had to keep hundreds of people outside, letting
them in one at a time as others left. The Jerusalem-Jericho
highway, a dusty road rarely used anymore by Israelis, was
bumper-to-bumper traffic for several miles (kilometers).
	   On Saturday, drivers needed to park on the casino's access road
after the central lot filled to capacity.
	   Needless to say, management is pleased.
	   ``We are very satisfied with the progress so far,'' said Joanne
Frankel, a casino spokesperson.
	   So satisfied, in fact, that the operator, Casinos Austria of
Vienna, is reportedly considering opening a second casino if
attendance remains high, according to the Israeli daily Maariv. A
casino official declined to comment on the report.
	   The casino, part of a dlrs 150 million resort complex under
construction on the outskirts of this ancient city, is expected to
provide an economic shot in the arm for the Palestinian Authority,
which stands to collect millions in taxes. The resort will
eventually employ 5,000 Palestinians.
	   After the 1987 Palestinian uprising began, Israelis went out of
their way to avoid entering Jericho. As a result of a 1993 peace
agreement, Jericho became an autonomous Palestinian city but the
casino has brought Israelis back.
	   Elior, a mechanic from northern Israel, ventured to the city
last week to check out the new attraction.
	   ``If I lose, it will be my last visit,'' he joked, while waiting
for the results of his latest bet. Elior said he had worried about
security but relaxed once he was inside the casino.
	   Security is tight and the casino said there have been no
problems so far. Mosque preachers have condemned the casino, but
the Islamic militant group Hamas has said it would not take any
violent action against the casino.
	   Cars are stopped and trunks examined when visitors enter the
parking lot. Customers pass through metal detectors before walking
into the gaming area.
	   Still, the new casino has prompted concern from both army
generals and lawmakers.
	   The army said last week it is considering banning career
soldiers from gambling there and the government is trying to figure
out a way to cash in on the business. Members of Israel's
parliament have proposed taxing winnings, although casinos
generally refuse to divulge such information about their customers.
	   When finished, the casino resort will feature hotels, a golf
course, tennis courts and a conference center.

Scientists zeroing in on gene for inherited prostate cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists say they've found the approximate
hiding place of another gene that can give men an inherited
tendency toward prostate cancer.
	   The researchers reported in 1996 that one such gene appears to
be lurking on chromosome 1. They are still looking for that one,
but now they have found evidence that a second vulnerability gene
lies somewhere within a particular region of the X chromosome.
	   That would explain the long-standing observation that a man runs
a higher risk of prostate cancer if he has a brother with the
disease than a father with it. Only the mother passes on the X
chromosome, so any susceptibility gene it contains could be
inherited by two brothers but not pass from father to son.
	   About 10 percent of prostate cancers are blamed on an inherited
vulnerability. The apparent gene on the X chromosome might explain
15 percent to 20 percent of hereditary cases, researchers said.
	   The work was presented in the October issue of the journal
Nature Genetics by five teams of researchers in the United States,
Finland and Sweden. They include William Isaacs of the Johns
Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore and Jeffrey Trent, chief
of the cancer genetics branch at the National Human Genome Research
Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
	   The study included DNA from 360 families who showed signs of
inherited vulnerability to the disease. Researchers analyzed
genetic material from 1,020 family members with the disease and 969
who were either female or men without the disease.

Two injured as LP gas blows out restaurant shop front

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A huge explosion apparently set off
by LP gas blew the front out of a restaurant in Melbourne's eastern
suburbs Tuesday, injuring a man and a woman.
	   With most of Victoria state without natural gas due to a
refinery fire and explosion Friday, restaurants are turning to
bottled LP gas to fuel their stoves.
	   In the explosion at Skandies restaurant in Malvern, a man in his
50s who was working in the area suffered second-degree burns to his
face and arms and was taken by ambulance to Alfred Hospital, the
ambulance service said.
	   A woman waiting in a car while her husband had a haircut
suffered severe shock when the explosion blew out the car's side
window.
	   Metropolitan Ambulance Service group manager Roger Williams said
the woman was sitting almost in line with the explosion and watched
debris fly past her.
	   ``When our guys first arrived they thought someone would have
been killed. It was quite huge,'' Williams said.
	   ``If it had happened with the restaurant full, the injury would
have been quite massive,'' he said.
	   Metropolitan Fire Brigade spokeswoman Heather Stockton said two
100-pound (45-kilogram) LP gas cylinders were found at the scene
and were being drenched.

Report: Russian gets new tax chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: INCORPORATES material from story slugged Russia-Tax Chief &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A moderate lawmaker has been chosen as Russia's
new tax chief and will face the difficult job of raising revenues
from a nation of skilled tax dodgers, a Russian news report said.
	   The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has played a
major role in the current economic crisis. The government has been
running a large budget deficit for years and regularly lacks money
to pay millions of state workers on time.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's government has pledged repeatedly to
improve tax collections, but tax revenues remain well below target.
	   The latest man to take on the unenviable job of tax chief is
Georgy Boos, 35, a member of the parliament's budget affairs
committee and the pro-government Our Home Is Russia faction.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov on Tuesday introduced Boos
to the workers of the State Tax Service as their new chief, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Boos replaces Boris Fyodorov, who was dismissed by President
Boris Yeltsin on Monday. Boos' appointment was not immediately
confirmed by Yeltsin's office.
	   Fyodorov, a strong proponent of free-market reforms, advocated
tough monetary policy and has taken tough action against tax
dodgers in an effort to boost government revenues.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov held talks Tuesday
with regional leaders.
	   Primakov announced Monday that the government had paid off back
wages to the military, and was planning to pay off debts for
student stipends, though he didn't say where the money had come
from. It is unclear exactly what portion of the wages were paid
off.
	   Primakov has made the payment of back wages one of the key goals
of his program to fight the country's punishing financial crisis.
	   The government still lacks a detailed plan to combat the crisis,
but the government has promised to unveil its program in 10 days,
officials said Monday.
	   Government officials said the plan would include greater state
control, and would be ``aimed at protection of the domestic
producer, reforming of the tax system so that producers feel an
easing of the tax burden,'' Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants
said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.

Israel closes Palestinian areas for Day of Atonement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel announced Tuesday that it will seal its
borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the Day of
Atonement, the most important day on the Jewish calendar.
	   The holiday of Yom Kippur begins at sundown Tuesday and ends at
sundown Wednesday. Observant Jews pray, fast and ask God for
forgiveness for their sins.
	   Israel routinely imposes a blanket closure on the West Bank and
Gaza during Jewish holidays to prevent possible terror attacks by
Palestinian militants.
	   On Tuesday morning, markets were crowded with shoppers buying
ingredients for a last afternoon meal before the start of the fast.
	   Security was beefed in the markets and around synagogues and
Jewish holy sites where thousands of Jews were expected to flock
beginning at sundown Tuesday.
	   The closure takes effect at 2 p.m. (noon gmt) Tuesday and will
be lifted at 1 a.m. Thursday (2300 gmt Wednesday), the army said.
It bars the more than 2.5 million Palestinians from entering
Israel, including tens of thousands of workers.
	   Israeli security forces have been on alert since Sept. 11 when
two top fugitives fugitives of the Islamic radical group Hamas were
killed by Israeli troops. Hamas has threatened revenge.

China apparently takes softer line toward Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Taking a softer approach toward rival Taiwan,
China reiterated Tuesday that the island would enjoy more autonomy
than Hong Kong if it agrees to reunify with the mainland.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang emphasized that Beijing
wants talks to end the 49-year split between the mainland and
island peacefully. Under one deal, Taiwan could keep its armed
forces and some of its leaders could join the Beijing government,
Tang said.
	   ``This demonstrates that after reunification, the policy toward
Taiwan will be more flexible than that toward Hong Kong,'' Tang
said at a twice-weekly media briefing.
	   Taiwan so far has rejected the ``one country, two systems''
formula China used in negotiating Hong Kong's return from Britain.
Taiwanese leaders say the island is neither a colony like Hong Kong
nor a rebel province as Beijing sees it, but a separate political
entity.
	   Although the proposals revived by Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
last week and repeated by his spokesman are nearly four years old,
a confluence of interests and events appears to be encouraging
Beijing's more conciliatory approach.
	   Elder statesman representing the two estranged governments are
due to meet in Shanghai in two weeks. If successful, they will
revive a dialogue Beijing shelved three years ago in favor of
launching test-missiles and war games in a display of anger over
Taiwan's perceived drift toward outright independence.
	   President Jiang Zemin is said to be under pressure from
conservatives in the ruling Communist Party and the military to get
Taiwan to agree to reunification talks. With Hong Kong's return
last year and the Portuguese colony of Macau due back next year,
Taiwan remains the last patch of what China calls the
``motherland'' outside of Beijing's control.

Mrs. Clinton heads to South America to boost women
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Lead prospects uncertain &QL; 
 &UR; By CAROLYN SKORNECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is leaving
domestic politics _ and controversies _ behind as she sets off on a
trip to South America aimed at boosting the political and economic
advancement of women.
	   The trip, planned long before Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
issued his report about President Bill Clinton's relationship with
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, will be Mrs. Clinton's first
solo journey abroad since then, although she's already been on the
road 10 days this month.
	   A congressional delegation and administrative officials,
including Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo,
were accompanying her to her first destination, Puerto Rico,
scheduled for late Tuesday afternoon, to tour areas devastated by
Hurricane Georges.
	   Then Mrs. Clinton will head to Santiago, Chile, for the annual
meeting of the first ladies of the Americas, and then on to
Montevideo, Uruguay, for a Vital Voices conference, a U.S. foreign
policy initiative focusing on lifting women's political and
economic roles, expected to draw about 400 women from across the
Western Hemisphere.
	   ``She's been committed to these two speeches for a long time,''
said her chief of staff, Melanne Verveer, rejecting speculation
that Mrs. Clinton was trying to escape the furor over her husband's
affair. ``You don't sort of drop in.''
	   Nevertheless, it will provide a respite.
	   ``She's treated like a rock star'' when she goes overseas, said
Theresa Loar, the State Department's senior coordinator for
international women's issues. ``People take a day off work. When
they see her, they mob the streets and push each other out of the
way to get closer.''
	   In addition, she'll spend some time with the other first ladies,
many of whom know firsthand about straying husbands.
	   ``She'll meet with a very sympathetic audience,'' said Johanna
Mendelson, a scholar in residence at American University with an
extensive background in Latin America. ``Infidelity is a given and
not the exception among politicians.'' The wives, she said, ``have
chosen to accept it as a given of public service.''
	   And like Mrs. Clinton, they take their work seriously.
	   ``The first ladies (in the Western Hemisphere) have gone from a
decorative function just a few years back to a professional role in
a number of ways,'' said Costa Rica-born Muni Figueres of the
Inter-American Development Bank, which is co-sponsoring the Vital
Voices conference. ``There's an empowerment thing going on among
the first ladies. They're beginning to feel they are political
entities on their own.''
	   Mrs. Clinton's larger audience wants her to keep on with her
work, said Hattie Babbitt, deputy administrator of the Agency for
International Development since last December.
	   ``People in the region are ... puzzled that so much attention
and time would be wasted on something like this when there are so
many needs,'' said Babbitt.
	   Said Figueres: ``Latins have a clearer sense of the separation
of personal life from public performance than Americans do.''
	   Even at home, Mrs. Clinton's approval ratings have soared while
her husband's future hangs in the balance. Candidates and causes
seek her out even as they fear drawing too close to the president.
	   The Uruguay conference is the third Vital Voices meeting, and
Mrs. Clinton also spoke at the first two. The first, in July 1997
in Vienna, Austria, drew hundreds of women from 19 countries carved
out of the former Soviet bloc. The second was in Belfast, Northern
Ireland, in early September.

Mayoral election in Russia likely to be declared invalid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ The weekend election for a new mayor
in the eastern port city of Vladivostok will probably be declared
invalid and a new vote will have to be held, an official said
Tuesday.
	   According to preliminary results, more than 50 percent of voters
in Sunday's election rejected all 12 candidates after incumbent
Mayor Viktor Cherepkov and one other candidate were removed from
the ballot at the last minute.
	   Official results are expected Oct. 1, but preliminary results
show the vote was invalid because of the massive ``no'' vote, Ilya
Grinchenko, head of the City Electoral Commission, said Tuesday.
	   A city court ruled Thursday that Cherepkov could not run because
he had illegally paid for his campaign with city money, while city
official Vladimir Murashov was barred because of anti-Semitic
statements.
	   The decision to remove Cherepkov outraged voters. He was widely
expected to win the race, and many saw the move as a politically
motivated attack by his enemies in the regional government.

bankruptcies made investors more nervous. The U.S. dollar fell
against the yen on expectations of lower American interest rates.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 87.94 points,
or 0.63 percent, closing at 13,821.43. On Monday, the Nikkei had
gained 185.53 points, or 1.35 percent.
	   The dollar bought 134.42 yen in late afternoon, down 1.30 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and sharply below its late New York level
of 135.85 yen overnight. Earlier Tuesday, the currency climbed as
high as 136.40 yen before plunging as low as 134.10 yen.
	   Investors moved to sell stocks after news that Japan Leasing
Corp., an affiliate of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
Ltd., filed for court protection under bankruptcy laws Sunday.
	   Further discouraging them, an auto leasing subsidiary of Japan
Leasing said Tuesday it also filed for bankruptcy. LTCB shares
closed at 14 yen (10 cents), unchanged from Monday's finish.
	   Masaaki Higashida of Nomura Securities said the investment
environment has become more severe with deflationary pressure and
worsening corporate earnings.
	   Also, many investors stayed out of the market ahead of a U.S.
Federal Open Market Committee meeting later in the day, traders
said.
	   The committee is widely expected to cut U.S. interest rates in
hopes of helping to revive the global economy. Such a move could
push New York stocks higher and have a positive impact on Japanese
share prices as well.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 0.62 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,062.90.
It had climbed 13.59 points, or 1.29 percent, the previous day.
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 390 million shares,
up from 377.35 million Monday. Retreats outnumbered advances 760 to
367, while 142 issues remained unchanged.
	   In currency trading, strong expectations of lower U.S. interest
rates weighed on the dollar throughout the day, traders said.
	   Lower yields on dollar-denominated assets would be expected to
weaken support for the U.S. currency in the short term.
	   Also supporting the yen was a report by Kyodo News service
quoting an international financial source as saying finance
ministers and central bank chiefs of the Group of Seven leading
economies would agree to strengthen efforts to support the yen at
their meeting in Washington Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.805 percent from Monday's finish of 0.800
percent, driving its price down to 108.96 yen from 109.01 yen.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The words Yasser Arafat didn't say spoke
louder than the ones he did.
	   The Palestinian leader called on world leaders during his United
Nations address Monday to support Palestinian statehood. But he
stopped short of threatening to unilaterally declare independence
on May 4, 1999, the deadline for the completion of peace accords
with Israel.
	   The carefully worded speech was a small victory for Israel,
which has vehemently lobbied the world body against accepting
Palestinian statehood. But for the Palestinians and the United
States, a week of frenzied diplomatic activity ultimately ended
without a deal for a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal and the
sides were vague about what progress, if any, was actually made.
	   A high profile summit Monday of Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and President Bill Clinton produced only a
schedule for more meetings, more attempts at breaking an 18-month
deadlock that has been riddled with false deadlines and dashed
expectations.
	   For Clinton, presiding over another public handshake between the
two Mideast adversaries may have been a welcome break from the
ongoing sex scandal that has plagued his presidency. But the summit
bore little fruit other than the extension of an invitation to
Arafat and Netanyahu to return to Washington next month to try to
wrap up a deal for the troop withdrawal, while the clock ticks away
on existing peace accords.
	   In Israel, opposition leader Ehud Barak called the summit ``no
more than another picture in the photo album.'' Barak, a former
military chief, said the meetings were a waste of time and the
continued absence of a peace deal was likely to lead to bloodshed.
	   Arafat has used the statehood issue as a wild card since the
deadlock began in the spring of 1997, saying that he could
unilaterally declare independence without an agreement from Israel.
	   Netanyahu hinted that he would counter such a move by annexing
more Palestinian areas, a scenario that would likely drag the sides
into armed conflict. The United States took Netanyahu seriously and
publicly said this week that it would not support unilateral
declarations. The pressure led to a watered-down speech by Arafat,
who still called on the United Nations to support Palestinian
statehood but avoided threats.
	   Netanyahu told reporters in Washington on Monday that the sides
had reached a breakthrough and were close to an agreement, but only
if the Palestinians would commit to tougher measures against
Islamic militants. It was the same message Netanyahu sent in
meetings this spring with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   The Palestinians, who have already agreed to U.S. proposals that
would give them less land now than they had hoped for, want Israel
to carry out its commitments to withdraw from war-captured
territory. It is the same thing they have asked for since accepting
the U.S. plan in January.
	   Also unchanged is the May 1999 deadline when the historic Oslo
peace accords, signed five years ago on the White House lawn, will
expire.
	   Albright said Monday the peace process ``needs to be
speeded-up,'' but she did not set a time frame for the next round
of Washington talks. When the two leaders return in mid-October,
only six months will remain before the deadline.
	   By then, the two sides were to have tackled the most fateful
issues of the Israeli-Arab conflict such as establishing fixed
borders, deciding the future of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and
Jewish settlements.
	   But with the interim stage still unresolved, it is unlikely that
the sides will meet the May deadline.
	   Arafat has said the day would not go by unrecognized by
Palestinians. Without agreement over how to handle the date, what
was intended to be a brass ring could instead become a trip wire
for violent confrontation.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's former deputy prime
minister said Tuesday he was led handcuffed and blindfolded to a
police lockup where he was greeted with a thundering punch that
left one eye swollen and useless for two days.
	   ``I was boxed very hard on the left temple and right part of my
head,'' Anwar told a court.
	   It was the first time since his arrest under a harsh security
provision on Sept. 20 that Anwar had been seen and heard.
	   He was arraigned on five counts alleging corruption during his
tenure as finance minister and deputy prime minister before Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired him Sept. 2.
	   He also was charged with four counts of illegal homosexual acts
that are punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a lashing with
a whip.
	   The trial has been transferred to the High Court. No date was
set.
	   ``I was hit very hard on the left part of my neck and slapped
left and right until blood flowed down my nose,'' Anwar told the
court, according to his lawyer Pawancheek Marican.
	   Anwar showed his bruises to his family in court while he was
waiting for the judge to turn up.
	   Anwar said his pleas for a doctor were ignored even when he told
police that he could not see with his left eye, walk properly or
use one of his arms, Marican added.
	   A police doctor was allowed to treat him on the fifth day of his
detention, during which neither his lawyers nor his family were
allowed to see him. On Tuesday, Anwar, 51, hugged his wife and
daughter in court when he saw them.
	   ``He said in court he fears for his life. His left eye is still
black and blue,'' said another of Anwar's lawyers, Kamar Ainah.
	   Anwar's appeal for a medical examination was granted by the
court and a family eye specialist would try to visit him in his
cell at Kuala Lumpur's police headquarters later, lawyers said.
	   A plea for bail was turned down by the judge. Bail applications
for arrests under the Internal Security Act, which allows for
indefinite imprisonment without trial, are decided only by the High
Court.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, said in an interview Monday that
she feared for his life because he knew many government secrets.
	   Mahathir has said that he was compelled to fire Anwar because of
the allegations of homosexuality against his deputy. But Anwar says
that he incurred Mahathir's wrath by challenging his 17-year rule.

Israel closes Palestinian areas for Day of Atonement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel announced Tuesday that it will seal its
borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the Day of
Atonement, the most important day on the Jewish calendar.
	   The holiday of Yom Kippur begins at sundown Tuesday and ends at
sundown Wednesday. Observant Jews pray, fast and ask God for
forgiveness for their sins.
	   Israel routinely imposes a blanket closure on the West Bank and
Gaza during Jewish holidays to prevent possible terror attacks by
Palestinian militants.
	   On Tuesday morning, markets were crowded with shoppers buying
ingredients for a last afternoon meal before the start of the fast.
	   Security was beefed in the markets and around synagogues and
Jewish holy sites where thousands of Jews were expected to flock
beginning at sundown Tuesday.
	   The closure takes effect at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT) Tuesday and will
be lifted at 1 a.m. Thursday (2300 GMT Wednesday), the army said.
It bars the more than 2.5 million Palestinians from entering
Israel, including tens of thousands of workers.
	   Israeli security forces have been on alert since Sept. 11 when
two top fugitives fugitives of the Islamic radical group Hamas were
killed by Israeli troops. Hamas has threatened revenge.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, pleaded innocent Tuesday to nine charges
of corruption and illegal sex acts and claimed he was beaten
severely in detention.
	   Anwar, who, according to a lawyer, had visible bruises from
police violence, made the plea after being brought to a courthouse
early in the morning for the beginning of what could be a landmark
legal case in this Southeast Asian nation.
	   A defense lawyer said the 51-year-old politician, who is leading
a campaign against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule,
had asked the court for an independent medical examination.
	   Anwar replied, ``Not guilty, I claim trial,'' as each charge was
read out before Judge Hasnah Hashim.
	   Wearing brown trousers and a checked shirt, Anwar smiled as he
entered the courtroom. He then embraced his wife, Azizah Ismail,
two of his daughters, and his father.
	   Anwar pointed to large bruises above his left eye and on his
neck and rolled up his shirtsleeves to show his family the scars of
police beatings on the first night of his custody, witnesses in the
courtroom said.
	   ``I was boxed very hard on the left temple and right part of my
head,'' Anwar told the court, according to lawyer Pawancheek
Marican. Anwar said he was still handcuffed and blindfolded when he
was hit.
	   Asked by someone how long he could withstand police violence,
Anwar replied: ``As long as it takes.''
	   He appeared pleased when his wife showed him copies of
international newsmagazines that had featured cover stories on his
movement.
	   Anwar's case was transferred from the lower sessions court to
the High Court at the prosecutor's request. His bail plea was also
referred to the higher court.
	   Anwar was led into the Jalan Raja Court 15 minutes before it was
scheduled to open and taken into a magistrate's courtroom after a
nearly three-hour wait in the court's judicial lockup.
	   Anwar, arrested on Sept. 20, faces nine counts of corruption and
``unnatural'' sex acts. The punishment for each count could be
several years imprisonment.
	   A 10th charge will be brought against him in another court in a
Kuala Lumpur suburb Wednesday, said a statement by the
Attorney-General's office.
	   Reporters jammed the narrow courthouse corridor for a glimpse of
Anwar, but the jailed leader was sneaked into the courtroom through
a back door. Only a few of the reporters could get inside the small
courtroom.
	   Outside, hundreds of riot policemen threw a ring around the
colonial courthouse building to prevent his supporters from
thronging the area for a glimpse of their leader, not seen since
his arrest.
	   At that time, Anwar was marched off by armed police under the
harsh Internal Security Act, which allows for imprisonment without
trial.
	   The start of legal proceedings on the corruption and
homosexuality charges was independent of Anwar's detention under
the ISA, the government's law office said.
	   After he was fired Sept. 2 by the prime minister, Anwar had led
a campaign against his former boss, saying Malaysia needed a more
liberal and clean government.
	   Since his arrest, Kuala Lumpur has been rocked by street
protests demanding his release and Mahathir's resignation.
	   On Monday, riot police chased a few thousand pro-reform
activists through the neon-lit streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur as
protesters defied warnings and gathered for a second consecutive
week near the courthouse.
	   Chanting ``Reformasi,'' or ``Reforms,'' the demonstrators
marched from the courthouse, carrying banners that said, ``Free
Anwar.''
	   At least 16 of Anwar's associates have been held under the ISA.
Nearly 300 people were detained in the series of protests. Many of
them have since been released.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were politically
motivated.
	   The Attorney-General's office said all the charges against Anwar
had been based on a police investigation into accusations contained
in a book titled ``50 reasons why Anwar cannot become PM.''
	   The book was widely distributed at this year's annual convention
of the governing United Malays National Organization party, where
Anwar's allies had campaigned for political reforms.
	   Mahathir has denied that a challenge to his leadership forced
him to fire Anwar, a man he had until last year described as his
successor. He said Anwar's sexual activities were intolerable.
	   ``Anwar's wish was for me to step down so that he would get away
without being tried,'' Mahathir said Tuesday in Parliament, which
met as Anwar was being arraigned in court.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese automobile leasing company has filed for
bankruptcy with nearly 126 billion yen (dlrs 930 million) in debts
after the failure of its parent company left it without support,
company officials said Tuesday.
	   The Japan Leasing Auto Corp. filed for protection from creditors
with the Tokyo District Court late Monday, said company spokesman
Osamu Sugita.
	   The action comes after its parent company, Japan Leasing Corp.,
took a similar measure in the nation's largest ever corporate
bankruptcy with debts of 2.18 trillion yen (dlrs 16 billion).
	   Japan Leasing is affiliated with the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan, the bank at the center of political debate over what to do
about the nation's mounting bad debt problem.
	   Analysts predicted the fall of Japan Leasing was also likely to
affect reconstruction plans for other LTCB affiliate.
	   In a separate development Tuesday, a regional textile maker
Longchamp Co., based in western Japan, has filed for court
protection, with debts estimated at 9 billion yen (dlrs 66
million), according to a private credit research agency Teikoku
Databank Ltd.
	   Longchamp is listed on the Osaka Stock Exchange's second
section. Its main lender is Sanwa Bank Ltd., also a major
shareholder in the company.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The French business school Insead will start
building its first foreign campus in Singapore by the end of this
year and will offer a one-year MBA program to 45 full-time students
by January 2000.
	   The 60 million Singapore dollar (dlrs 35.5 million) campus, to
be built in Singapore's Science Hub, is part of the island
city-state's 10-year program to encourage top universities to open
branch campuses for research and post-graduate studies.
	   The Singapore Insead, which hopes eventually to have a student
body of 480, will be identical to the French institution based in
Fontainebleau, its associate dean, Arnoud De Meyer, was quoted as
saying Tuesday.
	   ``It will be truly a `one school, two campus' concept,'' The
Straits Times quoted him as saying. Entry qualifications,
curriculum, tuition fees and the mix of nationalities among the
students will be the same, the newspaper said. Students will be
encouraged to do part of their studies on both campuses.
	   The Singapore campus will also offer a shorter executive
education program, said Liew Heng San, managing director of the
Economic Development Board.
	   ___
	   	   TOKYO (AP) _ Workers in the finance and real estate sectors
failed to top the list of Japan's highest paid for the first time
in 48 years as the bank crises and a stagnant property market
dragged down salaries, a government report said Tuesday.
	   The average annual wage in the finance and property sectors was
5,584,000 yen (dlrs 41,058) per worker last year, down 0.8 percent
from a year before, the National Tax Administration Agency said.
	   The total amount paid in the two sectors fell behind that of the
petrochemical industry, whose workers received 5,682,000 yen (dlrs
41,779) on average last year, the report said. The annual wages
included monthly salaries, allowances and twice-a-year bonuses.
	   Bonuses are usually considered part of a worker's wages in
Japan.
	   It was the first time wages in the finance and real estate
sectors lagged behind another industry since the agency began
taking statistics in 1949, the report said.
	   Businesses in the two sectors have remained in a slump in the
wake of the collapse of the highly speculative ``bubble economy''

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Sharply falling imports helped South
Korea record a dlrs 2.26 billion current account surplus in August,
the central Bank of Korea said Tuesday.
	   August's gain _ the tenth consecutive monthly surplus _ pushed
the country's combined current account surplus for the first eight
months of the year to dlrs 27.52 billion, compared with a dlrs
11.62 billion shortfall a year earlier.
	   The August surplus compared with a dlrs 498 million deficit in
the same month last year.
	   Imports plunged 38.1 percent to dlrs 7.12 billion in August,
largely because South Korea's financial crisis has been forcing
businesses to cut capital investment and families to reduce
spending.
	   Exports fell by 11.1 percent to dlrs 9.82 billion, leading to a
surplus of dlrs 2.7 billion in the trade component of the current
account. The bank attributed the drop, among other things, to
sluggish demand for South Korean goods in other financially
troubled Asian countries.
	   On Monday, President Kim Dae-jung said the country will post a
dlrs 40 billion current account surplus this year, in contrast to a
dlrs 8.17 billion shortfall last year.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's prime minister believes
agricultural and rural development are the keys to avoiding the
social unrest Asia's economic crisis has sparked in some nations,
state-run media reported Tuesday.
	   ``Our social economic situation will face unforeseen
difficulties if we don't have a stable agricultural and rural
foundation,'' Prime Minister Phan Van Khai was quoted as saying by
the newspaper Hanoi Moi.
	   Recently released statistics show the region's economic crisis
is taking a toll on Vietnam's economy, with exports and foreign
direct investment plummeting this year.
	   Khai said food security would allow Vietnam to advance, despite
adversity, by keeping farmers happy.
	   ``Rural stability is vital to national security,'' he said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Transport and Communications
Ministry is investigating corruption charges leveled at operators
of a state-run bus terminal by private bus companies, a ministry
official said Tuesday.
	   The bus companies have accused officials at The Transport
Company, a state-owned enterprise that operates Bangkok's Mor Chit
2 bus terminal, of demanding bribes in exchange for the right to
use certain departure slots, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Mor Chit 2 is one of Bangkok's largest terminals and is where
hundreds of thousands of travelers and rural migrants from the poor
northeast enter and leave the capital.
	   The ministry official declined to say how many tour bus
companies made the charges. He said the Department of Land
Transport is looking into the allegations.
	   Prasit Vivttrakul, managing director of The Transport Company,
denied the allegations in Tuesday's Bangkok Post newspaper.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Unionized employees called off a
strike at South Korea's nine major banks Tuesday after reaching a
deal with management on the size and terms of layoffs.
	   With the eleventh-hour agreement, some 35,000 employees returned
to their jobs, some in time for regular opening hours, others a few
hours later.
	   By early afternoon, nearly all branch offices of the nine banks
were back in normal operation.
	   ``We apologize to the people for causing trouble, however
briefly,'' said Chu Won-su, head of the Korea Federation of Bank
and Financial Unions.
	   Chu's group called the nationwide strike after overnight talks
broke down. But the strike immediately fizzled when employees at
seven of the nine banks accepted management offers.
	   Later, representatives of the umbrella group reopened talks with
management and reached a deal covering employees at all nine banks
that superseded the earlier individual agreements.
	   The settlement will allow the banks to cut manpower by 32
percent by the end of the year, with dismissed workers getting
additional severance pay equal to 11 months of salary.

Schroeder reassures Germans and the world after victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 7-11 with comments from Greens, nuclear
energy industry. &QL; 
 &UR; With Germany-How Kohl Lost &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The nation's future chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, made one thing clear after winning power as the voice of
change: Change will happen, but not too much for the good of
Germans, who cherish predictability.
	   The Social Democrat sought to reassure the world, too, declaring
in his first news conference after Sunday's vote that his
administration will represent steady foreign policy and ``economic
stability.''
	   The stability is associated with 16 years of consistent
conservative leadership by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, swept from
office by voters who wanted a fresh face and new ideas for solving
problems at home _ chiefly unemployment stuck at over 10 percent.
	   Not only has Schroeder vowed to continue Kohl's foreign policies
but the future chancellor also said Monday he may be consulting his
predecessor directly for advice on diplomacy.
	   As a first sign of continuity, Schroeder planned to visit Paris
on Wednesday in a symbolic trip to the capital of Germany's closest
European partner. Kohl made the same journey in 1982, when he, like
Schroeder, was elevated from state governor to the leader of the
nation.
	   ``Nobody needs to be afraid. We will ensure continuity in
foreign policy,'' Schroeder said. ``The international community can
rely on Germans to remain good partners.''
	   Also stressing continuity were the environmentalist Greens,
which Schroeder invited Monday to join his government as junior
partner.
	   Joschka Fischer, the Greens' leading moderate and considered a
possible foreign minister, played down the party's standing call
for scrapping NATO, saying ``we don't want Germany to go down a
separate path'' from its allies.
	   ``It will be difficult to govern the country with rebellious
policies,'' he said late Sunday on German television. ``The point
is to make successful policies as a party in government.''
	   Germany's power industry warned the Social Democrats and Greens
against making good their campaign promise of scrapping nuclear
energy.
	   Nuclear power accounts for about a third of the nation's energy
needs, and ``the a new government will have to be accept reality,''
Heinz Klinger, head of the electrical power industry's lobby, said
Tuesday.
	   Some of Schroeder's first tests as chancellor will be on the
international stage, with NATO planning air strikes to quell
violence in the Serb-ruled Yugoslav province of Kosovo and with the
Jan. 1 introduction of Europe's common currency, the euro.
	   Germany is at the center of both developments: Kohl was
instrumental in starting European monetary union, and his
government has promised German fighter planes and soldiers for any
NATO action in the current Balkan conflict.
	   Grinning with exuberance, Schroeder dodged tough questions _
such as how he would handle Kosovo. He and Social Democrat party
chief Oskar Lafontaine apparently were unwilling to commit their
new government to any plan as they head into tough talks Friday on
forming a coalition with the environmentalist Greens party.
	   But Schroeder made clear that the Social Democrats, as the
dominant partner, would not tolerate radical pacifist and
environmentalist causes pushed by many Greens.
	   In an interview with Der Spiegel news magazine, he warned the
Greens ``not to be pushy with their demands.''
	   Eager to enter government for the first time, the Greens
emphasized ideas the two parties share: combating unemployment,
scrapping nuclear energy and giving long-time foreign residents of
Germany dual nationality.

Israel says good ties with Germany to continue with Schroeder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel said Tuesday that good relations with
Germany will continue under the leadership of chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder.
	   ``We expect to continue the excellent relations that we've had
with previous governments of the federal republic,'' said
government spokesman Moshe Fogel.
	   Fogel said that Schroeder's visit to Israel in March proved he
was interested in maintaining close ties with Israel.
	   Fogel said that Germany can play a positive role in the peace
process with the Palestinians since it will soon assume presidency
of the European Community.
	   The German Social Democrat was elected Sunday over Chancellor
Helmut Kohl who had ruled Germany for 16 years.
	   During his visit to Israel, Schroeder shied away from taking
sides in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He has said he will
not drastically alter German foreign policy.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed
lower Tuesday on profit-taking, a day after the key index surged on
expectations of a cut in U.S. interest rates.
	   The blue chip Hang Seng Index fell 108.43 points, or 1.4
percent, closing at 7,837.61. On Monday, the index had soared 3.2
percent, or 244.43 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 4.42 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
566 million), down from Monday's 5.16 billion dollars (U.S. dlrs
661 million).
	   ``Profit-taking set in as the news of a possible rate cut in the
U.S. has been discounted'' in the local market, Kenny Tang,
research manager at Tung Tai Securities Ltd., said.
	   Brokers said many investors were awaiting the outcome of a
meeting later Tuesday of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Open Market
Committee, which might cut interest rates.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 70 Hong Kong cents to 34.80,
and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 10 cents to 27.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 3.50 dollars to
141.50, and Hang Seng Bank fell 80 cents to 48.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 80 cents to 39.70, and Swire
Pacific ``A'' fell 70 cents to 24.10.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A light airplane taking top Ugandan
military officers to a town controlled by rebels in northeastern
Congo has gone missing, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The aircraft departed Entebbe International Airport Sept. 25 en

headquarters in Goma at the head of Lake Kivu, the private Monitor
newspaper said.

President Laurent Kabila.

there.

of the Ugandan armed forces.

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bavaria's popular governor, Edmund
Stoiber, was re-elected to his post by the state parliament
Tuesday, two weeks after his conservative Christian Social Union
easily won another majority in state elections.
	   Stoiber was named to a five-year term by a vote of 123-75 and
took the oath of office right afterward.
	   In a TV interview, Stoiber also said he would like to take over
the job of party chairman from Theo Waigel, who announced on Monday
that he would give up the post following the party's poor
performance in national elections.
	   ``If the party needs me in such a not-so-simple situation, then
I'm ready to contribute my experience and knowledge happily,''
Stoiber said.
	   Waigel, outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's finance minister, said
he would not seek re-appointment as chairman at the party
convention in early 1999.

Myanmar leader issues patriotism call
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ As Myanmar's main opposition party
reported that arrests of its members were approaching 1,000, a
senior member of the ruling junta has aimed another barb at the
group by calling for a renewal of patriotic spirit.
	   The state-owned press Tuesday quoted Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt as
saying Myanmar had lived under servitude for more than 100 years
due to disunity among the citizens.
	   ``The need to vitalize patriotism among the people is of utmost
importance, as there have been attempts by alien nations to
subjugate the country for the second time,'' Khin Nyunt said.
	   The military government accuses the opposition National League
for Democracy of being in cahoots with Western powers to
destabilize Myanmar, also known as Burma. Western nations have been
critical of the junta for its poor human rights record and failure
to move toward democracy.
	   In recent months, the government has been in a sustained
confrontation with the opposition. It began mass arrests in May and
intensified them in September in an effort to block the NLD from
carrying out a threat to convene parliament on its own. The NLD won
a landslide victory in 1990 elections, but the military never
allowed parliament to meet.
	   On Monday, the NLD said 961 party members, including 202 elected
representatives from the 1990 election, have been detained so far.
The government claims that they have simply been invited for
discussion of political matters.
	   ``The unlawful activities by the National League for Democracy
harm the stability and unity of the country and hamper economic
progress,'' the state press quoted Khin Nyunt saying. ``The gentle
handling of the government toward the opposition was to avoid
causing panic and danger among the public.''
	   Khin Nyunt also said that an exhibition to vitalize patriotic
spirit among youths and students must be organized.
	   Official newspapers also reported Tuesday that police and
citizens of North Okkalapa township, an eastern suburb of the
capital, had been honored Monday for outstanding performance in
keeping community peace and tranquility.
	   At the ceremony attended by Lt. Gen. Tin Au, a secretary of the
military government, a resident of North Okkalapa denounced
``destructive elements who are trying to disrupt community peace
and tranquility and prevalence of law,'' the newspaper reported.
	   A 10-member committee, made up of supporters of the National
League for Democracy, was formed Sept. 16 to carry out parliament's
functions, according to a party statement.
	   Members include party leader Aung San Suu Kyi, eight senior
officials in her party and a delegate representing the country's
ethnic minorities.
	   Since the NLD declared it had convened parliament, official
newspapers have carried commentaries, cartoons and poems every day
mocking its plans and suggesting that the party should be
deregistered and opposition leader Suu Kyi deported for disrupting
stability.

Study: low-quality day care may endanger child's development
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A prolonged stay in low-quality day care
centers may endanger the emotional development of infants,
according to a study of 800 babies released Tuesday.
	   The research also found that infants who are raised at home by a
private nanny have the same secure emotional attachments to their
mothers as do babies whose mothers care for them full time.
	   The study was financed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health
and conducted by Haifa University's Center for the Study of Child
Development headed by Avi Sagi, a professor of psychology.
	   In a supplementary study, the operators of 50 day-care centers
and 120 private nannies were interviewed.
	   The study found that people working at day care centers in
Israel often were not properly trained, had to take care of more
babies than they could handle and tended to emphasize the basics of
the jobs, such as changing diapers, over emotional needs.
	   ``Staff often went about their work mechanically, stressing the
custodial aspects of their jobs and omitting the emotional needs of
the children under their care,'' the study said.
	   An American expert said the problems uncovered by the study are
also found in the United States.
	   ``We have encountered these problems here also, not enough staff
looking after too many babies, underpaid and undertrained staff,''
said Douglas Fizel of the American Psychological Association.
	   High-quality day care, on the other hand, is just as beneficial
for babies as staying at home, he said.

Taiwan launches crime crackdown following stock trader's murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Police launched an island-wide sweep for
suspected gangsters Tuesday after a securities executive's murder
sparked an outcry over mob-related violence and manipulation of the
stock market.
	   Hundreds of police searched company offices, restaurants, bars
and other suspected gang-operated businesses for evidence of
strong-arm tactics and extortion against traders and brokerages,
said Lin Kuo-tung, deputy director of the Criminal Investigation
Bureau.
	   Lin did not say how many people were rounded up in the sweep.
	   Worries about gang involvement in stock trading were renewed by
the murder of Huang Nai-hsuan, vice president of Yuanta Securities
Corp., outside his apartment as he returned home early Saturday.
	   Newspapers said Huang handled gang extortion demands on behalf
of the company for years, and was familiar with many top organized
crime figures.
	   At a news conference Monday, Yuanta head Ma Chih-ling delivered
a tearful denunciation of what he called worsening crime in Taiwan
and appealed to the government to ``give proper businesses room to
survive and grow.''
	   Police said they were questioning an investor who reportedly
demanded that Yuanta compensate him 30 million Taiwan dollars (U.S.
dlrs 860,000) for stock losses incurred through the brokerage eight
years ago. Turned away, he later enlisted four of Taiwan's top
criminal groups to demand a sum four times larger, but never
received payment, newspaper reports said.
	   Police said another unidentified securities firm paid gangsters
100 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.9 million) two months ago
to cover their trading losses after receiving threats.
	   In the past few years, gangsters have fired warning shots and
abducted officials at several shareholders meetings in fights over
management at the companies or merely to extort money.
	   Last year, a stock analyst accused gangsters of threatening to
kill him after he refused to talk up a share price on a television
show.

Protests and strike by Shiite Muslim group keeps businesses shut in
</HEADLINE>
Karachi &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Paramilitary troops patrolled the
streets of the southern Pakistani port of Karachi on Tuesday as a
strike called by Shiite Muslims kept many shops and offices closed.
	   Rioters torched a car in the central Liquatabad area and threw
stones at passing vehicles, police said. Public transport remained
off the roads and attendance was thin at educational institutions
and offices.
	   Security forces patrolled in trucks mounted with machine-guns.
	   The strike was called by the Shiite group Tehrik-e-Jafria, or
movement for the implementation of the Shiite rights, to protest
the killing of its leader and his son, who were shot to death last
week, allegedly by Sunni Muslim extremists.
	   The killing triggered protests, with two people killed in a gun
battle between Shiite Muslims and security forces on Sunday.
	   Shiite and Sunni Muslim extremist groups locked in a fierce
sectarian war in Pakistan which has left hundreds of people dead in
recent years.

Three opposition leaders arrested in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Police arrested three opposition
leaders early Tuesday in connection with the killing of four former
Cabinet ministers in Dhaka's central jail 23 years ago.
	   All those arrested were ministers in the government headed by
Khondkar Mushtaq Ahmed, who assumed power after the assassination
of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first prime minister, in a
military coup in 1975. The four ministers close to Rahman, known
here as Mujib, were jailed at first, then killed on Aug.15, 1975.
	   Police took Obidur Rahman and Nurul Islam Manju of the main
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Shah Moazzem Hussain of
the Jatiya Party to a Dhaka district court later Tuesday. The
charges they face and other details were not immediately known.

Iraq to safeguard properties of Kuwaitis, Saudis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a bid to safeguard estates abandoned by
their Saudi and Kuwaiti owners, Iraq will rent the properties out
and hold the revenue in escrow accounts, a weekly newspaper
reported.
	   The absentee landlords, who deserted their holiday homes,
estates and farms following the 1991 Gulf War, will be free to
claim the money from the escrow accounts later, the al-Musawir
al-Arabi newspaper said in its latest issue released Monday.
	   ``The Cabinet decision is meant to take care of the Gulf
brothers' properties in order to maintain them,'' the newspaper
said.
	   The decision will mainly affect properties in and around the
southern city of Basra where hundreds of foreigners, mostly rich
Kuwaitis and Saudis, built vacation homes.
	   Gulf residents were attracted to Basra for its proximity,
relatively low real estate prices and Iraq's more relaxed social
norms.
	   Al-Arabi quoted Basra Gov. Ahmad Ibrahim Hamash as saying that
678 estates belonging to Kuwaitis and 85 Saudi-owned properties
have been identified as abandoned in Basra.
	   Unless claimed by the owners through officially appointed
agents, the properties will be rented out in an effort to prevent
them from falling into disrepair, Hamash was quoted as saying.
	   So far 42 appointed agents have shown up with proper papers from
landlords, he said.
	   In a similar decision in March, the government announced it will
develop Kuwaiti and Saudi owned farm lands that were left fallow
since the war, which was sparked by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The revenues from the farms also will be deposited in escrow
accounts.

Ousted deputy premier pleads innocent to charges

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, pleaded innocent Tuesday to nine charges
of corruption and illegal sex acts and claimed he was beaten
severely in detention.
	   Anwar, who, according to a lawyer, had visible bruises from
police violence, made the plea after being brought to a courthouse
early in the morning for the beginning of what could be a landmark
legal case in this Southeast Asian nation.
	   A defense lawyer said the 51-year-old politician had asked the
court for an independent medical examination.
	   Anwar replied, ``Not guilty, I claim trial,'' as each charge was
read out before Judge Hasnah Hashim.
	   He has contended that the charges are politically motivated.
	   After Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired him Sept. 2, Anwar
led a campaign against Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Since his arrest Sept. 20, Kuala Lumpur has been rocked by
street protests demanding his release and Mahathir's resignation.
	   Wearing brown trousers and a checked shirt, Anwar smiled as he
entered the courtroom. He then embraced his wife, Azizah Ismail,
two of his daughters, and his father.
	   Anwar pointed to large bruises above his left eye and on his
neck and rolled up his shirtsleeves to show his family the scars of
police beatings on the first night of his custody, witnesses in the
courtroom said.
	   ``I was boxed very hard on the left temple and right part of my
head,'' Anwar told the court, according to lawyer Pawancheek
Marican. Anwar said he was still handcuffed and blindfolded when he
was hit.
	   Asked by someone how long he could withstand police violence,
Anwar replied: ``As long as it takes.''
	   He appeared pleased when his wife showed him copies of
international newsmagazines that had featured cover stories on his
movement.
	   Anwar's case was transferred from the lower sessions court to
the High Court at the prosecutor's request. His bail plea was also
referred to the higher court.
	   Anwar was led into the Jalan Raja Court 15 minutes before it was
scheduled to open and taken into a magistrate's courtroom after a
nearly three-hour wait in the court's judicial lockup.
	   Anwar, arrested on Sept. 20, faces nine counts of corruption and
``unnatural'' sex acts. The punishment for each count could be
several years imprisonment.
	   A 10th charge will be brought against him in another court in a
Kuala Lumpur suburb Wednesday, said a statement by the
Attorney-General's office.
	   Reporters jammed the narrow courthouse corridor for a glimpse of
Anwar, but the jailed leader was sneaked into the courtroom through
a back door. Only a few of the reporters could get inside the small
courtroom.
	   Outside, hundreds of riot policemen threw a ring around the
colonial courthouse building to prevent his supporters from
thronging the area for a glimpse of their leader, not seen since
his arrest.
	   At that time, Anwar was marched off by armed police under the
harsh Internal Security Act, which allows for imprisonment without
trial.
	   The start of legal proceedings on the corruption and
homosexuality charges was independent of Anwar's detention under
the ISA, the government's law office said.
	   On Monday, riot police chased a few thousand pro-reform
activists through the neon-lit streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur as
protesters defied warnings and gathered for a second consecutive
week near the courthouse.
	   Chanting ``Reformasi,'' or ``Reforms,'' the demonstrators
marched from the courthouse, carrying banners that said, ``Free
Anwar.''
	   At least 16 of Anwar's associates have been held under the ISA.
Nearly 300 people were detained in the series of protests. Many of
them have since been released.
	   The Attorney-General's office said all the charges against Anwar
had been based on a police investigation into accusations contained
in a book titled ``50 reasons why Anwar cannot become PM.''
	   The book was widely distributed at this year's annual convention
of the governing United Malays National Organization party, where
Anwar's allies had campaigned for political reforms.
	   Mahathir has denied that a challenge to his leadership forced
him to fire Anwar, a man he had until last year described as his
successor. He said Anwar's sexual activities were intolerable.
	   ``Anwar's wish was for me to step down so that he would get away
without being tried,'' Mahathir said Tuesday in Parliament, which
met as Anwar was being arraigned in court.

Fans rejoice as their lovable losers head to playoffs

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ One of baseball's most memorable seasons ended
with a consolation prize for Sammy Sosa that the slugger valued
even more than the home run title _ the playoffs.
	   ``Tonight, I forgot about the home run. I just wanted to win,''
Sosa said after his Chicago Cubs beat the San Francisco Giants 5-3
Monday night in a one-game playoff for a postseason berth. ``I
never thought this would happen to me. I'm never going to forget
it.''
	   Sosa finished the season with 66 home runs, four behind Mark
McGwire. His exploits highlighted a rare winning year for the Cubs,
in their first season since their beloved broadcaster Harry Caray
died.
	   Every Cubs fan can recite the legacy of disappointment: The Cubs
haven't won a championship since 1908 and haven't been to the World
Series since 1945. Since then, they've only made the playoffs
twice, in 1984 and 1989.
	   So after Monday night's win kept hope alive, fans streamed out
of 84-year-old Wrigley Field and neighboring taverns into the
streets, jumping, cheering, high-fiving and riding on each other's
shoulders.
	   ``I have been a long-suffering Cubs fan for 40-odd years,'' said
Chicago attorney Mike Fulton. ``It was worth the wait. It just
shows that the meek WILL inherit the earth.''
	   ``They thought they saw a celebration with the Bulls,'' said
Mark Eckert, 43, a tavern owner who drove down from Milwaukee just
to watch the game at a bar in the Wrigleyville neighborhood. ``They
haven't seen anything.''
	   ``My face hurts from smiling,'' said Tara Gameron, 24, of
Bloomington, Illinois, who also drove two hours to Chicago for the
game. ``I was so nervous, I wasn't able to eat a thing all day.''
	   When Monday night's game became necessary Sunday _ because the
Cubs and Giants were tied for the National League's fourth playoff
spot _ tickets for the game sold out in an hour and a half. Brokers
sold seats for up to dlrs 500 each.
	   Sitting in a wheelchair outside Wrigley before the game, Edward
Stritzel, 66, could understand the excitement. He has followed the
Cubs though their darkest days.
	   ``My diabetes helps me as a Cub fan,'' he said. ``It has taught
me to have patience. You have to wait for the pain to heal.''

China asks Lesotho to protect Chinese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has asked South Africa to provide emergency
assistance to hundreds of Chinese citizens and ethnic Chinese who
fled the violence in Lesotho, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Ethnic Chinese were a favorite target of looters who took
advantage of an army mutiny, a crippling strike and an intervention
last week by neighboring South African forces.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said Chinese
citizens on personal business and ethnic Chinese residents were
``severely attacked and disturbed.'' He said about 400 of them
sought refuge in South Africa on Sept. 22.
	   Chinese diplomats have asked South Africa to care for the
refugees and give them emergency transit visas as needed, Tang
said.
	   China has also ``asked the Lesotho government to take effective
measures to protect Chinese personnel and overseas Chinese and
ensure the security of their life and property,'' Tang said at a
twice weekly media briefing.
	   For China, the crisis in Lesotho was the second time in four
months it has appealed to foreign governments to care for ethnic
Chinese. Riots surrounding the downfall of Indonesian President
Suharto in May also targeted the country's dominant Chinese
business community.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ At best, the Stottlemyre family will get a split
tonight.
	   On one side is Todd, who will start Game 1 of the playoffs for
the Texas Rangers. On the other is his dad, Mel, the pitching coach
for the New York Yankees.
	   ``He probably knows me as well or better than anybody,'' the
pitcher said Monday during a workout at Yankee Stadium. `From an
emotional standpoint, he understands me better than anybody. There
are no secrets.''
	   When Todd won at New York last month, his mother, Jean _ Mel's
wife _ felt so uncomfortable that she abandoned her usual seat in
the Yankees' family section so she could cheer for her son.
	   ``I'm hiding my feelings,'' Mel said. ``I'm keeping them to
myself. I'm keeping my family and my feelings out of this.''
	   The best-of-5 playoffs were to begin today with three matchups.
	   In the other AL first-rounder, Pedro Martinez pitched for Boston
against Jaret Wright and the Indians at Cleveland. In the NL, Randy
Johnson and the Houston Astros faced Kevin Brown and the San Diego
Padres at the Astrodome.
	   On Wednesday, the Chicago Cubs, coming off their 5-3 win over
San Francisco in the NL wild-card tiebreaker, visit Atlanta to play
John Smoltz and the Braves.
	   David Wells will pitch for the opener for the Yankees, who set
an AL record with 114 wins. The Rangers' only other playoff
appearance came in 1996, when New York eliminated them in the first
round.
	   Mel Stottlemyre had never watched Todd pitch from a major league
dugout until that game in mid-August. Both later admitted it was an
emotional, difficult day.
	   ``I get chill bumps even thinking about it,'' Texas manager
Johnny Oates. ``We always want to do well for our dads. I thought
about sitting there, rooting against your son. I don't know if you
can do that.''
	   At Houston, the Astros are thinking this might be the year they
reach the World Series for the first time. A lot of that confidence
is because of Johnson, who went 10-1 after being acquired from
Seattle.
	   ``I'm much more at ease. I still have fun,'' the Big Unit said.
	   The Padres had trouble in September, even though they had no
problem clinching the NL West. In Brown, they have a pitcher who
helped the Florida Marlins win the World Series last year.
	   ``Well, there is no question you never want to struggle coming
into the playoffs. Then again, there have been teams playing great
going into the playoffs and lost four straight or not fared well,''
Brown said. ``And vice versa, a team can come in struggling and
turn it around in a series. You can't read too much into it.''
	   At Jacobs Field, two teams will try to erase the memories of
painful postseasons.
	   The Red Sox have lost 13 straight postseason games since winning
Game 5 of the 1986 World Series. The Indians have not won the World
Series since 1948, coming within a double play grounder of the
title last October at Miami.
	   ``The postseason is an absolutely new ballgame, a clean slate
and you approach it as such,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said.
	   ``Records are 0-0,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said. ``You
start all over.''
	   At Atlanta, the Braves could do little Monday but wait to see
who they would play. In fact, some players weren't even in a rush
to find out.
	   ``I don't think I'll even watch the game,'' Braves closer Kerry
Ligtenberg said. ``I don't know who to root for. I don't know who I
want to play. I'll just take the night off and relax. I'll probably
be watching `Ally McBeal.'''

Philippine stocks, peso rise on hopes of U.S. rate cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks were lifted Tuesday
by expectations of a cut in U.S. interest rates and a continued
advance by Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., traders said.
	   But signs of a correction started to emerge late in Tuesday's
session, with profit-taking whittling early gains.
	   The peso also rose, buoyed by an upcoming increase in the
reserve requirements of banks and hopes for the U.S. rate cut,
dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 7.67 points,
or 0.6 percent, to 1,238.17 after gaining 15.04 points Monday.
	   The broader All Shares Index also rose 1.26 points to 409.10
after climbing 5.02 points Monday.
	   PLDT's stock led gainers, propped up by persistent talk of a
possible takeover.
	   There were 42 gainers and 38 losers, with 10 issues unchanged.
	   Airline-related stocks, which rallied on the closure of
Philippine Airlines last week, continued their retreat Tuesday
after news of a possible resumption of the flag carrier's
operations.
	   PLDT dominated trading activity again Tuesday, accounting for
nearly 47 percent of all trades.
	   Erwin Balita, analyst for Securities 2000 Inc., said the absence
of any fresh developments kept investors focused on PLDT.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 43.809 pesos, down from
Monday's average of 43.890 pesos. It was last traded at 43.840
pesos.
	   Traders said banks sold dollars to acquire pesos to be used to
cover additional reserve requirements.
	   The Central Bank plans to raise the statutory reserve
requirement for commercial banks by 2 percentage points to 10
percent, effective Friday, to siphon off some 22 billion pesos
(dlrs 500 million) in excess domestic funds that could be used to
speculate on the dollar.
	   The liquidity reserve requirement of commercial banks will
remain unchanged at 7 percent.
	   Statutory reserves cover mostly non-interest-earning deposits
and deposit substitutes of banks, which are kept with the Central
Bank. Liquidity reserves are the portion of a bank's portfolio
invested in government securities.
	   Traders expect demand for pesos to continue to remain strong in
the run-up to the implementation of the new reserve requirement
Friday.
	   The peso is also expected to be buoyed by a cut in U.S. interest
rates.
	   The Central Bank wasn't active in the spot market. It held its
overnight borrowing and lending rates at 16 percent and 18 percent,
respectively. The rates will be cut to 14 percent and 16 percent,
respectively, on Friday.

Top diplomats tour Kosovo following Milosevic pledge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Senior diplomats were touring Kosovo
on Tuesday to see whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is
living up to his pledge to withdraw Serb-led special police as
demanded by NATO and the U.N. Security Council.
	   Also Tuesday, ethnic Albanians said they planned to bury 15
people, including women, children and elderly, who were allegedly
massacred Sunday by Serb forces in the Drenica region.
	   The Albanians said some of the victims had their throats slit
and limbs cut off. They said a baby was left alive in a pool of her
dead mother's blood.
	   Drenica is the heart of ethnic Albanian rebellion in Kosovo. The
Serb crackdown in Kosovo started there Feb. 28.
	   Envoys of the six so-called Contact Group countries dealing with
former Yugoslavia met Milosevic on Monday and warned him to honor
demands for an immediate cease-fire in the Serbian province,
according to a statement by the French embassy in Belgrade.
	   Following the meeting, the diplomats from the United States,
Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy headed off for Kosovo.
	   On Monday, the premier of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia, declared that ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo had
been defeated and that the special forces would be withdrawn. Mirko
Marjanovic warned they could be sent back if the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army resumes attacks against police.
	   The statement was an apparent attempt to avoid NATO strikes on
Serbia because of the seven-month crackdown in Kosovo. The
onslaught has claimed hundreds of lives and sent more than 250,000
people fleeing their homes.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the KLA, which is fighting for
independence from Serbia, warned the world to act ``more justly,
swiftly and energetically, or the consequences of the Kosovo war
would be reflected in the whole of Balkans and wider.''
	   The rebels pledged to fight on despite a string of defeats which
have driven them from many of their former strongholds in the
province.
	   The leading ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic League of
Kosovo, dismissed the premier's statement as a ``manipulation of
the world public by the Belgrade regime,'' and called for an
``immediate NATO action in Kosovo to stop the humanitarian
catastrophe.''
	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians _ who make up 90 percent of the 2
million inhabitants _ favor independence.

Thai ruling coalition talks with opposition party about joining
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A potential strengthening of Thailand's
coalition government was being negotiated Tuesday as a key member
of the ruling Democrats held talks with the leader of the second
largest opposition party.
	   Adding the opposition Chart Pattana (National Development) Party
to the six-party coalition would substantially increase the
government's thin majority in Parliament and strengthen its ability
to push through programs to tackle the country's economic crisis.
	   It was not clear, however, whether other members of the
coalition would jump ship if the lineup were changed. Adding Chart
Pattana would require other parties to give up some Cabinet seats
under the Thai government's quota system.
	   One coalition party leader resigned Tuesday, apparently angered
over the potential reapportionment.
	   Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart, who is also the Democrat
Party secretary-general, emerged from a one-hour meeting Tuesday
shaking hands with Korn Dabbaransi, leader of Chart Pattana.
	   ``We have no problems. No demands have been made,'' Sanan told
reporters, while refusing to say whether a deal had been reached.
	   Sanan is Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's political point man and
key negotiator. He put together the current coalition out of the
political chaos that followed the resignation of former Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh last November.
	   If Sanan can include Chart Pattana in a new coalition without
losing any current members, that would leave Chavalit's New
Aspiration Party virtually isolated in the opposition.
	   The ruling coalition holds 207 seats in the 393-seat parliament.
Chart Pattana would give it an additional 51 seats.
	   Sanan has been pushing for Chart Pattana's inclusion for several
weeks. Last week, however, several coalition parties told the
Democrats they objected to the move and it was apparently dropped.
	   Chart Pattana also has a reputation of being an uncooperative
partner. It was blamed for undermining the Chavalit coalition in an
attempt to maneuver its late leader, Chatichai Choonhavan, into the
prime minister's job.
	   The current maneuverings appeared to prompt the resignation of
Montree Pongpanich as leader of the Social Action Party, which has
20 seats and is a coalition member.
	   Some local newspapers reported that in a new lineup, Chart
Pattana would be offered the Ministry of Industry, now under the
control of the Social Action Party.
	   ``I resigned because I failed to manage appointments for my
party members,'' Montree told reporters, visibly angry.
	   Montree had long been an opponent of the Democrats. In an
unusual act of political courage, he abandoned his longtime allies
last November to join Chuan's coalition, giving the Democrats
enough seats to form the government. He said he did it for the good
of the country in its time of economic crisis.
	   He suffered intense personal and political attacks from
Chavalit's party and Chatichai's Chart Pattana for siding with
Chuan.
	   A recent corruption scandal at the Ministry of Public Health,
controlled by the Social Action Party, cast the party, however, in
the role of the coalition black sheep.

One Nation calls police to evict media from meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GATTON, Australia (AP) _ The right-wing populist One Nation
party's chief strategist and New South Wales Senate candidate,
David Oldfield, called police to the party's official campaign
launch Tuesday to kick out reporters.
	   The media had refused to leave the senior citizens' center at
Gatton, west of Brisbane, after party officials failed to release
promised documents spelling out how its programs would be paid for.
	   Oldfield told about 150 supporters he had called police to evict
about 25 journalists.
	   Following the formal proceedings, during which One Nation leader
Pauline Hanson delivered a party statement predominantly about
jobs, Oldfield asked reporters to leave the hall.
	   The media complied with the request but went back inside when
promised policy cost documents were not produced.
	   In July, Hanson had a reporter and photographer ejected from a
news conference and launched an attack on the media, saying she was
fed up with ``biased reporting.''
	   The independent member of Parliament from Queensland spoke at a
news conference at her electorate office after having a reporter
and photographer from The Queensland Times escorted from the
building by security guards.
	   Hanson told about 20 reporters she had those journalists evicted
because she believed biased reporting by the newspaper was directly
responsible for two of her One Nation party candidates losing the
June 13 Queensland state election.
	   One Nation stunned the mainstream political parties by capturing
11 of the 89 seats in Queensland's state parliamentary election.

German court says terrorist's death was probably suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A leftist terrorist who died during a
shootout with federal agents in 1993 apparently killed himself, a
German court said Tuesday in deciding that the German government
does not have to pay for his funeral.
	   The state court in Bonn ruled in a case brought by the parents
of Wolfgang Grams, who was shot in the head as federal agents
sought to arrest him at a train station on June 27, 1993.
	   The circumstances surrounding Grams' death remain unclear. Some
witnesses say he was shot point-blank in the head by a federal
agent as he lay bleeding on a railroad track.
	   But an official investigation determined he had killed himself,
and an attempt by his parents to force a trial for the officers
involved was denied by Germany's highest court.
	   The parents pursued their claim by filing a civil lawsuit
seeking reimbursement from the government for their son's funeral.
	   But the court, which heard testimony from witnesses and visited
the train station in Bad Kleinen, ruled there was insufficient
evidence to persuade it that a federal agent killed Grams.
	   It said witness accounts were contradictory and the medical
report on Grams could not exclude the possibility of a suicide. The
fatal bullet was never found.
	   Grams was a member of the Red Army Faction, a leftist terrorist
group that killed more than 50 people starting in the 1970s.

Top diplomats tour Kosovo following Milosevic pledge

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Senior diplomats were touring Kosovo
on Tuesday to see whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is
living up to his pledge to withdraw Serb-led special police as
demanded by NATO and the U.N. Security Council.
	   Also Tuesday, ethnic Albanians said they planned to bury 15
people, including women, children and elderly people, who were
allegedly massacred Sunday by Serb forces in the Drenica region.
	   The Albanians said some of the victims had their throats slit
and limbs cut off. They said a baby was left alive in a pool of her
dead mother's blood.
	   Drenica is the heart of ethnic Albanian rebellion in Kosovo. The
Serb crackdown in Kosovo started there Feb. 28.
	   Envoys of the six so-called Contact Group countries dealing with
former Yugoslavia met Milosevic on Monday and warned him to honor
demands for an immediate cease-fire in the Serbian province,
according to a statement by the French embassy in Belgrade.
	   Following the meeting, the diplomats from the United States,
Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy headed off for Kosovo.
	   On Monday, the premier of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia, said ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo had been
defeated and that the special forces would be withdrawn. Mirko
Marjanovic warned they could be sent back if the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army resumes attacks against police.
	   The statement was an apparent attempt to avoid NATO strikes on
Serbia because of the seven-month crackdown in Kosovo. The
onslaught has claimed hundreds of lives and sent more than 250,000
people fleeing their homes.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the KLA, which is fighting for
independence from Serbia, warned the world to act ``more justly,
swiftly and energetically, or the consequences of the Kosovo war
would be reflected in the whole of Balkans and wider.''
	   The rebels pledged to fight on despite a string of defeats which
have driven them from many of their former strongholds in the
province.
	   The leading ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic League of
Kosovo, dismissed the premier's statement as a ``manipulation of
the world public by the Belgrade regime,'' and called for an
``immediate NATO action in Kosovo to stop the humanitarian
catastrophe.''
	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians _ who make up 90 percent of the 2
million inhabitants _ favor independence.

Philippine Airlines workers protest management-union accord

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Estrada urging PAL workers to ratify agreement,

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ About 1,000 Philippine Airlines
workers marched to the presidential palace Tuesday to protest their
union's approval of a management plan to reopen the national
flag-carrier.
	   The agreement with management, reached Monday by a majority of
the union's board, was brokered in part by President Joseph
Estrada.
	   Asia's oldest airline, which owes creditors dlrs 2.1 billion,
closed last Wednesday after failing to persuade its ground crew
union to accept the rescue plan. Its closure left much of the
Philippines without air service.
	   The board agreed Monday to accept a 10-year suspension of the
union's collective bargaining agreement in exchange for continued
management recognition of the union and a guarantee of no cuts in
salaries or health benefits.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with its radical
wing saying a suspension of the CBA would violate workers' rights
and expose them to management abuses.
	   Abel Capili, a union board member opposed to the plan, said
protesters prefer a government takeover of PAL or a moratorium on
strikes of up to 10 years.
	   ``They are asking us to jump into a fire or a sea full of
sharks. We're given no other options,'' Capili said.
	   The agreement must still be formally approved by workers,
regulators and PAL's creditors. The union will hold a campaign
Wednesday in which workers will be asked to sign their names if
they support the plan, union president Alex Barrientos said.
	   A majority of the nearly 7,000 union members must approve the
agreement, he said.
	   Estrada urged the workers to ratify the agreement.
	   ``What more do they want? If PAL earns profit, they'll have a
share in that,'' he said. ``This is the best setup and I don't know
why some people still oppose it.''
	   Many of the workers who joined Tuesday's protest said they would
boycott the ratification.
	   The recovery plan would give workers 20 percent of the company's
stock in exchange for the 10-year suspension of their collective
bargaining agreement.
	   PAL officials said they can restart domestic flights Oct. 7 and
international flights two weeks later if the workers approve the
agreement.
	   PAL has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency crisis. It
says creditors have insisted on the CBA suspension before they will
accept a restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Estrada says the government is unable to take over PAL because
there is no money in public coffers to underwrite daily losses of
up to 45 million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount of
money it must repay to overseas creditors.
	   The Philippine flag carrier also was badly crippled by a 22-day
pilots' strike in June.

Forty 10th graders admitted to hospital after vaccination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Forty 10th grade students were treated in
hospitals for dizziness and nausea Tuesday, one day after they were
given tetanus shots at their public high school.
	   The Health Ministry said it was not immediately clear if the
students' condition was related to the shot, which is normally
given to all 10th graders in Jordan.
	   Preliminary investigations showed that the dosage, the vaccine
and its expiry date were all valid, said a senior ministry
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   But Dr. Najwa Khoury of the Jordan University Hospital said
doctors suspect an allergic response to the medicine.
	   The university hospital admitted 25 students, including five who
suffered from low blood pressure and fever, while the rest were in
other state hospitals.
	   ``They are in a stable condition and they seem to be okay now,''
Dr. Khoury said.
	   She said the students, mostly 15 years of age, will remain under
observation Tuesday.

Brazil's eternal optimism fades as Oct.4 election nears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians by nature are hardy
optimists, especially at World Cups and election time. But this
year they lost the Cup, and optimism about the national vote is
fading too.
	   With Brazil's economy staggered by a seemingly endless Asian
financial crisis, voters realize there's no quick fix and hard
times lie ahead.
	   On Oct. 4, some 100 million voters will choose a president, 27
governors, all 513 federal deputies, one-third of the 81-seat
Senate and 1,045 state legislators.
	   They almost certainly will re-elect President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, a 67-year-old sociologist who took office in 1995. Recent
polls give Cardoso about 47 percent of the vote, compared to 24
percent for his nearest rival, former labor leader Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva.
	   The only question seems to be whether Cardoso will win outright
or in a runoff against Lula. To win on the first ballot he needs
half the valid votes.
	   But the landslide is less an endorsement of Cardoso than a
grudging admission that there's little alternative _ and that it's
safer not to change horses in midstream.
	   ``He's not what I want, but look, he's going to win anyway, so
it's better to get it over with quickly,'' said Joao Carlos da
Cunha, a Rio taxi driver.
	   It's quite a change from four years ago, when Brazil won
soccer's World Cup and Cardoso was running for president on the
strength of the ``Real Plan,'' an anti-inflation program he had
devised as finance minister.
	   It was a phenomenal success. With a new, dollar-pegged currency
called the real, inflation was slashed and euphoric Brazilians
elected Cardoso on the first ballot.
	   But trade and budget deficits grew. Banks and businesses that
had survived on inflationary profits went under, and unemployment
rose. It stands at about 18 percent today, according to union
figures.
	   The government sold state companies to raise cash and promised
to cut spending. But civil service, social security and tax reforms
stalled in Congress, and Cardoso spent precious time pushing
through a constitutional amendment allowing his own re-election.
	   ``The government ... put off the painful changes, until the
international crisis put its nose to the grindstone,'' said David
Fleischer, a political scientist at the University of Brasilia.
	   The crisis hit late last year. Investors pulled dlrs 10 billion
from the country overnight, and the government jacked up interest
rates _ slowing the economy to a near standstill _ to lure them
back.
	   After a brief respite, the hard times resumed. Since August,
some dlrs 25 billion has fled abroad, as investors bet that Brazil
couldn't cover its huge budget deficit of around dlrs 60 billion.
	   Cardoso has warned of more budget cuts, belt-tightening, and
even more taxes.
	   ``What's at stake is not only our stability, so painfully won,
but our prosperity,'' he said. ``No magic can resolve this
overnight.''
	   Polls show most Brazilians think Cardoso is better prepared to
handle the crisis than Lula, who is making his third run at the
presidency.
	   The makeup of Congress isn't likely to change much, analysts
say. That means Cardoso probably will maintain his centrist
coalition majority _ although that won't make reforms any easier.
	   ``Congress knows he needs them and says 'Aha! He's weak!''' said
Alexandre Barros, head of the Brasilia-based consulting firm Early
Warning. ``Passing measures will be harder and more costly. I don't
see any possibility of improvement.''

Printer breakdown delays opening of Ward murder trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The trial of a former game warden charged
with the 1988 murder of British tourist Julie Ward did not begin
Tuesday because of a printer breakdown, defense attorney Keriako
Tobiko said.
	   Tobiko, who represents defendant Simon ole Makallah, said all
court proceedings from the day his client was arraigned July 21
until the day his case was turned over to the high court have to be
typed, printed and signed by the committing magistrate before they
are forwarded to the high court's criminal registry.
	   ``They (the proceedings) are on a diskette, but the high court
printer is not working,'' said Tobiko. He said he only learned of
the problem when he showed up at the court for the scheduled
opening hearing.
	   He said it is hard to tell when the trial will begin.
	   ``In my best estimate, maybe after a month,'' he said. ``It is
not unusual in this country for such delays. We measure time in
years because of the red tape involved.''
	   Makallah was committed to the high court two weeks ago to stand
trial for murdering Ward between Sept. 6 and 13, 1988 in the Maasai
Mara National Reserve.
	   Makallah was arrested July 17 in connection with the slaying of
the 28-year-old Ward, whose mutilated and charred remains were
found Sept. 13, 1988 in reserve near the Tanzanian border.
	   Officials first claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild
animals.
	   Two park rangers were subsequently arrested and tried for her
murder, but they were found innocent of all charges in June 1992.
Justice Fidahussein Abdullah criticized the police for conducting a
flawed investigation. Makallah was a prosecution witness.
	   At the time of his arrest, Makallah was an assistant director of
the Kenya Wildlife Service. He has not been removed from his post.
At the time of the murder, he was game warden in the reserve.
	   Tobiko and four other attorneys _ Pravin Bowry, Moitalel ole
Kenta, Isaac Lenaola and Gideon Solonka _ are defending Makallah.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of soldiers and police
remained on alert in the capital and other cities Tuesday as
Indonesia prepared to mark the anniversary of what the government
says was a failed communist coup 33 years ago.
	   The military has warned that anti-government groups might use
Wednesday's anniversary as an excuse to stage protests.
	   Rumors of possible unrest have spread through the city of 11
million people during the past week despite the presence of troops
and police across Jakarta.
	   The heavy security has been in place for almost a month to
counter rising student protests against the government, which is
struggling under the weight of the worst economic crisis since the
coup attempt more than three decades ago.
	   Jakarta police spokesman Lt. Col. Edward Aritonang downplayed
the significance of the rumors, but said security personnel would
remain on alert.
	   ``Jakarta is safe as usual,'' he said.
	   Sept. 30, 1965, was a bloody turning point in the history of the
sprawling Southeast Asian nation.
	   Six army generals were executed and their bodies tossed down a
well on the outskirts of Jakarta. The military at the time blamed
communists for the murders and swiftly crushed what they said was a
coup attempt.
	   The operation was led by Suharto, a major general, who later
replaced Indonesia's founding President Sukarno as head of state.
	   Tens of thousands are said to have been slaughtered in a
backlash against leftists during the following months.
	   The burgeoning Indonesian Communist Party was decimated and
remains banned to this day.
	   Suharto led Indonesia for 32 authoritarian years, but was forced
to quit in May after about 1,200 people were killed in a wave of
riots and protests against him.
	   The government solemnly commemorates the anniversary of the 1965
events every Oct. 1, the date the alleged plotters were stopped.
	   Last week, Indonesia's military claimed that university students
were planning to hold demonstrations across the country Wednesday.
However, student leaders have denied this.

Israeli Arabs observe general strike; some West Bankers join
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Arab citizens observed a general
strike Tuesday and in one Arab town scores of teen-agers hurled
stones at police for a third straight day to protest the
government's expropriation of a 125-acre olive grove.
	   In a show of solidarity, shops in several West Bank towns were
shut for an hour.
	   Israel has 1 million Arab citizens who make up 20 percent of the
population. Israeli Arabs have long complained of discrimination at
the hands of Israeli governments. Confiscation of Arab land is an
especially sore point.
	   The battle over land began Sunday in the town of Umm al-Fahm in
northern Israel when Israeli police dismantled a tent set up to
protest the expropriation of the olive grove. The land is to be
used for an army firing range, and the army said the land owner was
to be compensated with six times as much land elsewhere.
	   In response to the dismantling of the tent, hundreds of Umm
al-Fahm residents threw stones at police who responded with tear
gas and rubber bullets. The riots continued Monday and Tuesday.
	   In all, at least 55 protesters and 15 police officers were
injured.

Asian stock markets close mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
the key index in Kuala Lumpur slumping 2.5 percent after ousted
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was charged with corruption and
sexual misconduct.
	   Shares prices also closed lower in Tokyo, in reaction to two big
bankruptcies, and in Hong Kong, on profit-taking.
	   In Malaysia, the key Composite Index fell 9.75 points to 377.52.
	   ``It's demoralizing,'' a foreign institutional salesman at a
local bank-backed brokerage house said of the slew of depressing
news hitting the Malaysian market. The biggest news was the long
awaited arraignment of Anwar.
	   Anwar, who, according to a lawyer, had visible bruises from
police violence, pleaded innocent for the beginning of what could
be a landmark legal case in the country. He has called the charges
politically motivated.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
87.94 points, or 0.63 percent, closing at 13,821.43. On Monday, the
Nikkei had gained 185.53 points, or 1.35 percent.
	   Investors sold stocks after news that Japan Leasing Corp., an
affiliate of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.,
filed for court protection under bankruptcy laws Sunday.
	   Further discouraging them, an auto leasing subsidiary of Japan
Leasing said Tuesday it also filed for bankruptcy.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 134.42 yen in late
afternoon, down 1.30 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and sharply
below its late New York level of 135.85 yen overnight.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Seng Index fell 108.43 points,
or 1.4 percent, closing at 7,837.61. On Monday, the index had
soared 3.2 percent, or 244.43 points.
	   Brokers said investors took profits following Monday's sharp
gains on expectation of a cut in U.S. interest rates.
	   Brokers said many investors stayed on the sidelines to await the
outcome of a meeting later Tuesday of the U.S. Federal Reserve's
Open Market Committee, which might cut interest rates.
	   However, South Korean share prices closed sharply higher after
employees called off a strike at South Korea's nine major banks
following a deal with management on the size and terms of layoffs.
	   The Seoul Stock Exchange's Korea Composite Stock Price Index
rose 6.60 points, or 2.2 percent, to 312.33.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower as investors anxiously awaited
third-quarter earnings reports. The market's key Weighted Stock
Price Index fell 26.11 points, or 0.37 percent, to 6,884.50.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers
saying the local market suffered from a lack of direction. The
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 11.69 points, or 0.6 percent, to
1,704.92.
	   MANILA: Share prices closed higher, boosted by expectations of a
cut in U.S. interest rates. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of
30 selected stocks rose 7.67 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,238.17.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher. The All
Ordinaries Index rose 12.00 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,603.6.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher on expectations of an
imminent cut in U.S. interest rates. The Straits Times Index rose
7.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 938.51.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesia shares closed higher. The Composite Index
rose 1.007 points, or 0.3 percent, to 276.008.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed little changed. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index slipped 0.18 points, or 0.1 percent, to

Report: Russian gets new tax chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS with 5 grafs on new tax chief, grafs 8-11 with Primakov
comments. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Desperate for cash, the Russian government on
Tuesday named a new tax chief who must try to quickly boost
revenues despite the country's severe economic crisis.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov indicated just how great the
challenge will be when he announced that government tax revenues in
September were only half of what had been hoped for, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   The premier, who gave no figures, planned talks with some of the
country's largest companies, which have not been paying their taxes
in full.
	   The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has played a
major role in the current economic crisis. The government has been
running a large budget deficit for years and regularly lacks money
to pay millions of state workers on time.
	   The government still does not have a detailed plan to combat the
country's economic crisis, but will unveil one by Oct. 8,
government spokesman Andrei Korotokov said Tuesday.
	   The latest man to take on the unenviable job of tax chief is
Georgy Boos, 35, a member of the parliament's budget affairs
committee and the moderate Our Home Is Russia faction.
	   Boos replaces Boris Fyodorov, who was dismissed by President
Boris Yeltsin on Monday. Fyodorov, a strong proponent of
free-market reforms, advocated tough monetary policy and has taken
tough action against tax dodgers in an effort to boost government
revenues.
	   Meanwhile, Primakov held talks Tuesday with regional leaders.
Some have threatened to withhold taxes they owe federal coffers,
and say they want the government to give them more power.
	   Primakov suggested that the regions work on restructuring the
tax system, but he ruled out non-payment of taxes. He warned that
the present crisis and the regions' desire for more independence
was creating a ``threat of separatism.''
	   Calling for ``the preservation of the integrity of the state,''
Primakov said the regions cannot go so far as to say ``they don't
want to pay taxes to the federal center.''
	   ``We must stop this feudal-type thinking, or we shall lose
Russia as a single state and our successors shall never forgive
us,'' he said.
	   Primakov announced Monday that the government had paid off back
wages to the military, and was planning to pay off debts for
student stipends, though he didn't say where the money had come
from. It is unclear exactly what portion of the wages were paid
off.
	   Primakov has made the payment of back wages one of the key goals
of his program to fight the country's punishing financial crisis.
	   He also said that food imports were way down in September, and
the government planned to slash rail tariffs by half for the
transportation of some food in order to move it to needy regions
more quickly.
	   Also, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov tried to calm foreign
investors Tuesday. Some of them have assailed the government for
favoring Russian banks as it tries to clear up its massive debts.
	   ``There will be no discrimination,'' he said. ``We will offer
all investors a choice between different (financial) instruments.''

Nippon Steel to withdraw from semiconductor chip production
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nippon Steel Corp. said Tuesday it will withdraw
from semiconductor chip production and sell all of its 56 percent
stake in its semiconductor subsidiary to a Taiwanese electronics
group.
	   At a news conference, Nippon Steel President Akira Chihaya said
the steep drop in semiconductor prices over the past year prompted
the company to sell its semiconductor unit to Taiwan's United
Microelectronics Corp. group.
	   The Japanese steelmaker will sell its 30,560 shares in Nippon
Steel Semiconductor Corp. for 50,000 yen (dlrs 370) each, a total
of 1.53 billion yen (dlrs 11.3 million), the company said.
	   The transaction will be completed by Dec. 15, it said.
	   United Microelectronics said it foresees growth potential in
Japan for integrated circuit design companies that have
manufacturing done elsewhere, as is the case in the United States.
The Taiwanese group expects its takeover of Nippon Steel
Semiconductor will help it tap the market.
	   United Microelectronic has a dedicated wafer foundry service and
other semiconductor-related businesses. The group said in a
statement that the infusion of its technology and foundry
management know-how into Nippon Steel Semiconductor will enable the
group to capture an early lead in the foundry market in Japan.
	   Nippon Steel will post a special parent loss of about 120
billion yen (dlrs 890 million) because of Nippon Steel
Semiconductor borrowings it has guaranteed and as it writes off
loans to the unit and liquidates another chip-making unit.
	   About 85 billion yen (dlrs 630 million) of the special parent
loss will be posted in the first half of the fiscal year ending
Sept. 30.
	   Nippon Steel said there is no change to its parent earnings
forecast as the special loss will be covered by the sale of assets.
On Sept. 4, Nippon Steel said it expects a parent net profit of
between 5 billion and 15 billion yen (dlrs 37 million and dlrs 110
million) this year on sales of 2.03 trillion yen (dlrs 15 billion).

Illness forces U.S. envoy to postpone Horn of Africa mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Former U.S. national security adviser
Anthony Lake has postponed his peace mission to the Horn of Africa
for a week because of illness, the U.S. Embassy said Tuesday.
	   Lake was scheduled to arrive in Asmara Tuesday in the second
U.S. bid to seek a solution to the five-month border conflict
between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
	   Lake's five-member team is now scheduled to arrive in Asmara
next Tuesday for talks with President Isaias Afwerki. The team then
travels to Ethiopia to meet with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
	   Neither Asmara nor Addis Ababa appears to be in a concilatory
mood.
	   On Sept. 17 the Eritrean leader accused Washington of
``complicating the problem right from the beginning.''
	   Four days later, Ethiopian state television accused Eritrea of
``once again undermining the peace efforts, this time before they
have even began.''
	   The simmering border dispute turned violent May 12 when four
Eritrean soldiers were shot dead during a meeting of Ethiopian and
Eritrean troops in the contested Badme region.
	   Subsequent air strikes and artillery bombardments on both sides
killed several hundred people.
	   Ethiopia accuses Eritrea of unlawfully occupying portions of its
territory and says no talks will be possible until Eritrea
withdraws. Eritrea has refused to do so.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice
led Washington's first, unsuccessful, peace mission to the region
in June.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a
30-year war.

Manila city council votes to ban movies of Hollywood actress Claire
</HEADLINE>
Danes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Manila's city council voted 23-3
Tuesday in favor of a resolution banning the movies of Hollywood
actress Claire Danes because of reported statements in which she
disparaged the city.
	   ``She is declared persona non grata. All her films will be
banned,'' said councilor Kim Atienza, the principal sponsor of the
resolution and a son of Manila's mayor.
	   ``We are a very hospitable people, but we cannot accept
irresponsible sweeping statements from irresponsible actresses,''
he said.
	   Danes, who appeared in the movies ``Romeo and Juliet,'' ``Little
Women,'' and ``The Rainmaker,'' was in Manila for several weeks
early this year to shoot scenes for the movie ``Brokedown Palace.''
Most of the sequences shot in Manila were done inside a dilapidated
psychiatric hospital.
	   Atienza earlier said the councilors had dismissed comments Ms.
Danes made in Vogue magazine in April describing Manila as a
``ghastly and weird city'' as ``mere irresponsible statements of
youth.''
	   But the actress went ``overboard'' in a recent interview with
Premiere magazine by saying Manila ``smelled of cockroaches, with
rats all over and that there is no sewerage system and the people
do not have anything _ no arms, no legs, no eyes,'' he said.
	   ``Definitely her statements insult us and make us lose visitors.
That is unacceptable,'' Atienza said.
	   But councilor Julio Logarta, one of the three who voted against
the resolution, said the ban was a curtailment of the freedom of
expression.
	   ``Any visitor to this country can make comments, positive or
negative,'' Logarta said. ``This resolution is in fact abridging
her rights. Most of what she said is true.''
	   Logarta also said the council has no authority to ban movies,
unlike the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board,
which is in charge of rating and approving motion pictures.
	   Ms. Danes' reported comments have also been widely debated in
newspaper columns and editorial pages, with some newspapers
castigating the actress and others saying the city council should
clean up Manila instead of criticizing the remarks.

Levi announces European closure plans, cites falling demand for
</HEADLINE>
jeans &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Levi Strauss Europe on Tuesday
announced plans to close four factories in France and Belgium with
the possible loss of 1,560 jobs.
	   The company, a unit of U.S. clothing manufacturer Levi Strauss
and Co., said it was forced to restructure because of falling
demand for denim jeans.
	   In a statement, Levi said the drop in demand was due to a
decline in the European youth population, a shift away from denim
products and increased competition from smaller ``own label''
brands.
	   Communications Manager Mark Elliott said the company started
talks Tuesday with workers' representatives on the proposed
closures. He said it was too early to say when the plants might
close.
	   Levi said it would set up a new management organization to
develop products ``that meet the needs of existing and potential
consumers.''
	   The proposed restructuring envisages laying off 931 production
staff at factories in the Belgian towns of Gits, Wervik and Deurne,
and 530 staff at a sewing plant in the northern French town of La
Bassee.
	   One hundred office employees across Europe could also face
layoffs over the next year.
	   ``We regret that these restructuring proposals might lead to
plant closures and layoffs, but these options have to be considered
given the current and future business realities,'' said Carl von
Buskirk, president of Levis Strauss Europe, Middle East and Africa.
	   The proposed layoffs would effect about 20 percent of Levi's
European workforce of 7,500. Apart from the French and Belgian
plants, Levi has manufacturing and finishing plants in Scotland,
Spain, Poland, Hungary and Turkey.

Electronics giant to spend dlrs 1.2 billion on chip plant in
</HEADLINE>
Singapore

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Royal Philips Electronics NV said
Tuesday it will build a new dlrs 1.2 billion chip production site
in a joint venture with Singapore with Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. and EDB Investments.
	   Philips revealed in January plans to build the new site with a
partner in Asia, but did not specify who that partner would be.
	   In a Tuesday news release, Philips said the new site will be set
up through a joint venture at Singapore's Pasir Ris Wafer
Fabrication Park.
	   Construction will start early next year and the facility will
open in the second half of 2000, Philips said.
	   Philips will be the major shareholder with a 48 percent stake in
the joint venture.
	   ``Timing is critical with a major investment like this,'' said
Arthur van der Poel, head of Philips' semiconductor division. ``Our
projections show that by the time this new facility comes on
stream, late in the year 2000, the market for logic chips will be
strong.''
	   Despite market doubts that this is the right time to be
investing in chip manufacturing, Van der Poel added that ``the
joint venture is a carefully thought-out investment in the future
of Philips semiconductors, one of the key profit centers of the
Philips group.''
	   According to the Amsterdam-based Philips, TSMC will take a 32
percent holding in the joint venture. The companies will be able to
use a respective 60 percent and 40 percent of the production
facility's capacity.
	   EDB Investments of Singapore will take the remaining 20 percent
share of the venture.

China's foreign exchange chief cites problems in capital control
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's pledge to keep its currency stable is
under pressure from companies engaging in fraud and other
underhanded practices to hold on to hard currency, a senior
government official said Tuesday.
	   The government recently issued an order warning businesses not
to circumvent China's strict foreign exchange controls. China has
protected the stability of its currency, the yuan, largely by
allowing it to be converted only for international trade, but not
for speculation.
	   Foreign exchange fraud has increased this year, Wu Xiaoling,
director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said at a
briefing.
	   ``Such practices have put pressure on the foreign exchange
market and are not beneficial to the balance of payments or the
stability of the yuan,'' Wu said.
	   She stressed that shoring up China's capital controls was part
of the government's efforts to keep the yuan stable, since a
devaluation ``is not in the interests of China and not in the
interests of the world.''
	   With a large foreign reserve and a trade surplus, China is under
no economic pressure to devalue the yuan, Ms. Wu said. She
acknowledged that many businesses nevertheless believe the yuan
will be devalued because of the Asian financial crisis.
	   But the government's dlrs 140 billion in foreign exchange
reserves has stopped growing this year as exporters hold on to more
of their hard currency earnings instead of remitting them to
Beijing as required.
	   She declined to say overall how much foreign exchange was being
held illegally. Some analysts estimate as much as dlrs 13 billion a
year moves outside the government's control.
	   The government is demanding that Chinese companies remit their
overseas earnings back to China by Oct. 1 to escape punishment.
	   Chinese companies also have tried to protect themselves from a
devaluation by taking such measures as paying for imports in
advance in violation of China's rules, Ms. Wu said.
	   Many also have obtained foreign exchange illegally by pretending
to be involved in foreign trade.
	   Since the government started inspections in July, it has found
several billion U.S. dollars worth of falsified import documents
for the purpose of obtaining foreign exchange or export documents
for obtaining tax rebates, Ms. Wu said.
	   Ms. Wu said the tighter measures to verify international
transactions would inconvenience traders, but argued that in the
long run a strong Chinese economy was more important.
	   A country as large as China cannot rely on devaluation to
stimulate economic growth, Ms. Wu said, repeating the government's
rationale for keeping the currency stable.
	   Devaluation would be of limited help in making China's exports
cheaper because exporters rely heavily on imported materials, which
would cost more.
	   But devaluation would certainly harm domestic confidence in the
economy, she said.
	   China sees increasing demand by its population of 1.2 billion as
the key to maintaining a high growth rate, targeted at 8 percent
for this year.

Indonesian government demands banks repay loans in cash, not
</HEADLINE>
assets &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's government is demanding
that the former owners of insolvent banks repay billions of dollars
in emergency loans from the central bank in cash, not assets,
Finance Minister Bambang Subianto said Tuesday.
	   ``The government has asked them to solve this problem and sell
their assets so they can pay in cash,'' Bambang told reporters.
	   ``They have one month to provide proposals on how they're going
to pay,'' he said after meeting President B.J. Habibie and other
senior economic ministers.
	   Bambang was referring to 14 banks closed or taken over by the
state. They include PT Bank Umum Nasional, which is part controlled
by a close associate of former President Suharto, Mohamad ``Bob''
Hasan.
	   The central bank, Bank Indonesia, injected liquidity into the
banks to offset the worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   However, the government later shut them down as part of sweeping
economic reforms.
	   The government originally gave banks until Sept. 21 to repay the
state. The owners of PT Bank Central Asia, the banking arm of the
Salim Group, and PT Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia have already
reached agreement with the government to pay back dlrs 7 billion in
the form of assets, cash and property.
	   After the deadline passed, the government said other banks'
owners who hadn't reached agreement could face civil or criminal
proceedings.
	   Some bankers have offered to hand over their assets in lieu of
cash payment. However, the government says the bankers have grossly
overestimated the worth of many of the assets.
	   ``This has to be worked out because the government is badly in
need of cash,'' he said.

Mubarak: Israel hypocritical in objecting to neighbors' arms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Israel should not object to other countries
acquiring arms when its own arsenal has nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in remarks
published Tuesday.
	   ``We see that Israel wants now to have nuclear weapons and
missiles and does not want others to have anything,'' Mubarak told
Egypt's leading Al-Ahram newspaper.
	   Israel has never acknowledged owning nuclear, biological or
chemical weapons but foreign intelligence and defense agencies say
it has all three. Western intelligence reports say Israel is the
only nuclear power in the Middle East and has a significant
stockpile.
	   ``Israel wants to own nuclear, biological and chemical weapons,
then it objects when we acquire a missile,'' Mubarak said.
	   Although Egyptian officials have frequently criticized Israel
for its military acquisition, it is unusual for Mubarak himself to
speak in such harsh terms about the Jewish state.
	   Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, but the two neighbors have shared a cold
friendship.
	   Mubarak said the Israelis have been talking about the growing
Egyptian military power in an attempt to cover up Arab concerns
about the new Israeli missile.
	   Israel announced Sept. 14 that its Arrow-2 missile successfully
destroyed a simulated target in the first comprehensive test of the
anti-missile's systems.
	   Mubarak's interview, to be published in parts on three days
beginning Tuesday, is to mark the 25th anniversary of the Oct. 6,
1973 assault when the Egyptian army crossed the Suez Canal into the
Israeli-held Sinai peninsula.
	   Mubarak was the commander of the air force during the assault,
which is hailed in Egypt as a great victory and a revenge for the
Arab forces' loss in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Israel had captured
Sinai in that war and had returned it only under the 1979 peace
treaty.
	   Mubarak also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for not working for peace.
	   Egypt wants peace to make the region stable ``but the method of
... Netanyahu is the method of hinting war every now and then,'' he
said.
	   ``He (Netanyahu) attacked the Oslo agreements, attacked the Camp
David agreement ... which opened the door for peace in the region
and led to the peace treaty with Egypt,''
	   ``War will not solve a problem, and if Netanyahu is hinting war,
I would like everybody to know that war does not solve a problem at
all,'' he said.

U.S. Air Force, Turkish union strike deal to end base strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ U.S. Air Force officials struck a deal
with a Turkish labor union on Tuesday, ending a 69-day strike at
NATO bases in Turkey just days ahead of a planned exercise, a union
official said.
	   ``The workers will return to their posts on Wednesday,'' said
Tevfik Mustu, a union official.
	   The breakthrough came when the air force agreed Monday to a 50
percent salary increase and no layoffs of the 1,800 striking
workers. Each worker will also get dlrs 800 in partial compensation
for lost wages, Mustu said.
	   The agreement comes just before the Oct. 1-21 NATO maneuvers in
Turkey, Greece and Italy.
	   The strike, which began July 23, closed down commissaries, gas
stations, dining halls and other facilities at Incirlik Air Base in
the south, a base in Ankara and another one in the Aegean port city
of Izmir.
	   U.S. and British planes use Incirlik to monitor Iraq's treatment
of the Kurds in northern Iraq.

Election of new head not before December
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian commentators called for a housecleaning of
the Italian Olympic Committee following the resignation of the
president amid a scandal over testing for banned,
performance-enhancing substances.
	   Mario Pescante had come under growing criticism from sports and
government officials after news reports that some required doping
tests were not being conducted properly or that the results had
disappeared.
	   ``The valiant gesture and the shame,'' said Italy's largest
sports daily, La Gazzetta dello Sport, in an editorial suggesting
that others officials resign.
	   In the meantime, the Olympic Committee will be run by the senior
vice president, Bruno Grandi, with the election of a new president
expected in December.
	   There is no apparent favorite. Candidates must have run a
national sports federation.
	   Pescante said he stepped down to ``restore calm to the
atmosphere and not because I believe I have responsibility.''
	   The committee oversees all sports _ amateur and professional _
in Italy. As head of the committee, Pescante became a target for
blame when Italian media reported that sports authorities were
failing to run all the required doping tests on pro soccer league
players.
	   Pescante has served as president of the committee since June
1993.
	   This year has seen a series of investigations into alleged
doping by Italian athletes. The probes were prompted by comments
from AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman, who said he was amazed by the
quick muscular development of some players.
	   One investigation, for the Italian Olympic Committee's doping
commission, ended in August without finding evidence of illegal
drug use, but did find that the use of legal muscle-builders is
widespread.

Forty high school students hospitalized after vaccination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Forty high school students, mostly 15 years
of age, were treated in hospitals for dizziness and nausea Tuesday,
one day after they were given tetanus shots.
	   The Health Ministry said it was not immediately clear if the
students' condition was related to the shot, which is normally
given to all 10th grade students in Jordan.
	   Preliminary investigations showed that the dosage, the vaccine
and its expiry date were all valid, said a senior ministry
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   But Dr. Najwa Khoury of the Jordan University Hospital said
doctors suspect an allergic response to the medicine.
	   The university hospital admitted 25 students, including five who
suffered from low blood pressure and fever, while the rest were in
other state hospitals.
	   ``They are in a stable condition and they seem to be okay now,''
Dr. Khoury said.
	   She said the students of the Ibn Abbas public high school will
remain under observation Tuesday.

With U.S. aid, Puerto Rico hurricane recovery proceeds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VILMA PEREZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Marines are coming _ and
thousands of Puerto Ricans suffering the ravages of Hurricane
Georges are glad to see them and the emergency supplies they are
bringing.
	   As damage reports mounted Monday, the U.S. military launched a
massive relief operation, ferrying in 1,800 tons of supplies from
the mainland to the U.S. Navy Station at Roosevelt Roads.
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile, was due in Puerto
Rico on Tuesday to survey Georges' damage and visit one of the 232
shelters housing more than 17,000 people left homeless by Hurricane
Georges.
	   The relief supplies arriving on U.S. Air Force C-5, C-17 and
C-130 cargo planes have included cots, medicine, drinking water and
generators, said Roosevelt Roads base spokesman Bob Nelson.
	   Several hundred U.S. Marines were en route to Puerto Rico to
install bridges, power-generating stations and water purification
centers, said Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Paul M. Lee Jr., chief of the
military task force.
	   Heavy-lift helicopters will carry temporary bridges to areas
where the hurricane washed away regular ones on Sept. 21.
	   ``We are prepared to help in any way and try to relieve some of
the discomfort,'' said Lee, commanding general of the 2nd Force
Service Support Group at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. ``Anything
we can do, we will.''
	   Officials in this U.S. territory released more details on storm
damage, tentatively estimated at dlrs 2 billion.
	   More than 90,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, Gov. Pedro
Rossello said Monday.
	   Just over half of Puerto Rico's 1.3 million electricity
customers had power restored by Monday, Rossello said, and
two-thirds of 1 million water customers had drinking water. Power
and water service won't be restored to all areas for about two
months, the governor added.
	   Agricultural losses surrounding the north coast city of Arecibo
reached dlrs 80 million, the island's agronomist association said.
Hard-hit were coffee, bananas and plantains. Thousands of cattle
were lost and dozens of farms and dairies were damaged.
	   To the west, Mayaguez Mayor Jose Guillermo Rodriguez put damages
in the coastal city at dlrs 250 million.
	   Island highways and roads sustained dlrs 18 million damage, said
Transportation Secretary Carlos Pesquera.
	   Still, more signs of normalcy returned. American Airlines,
Puerto Rico's main air bridge to the U.S. mainland, resumed a
normal 36-flight schedule Monday. Hoteliers across the island
rushed repairs, said Jorge Davila, head of Puerto Rico's government
Tourism Company.
	   Two well-known resorts _ El Conquistador, perched on a bluff in
the eastern town of Fajardo, and the nearby Westin Rio Mar _ will
reopen Oct. 1 and Oct. 7 respectively, Davila said.
	   Of 11,000 hotel rooms in Puerto Rico, 3,500 were temporarily out
of service because of the storm, he said. Blocked roads have closed
the Caribbean National Forest _ the only tropical forest in the
U.S. National Parks system _ but Forest Service personnel were
cleaning up.
	   ``I think Puerto Rico was very prepared for Hurricane Georges,''
Davila said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Now that Israel has agreed to give up another
piece of the West Bank, President Bill Clinton wants to know what
security assurances Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will offer in
return. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed at the
White House on Monday he was ready to withdraw from parts of the
West Bank provided the land would not be used as a base for attacks
on Israel. Before flying home to Israel for the holy day of Yom
Kippur, Netanyahu insisted the Palestinian Authority must do more
to prevent terror attacks by Islamic militants against Israel. In
his Tuesday meeting with Arafat, Clinton was expected to discuss
how the Palestinians will seek to allay Israel's security concerns.
The White House session was part of an accelerated drive by Clinton
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to conclude a West Bank
accord at the White House in mid-October. The key provision would
be withdrawal by Israel from 13 percent of the West Bank captured
in the 1967 Mideast war. (US-MIDEAST)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The environmentalist Greens, likely junior
partner in Germany's new government, play down worries that their
anti-military stand will make the nation an uncertain ally. Gerhard
Schroeder invited the Greens to form a governing coalition Monday,
after he swept from office Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Joschka Fischer,
the Greens' leading moderate and considered a possible foreign
minister, played down the party's standing call for scrapping NATO,
saying ``we don't want Germany to go down a separate path'' from
its allies. ``It will be difficult to govern the country with
rebellious policies,'' he said late Sunday on German television. On
Tuesday, Germany's power industry warned the Schroeder's Social
Democrats and the Greens against making good their campaign promise
of scrapping nuclear energy. Nuclear power accounts for about a
third of the nation's energy needs. (GERMANY-ELECTIONS)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, pleaded innocent Tuesday to nine charges
of corruption and illegal sex acts and claimed he was beaten
severely in detention. Anwar, who, according to a lawyer, had
visible bruises from police violence, made the plea after being
brought to a courthouse early in the morning for the beginning of
what could be a landmark legal case in this Southeast Asian nation.
A defense lawyer said the 51-year-old politician had asked the
court for an independent medical examination. Anwar replied, ``Not
guilty, I claim trial,'' as each charge was read out before Judge
Hasnah Hashim. He has contended that the charges are politically
motivated. After Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired him Sept. 2,
Anwar led a campaign against Mahathir's 17-year rule.
(MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is leaving
domestic politics _ and her husband's controversies _ behind as she
sets off on a trip to South America aimed at boosting the political
and economic advancement of women. The trip, planned long before
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr issued his report about President
Bill Clinton's relationship with White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, will be Mrs. Clinton's first solo journey abroad since
then, although she's already been on the road 10 days this month. A
congressional delegation and administrative officials, including
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, were
accompanying her to her first destination, Puerto Rico, scheduled
for late Tuesday afternoon, to tour areas devastated by Hurricane
Georges. Then Mrs. Clinton will head to Santiago, Chile, for the
annual meeting of the first ladies of the Americas, and then on to
Montevideo, Uruguay, for a Vital Voices conference, a U.S. foreign
policy initiative focusing on lifting women's political and
economic roles, expected to draw about 400 women from across the
Western Hemisphere. (MRS CLINTON-SOUTH AMERICA)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Senior diplomats were touring Kosovo
on Tuesday to see whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is
living up to his pledge to withdraw Serb-led special police as
demanded by NATO and the U.N. Security Council. Also Tuesday,
ethnic Albanians said they planned to bury 15 people, including
women, children and elderly people, who were allegedly massacred
Sunday by Serb forces in the Drenica region. The Albanians said
some of the victims had their throats slit and limbs cut off. They
said a baby was left alive in a pool of her dead mother's blood.
Drenica is the heart of ethnic Albanian rebellion in Kosovo. The
Serb crackdown in Kosovo started there Feb. 28. Envoys of the six
so-called Contact Group countries dealing with former Yugoslavia
met Milosevic on Monday and warned him to honor demands for an
immediate cease-fire in the Serbian province, according to a
statement by the French embassy in Belgrade. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
the key index in Kuala Lumpur slumping 2.5 percent after ousted
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was charged with corruption and
sexual misconduct. The key Composite Index fell 9.75 points to
377.52 after Anwar pleaded innocent to what he calls politically
motivated charges. Share prices also closed lower in Tokyo, in
reaction to two big bankruptcies, and in Hong Kong, on
profit-taking. In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average lost 87.94 points, or 0.63 percent, closing at 13,821.43.
Investors sold stocks after news that Japan Leasing Corp., an
affiliate of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., and
an auto leasing subsidiary filed for court protection under
bankruptcy laws Sunday. In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Seng Index
fell 108.43 points, or 1.4 percent, closing at 7,837.61. Meanwhile,
the U.S. dollar was quoted at 134.42 yen in late afternoon, down
1.30 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and sharply below its late New
York level of 135.85 yen overnight. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Federal Reserve policy-makers are expected to
cut U.S. interest rates for the first time in nearly three years on
Tuesday, acting on Chairman Alan Greenspan's alarm about a
deteriorating world economy. The question is how much success any
cut would have in containing a financial crisis that so far has
proven unstoppable and now threatens Brazil and other countries. A
reduction in interest rates by the Federal Reserve would boost the
U.S. economy by making it cheaper for American consumers and
businesses to obtain loans for big-ticket items. Stronger U.S.
demand in turn would help foreign countries that ship goods to the
United States. Emphasizing the urgency, international authorities
were busy working behind the scenes on a dlrs 30 billion rescue
package for Brazil. The largest economy in South America is being
hit by the same panicked rush to the exits by foreign investors
that has already flattened many Asian countries and Russia.
(US-FINANCIAL CRISIS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Desperate for cash, the Russian government on
Tuesday named a new tax chief who must try to quickly boost
revenues despite the country's severe economic crisis. Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov indicated just how great the challenge
will be when he announced that government tax revenues in September
were only half of what had been hoped for, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said. The premier, who gave no figures, planned talks with
some of the country's largest companies, which have not been paying
their taxes in full. The government's chronic inability to collect
taxes has played a major role in the current economic crisis,
leaving large budget deficits and no money to pay millions of state
workers. The latest man to take on the unenviable job of tax chief
is Georgy Boos, 35, a member of the parliament's budget affairs
committee and the moderate Our Home Is Russia faction. Boos
replaces Boris Fyodorov, who was dismissed by President Boris
Yeltsin on Monday. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ About 1,000 Philippine Airlines
workers marched to the presidential palace Tuesday to protest their
union's approval of a management plan to reopen the carrier. The
agreement with management, reached Monday by a majority of the
union's board, was brokered in part by President Joseph Estrada.
Asia's oldest airline, which owes creditors dlrs 2.1 billion,
closed last Wednesday after failing to persuade its ground crew
union to accept the rescue plan. Its closure left much of the
Philippines without air service. The board agreed Monday to accept
a 10-year suspension of the union's collective bargaining agreement
in exchange for continued recognition of the union and a guarantee

	   	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ A newly opened casino near Jericho has
broken a psychological barrier, bringing Israelis in droves to an
autonomous Palestinian city. Israelis love to gamble, but it is
illegal in Israel and until now they've had to travel outside the
region to place a bet. More than 25,000 people have passed through
the casino's doors since it opened 12 days ago. During last week's
two-day Jewish New Year holiday, an overflow crowd lined up on the
front steps waiting to enter. Casino staff had to keep hundreds of
people outside, letting them in one at a time as others left. The
operator, Casinos Austria of Vienna, is reportedly considering
opening a second casino if attendance remains high, according to
the Israeli daily Maariv. A casino official declined to comment on
the report. The casino is expected to provide an economic shot in
the arm for the Palestinian Authority, which stands to collect
millions in taxes. The resort will eventually employ 5,000
Palestinians. (ISRAEL-CASINO CRAZE)

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ A French court on Tuesday freed American
fugitive Ira Einhorn from jail and set a December date for a
hearing on a U.S. extradition request.
	   Judge Claude Arighi ruled that Einhorn must report to his local
police station once a week between now and the hearing, set for
Dec. 1.
	   This was the second time that French authorities have jailed and
released Einhorn, who has fled U.S. justice for nearly two decades
before being arrested last year.
	   Tuesday's hearing was the start of the renewed U.S. effort to
get Einhorn extradited for the 1977 murder of his girlfriend.
	   Einhorn, 57, wearing a scruffy black Tee-shirt, jeans and
sandals, appeared relaxed but focused during the approximately
50-minute hearing. He often smiled and made eye contact with his
wife, Annika Einhorn, a Swede.
	   ``The reason I want to be released is because of what prison
does to me,'' Einhorn told the judge. ``It has ruined my life.''
	   He pledged not to flee the country between now and December, but
the court nevertheless demanded the weekly police checks.
	   The hearing was the start of a new effort by U.S. justice to end
the nearly two-decade-long flight of Einhorn, once at the vanguard
of the 1960s New Age movement.
	   Einhorn was sentenced in absentia to life in prison in
Pennsylvania for the murder of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux -- a crime he
denies even though police found her corpse stuffed in a trunk in
his closet.

Parliament session delayed as Cambodian parties negotiate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with talks beginning; edits thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's sparring political
parties began more negotiations Tuesday aimed at forming a new
government, delaying the official opening of parliament.
	   The National Assembly, which had its ceremonial opening last
week, had been scheduled to start business Wednesday. Now, it
probably will have to wait until early next week because the agenda
has yet to be set, said Chan Ven, deputy secretary-general of the
last parliament.
	   ``We will discuss how to form the structure of the National
Assembly,'' said Sok An, representative for Hun Sen's ruling
Cambodian People's Party. ``If we can succeed, after this we will
discuss about the government.''
	   The parliament's presidency is coveted by both the ruling party
and the opposition because the president controls parliamentary
sessions and is acting head of state when King Norodom Sihanouk is
out of the country.
	   Delegates from Hun Sen's party and the opposition FUNCINPEC and
Sam Rainsy parties attended the opening ``working group''
negotiating session at the office of former parliament president
Chea Sim, a member of Hun Sen's party widely expected to retain the
post.
	   Hun Sen's party narrowly won a majority in the July 26 election,
claiming 64 of the 122 seats in parliament, but not the two-thirds
needed to form the government.
	   The opposition, winner of 58 seats, has claimed that Hun Sen's
victory was achieved through fraud and intimidation. The two
parties resisted forming a government until the allegations against
their rival are thoroughly investigated.
	   A quick agreement between the ruling party and the opposition
appeared doubtful as an official from the party of former Finance
Minister Sam Rainsy said election-related disputes must be
addressed before moving on to negotiations for the government.
	   ``Our delegation is going to show up and support the points
we've always been supporting,'' party spokesman Rich Garella said.
	   The pressure is on both opposition parties to form the
government sooner rather than later following two alleged attempts
on Hun Sen's life after the election.
	   The Cambodian leader _ who has claimed several plots on his life
in recent years _ blamed the opposition for the attacks and
threatened its leadership with arrest.
	   A foreign travel ban was imposed on all opposition lawmakers,
but the restriction was lifted last week after the opposition
attended the opening session of parliament.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy tested their freedom of movement by
flying to Bangkok, Thailand, on Friday.
	   Neither has returned to Cambodia amid government warnings that
several opposition figures will soon be called by the courts for
questioning about their roles in anti-government demonstrations
that followed the election.

Three shot dead when soldiers, police clash after soccer match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Three security personnel were fatally
shot after a soccer match between police and troops was followed by
a brawl on the island of Borneo Tuesday, police and witnesses said.
	   Two police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
two police officers and one soldier had died from gunshot wounds.
	   ``I just know that three people _ two policemen and a soldier _
were shot and are dead,'' one police officer said.
	   The clash broke out in Pontianak, about 800 kilometers (500
miles) north of Jakarta.
	   Other witnesses said soldiers from a cavalry unit and members of
the police special mobile brigade fought each other in a military
barracks.
	   Some witnesses said they heard gunshots and that some security
personnel had been wounded.
	   Earlier, the two sides played a soccer match as part of
celebrations ahead of national Armed Forces Day next Monday.
	   In Indonesia, the police force is part of the military.
	   However, in recent months there have been growing calls for the
police to be made a separate organization as part of a push for
greater democracy following May's resignation of autocratic
President Suharto.

Romanian president complains to Austria about pro-Hungarian lawyer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ President Emil Constantinescu took the
unusual step of accusing an Austrian lawyer of anti-constitutional
propaganda after she called for autonomy for Transylvania, media
reported Tuesday.
	   Saying he would not tolerate ``illegal manifestations,''
Constantinescu said he would write to Austrian President Thomas
Klestil about the matter, a statement from his office said late
Monday. It was not clear what Klestil should do.
	   Constantinescu asked the government to apply the law in cases
where someone ``urges racial, ethnic, class, or religious hatred or
pushes for territorial separatism and public violence.''
	   For years, Austrian lawyer Eva Maria Barki has been a thorn in
Romania's side with her criticism of the government's treatment of
the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarian minority.
	   Under former Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Barki was
active in denouncing his destruction of villages and forcing people
to move to urban areas.
	   She has often claimed the only answer to ethnic Hungarians'
problems in Romania is wide-ranging autonomy, the daily Adevarul
reported, quoting interviews she gave to Hungarian media.
	   The government banned her from visiting Romania from 1994 to
1997 because of her remarks which incensed authorities.
	   A few Romanians living in Transylvania, which was formerly part
of the Austro-Hungarian empire, recently have called for autonomy
of this northwest Romanian region, complaining of too much
centralism and bureaucracy.
	   Relations between Romania and Hungary improved after the two
historical foes signed a bilateral treaty two years ago. When
reformists won elections in November 1996, the party that
represents ethnic Hungarian interests joined the governing
coalition.

Mexican company wins bid for stake in Indonesian cement maker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia confirmed Tuesday that
Mexico's Cemex SA has won the second round of bidding for a 14
percent government stake in cement maker PT Semen Gresik, the first
sale in the government's privatization program.
	   ``Cemex won it as there were no other bids filed by other
competitors before Monday's deadline,'' Sofyan Djalil, a senior
official at the State Enterprises Ministry, told Dow Jones
Newswires.
	   Djalil said Cemex would pay dlrs 1.38 for each Semen Gresik
share, representing a total of dlrs 114.6 million for the 14
percent stake.
	   Indonesia originally planned to sell 35 percent of Semen Gresik
to Cemex, which would have ceded control of the company to the
Mexican cement maker.
	   That plan was subsequently shelved, however, after domestic
resistance to a foreign company controlling Semen Gresik forced the
government to change tack.
	   Under the latest agreement, Cemex plans to buy a minimum 6
percent of Semen Gresik shares through an open tender on the
Jakarta stock exchange at current market prices.
	   Shares of the cement maker plummeted on the news as investors
registered their disappointment with the sale price and the fact
that other buyers didn't enter the bidding process.
	   The Semen Gresik sale is one of 12 partial privatizations
planned by the government to raise badly needed cash for the state
coffers. The government originally intended to raise dlrs dlrs 1.5
billion this fiscal year from stake sales, but has since admitted
that target is unrealistic.

Israeli intelligence agents married Arab women as part of disguise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Plunging deep undercover, Israeli agents
infiltrating Israel's Arab communities in the 1950's married Muslim
women and even had children with them, an Israeli newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency sent agents into Arab
towns in the years after the 1948 creation of the state because it
questioned the loyalty of the Arab minority. About 1 million of
Israel's 6 million residents are Arabs.
	   The agents sent to the villages assumed false identities.
Several succumbed to social pressure and started families to avoid
suspicion, the Haaretz daily reported.
	   After seven years, when the special unit broke up, so did many
families. Some women took the abrupt revelation in stride,
converted to Judaism, and stayed with their husbands, the daily
said.
	   The unit's first commander, Shmuel Moriah, told Haaretz that the
idea was a mistake that eventually wreaked havoc on the agents'
personal lives. As late as the 1980's, the Shin Bet was dealing
with problems involving some of those families, he said.
	   Israeli security forces have carried out other undercover
operations, but usually involving agents who assumed disguises for
a brief period. During the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising, the
Israeli army ran undercover squads in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
with agents disguising themselves as Palestinians in order to track
down and arrest fugitives.

Australians will not front bribery hearing says Board
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with ACB ruling its players out of the hearings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Cricket Board has ruled out
any of its players appearing at hearings into match-fixing scandals
while on the current tour of Pakistan.
	   ACB chief executive Malcolm Speed issued a statement Tuesday
saying players would not be available to appear at the inquiry,
which took evidence from Pakistani players on Saturday.
	   It had been reported that members of the Australian touring
party would be likely called to appear now that they were back in
Pakistan for the first time since the controversial 1994 tour.
	   On that tour Mark Waugh, Shane Warne and Tim May alleged that
former Pakistan captain Salim Malik had offered them bribes to play
poorly in selected matches.
	   It is believed the commission is seeking evidence from Waugh and
Australian captain Mark Taylor.
	   ``The Australian Cricket Board has advised the Australian
players would not be attending any sittings of the judicial
commission into allegations of match-fixing and bribery,'' Speed
said. ``The Australian team was in Pakistan to play cricket and its
first commitment was to the opening test match starting in
Rawalpindi on Thursday.
	   ``The sitting days of the commission which were held each
Saturday were also incompatible with the team's program for the
tour.''
	   Both Taylor and Waugh have said they will be available to the
commission if required to appear but only given official approval
by the ACB.
	   The Australians have never attended a hearing in Pakistan to
discuss their 1994 allegations against Malik. Pakistan Cricket
Board chairman Khalid Mahmood was reported by The Australian
newspaper on Tuesday as saying that the chance to appear now is ``a
good offer to substantiate the allegations of four years ago.''
	   ``In the past the players couldn't come for various reasons but
now they are here and it's a great chance,'' the paper quoted
Mahmood as saying. ``If any of my players had leveled accusations
against any other team's player I would have encouraged him to
appear before the inquiry commission.''
	   The Pakistani High Commission in Canberra said the Australians
could not be ordered to front the hearings because they are covered
by diplomatic immunity.

Premier Nano resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Democratic Party saying resignation
not enough, calling for more protests. Trims &QL; 
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's Democratic Party said Tuesday
the resignation of Socialist Premier Fatos Nano was not enough and
demanded a ``technical'' government be set up to arrange new
elections.
	   Nano resigned Monday, two weeks after rioting in the wake of a
politician's assassination pushed the impoverished nation to the
brink of anarchy.
	   A statement of the Socialist Party said that Pandeli Majko, the
31-year-old general secretary of the party, would be the party's
candidate for prime minister.
	   Nano's resignation was a main demand by the opposition
Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha.
	   But the Democratic Party said Nano's move was not enough and
demanded appointment of a technical government that could rule for
up to a year, until new elections could be organized.
	   In a statement, the party said such a party would also establish
public order and work towards passing the constitution. A
parliamentary commission has drafted the constitution and wanted to
hold a referendum on Nov. 28 to pass it.
	   Until their demands are met, the Democratic Party said it would
continue holding street protests until their demands are met. They
called another protest for Wednesday.
	   Immediately after word of Nano's resignation spread in Tirana,
gunfire erupted in several parts of the capital city. But it was
not clear whether it was just celebratory shooting by his political
foes _ supporters of his arch-rival, former President Sali Berisha.
	   Nano became prime minister last year after his Socialist Party
of former communists defeated Berisha's Democratic Party in
parliamentary elections.
	   That internationally supervised ballot followed widespread
lawlessness and chaos that erupted with the collapse of phony
pyramid schemes in which many Albanians lost their life savings.
	   Before Nano resigned, Interior Minister Perikli Teta, a member
of the small Democratic Alliance, also quit under mounting pressure
for apparent failure to improve public security.
	   Majko's nomination to head a new government was seen as a
significant move to gradually part with officials who had been
associated the former Communist party that ruled Albania for 46
years.
	   Unlike Nano, Majko, a trained engineer respected for his
moderate stance, is not a former communist but took part in student
demonstrations in 1990 that helped topple the communists from
power.
	   Nano stepped down Monday, after he told President Rexhep Meidani
that he had been unable to put together a new Cabinet according to
his own wishes and ideas. He acknowledged his responsibility ``for
everything this government has not done'' and said that ``the
chances of coming out of the crisis are little.''
	   He also admitted that communication with international leaders
had become strained since political tensions increased between he
and Berisha. They reached fever pitch with the assassination by
unidentified gunmen of Azem Hajdari, a close Berisha associate on
Sept. 12.
	   Rioting began a day later with angry protesters burning the
first floor of the government building housing Nano's office as
well as seven government cars parked outside.
	   On Sept. 14, the day of Hajdari's funeral, rioters rampaged
through Tirana, taking control of state television and ravaging
Nano's office, parliament and other government buildings. At least
three people were killed in pitched battled with police and scores
were injured.

Philippine Airlines workers protest management-union accord

domestic flights in new 15th-16th grafs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ About 1,000 Philippine Airlines
workers marched to the presidential palace Tuesday to protest their
union's approval of a management plan to reopen the national
flag-carrier.
	   The agreement with management, reached Monday by a majority of
the union's board, was brokered in part by President Joseph
Estrada.
	   Asia's oldest airline, which owes creditors dlrs 2.1 billion,
closed last Wednesday after failing to persuade its ground crew
union to accept the rescue plan. Its closure left much of the
Philippines without air service.
	   The board agreed Monday to accept a 10-year suspension of the
union's collective bargaining agreement in exchange for continued
management recognition of the union and a guarantee of no cuts in
salaries or health benefits.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with its radical
wing saying a suspension of the CBA would violate workers' rights
and expose them to management abuses.
	   Abel Capili, a union board member opposed to the plan, said
protesters prefer a government takeover of PAL or a moratorium on
strikes of up to 10 years.
	   ``They are asking us to jump into a fire or a sea full of
sharks. We're given no other options,'' Capili said.
	   The agreement must still be formally approved by workers,
regulators and PAL's creditors. The union will hold a campaign
Wednesday in which workers will be asked to sign their names if
they support the plan, union president Alex Barrientos said.
	   A majority of the nearly 7,000 union members must approve the
agreement, he said.
	   Estrada urged the workers to ratify the agreement.
	   ``What more do they want? If PAL earns profit, they'll have a
share in that,'' he said. ``This is the best setup and I don't know
why some people still oppose it.''
	   Many of the workers who joined Tuesday's protest said they would
boycott the ratification.
	   The recovery plan would give workers 20 percent of the company's
stock in exchange for the 10-year suspension of their collective
bargaining agreement.
	   PAL officials said they can restart domestic flights Oct. 7 and
international flights two weeks later if the workers approve the
agreement.
	   Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific began flying six daily round-trip
domestic flights Monday to help fill the vacuum left by PAL's
closure. It is operating under a charter arrangement with PNB
Holdings, partly owned by the Philippine government.
	   On Tuesday, Hong Kong Dragon Airlines also signed an agreement
with the holding company to fly three other round-trip domestic
flights beginning Wednesday.
	   PAL has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency crisis. It
says creditors have insisted on the CBA suspension before they will
accept a restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Estrada says the government is unable to take over PAL because
there is no money in public coffers to underwrite daily losses of
up to 45 million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount of
money it must repay to overseas creditors.
	   The Philippine flag carrier also was badly crippled by a 22-day
pilots' strike in June.

Chechen war veterans condemn leader at congress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prominent Chechen war veterans accused the
president of the breakaway republic with ``aggravated crimes
against the Chechen people,'' in a sign of growing internal dissent
in the region, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   Opponents of President Aslan Maskhadov, including former rebel
leaders Salman Raduyev and Maskhadov's former prime minister,
Shamil Basayev, passed a vote of no confidence against him during a
congress of war veterans.
	   Raduyev, who gained fame for a hostage-taking raid on Russia
during Chechnya's 1994-96 independence war, said Maskhadov was
guilty of ``violating the constitution and the inability to rule
the country,'' according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Raduyev said Maskhadov deserved to be prosecuted and should step
down from his post for ``aggravated crimes against the Chechen
people,'' Interfax reported.
	   The president's critics included Basayev, who was prime minister
under Maskhadov for the first six months of this year. Since
stepping down, he has been increasingly critical of the president.
	   Maskhadov was a leading rebel commander during the war, but he
has been unable to bring law-and-order to the southern territory
since the fighting ended two years ago.
	   The Chechen opposition has refused to heed many of Maskhadov's
orders and has accused him of maintaining too-close relations with
Russia.
	   Maskhadov countered by saying that Raduyev deserves to be shot
in the capital city Grozny's Square of Peoples' Friendship, where a
number of public executions have taken place, Russian news agencies
said.
	   Chechnya claims to be a sovereign nation, but Moscow says it
remains a part of Russia.
	   Despite his fight for Chechen independence, Russia considers
Maskhadov a moderate and has been willing to negotiate with him.

Greens play down concerns over pacifist platform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with Greens' leader comments on defense
policies; new details, background &QL; 
 &UR; With Germany-How Kohl Lost &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The Greens, likely junior partner in
Germany's new government, played down worries that their pacifist
platform will make the nation an uncertain ally.
	   With future chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to start talks on a
coalition with the Greens on Friday, Germany's allies were closely
watching for clues of how the small party might affect defense
policy and therefore continent's balance of power. Schroeder on
Monday invited the Greens to join his government
	   Concerns over the Greens' influence were were grounded in the
Greens' standing call for the dissolution of NATO.
	   But Joschka Fischer, the Greens' leading moderate and considered
a possible foreign minister, played down the platform, saying ``we
don't want Germany to go down a separate path'' from its allies.
	   ``It will be difficult to govern the country with rebellious
policies,'' he said late Monday on German television. ``The point
is to make successful policies as a party in government.''
	   Schroeder himself has assured the world that Germany's foreign
policy will not change, and addressed concerns over the Greens'
role in setting the defense agenda during a press conference
Monday.
	   ``Nobody needs to be afraid. We will ensure continuity in
foreign policy,'' Schroeder said. ``The international community can
rely on Germans to remain good partners.''
	   Schroeder also made clear that the Social Democrats, as the
dominant partner, would not tolerate radical pacifist and
environmentalist causes pushed by many Greens.
	   In an interview with Der Spiegel news magazine, he warned the
Greens ``not to be pushy with their demands.''
	   Not only has Schroeder vowed to continue Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's foreign policies, but the future chancellor also said Monday
he consult his predecessor directly for advice on diplomacy.
	   As a first sign of continuity, Schroeder planned to visit Paris
on Wednesday in a symbolic trip to the capital of Germany's closest
European partner. Kohl made the same journey in 1982, when he, like
Schroeder, was elevated from state governor to the leader of the
nation.
	   The new government's defense policies could first be tested on
the issue of German involvement in possible NATO strikes in the
Serb-ruled Yugoslav republic of Kosovo. Schroeder deferred
questions Monday on Germany's role in threatened strikes, noting
that Kohl's government still technically was in power.
	   The outgoing Cabinet was to meet Wednesday to confirm Germany's
offer to deploy 14 fighter planes to participate in possible NATO
strikes. The offer requires no parliamentary action. However if
NATO were to call the air strikes, German participation would
require lawmakers' approval.
	   That would fall to the outgoing parliament if the decision came
before the new legislature is confirmed.
	   Germany's constitution gives no deadline for forming a
government, but the new parliament must convene by Oct. 27.

New spending cuts follow recession, credit downgrade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Prime Minister Jenny Shipley
announced fresh budget cuts worth 400 million New Zealand dollars
(U.S. dlrs 200 million) over two years Tuesday, the third major
package in five months to deal with the Asian crisis and falling
domestic output.
	   The three packages together will reduce government outlays by 1
billion NZ dollars (U.S. dlrs 500 million) over the next two years.
	   The latest spending cuts come days after figures showed the
economy officially in recession and U.S. credit agency Moody's
Investor Services downgraded New Zealand's credit rating from Aa1
to Aa2, the same level as Australia and Canada.
	   Among the latest measures are reductions in social spending on
pensions, a move to eliminate all import tariffs by 2006 and a
proposal to sell Contact Energy, a state-owned company generating
28 percent of the country's electricity.
	   Shipley unhitched state pension rates from indexation to the
average wage effective next April, tying them to inflation instead,
a move that will save 2.6 billion NZ dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.3
billion) over the next 10 years.
	   As a result, national pension payments will fall to 60 percent
of the average wage instead of the current 65 percent.
	   She said that in addition to these ``urgent economic matters,''
a series of new policies on housing, education, immigration,
tourism, investment and trade will be announced over the next six
weeks.
	   Shipley's new austerity and social policy program will test her
minority National Government's grip on power, after a falling out
with coalition partner the New Zealand First party in July.
	   The Parliament will debate the legislation Wednesday.
	   Together with minority ACT party members and independents, the
prime minister has a two-vote majority in the 120-seat Parliament.
	   Passing the program will challenge her ability to manage as a
minority government. Observers said Tuesday that if she succeeds in
ratifying the package, she will strengthen her hold on government.
	   ``We must make rapid progress to show that Parliament can act
when necessary,'' she told legislators.
	   ``It is only by being firm and resolute that this Parliament can
demonstrate that it has the political will and policy that New
Zealand needs.''
	   Opposition Labor leader Helen Clark said Shipley had no mandate
for her policies on pensions.
	   ``The path Mrs. Shipley and her ministers are embarked on is a
path that will lead to poverty and squalor for the elderly in this
country,'' she said.
	   To cheers from opposition members of Parliament, Clark said
Shipley should go to an election.
	   If the government retains its slim majority in Parliament, no
election needs to be held before November next year.

	   Government-held Jaffna, on the southern tip of this Indian Ocean
island, is linked to the rest of Sri Lanka only by air and sea
because of fighting between the army and secessionist ethnic Tamils
along the land route. Lionair, which owns the missing plane, is one
of two private companies providing civilian air service between
Colombo and Jaffna. The airline's planes normal flight path is over
the sea just along the coast, past areas held by rebels.
	   Two weeks ago, the Defense Ministry said the other airline,
Monara, had received an unsigned letter saying its planes would be
attacked if it did not cease service. Monara stopped flights for
two days, but then decided to resume.
	   It was not immediately clear if Lionair had received a similar
threat.
	   Though the letter to Monara was anonymous, suspicion fell on the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam separatists, who have tried to
sabotage attempts to restore normalcy on Jaffna.

	   Earlier this month, the rebels were blamed in a bombing that
killed the new mayor of Jaffna city, the main city on the
peninsula, along with military and police commanders.
	   Just a few months earlier, the previous mayor was shot and
killed while she met with residents. That attack also was blamed on
the Tigers.
	   The Tigers seized the city in 1990 and proclaimed a government
for the more than 1 million people who live in northern Sri Lanka,
where Tamils predominate. Sri Lanka's army retook the city in 1995
after a bitter 50-day offensive.
	   Maj. Gen. Lionel Balagalle, the peninsula's army commander, said
recently that only 100 rebels are active on the peninsula, carrying
out occasional attacks. The main force fighting for an ethnic Tamil
homeland has been driven across a broad lagoon into the jungles of
the Sri Lankan mainland.
	   In 1983, the rebels blew up a plane of the then-state-owned Air
Lanka on the ground at Colombo airport, killing 14 people. They
have not since attacked civilian planes.

NATO chief in Georgia for talks about Partnership for Peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Javier Solana is
expected to discuss Georgia's participation in the Partnership for
Peace program during a two-day visit that began Tuesday.
	   Solana arrived Tuesday afternoon, and was greeted at the Tbilisi
airport by Georgian State Minister Vazha Lordkipanidze, Foreign
Minister Irakly Menagarishvili and Defense Minister David Tevzadze.
	   He was expected to meet with the officials later in the day and
then with President Eduard Shevardnadze. The talks were expected to
focus on Georgian participation in the Partnership for Peace
program and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, Russian news
agencies said.
	   It is unlikely there will be any serious discussion of Georgia
joining NATO anytime in the near future. Interfax quoted the
Georgian ambassador to NATO, Zurab Abashidze, as saying Georgia is
not ready for such a step.
	   Even if it were, ``the factor of Russia, which is very
significant and down-to-earth, would have to be taken into
account,'' he said. Russia is strenuously opposed to former Soviet
republics joining NATO.
	   Solana was scheduled to leave Georgia on Wednesday for Baku,
Azerbaijan.

Philippine president supports possible wider strike ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ After brokering a suspension of a
collective bargaining agreement for workers at cash-strapped
Philippine Airlines, President Joseph Estrada on Tuesday supported
a possible halt to all strikes as the country struggles with its
economic problems.
	   ``If we are in an economic crisis, the whole nation is
affected,'' Estrada told reporters. ``Maybe we need a moratorium on
strikes. We should all unite and help each other.''
	   Some labor leaders have criticized Estrada for encouraging PAL's
largest union to accept a 10-year suspension of its collective
bargaining agreement in exchange for a 20 percent stake in the
airline for its workers.
	   Some PAL workers said they would boycott a vote Wednesday to
ratify the agreement, which militant labor leaders called a
sellout.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said the strike moratorium
has to be studied thoroughly.
	   ``We will take a look at, among others, the parameters regarding
any prohibitions on strikes, such as the industries involved, the
period of the ban, and the exceptions,'' Barican said.

election. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Russia's main election monitoring
body on Tuesday declared invalid the weekend vote for a new mayor
in the eastern port city of Vladivostok, a news agency said.
	   Russia's Central Election Commission said poorly drafted voting
laws in the Vladivostok region caused the ``collisions'' in the
balloting process, said Alexander Ivanchenko, the commission's
chairman, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The report did not specify what those laws were.
	   According to preliminary results, more than 50 percent of voters
in Sunday's election rejected all 12 candidates after incumbent
Mayor Viktor Cherepkov and one other candidate were removed from
the ballot at the last minute.
	   Local election officials agreed with the Central Election
Commission's decision. Official results are expected Oct. 1, but
preliminary results show the vote was invalid because of the
massive ``no'' vote, Ilya Grinchenko, head of the City Electoral
Commission, said Tuesday.
	   A city court ruled last Thursday that Cherepkov could not run
because he had illegally paid for his campaign with city money,
while city official Vladimir Murashov was barred because of
anti-Semitic statements.
	   The decision to remove Cherepkov outraged voters. He was widely
expected to win the race, and many saw the move as a politically
motivated attack by his enemies in the regional government.

Mexican company wins bid for stake in Indonesian cement maker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO RESTORE CYCLE DESIGNATOR &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia confirmed Tuesday that
Mexico's Cemex SA has won the second round of bidding for a 14
percent government stake in cement maker PT Semen Gresik, the first
sale in the government's privatization program.
	   ``Cemex won it as there were no other bids filed by other
competitors before Monday's deadline,'' Sofyan Djalil, a senior
official at the State Enterprises Ministry, told Dow Jones
Newswires.
	   Djalil said Cemex would pay dlrs 1.38 for each Semen Gresik
share, representing a total of dlrs 114.6 million for the 14
percent stake.
	   Indonesia originally planned to sell 35 percent of Semen Gresik
to Cemex, which would have ceded control of the company to the
Mexican cement maker.
	   That plan was subsequently shelved, however, after domestic
resistance to a foreign company controlling Semen Gresik forced the
government to change tack.
	   Under the latest agreement, Cemex plans to buy a minimum 6
percent of Semen Gresik shares through an open tender on the
Jakarta stock exchange at current market prices.
	   Shares of the cement maker plummeted on the news as investors
registered their disappointment with the sale price and the fact
that other buyers didn't enter the bidding process.
	   The Semen Gresik sale is one of 12 partial privatizations
planned by the government to raise badly needed cash for the state
coffers. The government originally intended to raise dlrs dlrs 1.5
billion this fiscal year from stake sales, but has since admitted
that target is unrealistic.

Sri Lankan plane missing after taking off from Jaffna

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A passenger plane carrying 55 people
is missing after taking off Tuesday afternoon from Sri Lanka's
troubled Jaffna peninsula en route for the capital, aviation
officials said.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said air
force planes and navy gunboats had launched a search. They said
those on board the Ukrainian-built Antonov-24 included two Russian
pilots, five Sri Lankan crew members and 48 Sri Lankan passengers.
	   Government-held Jaffna, on the southern tip of this Indian Ocean
island, is linked to the rest of Sri Lanka only by air and sea
because of fighting between the army and secessionist ethnic Tamils
along the land route. Lionair, which owns the missing plane, is one
of two private companies providing civilian air service between
Colombo and Jaffna. The airlines' planes normal flight path is over
the sea just along the coast, past areas held by rebels.
	   Two weeks ago, the Defense Ministry said the other airline,
Monara, had received an unsigned letter saying its planes would be
attacked if it did not cease service. Monara stopped flights for
two days, but then decided to resume.
	   It was not immediately clear if Lionair had received a similar
threat.
	   Though the letter to Monara was anonymous, suspicion fell on the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam separatists, who have tried to
sabotage attempts to restore normalcy on Jaffna.
	   Earlier this month, the rebels were blamed in a bombing that
killed the new mayor of Jaffna city, the main city on the
peninsula, along with its military and police commanders.
	   Just a few months before the bombing, the previous Jaffna mayor
was shot and killed while she met with residents. That attack also
was blamed on the Tigers.
	   The Tigers seized Jaffna in 1990 and proclaimed a government for
the more than 1 million people who live in northern Sri Lanka,
where Tamils predominate. Sri Lanka's army retook the city in 1995
after a bitter 50-day offensive.
	   Maj. Gen. Lionel Balagalle, the peninsula's army commander, said
recently that only 100 rebels are active on the peninsula, carrying
out occasional attacks. The main force fighting for an ethnic Tamil
homeland has been driven across a broad lagoon into the jungles of
the Sri Lankan mainland.
	   In 1983, the rebels blew up a plane of the then-state-owned Air
Lanka on the ground at Colombo airport, killing 14 people. They
have not since attacked civilian planes.

Taiwan keeps faith in open markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan remains committed to open markets
despite the Asian economic crisis, Finance Ministry officials said
Tuesday.
	   The removal of all restrictions on movement of capital by 2000
remains the ministry's target, although rules allowing remittances
of U.S. dlrs 5 million per person annually are already sufficient,
said Vice Minister Yen Ching-chang.
	   ``Up to now, we provide generous movements of capital,'' he
said.
	   ``If capital movements are totally free, we need to consider
short-term capital. The situation is still under consideration with
the central bank,'' he added.
	   More foreign banks will also be encouraged to set up branches
and representative offices to conduct business in Taiwan, Yen said.
	   Taiwan will also honor its pledges to cut real tariff rates _
the actual amount imports are charged _ from an average of 4.9
percent to 4.27 percent after joining the World Trade Organization.
	   The reduction will cost Taiwan an estimated 40.5 billion Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.17 billion) in lost revenue by 2002, said
Richard R.C. Liu, director general of the ministry's Department of
Customs Administration. But taxes paid by exporters enjoying lower
tariffs in markets abroad should more than make up the difference,
he said.
	   Taiwan has resolved trade issues with all 26 WTO members that
asked for negotiations, but still needs to sign final agreements
with three _ the European Union, Hong Kong and Canada, Liu said.
	   Taiwan so far has survived the massive regional downturn in
markets and currencies relatively unscathed, thanks to a healthy
banking system, almost non-existent foreign debt, and about U.S.
dlrs 85 billion in foreign currency reserves.
	   Its response has been to maintain its course, but the government
has stepped up spending to stimulate the economy and the central
bank earlier took measures to dampen speculation in the Taiwan
dollar.
	   Countries harder hit have taken more radical measures to shield
their currencies, and Malaysia virtually killed off speculation in
its currency at the beginning of the month with draconian
restrictions.

Tax analysis says no jobs in goods and services tax
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, , Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard's
election bid to push his economic reforms suffered a blow Tuesday
with an economic analysis of his goods and services tax finding it
could wipe out 200,000 jobs in the first year.
	   The analysis by Economic Modelling Bureau of Australia (EMBA)
director Colin Hargraves said the finding was based on higher
prices and lower demand in certain industries under a 10 percent
goods and services tax.
	   EMBA is associated with the Australian National University and
was formed in 1989 by prominent economists including Professor Fred
Gruen, former Treasury secretaries Tony Cole and Chris Higgins, Dr.
Vince Fitzgerald and Professor Jeffrey Carmichael.
	   But Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello rubbished the finding,
and said Hargreaves has refused to release full details of his
analysis.
	   Howard said the analysis failed to examine the benefits of the
tax package to consumers and the drop in the price due to the
abolition of a range of sales and state taxes.
	   Under the coalition tax plan, the government said higher
economic growth and 10.5 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6
billion) off the cost of export industries would lead to jobs
growth.
	   Costello said the EMBA analysis was unsubstantiated and wrong.
	   ``The statement has no modelling to back the assertions. It does
not disclose assumptions.''
	   Hargraves said the government needed to release a more detailed
model of its tax plan to work out the impact on jobs.
	   ``In the absence of any substantive information on the
employment effect flowing from a goods and services tax, the EMBA
estimates that the GST could destroy over 150,000 full-time and
50,000 part-time jobs in its first year of operation,'' Hargreaves
said.
	   He said jobs in labor-intensive sectors such as accommodation,
restaurants, property, business and recreation were most at risk.
	   Short-term job losses in mining and manufacturing were likely to
be quite
	   small and agriculture should escape unscathed.
	   ``The lost jobs may be replaced in the medium and long run but
no modelling work was presented in the tax plan to be able to
assess this,'' Hargreaves said.

Australian government to shop for early warning aircraft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A re-elected conservative government
would ``dramatically increase'' Australia's capacity to meet and
beat any potential enemy in its maritime approaches, Defense
Minister Ian McLachlan said Tuesday.
	   McLachlan, releasing the government's defense policy for the
national election on Saturday, said it would acquire airborne early
warning and control aircraft for this task.
	   Australia now does not have this kind of aircraft in its defense
arsenal.
	   ``Airborne early warning and control aircraft will dramatically
enhance Australia's air defense capabilities,'' McLachlan said.
	   He said other major projects in the government's second term, if
it wins re-election, would include:
	   _Reconnaissance and fire-support helicopters for the army.
	   _Upgrading weapons systems and sensors for the navy's guided
missile and ANZAC class frigates.
	   _Upgrading electronic and radar systems for Australia's F/A-18
Hornet aircraft.
	   _Purchasing a new tactical aircraft to replace the country's
present Caribou planes; and
	   _Bringing modified and refurbished amphibious transport vessels
into service.
	   McLachlan will not be a member of any new conservative
government. A farmer, he has announced that he will retire to his
property in South Australia.
	   He said he did not know who would succeed him if the
conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard is returned
in Saturday's election.
	   McLachlan used the opportunity to attack opposition leader and
former Labor Defense Minister Kim Beazley.
	   Specifically, McLachlan criticized Beazley's talk of possibly
scrapping the government's plans to upgrade Australia's F/A-18
Hornet fighter aircraft in favor of early replacement options.
	   McLachlan said it is not possible to buy replacement fighter
aircraft off the showroom floor.
	   ``None of these are yet in service with any air force in the
world,'' McLachlan said.
	   ``It would take around 10 years to develop a fully operational
combat fighter,'' he added.
	   ``In the meantime, the abandonment of the Hornet upgrade would
expose our fighter force to growing regional capabilities,''
McLachlan said.

Opposition says Albanian premier's resignation not enough
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's Democratic Party said Tuesday
the resignation of Socialist Premier Fatos Nano was not enough and
demanded a ``technical'' government be set up to arrange new
elections.
	   Nano resigned Monday, two weeks after rioting over a
politician's assassination pushed the impoverished nation to the
brink of anarchy.
	   A statement of the Socialist Party said that Pandeli Majko, the
31-year-old general secretary of the party, would be the party's
candidate for prime minister.
	   Nano's resignation was a main demand by the opposition
Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha.
	   But the Democratic Party said Nano's move was not enough and
demanded appointment of a technical government to rule for up to a
year, until new elections.
	   In a statement, the party said such a party would also establish
public order and work toward passing the constitution. A
parliamentary commission has drafted the constitution and wanted to
hold a referendum on Nov. 28 to pass it.
	   Until their demands are met, the Democratic Party said it would
continue holding street protests until their demands are met. They
called another protest for Wednesday.
	   Immediately after word of Nano's resignation spread in Tirana,
gunfire erupted in several parts of the capital city. But it was
not clear whether it was just celebratory shooting by his political
foes _ supporters of his rival, former President Sali Berisha.
	   Nano became prime minister last year after his Socialist Party
of former communists defeated Berisha's Democratic Party in
parliamentary elections.
	   That internationally supervised ballot followed widespread
lawlessness and chaos that erupted with the collapse of phony
pyramid schemes in which many Albanians lost their life savings.
	   Before Nano resigned, Interior Minister Perikli Teta, a member
of the small Democratic Alliance, also quit under mounting pressure
for apparent failure to improve public security.
	   Majko's nomination to head a new government was seen as a
significant move to gradually part with officials who had been
associated the former Communist party that ruled Albania for 46
years.
	   Unlike Nano, Majko, a trained engineer respected for his
moderate stance, is not a former communist but took part in student
demonstrations in 1990 that helped topple the communists from
power.
	   Nano stepped down Monday, after he told President Rexhep Meidani
that he had been unable to put together a new Cabinet according to
his own wishes and ideas. He acknowledged his responsibility ``for
everything this government has not done'' and said that ``the
chances of coming out of the crisis are little.''
	   Nano also admitted that communication with international leaders
had become strained since political tensions increased with
Berisha. Tensions boiled over after the assassination by
unidentified gunmen of Azem Hajdari, a close Berisha associate on
Sept. 12.
	   Rioting began a day later with angry protesters burning the
first floor of the government building housing Nano's office as
well as seven government cars parked outside.
	   On Sept. 14, the day of Hajdari's funeral, rioters rampaged
through Tirana, taking control of state television and ravaging
Nano's office, parliament and other government buildings. At least
three people were killed battling police and scores were injured.

Polish intellectuals call for resolution of Auschwitz cross

problem &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A group of Polish intellectuals, including
two Nobel laureates, has called on the government to end the
dispute over crosses near the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.
	   In a letter published Tuesday in Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper, the
signatories said the controversy over crosses on property adjoining
Auschwitz was harming Poland and its image in the world.
	   Jewish groups complain the crosses at a former Carmelite nunnery
disturb the memory of more than 1 million Jews killed by the Nazis
at Auschwitz and its sister camp at nearby Birkenau.
	   But Polish nationalists say the crosses commemorate 152 Polish
Catholic resisters killed by the Nazis on the site.
	   The crosses include a tall, wooden one erected in 1988 by the
Carmelites and more than 200 others added in recent months by
conservative Catholics protesting the possible removal of the
larger cross, which was the backdrop of a Mass celebrated by
Polish-born Pope John Paul II at Birkenau in 1979.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government indicated earlier this
year it would remove the papal cross, sparking protests by
conservative Catholics who erected the scores of smaller crosses.
Now the government says the smaller crosses will be removed once it
has completed a legal process to take control of the property from
a war victim's association that leases it.
	   ``The problem of Auschwitz crosses does not cease to trouble
Poles, offend Jews, and burden the world public opinion,'' said the
letter signed by six people, including Wislawa Szymborska and
Czeslaw Milosz, who won Nobel prizes in literature in 1996 and 1980
respectively.
	   They called on Buzek to end ``provocations and disturbances at
Auschwitz in order that we could bow with peace and dignity before
the ashes of martyrs.'' The letter urged the government to restore
order at Auschwitz, instead of ``hiding itself behind unnecessary
procedural problems.''
	   Other signatories were Jerzy Turowicz, longtime editor of
Tygodnik Powszechny, the Krakow-based lay-Catholic weekly;
historian Jozef Gierowski; literary critic Jan Blonski; and
philosopher Wladyslaw Strozewski.

	   OBRIJA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces launched new attacks
Tuesday south of the Kosovo capital Pristina, Albanian sources
said, despite government claims that it was withdrawing special
police units as demanded by NATO.
	   The attacks were reported as diplomats from the United States
and other countries visited some of the estimated 275,000 refugees
driven from their homes in the seven-month crackdown.
	   At this Kosovo village, the diplomats saw evidence of the
carnage _ the bodies of 15 Albanian men, women and children all
shot in the back of the head at the makeshift camp in the woods
where they had taken shelter.
	   The bodies of six women, four children and five men lay unburied
on the ground Tuesday, two days after Albanians said they were
massacred by the Serbs.
	   Two of the bodies had been decapitated. One woman was missing
her foot. One of the women was pregnant. Her stomach was cut open
and her head was in half by a gunshot.
	   One elderly man had his throat cut, apparently with his own
kitchen knife which lay on his chest. Residents of a nearby village
said masked Serb police forced one villager to show them where the
refugees were hiding, then shot him and the others.
	   The Albanians said a baby was left alive in a pool of her dead
mother's blood.
	   On Monday, Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic declared that
government forces had crushed the secessionist Kosovo Liberation
Army in the seven-month crackdown and that special police units
would be returned to their barracks.
	   He warned that troops could be sent back to the field again if
the rebels resumed attacks on Serb police.
	   NATO recently has stepped up plans for airstrikes against Serb
forces after repeated warnings that it would attack unless violence
ends in the restive province.
	   Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj said if NATO carries out threatened
strikes, Serbia would take hostage pro-Western Serbs who work for
independent media, peace and rights groups.
	   Despite Marjanovic's statement, the Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center reported ``heavy'' Serb attacks Tuesday around
the towns of Stimlje and Urosevac, about 30 kilometers (18 miles)
south of Pristina.
	   The center said smoke was billowing from several villages in the
area and that 700 civilians are trapped in at least one village
near Stimlje.
	   There was no statement from Serb sources and the reports could
not be independently confirmed. Kosovo is located in southern
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
	   Most ethnic Albanians _ who make up 90 percent of the 2 million
inhabitants _ favor independence.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army warned
the world to act ``more justly, swiftly and energetically, or the
consequences of the Kosovo war would be reflected in the whole of
Balkans and wider.''
	   The rebels pledged to fight on despite a string of defeats which
have driven them from many of their former strongholds in the
province.
	   The diplomats who visited Kosovo on Tuesday were from the United
States, Russia, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Austria,
representing the European Union.
	   Austrian envoy Wolfgang Petritsch said they ``came here to see
with our own eyes what is happening in Kosovo'' because of
conflicting claims by the government and humanitarian
organizations.
	   He said the envoys met Monday in Belgrade with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and told him that warnings by NATO and
the U.N. Security Council to halt the bloodshed must be ``obeyed in
full.''
	   ``That was unanimous point of view from the Russian, Americans
and Europeans,'' he said. ``We mean business that we are serious
about the resolution and about the consequences.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Levi Strauss Europe on Tuesday
announced plans to close four factories in France and Belgium with
the possible loss of 1,560 jobs.
	   The company, a unit of U.S. clothing manufacturer Levi Strauss
and Co., said it was forced to restructure because of falling
demand for denim jeans.
	   In a statement, Levi said the drop in demand was due to a
decline in the European youth population, a shift away from denim
products and increased competition from smaller ``own label''
brands.
	   Company officials said the French and Belgian plants were
singled out because of high labor costs and overcapacity.
	   The company needs to reduce that overcapacity ``and we do that
by closing high-labor cost plants,'' said Paul Scheltens, a
spokesman at the Levi Strauss Europe headquarters in Brussels.
	   Communications Manager Mark Elliott said the company started
talks Tuesday with workers' representatives on the proposed
closures. He said it was too early to say when the plants might
close.
	   Levi said it would set up a new management organization to
develop products ``that meet the needs of existing and potential
consumers.''
	   The restructuring envisages laying off 931 production staff at
factories in the Belgian towns of Gits, Wervik and Deurne, and 530
at a sewing plant in the northern French town of La Bassee.
	   One hundred office employees across Europe could also face
layoffs over the next year. No layoffs were announced for Levi's
European headquarters which employs almost 600 people.
	   ``We regret that these restructuring proposals might lead to
plant closures and layoffs, but these options have to be considered
given the current and future business realities,'' said Carl von
Buskirk, president of Levis Strauss Europe, Middle East and Africa.
	   The proposed layoffs would effect about 20 percent of Levi's
European workforce of 7,500. Apart from the French and Belgian
plants, Levi has manufacturing and finishing plants in Scotland,
Spain, Poland, Hungary and Turkey.

Inquiry finds deputy PM got corrupt payment in mercenary affair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Former Deputy Prime
Minister Chris Haiveta received a ``corrupt and improper payment''
that may have been connected to mercenary company Sandline
International's contract with the government, an inquiry found
Tuesday.
	   The report of the second Commission of Inquiry into the
government's contract with London-based Sandline, chaired by
Justice Sir Kubulan Los, was tabled in Parliament by Prime Minister
Bill Skate.
	   Skate announced the second inquiry into Sandline shortly after
he was elected in July 1997, after campaigning against the former
administration's aborted plan to use mercenaries to end the
10-year-old Bougainville secessionist crisis.
	   Haiveta on Tuesday denied the findings in the report, saying
they were ``simply untrue'' and had ``no basis in evidence.''
	   The inquiry found that Haiveta had bought a house in Port
Moresby and a part-payment was made in Australia with funds from a
Swiss account ``three months before the Sandline contract saga.''
	   ``Nevertheless the commission believes that it (the transfer of
funds) may
	   have been connected to that contract,'' the report said.
	   ``The commission has reached the irresistible conclusion that
the money Mr. Haiveta transmitted from Switzerland was a corrupt
and improper payment.''
	   The payment of 150,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 87,000) was
made in November 1996, from Switzerland to the Cairns bank account
of a doctor who was selling his house in Port Moresby to Haiveta.
	   The commission said the evidence on the purchase of a house by
Haiveta confirmed a suspicion based on other circumstances that
Haiveta had received a corrupt and improper payment.
	   The commission observed that Haiveta was a ``strong proponent''
of the Sandline contract and went to ``extraordinary means'' to
send U.S. dlrs 18 million to Sandline International in Hong Kong in
January 1997.
	   Haiveta had also falsely denied that he had deliberately planned
to meet Sandline personnel on a trip to Hong Kong in February 1997,
when a U.S. dlrs 500,000 cash withdrawal was made from the Sandline
account in Hong Kong.
	   The commission also observed that Haiveta had money and assets
acquired within the past 18 months which could not be wholly
accounted for from his and his wife's means.
	   In addition, Haiveta's evidence did not appear to be consistent
with income disclosed in the bank accounts held for himself and
Mrs. Haiveta.
	   The commission said Haiveta's credibility was in question and he
had avoided telling the truth to both Sandline inquiries.
	   Haiveta said in a statement that he had referred the report to
his lawyers and accused Skate of engaging in a ``political witch
hunt'' against him.
	   The first inquiry into the government's U.S. dlrs 34 million
contract with US-based Sandline International cleared Haiveta,
former prime minister Julius Chan and former defense minister
Mathias Ijape of allegations that they corruptly benefited from the
deal.

Six drug traffickers face trial in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Six people have gone on trial in northern
Vietnam on charges of trafficking in 10.4 kilograms (22.88 pounds)
of opium and 12 kilograms (26.4 pounds) of heroin, a legal official
said Tuesday.
	   The six belonged to a trafficking ring allegedly masterminded by
Nguyen Ngoc Phu, and were arrested last October when members of
another ring led by a police captain confessed their connection
with Phu's ring, said an official from the Ninh Binh provincial
prosecutor's office, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Thousands of people showed up at the provincial court building
Tuesday for the opening of the scheduled three-day trial. The
proceedings were broadcast over loudspeakers to crowds outside, the
official said.
	   Police Capt. Vu Xuan Truong and six associates in the earlier
case were executed by firing squad earlier this year.
	   Another 16 of Truong's associates, including some border guard
officers, received sentences of up to life in prison for smuggling
a huge amount of heroin into the country from neighboring Laos.
	   In July last year, Vietnam's legislature toughened the penalties
for drug trafficking. Trafficking in or possessing 1 kilogram (2.2
pounds) of opium or 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of heroin is punishable
by death or life imprisonment.
	   Despite the government's efforts, trafficking is on the rise in
Vietnam and drug abuse has spread to schools and colleges.
	   Courts have put more than 30 people to death over the past year
for trafficking convictions.

Ethiopian Airlines to resume flights to Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopian Airlines will resume
flights in November from Addis Ababa to the Sudanese capital
Khartoum after a three-year suspension, a senior official of the
state-owned airline said Tuesday.
	   Promotion and customer services manager Kagnew Fissiha told
reporters the national carrier will begin with two flights a week
between Addis and Khartoum.
	   The resumption of service is a sign of the growing improvement
in relations between Ethiopia and Sudan which were severely
strained in June 1995 after Ethiopia accused Sudanese intelligence
services of masterminding an assassination attempt on Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa.
	   Mubarak was on the way from the Addis Ababa airport to the
Organization of African Unity headquarters to attend a heads of
state summit when gunmen opened fire on his motorcade.
	   Mubarak escaped injury.
	   The Ethiopian government immediately ordered the airline to stop
flights to Khartoum and reduce from 20 to three the number of
Sudanese diplomats accredited in the Ethiopian capital.
	   Political analysts in Ethiopia say relations between Ethiopia
and Sudan have improved partly because of Ethiopia's border dispute
with Eritrea.
	   Eritrea and Ethiopia are Sudan's eastern neighbors.
	   Eritrea hosts the National Democratic Alliance, a grouping of
political parties from northern Sudan whose armed wing has been
hitting targets in eastern Sudan.
	   The NDA is allied with the Sudan People's Liberation Army which
has been waging a 15-year war for autonomy in the predominantly
Christian, African and animist south which has been traditionally
dominated by the Muslim and Arab-led north.
	   Eritrea also accuses Sudan of hosting Eritrean exiles opposed to
President Isaias Afwerki.
	   Ethiopian Airlines is the only carrier in eastern Africa with
direct flights to the United States. It operates a weekly flight
between Addis Ababa and Washington, D.C. with a stop in Rome.

Car explodes in West Bank industrial area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEITUNIA, West Bank (AP) _ A car exploded Tuesday in a
Palestinian industrial area in the West Bank, and witnesses saw a
covered body lying near the mangled vehicle.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has threatened to carry out
suicide bombings in Israel.
	   In the past, there have been several incidents in which Hamas
activists were either killed or injured in trying to rig a car with
explosives in preparation for an attack.
	   The blast came as Israel sealed off its borders to the West Bank
and Gaza Strip on the eve of the Yom Kippur holiday, or the Day of
Atonement, which lasts from sundown Tuesday to sundown Wednesday.
	   Israel routinely imposes a closure on the Palestinian
territories during Jewish holidays to prevent possible attacks by
Palestinian militants.

Sri Lankan government and Tamil rebels make counter claims on fate
</HEADLINE>
of two towns &QL; 
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan rebels claimed Tuesday to
have captured two key government-controlled towns after a fierce
fighting over the last three days killed 527 combatants.
	   But the government said it still controlled the towns of
Kilinochchi and Paranthan which lie on a 70-kilometer (45-mile)
highway on the nothern Jaffna peninsula that the military has been
trying to capture for more than a year.
	   The military said it killed 377 Tamil Tiger rebels and lost 150
soldiers since Sunday in the heaviest fighting this year. Another
300 soldiers were wounded.
	   The clandestine Voice of Tigers radio, monitored by civilians in
the northern government-held town of Vavuniya, admitted losing 240
fighters, but said they had overrun military defenses by Monday in
the towns of Kilinochchi and Paranthan.
	   There was no independent confirmation since the government has
barred journalists from visiting the battle zone in northern Sri
Lanka.The government imposed censorship in June on war reporting by
foreign and local reporters after fighting escalated in the north.
	   The clandestine radio said rebels were prepared to hand over the
bodies of soldiers to the International Committee of Red Cross.
	   The latest fighting erupted Sunday when Tamil Tiger rebels
attacked soldiers guarding the towns, nearly 280 kilometers (175
miles) north of Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital.
	   Since May last year, government forces have wrested control of
two-thirds of the highway, parts of which are controlled by the
guerrillas. Complete military control would open a land route to
the Jaffna peninsula, a former rebel stronghold in the north that
the army captured two years ago.
	   The government is relying on expensive air and sea deliveries of
food and other commodities to Jaffna's half-million residents in
the absence of a road link.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
widely discriminated by the majority Sinhalese who control the
government and the military.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in the fighting since
1983.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian commentators called for a housecleaning of
the Italian Olympic Committee following the resignation of the
president amid a scandal over testing for banned,
performance-enhancing substances.
	   Mario Pescante had come under growing criticism from sports and
government officials after news reports that some required doping
tests were not being conducted properly or that the results had
disappeared.
	   ``The valiant gesture and the shame,'' said Italy's largest
sports daily, La Gazzetta dello Sport, in an editorial suggesting
that others officials resign.
	   In the meantime, the Olympic Committee will be run by the senior
vice president, Bruno Grandi, with the election of a new president
expected in December.
	   There is no apparent favorite. Candidates must have run a
national sports federation.
	   Pescante said he stepped down to ``restore calm to the
atmosphere and not because I believe I have responsibility.''
	   The committee oversees all sports _ amateur and professional _
in Italy. As head of the committee, Pescante became a target for
blame when Italian media reported that sports authorities were
failing to run all the required doping tests on pro soccer league
players.
	   Pescante has served as president of the committee since June
1993.
	   This year has seen a series of investigations into alleged
doping by Italian athletes. The probes were prompted by comments
from AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman, who said he was amazed by the
quick muscular development of some players.
	   One investigation, for the Italian Olympic Committee's doping
commission, ended in August without finding evidence of illegal
drug use, but did find that the use of legal muscle-builders is
widespread.

Howard backs Malaysia for APEC meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on Tuesday
backed Malaysia as host country for November's Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting, despite recent strife.
	   Kuala Lumpur has been the scene of riots against Prime Minister
Dr. Mahathir Mohamad since finance minister Anwar Ibrahim was
arrested earlier this month.
	   ``I would not think there would be any difficulty in hosting
that meeting,'' Howard told reporters.
	   ``There's no reason why the conference should not go ahead.
	   ``It's very, very important that we go ahead with it and I would
encourage
	   other regional leaders to continue to treat APEC very
seriously.''
	   Howard described APEC as a ``great hope'' in the region,
bringing together heads of government from north America, Pacific
countries and Oceania.
	   Howard's endorsement of Malaysia for the APEC summit comes two
days after he said Malaysia seems to be undergoing ``a drift
towards a more authoritarian approach.
	   ``The image of somebody who is clearly a political opponent of
the current prime minister being arrested is very disturbing.''

Police chief sees terrorist threat to U.S. facilities in
</HEADLINE>
Philippines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The national police chief warned
congressmen Tuesday that recent terrorist attacks against U.S.
targets raise the risk for American facilities in the Philippines.
	   ``Renewed anti-American terrorist attacks warrant serious
concern in view of the presence of radical Muslim elements in the
country,'' said national police director Roberto Lastimoso.
	   Lastimoso was referring to the bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Tanzania and Kenya by suspected followers of Saudi exile Osama bin
Laden.
	   He said the local Muslim extremist group called Abu Sayyaf is
believed to be involved in bin Laden's network.
	   The group has also been linked to the convicted mastermind of
the World Trade Center bombing in New York in 1993, Ramzi Yousef,
who also allegedly plotted to kill Pope Paul II during the pope's
visit to Manila in January 1995.
	   Lastimoso said the campaign of terrorist organizations
``practically puts countries hosting U.S. installations in peril of
possible terrorist attacks.''
	   ``The retaliation of U.S. armed forces against bin Laden's
terrorist network could spark an `eye-for-an-eye' reaction, not
only against Americans but may also include several Israeli-Jewish
interests anywhere in the globe,'' he said.
	   During the Gulf War, two Iraqi agents in Manila tried to bomb
the Thomas Jefferson Cultural Center in suburban Makati City, but
the device exploded prematurely, killing one of them.
	   Aside from its embassy, the United States also maintains a large
residential seaside compound in Manila and a consulate in central
Cebu City.
	   Lastimoso, however, did not say whether these facilities were in
any immediate danger.
	   The Philippine military and police are known to work closely
with U.S. intelligence agencies and share information.

Inquiry finds deputy PM got corrupt payment in mercenary affair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Former Deputy Prime
Minister Chris Haiveta received a ``corrupt and improper payment''
that may have been connected to mercenary company Sandline
International's contract with the government, an inquiry found
Tuesday.
	   The report of the second Commission of Inquiry into the
government's contract with London-based Sandline, chaired by
Justice Sir Kubulan Los, was tabled in Parliament by Prime Minister
Bill Skate.
	   Skate announced the second inquiry into Sandline shortly after
he was elected in July 1997, after campaigning against the former
administration's aborted plan to use mercenaries to end the
10-year-old Bougainville secessionist crisis.
	   Haiveta on Tuesday denied the findings in the report, saying
they were ``simply untrue'' and had ``no basis in evidence.''
	   The inquiry found that Haiveta had bought a house in Port
Moresby and a part-payment was made in Australia with funds from a
Swiss account ``three months before the Sandline contract saga.''
	   ``Nevertheless the commission believes that it (the transfer of
funds) may
	   have been connected to that contract,'' the report said.
	   ``The commission has reached the irresistible conclusion that
the money Mr. Haiveta transmitted from Switzerland was a corrupt
and improper payment.''
	   The payment of 150,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 87,000) was
made in November 1996, from Switzerland to the Cairns bank account
of a doctor who was selling his house in Port Moresby to Haiveta.
	   The commission said the evidence on the purchase of a house by
Haiveta confirmed a suspicion based on other circumstances that
Haiveta had received a corrupt and improper payment.
	   The commission observed that Haiveta was a ``strong proponent''
of the Sandline contract and went to ``extraordinary means'' to
send U.S. dlrs 18 million to Sandline International in Hong Kong in
January 1997.
	   Haiveta had also falsely denied that he had deliberately planned
to meet Sandline personnel on a trip to Hong Kong in February 1997,
when a U.S. dlrs 500,000 cash withdrawal was made from the Sandline
account in Hong Kong.
	   The commission also observed that Haiveta had money and assets
acquired within the past 18 months which could not be wholly
accounted for from his and his wife's means.
	   In addition, Haiveta's evidence did not appear to be consistent
with income disclosed in the bank accounts held for himself and
Mrs. Haiveta.
	   The commission said Haiveta's credibility was in question and he
had avoided telling the truth to both Sandline inquiries.
	   Haiveta said in a statement that he had referred the report to
his lawyers and accused Skate of engaging in a ``political witch
hunt'' against him.
	   The first inquiry into the government's U.S. dlrs 34 million
contract with US-based Sandline International cleared Haiveta,
former prime minister Julius Chan and former defense minister
Mathias Ijape of allegations that they corruptly benefited from the
deal.

Nano resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to correct sequence
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's Democratic Party said Tuesday
the resignation of Socialist Premier Fatos Nano was not enough and
demanded a ``technical'' government be set up to arrange new
elections.
	   Nano resigned Monday, two weeks after rioting in the wake of a
politician's assassination pushed the impoverished nation to the
brink of anarchy.
	   A statement of the Socialist Party said that Pandeli Majko, the
31-year-old general secretary of the party, would be the party's
candidate for prime minister.
	   Nano's resignation was a main demand by the opposition
Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha.
	   But the Democratic Party said Nano's move was not enough and
demanded appointment of a technical government that could rule for
up to a year, until new elections could be organized.
	   In a statement, the party said such a party would also establish
public order and work towards passing the constitution. A
parliamentary commission has drafted the constitution and wanted to
hold a referendum on Nov. 28 to pass it.
	   Until their demands are met, the Democratic Party said it would
continue holding street protests until their demands are met. They
called another protest for Wednesday.
	   Immediately after word of Nano's resignation spread in Tirana,
gunfire erupted in several parts of the capital city. But it was
not clear whether it was just celebratory shooting by his political
foes _ supporters of his arch-rival, former President Sali Berisha.
	   Nano became prime minister last year after his Socialist Party
of former communists defeated Berisha's Democratic Party in
parliamentary elections.
	   That internationally supervised ballot followed widespread
lawlessness and chaos that erupted with the collapse of phony
pyramid schemes in which many Albanians lost their life savings.
	   Before Nano resigned, Interior Minister Perikli Teta, a member
of the small Democratic Alliance, also quit under mounting pressure
for apparent failure to improve public security.
	   Majko's nomination to head a new government was seen as a
significant move to gradually part with officials who had been
associated the former Communist party that ruled Albania for 46
years.
	   Unlike Nano, Majko, a trained engineer respected for his
moderate stance, is not a former communist but took part in student
demonstrations in 1990 that helped topple the communists from
power.
	   Nano stepped down Monday, after he told President Rexhep Meidani
that he had been unable to put together a new Cabinet according to
his own wishes and ideas. He acknowledged his responsibility ``for
everything this government has not done'' and said that ``the
chances of coming out of the crisis are little.''
	   He also admitted that communication with international leaders
had become strained since political tensions increased between he
and Berisha. They reached fever pitch with the assassination by
unidentified gunmen of Azem Hajdari, a close Berisha associate on
Sept. 12.
	   Rioting began a day later with angry protesters burning the
first floor of the government building housing Nano's office as
well as seven government cars parked outside.
	   On Sept. 14, the day of Hajdari's funeral, rioters rampaged
through Tirana, taking control of state television and ravaging
Nano's office, parliament and other government buildings. At least
three people were killed in pitched battled with police and scores
were injured.

U.S., Japan to work together on millennium bug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States and Japan will work together to
deal with the millennium computer bug problem, a U.S. official said
Tuesday.
	   The two countries have agreed to set up committees in five
areas, including finance and telecommunications, said John
Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, a group advising U.S. President Bill Clinton on the
issue.
	   ``The year 2000 problem is getting attention and has commitment
at the highest levels of the Japanese government and increasingly
in the private sector,'' Koskinen said after meetings this week
with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   Earlier this month, a special task force set up by Obuchi issued
a report urging large companies to test their readiness for the
potential turn-of-the-century crisis by staging mock exercises no
later than June 1999. Japan has been criticized as lagging in
efforts to deal with the Year 2000 problem.
	   The problem could set off crashes in those computers that only
recognize years by the last two digits and will not differentiate
between 1900 and 2000.
	   Koskinen said both sides discussed contingency plans if some
systems do not operate effectively in the future. They also talked
about helping Southeast Asian countries to cope with the problem.

U.S. Air Force, Turkish union strike deal to end base strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ U.S. Air Force officials struck a deal
with a Turkish labor union on Tuesday, ending a 69-day strike at
NATO bases in Turkey just days ahead of a planned exercise, a union
official said.
	   ``The workers will return to their posts on Wednesday,'' said
Tevfik Mustu, a union official.
	   The breakthrough came when the air force agreed Monday to a 50
percent salary increase and no layoffs of the 1,800 striking
workers. Each worker will also get dlrs 800 in partial compensation
for lost wages, Mustu said.
	   The agreement comes just before the Oct. 1-21 NATO maneuvers in
Turkey, Greece and Italy.
	   The strike, which began July 23, closed down commissaries, gas
stations, dining halls and other facilities at Incirlik Air Base in
the south, a base in Ankara and another one in the Aegean port city
of Izmir.
	   U.S. and British planes use Incirlik to monitor Iraq's treatment
of the Kurds in northern Iraq.

Top diplomats tour Kosovo following Milosevic pledge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with previous reports of Albanians massacring
Serbs &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OBRIJA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces launched new attacks
Tuesday south of the Kosovo capital Pristina, Albanian sources
said, despite government claims that it was withdrawing special
police units as demanded by NATO.
	   The attacks were reported as diplomats from the United States
and other countries visited some of the estimated 275,000 refugees
driven from their homes in the seven-month crackdown.
	   At this Kosovo village, the diplomats saw evidence of the
carnage _ the bodies of 15 Albanian men, women and children all
shot in the back of the head at the makeshift camp in the woods
where they had taken shelter.
	   The bodies of six women, four children and five men lay unburied
on the ground Tuesday, two days after Albanians said they were
massacred by the Serbs.
	   Two of the bodies had been decapitated. One woman was missing
her foot. One of the women was pregnant. Her stomach was cut open
and her head was in half by a gunshot.
	   One elderly man had his throat cut, apparently with his own
kitchen knife which lay on his chest. Residents of a nearby village
said masked Serb police forced one villager to show them where the
refugees were hiding, then shot him and the others.
	   The Albanians said a baby was left alive in a pool of her dead
mother's blood. Both sides have claimed ``massacres'' in the past.
Serbs have said that at least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and
killed near Glodjane in western Kosovo earlier this month after
they were ``kidnapped by the terrorists.''

Former U.N. weapons inspector says he asked Israel for help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A former U.N. weapons inspector said in an
interview Tuesday that he sought and received Israel's help several
years ago in tracking down Iraq's non-conventional arms program.
	   The inspector, Scott Ritter, told the Haaretz daily that he
asked Israel in 1994 to ``formulate analytical models, analytical
techniques and to advise on operational issues.''
	   Ritter did not provide details on how Israel helped the U.N.
Special Commission that supervises the inspectors.
	   The Washington Post, citing unidentified sources, said Israel
described trucks and depots used by Iraq in moving and hiding the
forbidden materials. Israel also told the inspectors that 40 tons
of a biological growth medium sold to Iraq by a British company
were not accounted for, the Post said.
	   Israeli government Moshe Fogel refused comment Tuesday on claims
that Israel assisted the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Ritter quit his job as a member of the U.N. Special Commission
last month, saying the United States and Britain undermined efforts
to uncover Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Ritter told Haaretz he contacted Israel because he felt its
approach to fighting terrorism could help in the search for
weapons. ``I believe that the methodology that Israel uses to hunt
down terrorists are the same methodologies we needed to use to go
after the weapons,'' he said.
	   A week after leaving his post, Ritter testified before Congress
that the Clinton administration deliberately blocked UNSCOM's
efforts in order to avoid confrontation with Iraq. U.S. Secretary
of State Madeline Albright denies the charge.
	   Ritter said Iraq would be able to reconstitute its biological
and chemical weapons capability and deliver a weapon of mass
destruction within six months of the end of U.N. weapons
inspections.

British boxing board appoints first female official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British Boxing Board of Control on Tuesday
appointed its first female official in the organization's 69-year
history.
	   Judith Rollestone, a commercial attorney from London, joined the
board's Panel of Administrative Stewards, the decision-making body
of domestic boxing.
	   Ms. Rollestone's appointment came less than 24 hours after the
Marylebone Cricket Club voted to admit women members for the first
time in 211 years.
	   ``This is an important appointment because Judith brings legal
expertise along with considerable knowledge of boxing,'' board
secretary John Morris siad. ``Obviously she can assist us as we
develop the female side of the sport but her involvement will go
far beyond that.''
	   Ms. Rollestone chairs the women's commission of the Amateur
Boxing Association of England. She holds a similar position with
the European Amateur Boxing Association.
	   Ms. Rollestone has been qualified as an amateur judge for the
past three years. She recently qualified as a referee.
	   ``I look forward to becoming more fully involved in the sport
and not simply with women's boxing,'' she said.
	   The British board recently issued its first licence to a female
boxer, Jane Couch, who is awaiting her first pro bout in Britain.

France's Insead to open campus in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The French business school Insead will start
building its first foreign campus in Singapore by the end of this
year and will offer a one-year MBA program to 45 full-time students
by January 2000.
	   The 60 million Singapore dollar (dlrs 35.5 million) campus, to
be built in Singapore's Science Hub, is part of the island
city-state's 10-year program to encourage top universities to open
branch campuses for research and post-graduate studies.
	   The Singapore Insead, which hopes eventually to have a student
body of 480, will be identical to the French institution based in
Fontainebleau, its associate dean, Arnoud De Meyer, was quoted as
saying Tuesday.
	   ``It will be truly a `one school, two campus' concept,'' The
Straits Times quoted him as saying. Entry qualifications,
curriculum, tuition fees and the mix of nationalities among the
students will be the same, the newspaper said. Students will be
encouraged to do part of their studies on both campuses.
	   The Singapore campus will also offer a shorter executive
education program, said Liew Heng San, managing director of the
Economic Development Board.
	   He said bringing international educational institutions to
Singapore will create ``a hotbed of ideas, encourage innovation and
creativity and boost the engines of economic growth.''
	   Previously, Singapore had reached an agreement with Johns
Hopkins University, based in Baltimore, Maryland, to set up a
Singapore branch.

Turkish Cypriot leader leaves for talks in U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
flew to New York Tuesday where he is to hold talks with United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   Denktash is expected to discuss the 24-year-old division of the
Mediterranean island, his proposal to establish a confederation of
two Cypriot states, and the planned deployment by Greek Cypriots of
Russian-made S-300 missiles.
	   The missiles have further exacerbated tension on the island
after UN-sponsored reunification talks stalled last year.
	   The Turkish Cypriot news agency said Denktash would also meet
U.S. presidential envoy Richard Holbrooke on Wednesday.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
the island following a short-lived coup by supporters of union with
Greece.
	   Denktash is also scheduled to hold talks in Canada, Norway and
Denmark.

Howard backs Malaysia for APEC meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on Tuesday
backed Malaysia as host country for November's Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation meeting, despite recent strife.
	   Kuala Lumpur has been the scene of riots against Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad since ousted Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim was
arrested earlier this month.
	   ``I would not think there would be any difficulty in hosting
that meeting,'' Howard told reporters.
	   ``There's no reason why the conference should not go ahead.
	   ``It's very, very important that we go ahead with it and I would
encourage other regional leaders to continue to treat APEC very
seriously,'' he added.
	   Howard described APEC as a ``great hope'' in the region,
bringing together heads of government from North America, Pacific
countries and Oceania.
	   Howard's endorsement of Malaysia for the APEC summit came two
days after he said Malaysia seemed to be undergoing ``a drift
toward a more authoritarian approach.
	   ``The image of somebody who is clearly a political opponent of
the current prime minister being arrested is very disturbing.''

Sri Lankan plane missing

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A plane carrying 55 people disappeared
Tuesday after taking off from Sri Lanka's troubled Jaffna peninsula
en route to the capital, aviation officials said.
	   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said air
force planes and navy gunboats were searching for the Antonov-24.
They said two Russian pilots, five Sri Lankan crew members and 48
Sri Lankan passengers were aboard.
	   Government-held Jaffna, on the northern tip of this Indian Ocean
island, is linked to the rest of Sri Lanka only by air and sea
because of fighting between the army and secessionist ethnic Tamils
along the land route.
	   Lionair, owner of the missing plane, is one of two private
companies providing civilian air service between Colombo, the
capital, and Jaffna. The airlines' normal flight path is over the
sea just along the coast, past areas held by rebels.
	   Two weeks ago, the Defense Ministry said the other private
airline, Monara, received an unsigned letter saying its planes
would be attacked if it did not cease service. Monara stopped
flights for two days, but then decided to resume.
	   It was not immediately clear if Lionair received a similar
threat.
	   Though the letter to Monara was anonymous, suspicion fell on the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam separatists, who have tried to
sabotage attempts to restore normalcy on Jaffna.
	   Earlier this month, the rebels were blamed in a bombing that
killed the new mayor of Jaffna city, the main city on the
peninsula, along with its military and police commanders.
	   Just a few months before the bombing, the previous Jaffna mayor
was shot and killed while she met with residents. That attack also
was blamed on the Tigers.
	   The Tigers seized Jaffna in 1990 and proclaimed a government for
the more than 1 million people who live in northern Sri Lanka,
where Tamils predominate. Sri Lanka's army retook the city in 1995
after a 50-day offensive.

Coca-Cola bottler sees shares fall on Russia worries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Shares in the European bottler Coca-Cola Beverages
PLC plunged 4.2 percent early Tuesday amid worries about business
in the former Soviet Union.
	   Coca-Cola Bottling, 50.1 percent owned by the Coca-Cola Co.,
warned that its full-year results will be affected by troubles in
Belarus and the Ukraine, where local currencies have been devalued
but raw materials must be purchased in hard currencies.
	   The profits warning came as Coca-Cola Beverages reported its
first half-year results since listing on the London Stock Exchange
earlier in the year.
	   Coca-Cola Beverages said it lost 2 million pounds (dlrs 3.4
million at current rates) for the half-year ending June 26,
compared with what would have been a stated profit of 12.6 million
pounds a year earlier.
	   Coca-Cola Beverages fell 6.5 pence (11 cents) per share to 149
pence (dlrs 2.53).
	   Analysts expressed concerns that sales growth in other markets
such as Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic had failed to
meet expectations.

Italian police break up big drug, money-laundering ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police said Tuesday they have broken up a major
international gang involved in drug trafficking and money
laundering, arresting 41 people in Italy, Spain and the
Netherlands.
	   The arrests came after a two-year investigation into the gang,
which is believed to have links to the United States and Latin
America.
	   Among those arrested were two fugitives, Primo Ferraresi and
Giuseppe D'alessandri, both convicted drug traffickers, the ANSA
new agency reported. Members of the `ndrangheta, the Calabrian
version of the Mafia, were also part of the organization.
	   Seven people were arrested in Spain, and two in the Netherlands,
all of them Italians.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
flew to New York Tuesday where he is to hold talks with United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   Denktash is expected to discuss the 24-year-old division of the
Mediterranean island, his proposal to establish a confederation of
two Cypriot states, and the planned deployment by Greek Cypriots of
Russian-made S-300 missiles.
	   The missiles have further exacerbated tension on the island
after UN-sponsored reunification talks stalled last year.
	   The Turkish Cypriot news agency said Denktash would also meet
U.S. presidential envoy Richard Holbrooke on Wednesday.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
the island following a short-lived coup by supporters of union with
Greece.
	   Denktash is also scheduled to hold talks in Canada, Norway and
Denmark.

Hundreds of Ukrainian nuclear plant employees demonstrate in Kiev
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ About 300 angry workers from Ukraine's
nuclear power plants demonstrated Tuesday at the government
headquarters and demanded overdue wages.
	   Wearing the white uniforms of nuclear plant operators, the
protesters from Ukraine's five nuclear plants occupied the pavement
in front of the Cabinet building, chanting, ``wages, wages,
wages.''
	   The demonstration began as union representatives were
negotiating with government officials on the delayed salaries, some
of which are six months overdue.
	   The government said Friday it planned to release 63 million
hryvna (dlrs 19 million), which is 10 million hryvna (dlrs 3
million) less than the total wage debt to nuclear plant employees.
But a final decision was still pending.
	   Ukraine's nuclear power plants account for about half of all
electricity generated in the former Soviet republic. But the plants
are owed hundreds of millions of dollars for electricity they have
supplied, and can barely make ends meet.
	   Officials from various nuclear plants have complained that most
of what the state owes them has already been lost because of a
recent sharp devaluation of the national currency.
	   Over the weekend, about 3,000 people demonstrated at the
Zaporizhia nuclear plant, while dozens of workers at the Yuzhnaya
plant have stayed for nearly a week at a self-made tent camp on the
plant's grounds.
	   Organizers have said their protest was not intended to hamper
the plants' work, and government officials said Tuesday they were
closely watching safety conditions at the nuclear facilities.
	   ``As soon as we see that a plant or a reactor is operating even
just a little below the necessary safety levels, we will
immediately shut it down,'' Environment and Nuclear Safety Minister
Vasyl Shevchuk said.

Car explodes in West Bank industrial area

<TEXT>
	   BEITUNIA, West Bank (AP) _ A car exploded Tuesday in a
Palestinian industrial area of the West Bank, and witnesses saw a
covered body lying near the mangled vehicle.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has threatened to carry out
suicide bombings in Israel.
	   There have been several incidents in which Hamas activists were
either killed or injured in trying to rig a car with explosives in
preparation for an attack.
	   The blast came as Israel sealed off its borders to the West Bank
and Gaza Strip on the eve of the Yom Kippur holiday, or the Day of
Atonement, which lasts from sundown Tuesday to sundown Wednesday.
	   Israel routinely imposes a closure on the Palestinian
territories during Jewish holidays to prevent possible attacks by
Palestinian militants.

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ A French court on Tuesday freed American
fugitive Ira Einhorn from jail and set a December date for a
hearing on a U.S. extradition request.
	   Judge Claude Arighi ruled that Einhorn must report to his local
police station once a week between now and the hearing, set for
Dec. 1.
	   This was the second time that French authorities have jailed and
released the 57-year-old Einhorn, once at the vanguard of the New
Age movement of the 1960s but for nearly two decades a fugitive
from U.S. justice.
	   He was found and arrested in June 1997 in southwest France,
where he lived in a converted mill.
	   Tuesday's hearing was the start of the renewed U.S. effort to
get Einhorn extradited for the 1977 murder of his girlfriend. A
Pennsylvania court had sentenced him in absentia to life in prison.
	   Einhorn's wife, Annika, a Swede, gasped as the ruling granting
her husband freedom was read out, then ran from the courtroom.
	   ``I'm very happy. I knew it, and I'm very confident,'' she told
reporters.
	   Mrs. Einhorn called the U.S. extradition request ``a legal
attempt to kidnap my husband,'' adding that it was ``100 percent
void of human rights.''
	   Einhorn's back was turned at the time the ruling was delivered.
He was then escorted out a side door and taken to the prison to
retrieve his belongings.
	   Wearing a scruffy black Tee-shirt, jeans and sandals, Einhorn
appeared relaxed but focused during the approximately 50-minute
hearing, often smiling at his wife.
	   ``The reason I want to be released is because of what prison
does to me,'' Einhorn told the judge. ``It has ruined my life.''
	   He pledged not to flee the country between now and December, but
the court nevertheless demanded the weekly police checks.
	   ``I will remain here. I want to live in France and stay in
France,'' Einhorn said.
	   The defense, arguing for his release, claimed there is
wide-spread bias in the United States against Einhorn.
	   ``Ira must be released because this will be evidence that France
is not a banana republic, bowing to U.S. pressure,'' said defense
attorney Dominique Tricaud.
	   Einhorn was sentenced in absentia to life in prison for the
murder of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux -- a crime he denies even though
police found her corpse stuffed in a trunk in his closet.
	   But in December a French court refused to extradite Einhorn,
citing a French law that would have required a retrial in
Pennsylvania.
	   Pennsylvania authorities then passed a law that would allow for
a new trial if Einhorn were extradited.
	   That prompted the United States to file a second extradition
request, and Einhorn was re-arrested on Sept. 20.
	   Einhorn, a prominent anti-war campaigner in the 1960s, was
courted by an international network of scientists, corporate
sponsors and wealthy benefactors drawn to his vision of a New Age.
He became a consultant for Bell Telephone of Pennsylvania and was
later a Harvard fellow.
	   Maddux, a former cheerleader from Tyler, Texas, repeatedly tried
to end her relationship with Einhorn, friends said. When she
disappeared, Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.
	   But her battered remains were found 18 months later, after
neighbors reported a stench coming from Einhorn's apartment.
Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.
	   Weeks before he was due to be tried, Einhorn -- granted bail
after wealthy contacts vouched for his character -- fled the United
States.
	   He fled to Ireland, Sweden and finally France, where he lived
discretely in Champagne-Mouton, near Bordeaux, in the heart of
French wine-growing country.
	   Neighbors said they thought Einhorn was a British author seeking
seclusion.

Tax analysis says no jobs in goods and services tax
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard's election
bid to push his economic reforms suffered a blow Tuesday when an
economic analysis of his goods and services tax concluded that it
could wipe out 200,000 jobs in the first year.
	   The analysis by Economic Modeling Bureau of Australia director
Colin Hargreaves said the finding was based on higher prices and
lower demand in certain industries under a 10 percent goods and
services tax.
	   EMBA is associated with the Australian National University and
was formed in 1989 by prominent economists including Professor Fred
Gruen, former Treasury secretaries Tony Cole and Chris Higgins, Dr.
Vince Fitzgerald and Professor Jeffrey Carmichael.
	   But Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello ridiculed the finding,
and said Hargreaves has refused to release full details of his
analysis.
	   Howard said the analysis failed to examine the benefits of the
tax package to consumers and the drop in prices due to the
abolition of a range of sales and state taxes.
	   Under the coalition tax plan, the government said higher
economic growth and 10.5 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6
billion) off the cost of export industries would lead to jobs
growth.
	   Costello said the EMBA analysis was unsubstantiated and wrong.
	   ``The statement has no modeling to back the assertions. It does
not disclose assumptions,'' he said.
	   Hargreaves said the government needed to release a more detailed
model of its tax plan to work out the impact on jobs.
	   ``In the absence of any substantive information on the
employment effect flowing from a goods and services tax, the EMBA
estimates that the GST could destroy over 150,000 full-time and
50,000 part-time jobs in its first year of operation,'' Hargreaves
said.
	   He said jobs in labor-intensive sectors such as accommodation,
restaurants, property, business and recreation were most at risk.
	   Short-term job losses in mining and manufacturing were likely to
be quite small and agriculture should escape unscathed, he said.
	   ``The lost jobs may be replaced in the medium and long run but
no modeling work was presented in the tax plan to be able to assess
this,'' Hargreaves said.

 &UR; Chechen war veterans condemn leader at congress &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new information in grafs 5-7, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Prominent Chechen war veterans accused the
president of the breakaway republic with ``crimes against the
Chechen people,'' the latest sign of growing dissent in the
southern territory, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Opponents of President Aslan Maskhadov, including former rebel
leaders Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, passed a vote of no
confidence against him during a congress of war veterans.
	   Raduyev, who gained notoriety for a hostage-taking raid in
Russia during Chechnya's 1994-96 independence war, said Maskhadov
was guilty of ``violating the constitution and the inability to
rule the country,'' according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Raduyev said Maskhadov deserved to be prosecuted and should step
down from his post for ``aggravated crimes against the Chechen
people,'' Interfax reported.
	   Maskhadov tried to blunt the criticism by taking over the
stadium where they had planned to hold the congress. The president
presided over a military ceremony at the stadium while the veterans
held their congress nearby.
	   But Maskhadov's move only further infuriated the congress.
Basayev, who was prime minister under Maskhadov for the first six
months of this year, has become increasingly critical of the
president since stepping down.
	   He said the president had ``distanced himself from the people''
and was ``unable to rule the country.''
	   Addressing his own group, Maskhadov called himself ``a
legitimate president'' elected by the Chechen people. He would not
allow anyone ``to spread rumors and lies'' about him, he said.
	   Maskhadov was a leading rebel commander during the war and won a
landslide election victory in January 1997. But he has been unable
to bring law-and-order to the southern territory since the fighting
ended two years ago.
	   The Chechen opposition has refused to heed many of Maskhadov's
orders and has accused him of maintaining too-close relations with
Russia.
	   Maskhadov countered by saying that Raduyev deserves to be shot
in the capital city Grozny's Square of Peoples' Friendship, where a
number of public executions have taken place, Russian news agencies
said.
	   Chechnya claims to be a sovereign nation, but Moscow says it
remains a part of Russia.
	   Despite his quest for Chechen independence, Russia considers
Maskhadov a moderate and has been willing to negotiate with him.

Official media: Thousands of civilians joining war in south Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Thousands of Sudanese civilians are
headed south to join the government's war against Sudanese rebels
and Ugandan troops, the official media reported Tuesday.
	   The mobilization follows an appeal on Monday by the government
for retired army officers to help he military's defense against
expected assaults by rebel forces.
	   Since Monday's call thousands of young men also have volunteered
and are traveling to the southern province of East Equatoria where
fighting has been raging since Sept. 14, state-run television and
Omdurman Radio said.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed. It was also
not possible to verify whether the civilians had volunteered or
were being forced to fight.
	   Sudan's Islamic government is known to conscript young men to
fight the largely animist and Christian rebels who have been waging
a military campaign since 1983 for more autonomy to the southern
districts.
	   Some 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.
	   Earlier this month, Sudan accused Uganda and Eritrea of sending
troops into Sudan to aid the rebels, a charge both countries deny.
Sudan, however, plans to complain to the United Nations and other
world bodies.
	   In comments published Tuesday, army spokesman Lt. Gen.
Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim said a fierce battle took place Monday
between government troops and ``the invaders and the traitors'' in
the Khor Angles area, about 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) south of
Khartoum.
	   Many Ugandans were killed, one tank was destroyed and another
was captured, Sirul-Khatim was reported as saying by the Al-Osboa
daily newspaper. The claim could not be independently verified.
	   Sirul-Khatim said Sudanese troops have destroyed or captured 17
Ugandan and rebel tanks since Sept. 14.
	   Meanwhile, some 7,000 government employees, who are required to
perform two years of military service, also have been asked to join
the war, said Kamal Hassan Ali, spokesman of the National Service
Coordination Committee.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Newly elected officials in
Bosnia can only comply with the peace process or face removal,
Carlos Westendorp, Bosnia's top international mediator, said
Tuesday.
	   ``We have no time to lose,'' Westendorp said before departing
for London where representatives of ``Contact Group'' countries
will discuss Bosnian election results and future strategies. They
include the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and
Russia.
	   In the months ahead, all Bosnian leaders will be pressed to
speed up peace implementation, especially the return of refugees,
enactment of property laws and reforms of police, media and the
judicial system, Westendorp said.
	   Western diplomats indicated that the faster pace is, among other
things, aimed at testing the new hard-line President of the
Serb-held part of Bosnia _ Nikola Poplasen.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Westendorp said he
will inform Western powers in London ``that we may have problems if
a new (Bosnian Serb) government is not Dayton friendly,'' a
reference to the 1995 Bosnian peace agreement.
	   The London meeting was urgently organized after the surprising
victory of Poplasen, who defeated Western-backed Biljana Plavsic.
	   Poplasen has said he will support Dayton, a key condition for
continued Western aid, but the West does not trust him. He has a
reputation of an ultranationalist and wartime paramilitary leader.
	   Aside from Poplasen's victory, international officials said
overall, the results of the Sept. 12-13 general elections were
encouraging because moderates showed significant gains in other
races, including the Bosnian Serb assembly.
	   The election ``is a step in the right direction, with one
exception _ Poplasen,'' Westendorp stressed.
	   ``This is a very symbolic exception,'' he said, listing several
possible moves to prevent Poplasen or anybody else from thwarting
the peace process: withholding financial assistance and removal of
officials opposed to Dayton.
	   As the president of the Bosnian Serb republic, Poplasen has the
power to nominate a new Prime Minister, but his candidate requires
approval in the 83-seat Bosnian Serb assembly where moderate
parties now hold a majority of seats.
	   The nomination will be the first test of Nikola Poplasen, who
was advised not to propose people from the Serb hard-line parties.
	   But Westendorp said removal of officials opposed to the Dayton
accord was a ``last resort.''
	   Western officials believe Poplasen will not use his second
presidential power _ to dismiss the assembly and call new
parliamentary elections. Expectations are that pro-Western parties
would gain even more seats in case of a new parliamentary ballot.
	   Westendorp said he has ``a lot of complaints'' and is ready to
use his powers against officials in the other Bosnian substate, the
Muslim-Croat Federation, too.
	   ``I am ready to accept the democratic result, the will of the
people ... as long as they support the Dayton,'' he said.

Parliament session delayed as Cambodian parties negotiate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting results, other details; edits thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's sparring political
parties began more negotiations Tuesday aimed at forming a new
government, delaying the official opening of parliament.
	   The National Assembly, which had its ceremonial opening last
week, had been scheduled to start business Wednesday, but a long
list of issues must be settled first.
	   ``We will discuss how to form the structure of the National
Assembly,'' said Sok An, representative for Hun Sen's ruling
Cambodian People's Party. ``If we can succeed, after this we will
discuss about the government.''
	   Delegates from Hun Sen's party and the opposition FUNCINPEC and
Sam Rainsy parties attended the opening ``working group''
negotiating session Tuesday at the office of former parliament
president Chea Sim, a member of Hun Sen's party widely expected to
retain the post.
	   A second meeting is expected to be held Oct. 5, and only after
that is parliament expected to meet, said FUNCINPEC delegate Pok
Than, a new member of parliament.
	   The parliament's presidency is coveted by both the ruling party
and the opposition because the president controls parliamentary
sessions and is acting head of state when King Norodom Sihanouk is
out of the country.
	   Both sides expressed optimism at a brief news conference after
Tuesday's session.
	   Hun Sen's party narrowly won a majority in the July 26 election,
claiming 64 of the 122 seats in parliament, but not the two-thirds
needed to form the government.
	   The opposition, winner of 58 seats, has claimed that Hun Sen's
victory was achieved through fraud and intimidation. The two
parties resisted forming a government until the allegations against
their rival are thoroughly investigated.
	   It was announced at the news conference that all three parties
agreed to send letters to the National Election Committee
requesting a reconciliation of used and unused ballots from July's
election.
	   The request to the NEC appeared to be a concession by Hun Sen's
party in response to the opposition's demands.
	   FUNCINPEC's Pok Than said that at their next session, the
parties would discuss the arrests of opposition supporters during
anti-government demonstrations and the threat of arrests against
opposition politicians. A disputed parliamentary seat allocation
formula is also on the agenda.
	   The pressure is on both opposition parties to form the
government sooner rather than later following two alleged attempts
on Hun Sen's life after the election.
	   The Cambodian leader _ who has claimed several plots on his life
in recent years _ blamed the opposition for the attacks and
threatened its leadership with arrest.
	   A foreign travel ban was imposed on all opposition lawmakers,
but the restriction was lifted last week after the opposition
attended the opening session of parliament.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy tested their freedom of movement by
flying to Bangkok, Thailand, on Friday.
	   Neither has returned to Cambodia amid government warnings that
several opposition figures will soon be called by the courts for
questioning about their roles in anti-government demonstrations
that followed the election.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Ruling and opposition parties in
Lesotho finally have agreed to meet and attempt to resolve problems
that led to last week's South Africa-led intervention, officials
said Tuesday.
	   ``It is quite clear that the process is now on to ensure a
peaceful solution,'' President Nelson Mandela said after a
90-minute meeting with the neighboring country's constitutional
monarch King Letsie III.
	   Talks were scheduled for Friday at the United Nations building
in the tiny mountain kingdom's shattered capital of Maseru. Since
the bloody Sept. 22 intervention, both sides have refused to meet
with the other.
	   Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili of the ruling Lesotho Congress
Party claimed his political opponents, working with mutineers of
the Royal Lesotho Defense Force, had plotted to assassinate him.
Mosisili requested the intervention.
	   In Maseru on Tuesday, residents resumed cleaning up the wreckage
of the arson and looting that followed the dawn intervention.
Government offices, schools and some undamaged businesses were
reopening.
	   The unofficial death toll, estimated by the South African Press
Association, was 114. The majority _ 67 _ were soldiers.
	   Political rivalries are at the heart of the unrest. Mosisili's
party won 79 of the 80 seats in parliament by garnering about 61
percent of the vote in national elections last May.
	   Seat distribution was by first-past-the-post system, not
proportional representation. Nevertheless, rivals _ notably the
Basotho National Party _ allege the election was rigged to favor
the now ruling party.
	   Both parties want to control government because patronage is key
in a poor country where most jobs are public. The Lesotho Defense
Force is politicized, analysts said, and the king _ who also wants
more autonomy _ seems to side often with the prime minister's
rivals.
	   Several hundred anti-government protestors still were camped in
the grounds of the royal palace. Mandela _ who barred questions to
King Letsie, who is supposed to be politically neutral _ said the
king had now agreed to ask the protestors to go back to their
homes.
	   Criticized for sending in troops so quickly, South Africa and
Botswana now want to pull them out, but not before the potentially
destabilizing issues that underlay the unrest are on the road to
resolution.
	   ``We have not got the resources to keep our forces there
indefinitely,'' Mandela said ``It is in our interests that there
should be a speedy resolution so that we can withdraw.''
	   Getting the government of Mosisili and opposition groups to talk
to each other is considered a potential breakthrough in the crisis.
	   Entirely surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is a country of two
million people and one of the poorest in the world.

Report: Russia gets new tax chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with details on tax collection, Zadornov
claiming revenues up, food imports collapse, Norilsk Nickel agrees
to cancel layoffs &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Desperate for cash, the Russian government on
Tuesday named a new tax chief who must try to quickly boost
revenues despite the country's severe economic crisis.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov indicated just how great the
challenge will be when he announced that government tax revenues in
September were only half of what had been hoped for, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   The prime minister, who gave no figures, planned talks with some
of the country's largest companies, which have not been paying
their taxes in full.
	   The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has played a
major role in the current economic crisis. The government has been
running a large budget deficit for years and regularly lacks money
to pay millions of state workers on time.
	   The government still does not have a detailed plan to combat the
crisis, but will unveil one by Oct. 8, government spokesman Andrei
Korotokov said Tuesday.
	   The latest man to take on the unenviable job of tax chief is
Georgy Boos, 35, a member of the parliament's budget affairs
committee and the pro-government Our Home Is Russia faction.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov introduced Boos on Tuesday
to the workers of the State Tax Service as their new chief, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Boos replaces Boris Fyodorov, who was dismissed by President
Boris Yeltsin on Monday. Boos' appointment was not immediately
confirmed by Yeltsin's office.
	   Fyodorov, a strong proponent of free-market reforms, advocated
tough monetary policy and has taken tough action against tax
dodgers in an effort to boost government revenues.
	   But with the economy in decline, and most bank accounts frozen,
tax collection has become increasingly difficult in recent weeks.
Primakov told his Cabinet that tax collections were half of
projections, and said the government was taking urgent measures to
improve matters, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   He has already said he intends to lower the tax rate to
encourage compliance.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov claimed that tax revenues were
up in September over August collections. However, he gave no
figures to back up the assertion, which contradicts statements by
the tax service last week.
	   Primakov, who held talks with regional leaders Tuesday, badly
needs a boost in tax collection to pay the government's many debts.
	   He announced Monday that the government had paid back wages to
the military, and was planning to pay debts for student stipends,
though he didn't say where the money had come from. It is unclear
exactly what portion of the wages were paid off.
	   Primakov has made the payment of back wages one of the key goals
of his program to fight the country's punishing financial crisis.
	   In another indication of the depth of the crisis, Primakov said
food imports had declined by 83 percent in September.
	   ``This situation has undermined the available food stockpiles in
the large industrial centers,'' he said, according to ITAR-Tass. He
added that the problem was exacerbated by Russia's poor harvest
this year.
	   The government's promised program to combat the crisis would
include greater state control, and would be ``aimed at protection
of the domestic producer, reforming of the tax system so that
producers feel an easing of the tax burden,'' Economics Minister
Andrei Shapovalyants said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   In one positive note, the giant Norilsk Nickel plant in northern
Siberia announced that it had reached an agreement with labor
unions allowing it to cancel plans to lay off as much as 40 percent
of its workforce.
	   The company did not describe the details of the agreement.

Sri Lankan plane missing after taking off from Jaffna

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A passenger plane carrying 55 people
disappeared Tuesday after from Sri Lanka's troubled Jaffna
peninsula en route to the capital, aviation officials said.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said air
force planes and navy gunboats had launched a search. They said
those on board the Ukrainian-built Antonov-24 included two Russian
pilots, five Sri Lankan crew members and 48 Sri Lankan passengers.
	   The plane left the Palali airport in Jaffna shortly after noon
(0700 GMT) and lost radio contact within minutes.
	   Government-held Jaffna, on the northern tip of this Indian Ocean
island, is linked to the rest of Sri Lanka only by air and sea
because of fighting between the army and secessionist ethnic Tamils
along the land route. Lionair, which owns the missing plane, is one
of two private companies providing civilian air service between
Colombo and Jaffna. The airline's normal flight path is over the
sea just along the coast, past rebel-held areas.
	   Two weeks ago, the Defense Ministry said the other airline,
Monara, had received an unsigned letter saying its planes would be
attacked if it did not cease service. Monara stopped flights for
two days, but then decided to resume.
	   It was not immediately clear if Lionair had received a similar
threat.
	   Though the letter to Monara was anonymous, suspicion fell on the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam separatists, who have tried to
sabotage attempts to restore normalcy on Jaffna.
	   The Tigers seized Jaffna in 1990 and proclaimed a government for
the more than 1 million people who live in northern Sri Lanka,
where Tamils predominate. Sri Lanka's army retook the city in 1995
after a bitter 50-day offensive.
	   In 1983, the rebels blew up a plane of the then-state-owned Air
Lanka on the ground at Colombo airport, killing 14 people. They
have not since attacked civilian planes.

	   BEITUNIA, West Bank (AP) _ A car rigged with large amounts of
explosives blew up Tuesday in a West Bank industrial area, killing
a Palestinian man and wounding two, Palestinian police said.
	   There was no immediate word on who was responsible for the
blast. Israel has been bracing for bombing attacks by the Islamic
militant group Hamas and on Tuesday sealed its borders with the
West Bank and Gaza Strip ahead of the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur
to prevent possible violence.
	   In the past, there have been several incidents in which Hamas
activists were killed or injured in trying to rig a car with
explosives in preparation for an attack.
	   The explosion went off in an industrial area of Beitunia, a
suburb of the West Bank town of Ramallah, at about 1:30 p.m. (1130
gmt). Palestinian police said the car had been rigged with large
amounts of explosives, but did not give an amount.
	   The force of the blast mangled and cut the car in half. It
killed Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, 35, from the West Bank village of
Biddou, said Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief in the
West Bank. The white car had Israeli license plates.
	   The two injured men, brothers from Biddou, were taken to nearby
Ramallah Hospital where they were placed under police guard, said
Ramallah Police Chief Kamal Sheik.
	   The scene of the blast was not far from where the body of the
chief Hamas bombmaker, Mohiyedine Sharif, was found in the spring
after a car explosion. The circumstances of Sharif's death remain
unclear.
	   Palestinian investigators have said Sharif was shot to death by
a rival in Hamas in a dispute over money and power, and that the
car explosion was staged to cover up the shooting.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II welcomed Spain's king and
queen to the Vatican on Tuesday as they returned for the first time
since attending the pope's installation in 1978.
	   Both men took rueful stock of the passing of their years.
	   John Paul greeted a grayer, plumper King Juan Carlos I this time
around.
	   ``We were 20 years younger,'' the 78-year-old pontiff said.
	   ``Yes, we were all younger,'' said Juan Carlos, 60.
	   Despite his words, John Paul was smiling and seemed hardy,
walking without a cane.
	   Queen Sofia attended in white, exempted from the restrictions
that etiquette dictates for commoners regarding suitable colors for
private audiences with the pope.
	   Juan Carlos _ born in Rome in his family's wartime exile _ is on
a five-day state visit to Italy.
	   He greeted well-wishers outside the Vatican before his audience.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin thanked defeated
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday for strengthening ties
between the two countries, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Yeltsin and Kohl, one of the Russian leader's staunchest allies,
held a ``warm and sincere'' telephone conversation, the news agency
said, quoting Yeltsin's press secretary, Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Kohl thanked Yeltsin for praising his personal contribution to
strengthening bilateral ties and expressed confidence that his
successor would continue the efforts, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Yeltsin's press service said the Russian president also planned
to speak to Gerhard Schroeder, who defeated Kohl in elections
Sunday.

	   OBRIJA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces launched new attacks
Tuesday in the southern Kosovo province, ethnic Albanian sources
said, despite government claims that it was withdrawing special
police units as demanded by NATO.
	   The attacks were reported while diplomats from the United States
and other countries visited some of the estimated 275,000 refugees
driven from their homes during the seven-month crackdown against
the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army rebels.
	   Most ethnic Albanians _ who make up the vast majority of the 2
million inhabitants _ favor independence.
	   On Monday, Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic declared that
government forces had crushed the KLA in the crackdown since
February and that special police units would be returned to their
barracks. He warned that troops could be sent back to the field
again if the rebels resumed attacks on Serb police.
	   Despite Marjanovic's statement, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center reported ``heavy'' Serb attacks Tuesday around
the towns of Stimlje and Urosevac, about 30 kilometers (20 miles)
south of Pristina.
	   The center said smoke was billowing from several villages in the
area and that 700 civilians are trapped in at least one village
near Stimlje.
	   There was no statement from Serb sources and the reports could
not be independently confirmed. Kosovo is located in southern
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
	   At the village of Obrija, the diplomats saw the bodies of 15
ethnic Albanians shot in the back of the head at a makeshift camp
in the woods where they had taken shelter. Residents of a nearby
village said masked Serb police forced one villager to show them
where the refugees were hiding, then shot him and the others.
	   The bodies of six women, four children and five men lay unburied
on the ground Tuesday, two days after Albanians said they were
massacred by the Serbs. Two of the bodies had been decapitated. One
woman was missing her foot.
	   One of the women was pregnant. Her stomach was cut open and her
head was shot in half. One elderly man had his throat cut,
apparently with his own kitchen knife left on his chest. The ethnic
Albanians said a baby was left alive in a pool of her dead mother's
blood. Both sides have claimed ``massacres'' in the past.
	   Serbs have claimed that at least 39 Serbs were tortured,
mutilated and killed near Glodjane in western Kosovo this month
after they were ``kidnapped by the terrorists,'' referring to
ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   NATO recently has stepped up plans for airstrikes against Serb
forces after repeated warnings that it would attack unless violence
ends in the restive province.
	   Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj said if NATO carries out threatened
strikes, Serbia would take hostage pro-Western Serbs who work for
independent media, peace and rights groups.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army warned
the world to act ``more justly, swiftly and energetically, or the
consequences of the Kosovo war would be reflected in the whole of
Balkans and wider.''
	   The rebels pledged to fight on despite a string of defeats which
have driven them from many of their former strongholds in the
province.
	   The diplomats who visited Kosovo on Tuesday were from the United
States, Russia, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Austria,
representing the European Union.
	   Austrian envoy Wolfgang Petritsch said they ``came here to see
with our own eyes what is happening in Kosovo'' because of
conflicting claims by the government and humanitarian
organizations.
	   He said the envoys met Monday in Belgrade with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and told him that warnings by NATO and
the U.N. Security Council to halt the bloodshed must be ``obeyed in
full.''
	   ``That was unanimous point of view from the Russian, Americans
and Europeans,'' he said. ``We mean business that we are serious
about the resolution and about the consequences.''

	   BEITUNIA, West Bank (AP) _ A car rigged with large amounts of
explosives blew up Tuesday in a West Bank industrial area, killing
a Palestinian man and wounding two people, Palestinian police said.
	   There was no immediate word on who was responsible. Israel has
been bracing for bombing attacks by the Islamic militant group
Hamas and on Tuesday sealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza
Strip ahead of the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur to prevent possible
violence.
	   Hamas activists have been killed or injured in the past while
trying to rig a car with explosives for an attack.
	   The explosion went off in an industrial area of Beitunia, a
suburb of the West Bank town of Ramallah. Palestinian police said
the car had been rigged with large amounts of explosives, but did
not give a figure.
	   The force of the blast mangled the car, cutting it in half. It
killed Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, 35, from the West Bank village of
Biddou, said Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief in the
West Bank. The white car had Israeli license plates.
	   The two injured men, brothers from Biddou, were taken to nearby
Ramallah Hospital where they were placed under police guard, said
Ramallah Police Chief Kamal Sheik.
	   The scene of the blast was not far from where the body of chief
Hamas bombmaker Mohiyedine Sharif was found in the spring after a
car explosion. The circumstances of Sharif's death remain unclear.
	   Palestinian investigators have said Sharif was shot to death by
a Hamas rival in a dispute over money and power, and that the
explosion was staged to cover up the shooting.

Former U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq says he asked Israel for
</HEADLINE>
help &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A former U.N. weapons inspector sought and
received Israel's help in tracking down Iraq's non-conventional
arms program, he was quoted as saying in an interview published
Tuesday.
	   The former inspector, Scott Ritter, was quoted as telling the
Haaretz daily that he asked Israel in 1994 to ``formulate
analytical models, analytical techniques and to advise on
operational issues.''
	   The paper said Ritter did not provide details on how Israel
helped the U.N. Special Commission that supervises the arms
inspectors.
	   The Washington Post, citing unidentified sources, said Israel
described trucks and depots used by Iraq in moving and hiding
forbidden materials. Israel also told the inspectors that 40 tons
of a biological growth medium sold to Iraq by a British company
were not accounted for, the Post said.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel refused comment Tuesday
on Ritter's reported claims.
	   Ritter, an American, quit his job as a member of the U.N.
Special Commission last month, saying the United States and Britain
undermined efforts to uncover Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in
1990, and has said it will not lift them until Baghdad eliminates
its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Ritter was quoted as telling Haaretz he contacted Israel because
he felt its approach to fighting terrorism could help in the search
for weapons. ``I believe that the methodology that Israel uses to
hunt down terrorists are the same methodologies we needed to use to
go after the weapons,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   A week after leaving his post, Ritter testified before Congress
that the Clinton administration deliberately blocked UNSCOM's
efforts in order to avoid confrontation with Iraq. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright denies the charge.
	   Ritter said Iraq would be able to reconstitute its biological
and chemical weapons capability and deliver a weapon of mass
destruction within six months of the end of U.N. weapons
inspections.

With German elections over, EU Commission cranks up money debate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Elections &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With the German elections out of the
way, the European Commission said Tuesday it will take a first
serious stab next month at proposals to revamp the EU budget to
prepare the club for more members.
	   Talks to reform farm subsidies _ which still gobble up half the
EU's dlrs 100 billion budget _ and craft a new funding formula for
the EU have so far sharply divided the union's 15 members.
	   Germany, under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, along with the
Netherlands, Sweden and Austria complain bitterly that they pay far
more into the EU then they get back in benefits.
	   This has upset others who worry EU membership is seen in money
figures just when taking in poor eastern neighbors should require
members to keep wallets and hearts wide open.
	   Additionally, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland want
assurances that special economic assistance for them will not be
lost to newcomers who are poorer than they are.
	   The money debate faces an informal deadline. It is hoped by the
end of March, 1999, EU governments can agree on new ways to fund
the EU. Closely related to that is the search for reform in
agricultural spending.
	   Sources said the Commission is looking at a number of new
funding options, such as:
	   _ re-nationalizing agricultural funding by letting member states
pay part of the EU farm subsidy program out of their national
budgets. Today, these costs are borne entirely by the EU budget.
	   _ limiting national contributions to the EU budget to a
particular percentage of gross national products.
	   _ removing value added taxes, levied in EU states, as a source
of revenue for the EU budget.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A propane gas canister bomb exploded
Tuesday outside an office housing a retired police officers club,
causing minor damages but no injuries.
	   The device, consisting of more than four gas canisters doused in
gasoline, exploded outside the empty first floor office in the
Zografos district of the capital. There was no immediate claim of
responsibility.
	   Similar devices have been used to torch more than 150 cars and
offices since January. They belonged to officials, politicians,
Jewish and anti-Semitic groups, diplomats, journalists and
foreigners.
	   Most have been claimed by shadowy groups little known to
authorities.

Azerbaijan president warns opposition against destabilizing

situation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Azerbaijan's president warned opposition leaders
boycotting upcoming presidential elections against
``destabilizing'' the situation in the former Soviet republic, a
news agency said Tuesday.
	   President Geidar Aliyev said he would continue to guard ``the
public and political stability and calm in Azerbaijan, its laws and
constitution,'' according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Aliyev cautioned the opposition against ``destabilizing the
socio-political situation in the country'' with their boycott,
Interfax said. He plans to go ahead with the elections on Oct. 11,
despite opposition calls to delay the vote.
	   Opposition leaders are boycotting the election because they
believe Aliyev is exerting too much power over the Caspian Sea
country's Central Election Commission.
	   Aliyev, who was Communist Party chief in Azerbaijan when it was
part of the Soviet Union, is expected to win by a large margin in
part because of the boycott call. He has ruled with a strong hand
but says he is committed to democracy and rule of law.

UBS memo promises employees answers about losses fast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ United Bank of Switzerland's top
management has promised its employees that internal inquiries of
the bank's large losses will produce answers by Friday, UBS
disclosed Tuesday.
	   Chairman Mathis Cabiallavetta and Chief Executive Marcel Ospel,
in an internal memo dated Monday, said they want ``absolute clarity
quickly about the decision-making processes and those responsible''
relating to the losses, which the bank revealed last Thursday.
	   They said it was understandable that after the announcement,
staff were ``ill at ease and have many questions.''
	   UBS disclosed losses of some 2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 1.4
billion) that would lead the bank to post a third-quarter after tax
loss of up to 1 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 720 million).
	   Much of the loss is accounted for by a 950 million franc (dlrs
689 million) charge the bank made to cover losses on its investment
in troubled private U.S. investment fund Long Term Capital
Management.
	   Long-Term Capital, a fund for wealthy investors run by some of
Wall Street's brightest minds, is getting a dlrs 3.5 billion
bailout from UBS and a consortium of 16 major banks and brokerages
to keep it afloat.
	   News of UBS' loss prompted a massive slide in its stock as
investors bailed out and analysts cut their earnings forecasts for
the bank.
	   Cabiallavetta and Ospel said the internal investigations had
been in place already before the disclosure of the losses last
Thursday.
	   ``We know you are finding yourselves in a difficult situation,''
the top executives told their employees. ``If your customers ask
questions, please respond in any case with self-confidence.''
	   The memo said the bank's management wants to convey to customers
that they are clients of a ``first-rate bank.''
	   ``UBS is very profitable, has a very strong capital base and
merits the confidence of its customers,'' said Cabiallavetta and
Ospel in the memo.
	   Swiss regulators plan to investigate UBS' risk management and
the absence of warning signals in the LTCM case.
	   UBS has said it lost income of 630 million francs (dlrs 454
million) on business in Russia and other emerging markets. It also
had a shortfall of 600 million francs (dlrs 432 million) in
equities transactions.

Outgoing U.N. coordinator in Iraq lashes out at U.N. sanctions

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The outgoing head of U.N. humanitarian
programs in Iraq said Tuesday he quit his job because he did not
want to be associated with the adverse impact of U.N. trade
sanctions on the country.
	   ``The fact that we in the United Nations have been obliged to
sustain ... the sanctions regime, for me is very unfortunate and
uncomfortable situation,'' Denis J. Halliday told a news conference
at the end of his 13-month tenure.
	   He said he is unhappy with the the way the U.N. dealt with the
Iraqi situation, imposing stringent resolutions on the one hand and
allowing a humanitarian program on the other.
	   The humanitarian program ``is underfunded, cumbersome, slow and
costly ... This is not a productive situation for anybody,'' said
Halliday, an Irishman.
	   Halliday, who had announced his decision to quit in July, leaves
his post on Wednesday. He will be replaced by Kofi Annan, the U.N.
chief, has named Hans von Sponeck, a German official with the
United Nations Development Program.
	   The U.N. Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq
oversees the distribution of food and other humanitarian goods that
Iraq purchases from money earned by the limited, U.N.-approved sale
of oil.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait ban
free sale of oil, its main export commodity.
	   Halliday said the oil-for-food program, which began in December
1996, has ``represented a shot of oxygen for the Iraqi people'' but
is still wrought with ``painful delays, frustration, politics and
bureaucracy.''
	   ``We are all familiar with children dying of leukemia and (the
program) has not been able to provide those sophisticated long-term
drugs,'' he said.
	   Halliday said he could not come to terms with the situation in
Iraq: ``It is a certain incompatibility between the various
resolutions of the Security Council, one imposing sanctions with
the results that we are very too familiar with and another imposing
a humanitarian program with all its shortcomings and politics.''
	   He said he will travel to Washington to brief 40 U.S.
Congressmen, ``these important decision makers, on the impact the
sanctions have had on the people and children of this country.''
	   Halliday, who joined the United Nations in 1964, was an
assistant secretary-general before taking up his Iraq post.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The European Union and the government
of Belgium on Tuesday handed over a rural development project to
the Thai government, an EU press statement said.
	   The project, launched in 1981, helped establish the largest
irrigation scheme in Nong Khai province, 510 kilometers (317 miles)
northeast of Bangkok.
	   The 40 million ECU (dlrs 46.47 million) project covered a wide
range of areas, including flood protection, infrastructure, crop
diversification, and farmers' participation in maintaining the
irrigation system.
	   ``The project has proved that by encouraging the formation of
strong farmer groups, the irrigation system can be maintained in
the long term, and crop production increased,'' the statement
quoted Michel Caillouet, EU ambassador to Thailand, as saying.

New Bosnian coins to be introduced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia will have its first
coins by November, and its citizens will stop receiving bubble gums
or small chocolates as change, the governor of Bosnia's Central
Bank announced Tuesday.
	   Bosnians were relieved by the new. The new currency _ the
convertible mark, was introduced early this summer. But so far only
banknotes have been printed.
	   ``If you're lucky you'll get German coins, if not you will get
bubble gums or something else'' as change, said Peter Nicholl, the
governor.
	   ``Oh, thank you, dear Lord,'' said Asima Kujundzic.
	   Working as a cashier in a supermarket near the Central Bank
building, Kujundzic always has her cash box filled with bubble gums
she calls ``my 10 pfennig coins.''
	   Coins worth some 70 million German marks will be minted in
Britain in 10-fening, 20-fening and 50-fening denominations.
	   The word fening is derived from the German word pfennig. The new
currency's official name is konvertibilna marka (convertible mark),
which equals one German mark, the currency to which it is tied.
	   Introduction of coins was delayed for months by Momcilo
Krajisnik, the former Bosnian Serb representative in the joint
Bosnian presidency, who couldn't agree about the design.
	   The current design _ with a map of Bosnia on the front and a
Bosnian flag at the back _ was finally approved by the top
international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, who has the
authority to arbitrate in case of a deadlock.

Israeli Arabs observe general strike; some West Bankers join
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Arab citizens observed a general
strike Tuesday and in one Arab town scores of teen-agers hurled
stones at police for a third straight day to protest the
government's expropriation of a 125-acre (50-hectare) olive grove.
	   In a show of solidarity, shops in several West Bank towns were
shut for an hour.
	   Israel has 1 million Arab citizens who make up 20 percent of the
population. Israeli Arabs have long complained of discrimination at
the hands of Israeli governments. Confiscation of Arab land is an
especially sore point.
	   The battle over land began Sunday in the town of Umm al-Fahm in
northern Israel when Israeli police dismantled a tent set up to
protest the expropriation of the olive grove. The land is to be
used for an army firing range, and the army said the land owner was
to be compensated with six times as much land elsewhere.
	   In response to the dismantling of the tent, hundreds of Umm
al-Fahm residents threw stones at police who responded with tear
gas and rubber bullets. The riots continued Monday and Tuesday.
	   In all, at least 55 protesters and 15 police officers were
injured.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The local utility in a frigid, far northern city
has cut gas supplies to more than 40,000 apartments because
impoverished consumers have stopped paying their bills, a news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   Gas supplies were cut to more than two-thirds of all housing in
Severodvinsk, a city that builds nuclear submarines in the
Arkhangelsk region, about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north of
Moscow, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Temperatures in the area are already dipping below freezing, and
can be expected to plunge well below in the weeks ahead. Tuesday's
forecast called for snow.
	   Igor Shpakovsky, head of the local gas company, Arkhangelskgaz,
said the 250,000 consumers in Severodvinsk owe 6 million rubles
(dlrs 400,000), and have almost completely stopped paying for gas
in the past few weeks, as the country's economic crisis has
worsened.
	   In addition, the region owes the gas company another 9.2 million
rubles (dlrs 600,000), he said.
	   Many Russians have little or no cash now, since many have not
been paid their wages in months and those with bank accounts have
seen their accounts frozen in the economic crisis.
	   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Russian air force said members of
the air force military council noted at a recent meeting that more
than half of their bases are not prepared for winter, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Boilers need repairs at many bases and there is not enough money
to buy fuel, the news agency said.

Israeli police officer fired for beating Palestinian cameraman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli police officer who beat and kicked
an APTN cameraman on assignment in Hebron was dismissed from his
unit, but not from the force, a police spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   The APTN cameraman, Imad Assaid, was covering confrontations
between Jewish settlers and Palestinian residents Monday when he
was ordered by the police officer to leave the scene.
	   When Assaid refused, saying the officer did not have a document
showing that the site had been declared a closed military area, the
officer grabbed the cameraman by the neck and kicked him.
	   Assaid walked away, and the officer delivered another blow.
	   The scene was shown on Israel TV' Channel One on Monday evening.
	   In response, the commander of the West Bank police district,
Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Aharonovich, dismissed the officer from the
Special Patrol Unit, but not from the force, said police
spokeswoman Linda Menuhin.
	   She said the incident is to be investigated by a Justice
Ministry department that handles complaints against police
officers.
	   An AP photographer, Nasser Shiyoukhi, was also hit by a police
officer when trying to take pictures of Jewish settlers. Neither
journalists needed treatment.
	   The violence in Hebron began when assailants in the Palestinian
sector of Hebron opened fire on an Israeli woman, wounding her in
the leg. In response, several Jewish settlers beat Palestinian
passers-by and overturned tables in the Arab vegetable market.
	   The Foreign Press Association in Israel filed a protest with the
police, calling the beating of Assaid ``malicious and unprovoked''
and said that such violence indicates ``a deeper problem within the
police regarding the role of the press.''
	   The group demanded the officer be prosecuted to the fullest
extent.

Official media: Thousands of civilians joining war in south Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Thousands of Sudan's civilians are headed
south to join the government's war against Sudanese rebels and
Ugandan troops, the official media reported Tuesday.
	   The mobilization follows an appeal Monday by the government for
retired army officers to help the military's defense against
expected rebel assaults.
	   Since Monday's call, thousands of volunteers have traveled to
the southern province of East Equatoria where fighting has raged
since Sept. 14, state-run television and Omdurman Radio reported.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed. It was also
not possible to verify whether the civilians had volunteered or
were being forced to fight.
	   Sudan's Islamic government is known to conscript young men to
fight the largely animist and Christian rebels who have been waging
a military campaign since 1983 for more autonomy to the southern
districts.
	   Some 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.
	   Earlier this month, Sudan accused Uganda and Eritrea of sending
troops into Sudan to aid the rebels, a charge both countries deny.
Sudan, however, plans to complain to the United Nations and other
world bodies.
	   In comments published Tuesday, army spokesman Lt. Gen.
Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim said government troops on Monday battled
``the invaders and the traitors'' in the Khor Angles area, about
1,200 kilometers (740 miles) south of Khartoum.
	   Many Ugandans were killed, one tank was destroyed and another
was captured, Sirul-Khatim was reported as saying by the Al-Osboa
daily newspaper. The claim could not be independently verified.
	   Sirul-Khatim said Sudanese troops have destroyed or captured 17
Ugandan and rebel tanks since Sept. 14.

Outgoing U.N. coordinator in Iraq lashes out at U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The outgoing head of U.N. humanitarian
programs in Iraq said Tuesday he quit because he did not want to be
associated with the adverse impact of U.N. trade sanctions on the
country.
	   ``The fact that we in the United Nations have been obliged to
sustain ... the sanctions regime, for me is very unfortunate and
uncomfortable situation,'' Denis J. Halliday told a news conference
at the end of his 13-month tenure.
	   The U.N. Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq
oversees the distribution of food and other humanitarian goods that
Iraq purchases from money earned by the limited, U.N.-approved sale
of oil. U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
ban free sale of oil, its main export commodity.
	   He said he is unhappy with the way the U.N. dealt with the Iraqi
situation, imposing stringent resolutions on the one hand and
allowing a humanitarian program on the other.
	   The humanitarian program ``is underfunded, cumbersome, slow and
costly ... This is not a productive situation for anybody,'' said
Halliday, from Ireland.
	   Halliday, who had announced his decision to quit in July, leaves
his post Wednesday. He will be replaced Hans von Sponeck, a German
official with the U.N. Development Program.
	   Halliday said the oil-for-food program, which began in December
1996, has ``represented a shot of oxygen for the Iraqi people'' but
is still wrought with ``painful delays, frustration, politics and
bureaucracy.''
	   ``We are all familiar with children dying of leukemia and (the
program) has not been able to provide those sophisticated long-term
drugs,'' he said.
	   Halliday said he will travel to Washington to brief 40 U.S.
Congressmen, ``these important decision makers, on the impact the
sanctions have had on the people and children of this country.''
	   Halliday, who joined the United Nations in 1964, was an
assistant secretary-general before taking up his Iraq post.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Claiming he was severely beaten by
police on the night of his arrest, Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, pleaded innocent Tuesday to nine charges
of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   Anwar, who is fast becoming the symbol of opposition to Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17 years of rule in this Southeast
Asian nation, showed his bruises in the court where he was
arraigned.
	   While Anwar pleaded for a doctor to examine his left eye, saying
it had been so swollen that he couldn't use it for two days, riot
police armed with assault rifles stood guard outside against any
attempts by his supporters to swarm the courthouse.
	   Since Anwar's arrest Sept. 20, Kuala Lumpur has been rocked by
street protests demanding his release and Mahathir's resignation.
Every day since Friday, several thousand people have defied arrest
and police batons to gather and shout, ``Reform, reform.'' During
Monday's demonstration, at least 80 protesters were arrested.
	   The crackdown on Mahathir's critics has continued away from the
scene of demonstrations. On Tuesday, police said three people,
including one of Anwar's defense attorneys, were jailed under the
harsh Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite imprisonment
without trial.
	   The ISA, condemned by human rights activists, has been used
against Anwar and 16 others this month.
	   Anwar's bail plea was referred to the higher court that is to
try him soon in a landmark legal case in this Islamic country. No
other senior politician has faced such charges of committing
illegal homosexual acts.
	   Anwar replied, ``Not guilty, I claim trial,'' as each charge was
read out before Judge Hasnah Hashim.
	   He has contended that the charges are politically motivated.
	   After Mahathir fired him Sept. 2, Anwar led a campaign against
his former boss. At each of his rallies before his arrest, Anwar
said Malaysia needed a more liberal government, a cleaner
administration and a press that was not shackled to the rulers.
	   Anwar is defending himself against five counts of corruption and
more seriously against four counts of illegal sexual acts,
punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment and a lashing with a
whip.
	   Prosecutors allege that he engaged in homosexual acts with four
people. Two of them are already in jail after admitting to being
Anwar's sexual partners.
	   A 10th charge will be brought against him in another court in a
Kuala Lumpur suburb Wednesday, said a statement by the
Attorney-General's office.
	   The corruption charges relate to alleged misuse of his
ministerial powers to thwart the investigation of the illegal sex
charges against him.
	   Wearing brown trousers and a checked shirt, Anwar smiled as he
entered the courtroom. He then embraced his wife, Azizah Ismail,
two of his daughters, and his father.
	   Anwar pointed to large bruises above his left eye and on his
neck and rolled up his shirtsleeves to show his family the scars of
police beatings on the first night of his custody, witnesses in the
courtroom said.
	   ``I was boxed very hard on the left temple and right part of my
head,'' Anwar told the court, according to lawyer Pawancheek
Marican. Anwar said he was still handcuffed and blindfolded when he
was hit.
	   His wife, who is an eye doctor, said after the court session:
``I was shocked. After 10 days, when I first saw him, he had this
big black mark around his left eye that really worries me.''
	   Looking shaken and tired as nearly 70 photographers swarmed
around her and her daughter, Azizah said she went to the federal
police headquarters, where another doctor examined Anwar's eye and
determined that his retina wasn't permanently damaged.
	   ``My strength comes from the fact that I know my husband is
innocent and all these fabrications are just a way to bring him
down so he will not be able to stand for elections and continue his
political career,'' she said.
	   She added: ``After all he's been through, his spirit is very
strong and I'm proud of that.''
	   The Attorney-General's office said all the charges against Anwar
had been based on a police investigation into accusations contained
in a book titled ``50 reasons why Anwar cannot become PM.''
	   The book was widely distributed at this year's annual convention
of the governing United Malays National Organization party, where
Anwar's allies had campaigned for political reforms.
	   Mahathir has denied that a challenge to his leadership forced
him to fire Anwar, a man he had until last year described as his
successor. He said Anwar's sexual activities were intolerable.
	   ``Anwar's wish was for me to step down so that he would get away
without being tried,'' Mahathir said Tuesday in Parliament, which
met as Anwar was produced in court.
	   Anwar's treatment by the authorities has drawn criticism from
foreign governments, human rights activists and opposition
politicians.
	   ``When Anwar Ibrahim was produced in court, it should be a day
of vindication of the rule of law but it has turned to be a day of
shame for the rule of law in Malaysia,'' said the opposition leader
in Parliament, Lim Kit Siang, who was barred by police from
entering the packed courtroom.

New bus service between Egypt and Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egypt-based company will start a bus
service between Cairo and Baghdad this week, the first such road
link between the two countries since the 1991 Gulf War, an official
said Tuesday.
	   The Arab Union Company for Land Transportation will initially
operate five two-way trips every week, and increase the frequency
gradually, Subhy Wafa, a company official, said.
	   The company is owned by the governments of Egypt, Syria and
Jordan but is managed and operated by Egyptians.
	   Iraq had severed diplomatic ties with Egypt and several other
Arab countries that participated in the U.S.-led military coalition
in the 1991 Gulf War to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.
	   Bilateral relations improved recently and the bus service
represents a further warming of relations between Iraq and Egypt.
	   The 24-hour bus journey through Jordan will be launched on
Friday and will mostly serve Egyptian workers in Iraq, Wafa said.
	   Some 200,000 Egyptians are believed to be working in Iraq, down
from nearly 2 millions before the 1991 Gulf War. Wafa said a
one-way trip will cost dlrs 69, considerably cheaper than flying to
Amman, Jordan and taking a bus to Baghdad.
	   Egypt signed dlrs 231 million worth of contracts this year to
sell goods to Iraq under a U.N. oil-for-food deal. The deal allows
Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to bypass economic sanctions
imposed for Iraq's Kuwait invasion.
	   Last month, Iraq asked Egypt to restore diplomatic relations,
saying recent improvement of ties required a further push.

strike Tuesday and teen-agers hurled stones three Arab towns to
protest the government's expropriation of a 125-acre olive grove.
	   In a show of solidarity, shops in several West Bank towns were
shut for an hour. In the West Bank town of Nablus, some 200 people
marched in support of their Palestinian brethren living in Israel,
chanting ``We are one people, here and there.''
	   Israel has 1 million Arab citizens who make up 20 percent of the
population. Israeli Arabs have long complained of discrimination at
the hands of Israeli governments. Confiscation of Arab land is an
especially sore point.
	   The battle over land began Sunday in the town of Umm al-Fahm in
northern Israel when Israeli police dismantled a tent set up to
protest the expropriation of the olive grove. The land is to be
used for an army firing range, and the army said the land owner was
to be compensated with six times as much land elsewhere.
	   In response to the dismantling of the tent, hundreds of Umm
al-Fahm residents threw stones at police who responded with tear
gas and rubber bullets. At least 55 protesters and 15 police
officers were injured.
	   The intensity of the anger raised the question of whether the
protests would spread. On Monday, stone-throwing protests continued
in Umm al-Fahm and on Tuesday the protests spread to the biblical
town of Nazareth and to the village of Tira in northern Israel.
	   In Nazareth and Tira, demonstrators threw stones at passing
cars, Israel radio said.
	   In all, 14 protesters were arrested in Umm al-Fahm and Nazareth,
and six policemen were lightly hurt, the radio said.

Official results confirm Meciar in first place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's
party won general elections late last week, according to official
results released Tuesday. But a close aide acknowledged the party
of the authoritarian leader will likely end up in the opposition
nonetheless.
	   Meciar's HDZS party is just ahead of the second-place Slovak
Democratic Coalition and lacking allies with enough seats in
Parliament to permit it to form a governing coalition. That means
that it will be likely be unable to form a majority government,
said Gustav Krajci, Meciar's interior minister.
	   Krajci said that Meciar's party received 27 percent of the
Friday-Saturday vote, compared to the Slovak Democratic Coalition
with 26.3 percent.
	   Meciar himself got the most individual votes _ 470,556. Mikulas
Dzurinda, the leader of the Slovak Democratic Coalition, received
304,071, in comparison.
	   The representatives of the Central Election Commission reported
that the Slovak elections were free and fair. Kare Vollan, head of
the observer mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, said the fact that representatives of all 17
political parties signed the election's official results means
``there will be no disputes and questions.''
	   Starting Tuesday, the chairman of the parliament has 30 days to
call the new parliament into session, which will accept the
resignation of the old government and vote the new government into
office.
	   The four opposition parties gained a 93-seat majority in
parliament, compared to Mecca's party and his coalition partner,
the Slovak National Party.

China asks for cooperation in stationing troops in Macau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ China asked Portugal on Tuesday for cooperation in
stationing troops in Macau after the Portuguese enclave reverts to
Chinese rule next year.
	   Han Zhaokang, leader of the Sino-Portuguese Liaison Group, made
the request at a meeting of the group, which is overseeing the
transition of Macau to China.
	   Han said Portugal's assistance was necessary to ensure a smooth
handover on Dec. 20, 1999.
	   His Portuguese counterpart, Santana Carlos, said Portugal would
consider the Chinese request, but pointed out that the 1987
agreement on the handover of Macau did not mention the stationing
of troops in this territory at the tip of south China.
	   Earlier this month, Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen said an
elite detachment of soldiers would be sent to Macau after the
change of sovereignty to protect social order.
	   Macau, famous for its gambling and tourism, has been hit with
gangland-style slayings, arson and other attacks _ many against
government officials.
	   Police believe triads, or Chinese gangs, are fighting over
profits from the gambling industry, which have been dwindling
because of Asia's economic slump.
	   China stationed troops in neighboring Hong Kong after it
regained sovereignty over that territory last year.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The outgoing head of U.N. humanitarian
programs in Iraq said Tuesday he quit his job because he did not
want to be associated with the adverse impact of U.N. trade
sanctions on the country.
	   ``The fact that we in the United Nations have been obliged to
sustain ... the sanctions regime, for me is very unfortunate and
uncomfortable situation,'' Denis J. Halliday told a news conference
at the end of his 13-month tenure.
	   He said he is unhappy with the the way the U.N. dealt with the
Iraqi situation, imposing stringent resolutions on the one hand and
allowing a humanitarian program on the other.
	   The humanitarian program ``is underfunded, cumbersome, slow and
costly ... This is not a productive situation for anybody,'' said
Halliday, an Irishman.
	   Halliday, who had announced his decision to quit in July, leaves
his post on Wednesday. He will be replaced by Hans von Sponeck, a
German official with the United Nations Development Program.

After Bosnian elections, West urges quick implementation of peace
</HEADLINE>
process &QL; 
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Newly elected officials in
Bosnia must comply with the peace process or be removed, Carlos
Westendorp, Bosnia's top international mediator, said Tuesday.
	   In the months ahead, all Bosnian leaders will be pressed to
speed up implementation of the peace accord, especially the return
of refugees, enactment of property laws and reforms of police,
media and the judicial system, Westendorp said.
	   ``We have no time to lose,'' Westendorp said before departing
for London where representatives of ``Contact Group'' countries
will discuss Bosnian election results and future strategies. Those
countries are the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy
and Russia.
	   But Westendorp said removal of officials opposed to the Dayton
accord was a ``last resort.''
	   Western diplomats indicated that the faster pace is, among other
things, aimed at testing the new hard-line president of the
Serb-held part of Bosnia _ Nikola Poplasen.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Westendorp said he
will inform Western powers in London ``that we may have problems if
a new (Bosnian Serb) government is not Dayton friendly,'' a
reference to the 1995 Bosnian peace agreement.
	   The London meeting was urgently organized after the surprising
victory of Poplasen, who defeated Western-backed Biljana Plavsic.
	   Poplasen, a wartime paramilitary leader, has said he will
support Dayton, a key condition for continued Western aid, but the
West does not trust him.
	   Aside from Poplasen's victory, international officials said
overall, the results of the Sept. 12-13 general elections were
encouraging because moderates showed significant gains in other
races, including the Bosnian Serb assembly.
	   The election ``is a step in the right direction, with one
exception _ Poplasen,'' Westendorp stressed.
	   ``This is a very symbolic exception,'' he said, listing several
possible moves to prevent Poplasen or anybody else from thwarting
the peace process: withholding financial assistance and removal of
officials opposed to Dayton.
	   As the president of the Bosnian Serb republic, Poplasen has the
power to nominate a new prime minister, but his candidate requires
approval in the 83-seat Bosnian Serb assembly where moderate
parties now hold a majority of seats.
	   Western officials believe Poplasen will not use his other
presidential power _ to dismiss the assembly and call new
parliamentary elections because pro-Western parties could gain even
more seats in a new ballot.
	   Westendorp said he has ``a lot of complaints'' and is ready to
also use his powers against officials in the other Bosnian
substate, the Muslim-Croat Federation.
	   ``I am ready to accept the democratic result, the will of the
people ... as long as they support the Dayton,'' accord, he said.

German Social Democrats warn unemployment could still worsen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The union leader picked to head the Labor Ministry
in Germany's new Social Democratic government sought to dampen
expectations of a quick fix Tuesday to high unemployment, the key
issue in the election campaign.
	   Walter Riester, a top metalworkers leader designated by
chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder as labor minister, said
unemployment could rise in the next few months. He blamed outgoing
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government for pouring money into
temporary, make-work measures before the election to nudge the
jobless rate down.
	   When those contracts run out, ``a new increase in unemployment
is to be expected,'' he told German television.
	   Meanwhile, Schroeder's main program to bring down the nearly 11
percent jobless rate _ bringing together government, business and
labor officials to brainstorm on a solution _ already was showing
signs of strain.
	   Industry leaders are vowing to fight Social Democratic plans to
repeal limited reforms passed by Kohl that were aimed at reducing
the high cost of doing business in Germany.
	   ``There are campaign promises, and then there's reality,''
Hans-Olaf Henkel, head of the German Federation of Industry, told a
Berlin radio station.
	   Industry want those plans to be part of the talks, but Schroeder
warned against making early demands.
	   ``I'm counting on readiness to talk and no one should put
conditions on anyone else beforehand,'' Schroeder said in a TV
interview Monday night.
	   Kohl tried a similar roundtable approach in 1996, but the effort
soon fell apart amid bickering between unions and employers.
	   The reforms Schroeder has promised to repeal involve making it
easier for small companies to fire employees, allowing companies to
trim sick pay and phased cuts in state pensions.
	   Labor leader Hubertus Schmoldt, whose union represents miners,
chemical and energy industry workers, said repealing those cuts was
``necessary'' and should not impact the job talks.
	   ``A new `Alliance for Jobs' will be a matter of give and take,''
the union said in a release, using the moniker for Schroeder's
proposed roundtable talks. ``None of the participants will remain
unshorn. The decisive thing is, however, that the principles of
social fairness are observed.''

	   BEITUNIA, West Bank (AP) _ A car rigged with large amounts of
explosives blew up Tuesday in a West Bank industrial area, killing
a Hamas activists and wounding two supporters of the Islamic
militant group, Palestinian police said.
	   Israel has been bracing for Hamas bombing attacks and on Tuesday
sealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip ahead of the
Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur to prevent possible violence.
	   In the past, there have been several incidents in which Hamas
activists were killed or injured in trying to rig a car with
explosives in preparation for an attack.
	   A senior Palestinian security official, when asked what he
believed happened Tuesday, said ``Isn't it obvious?,'' but refused
further comment when pressed whether the explosion went off
prematurely during preparations for a bombing attack in Israel.
	   The explosion went off in an industrial area of Beitunia, a
suburb of the West Bank town of Ramallah, at about 1:30 p.m. (1130
gmt). Palestinian police said the car had been rigged with large
amounts of explosives, but did not give an amount.
	   The force of the blast cut the white car in half and blew out
the doors and roof, leaving only the hood and front seats. The car
had Israeli license plates.
	   The explosion killed Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, 35, from the West
Bank village of Biddou, said Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian
security chief in the West Bank.
	   The two injured men, brothers from Biddou, were taken to nearby
Ramallah Hospital where they were placed under police guard, said
Ramallah Police Chief Kamal Sheik.
	   All three were known Hamas activists, security officials said.
	   The scene of the blast was not far from where the body of the
chief Hamas bombmaker, Mohiyedine Sharif, was found in the spring
after a car explosion. The circumstances of Sharif's death remain
unclear.
	   Palestinian investigators have said Sharif was shot to death by
a rival in Hamas in a dispute over money and power, and that the
car explosion was staged to cover up the shooting.

Sources: Schroeder will become German chancellor on Oct. 22

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder
will probably be sworn in on Oct. 22 so he can attend a European
Union summit in Austria later that week, parliamentary sources said
Tuesday.
	   The victorious Social Democrats have 30 days from election day,
Sept. 27, to convene the new lower house of parliament, or
Bundestag.
	   Social Democratic sources in parliament said newly elected
lawmakers likely will hold their first session on Oct. 20 or 21.
	   Other sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Schroeder will probably be formally voted and sworn in on Oct. 22
so that he can go to the EU summit scheduled for Oct. 24-25.
	   That two-day meeting is widely regarded as European leaders'
welcome for Schroeder. If he were not sworn in as head of
government by then, outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl would represent
Germany.
	   The sources said Schroeder will address the Bundestag to set out
his government's priorities in the first week of November.

 &UR; Lebed plans to join anti-government protest next month &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Regional governor Alexander Lebed said Tuesday he
would take part in a nationwide labor protest next month and called
on local authorities to prevent it from turning violent.
	   The strikes and marches set for Oct. 7 are being organized by
unions and opposition parties, including the Communists, to demand
President Boris Yeltsin's resignation over unpaid wages and
pensions and other economic woes.
	   ``The people will take to the streets because they have grown
tired of that hopeless life,'' said Lebed, a retired general and
national security advisor who now is governor of the vast
Krasnoyarsk region in Central Siberia.
	   ``The local authorities must do everything to ensure the
protests are carried out in a civilized and well-organized way,''
he said at a news conference. ``To achieve that, we must head (take
part in) those actions.''
	   Lebed refused to say whether he would join the call for
Yeltsin's resignation, saying he is still considering the issue.
But he reiterated his long-time criticism of Yeltsin, accusing him
of bringing Russia to ruin.
	   ``We now have an elderly and overworked person ... who is
disliked by parliament and people, to put in the mildest way
possible,'' Lebed said of Yeltsin, who is 67.
	   He warned the government against any attempts to curb the
protests by force.
	   ``That would be a big stupidity on the part of the government to
use force,'' he said. ``I don't think it will come to shooting.''
	   Lebed, who came in third in Russia's 1996 presidential election,
remained coy about his plans for the next race in 2000.
	   ``I haven't yet decided anything,'' he said. ``The presidential
race means nerves, time and money. When all these components are
present, I will make the decision.''
	   Lebed has previously said he would not run unless he solves the
problems of the Krasnoyarsk, where he was elected governor in May.
Many observers consider the governorship a stepping stone to the
presidential election, while others warn that Lebed may undermine
his chances if he fails to improve conditions in the region.
	   Lebed strongly backed Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny
Primakov, and voiced hope that his government could find solutions
to deal with the national economic crisis.
	   ``Primakov's success will be the success of all Russia. We don't
have a place to retreat,'' he said.

On Judaism's holiest day, soul-searching in Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In synagogues great and small, in army tents
and border bunkers, by the ancient stones of the Western Wall,
Israelis on Tuesday were ushering in the holiest day of the Jewish
calendar.
	   Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, lasts from sundown Tuesday to
sundown Wednesday. Jews the world over mark it by praying and
fasting, soul-searching and repenting, seeking God's forgiveness.
	   ``It's the time to confess your sins right out loud,'' said
Jerusalem tour guide Shmaryahi Yahav, 69. ``You try to improve your
communication with God, and with other people too.''
	   But even on a day of introspection, real-world tensions
intruded.
	   Military security was tight, the Palestinian lands were sealed
off, and little progress was seen in a round of just-finished peace
talks in the United States. In the West Bank, a car packed with
powerful explosives blew up, raising suspicions it was being
readied for a suicide attack.
	   In Israel proper, the holiday presented a rare spectacle: that
of a frantic and frenetic country simply shutting down.
	   Streets emptied as people hurried home for a final pre-fast
meal. For 24 hours, shops and businesses are shuttered, buses and
trains stop running, and virtually no one drives.
	   There are no international or domestic flights. Seaports are
closed. Border crossings are shut. News broadcasts cease.
	   At the Western Wall in Jerusalem's walled Old City, Judaism's
holiest site, tens of thousands of Jews gathered for prayers,
swaying and chanting before the expanse of yellow stone.
	   The day marks something of a truce in ongoing skirmishes between
religious and secular Israelis. Even though most Israelis describe
themselves as secular, nearly all go to synagogue on Yom Kippur,
and most also fast.
	   Synagogues are so crowded that many require seat reservations,
but by tradition, no worshipper is turned away.
	   Just before the start of Yom Kippur, some ultra-Orthodox Jews
observe the ancient rite of kapparot, or sacrificing a live chicken
to atone for sins.
	   In the ultra-religious Jewish neighborhood of Mea Shearim,
bearded Orthodox men with chicken feathers clinging to their long
black coats swung birds in awkward circles overhead, chanting
prayers as they did so.
	   Afterward, the chickens are slaughtered and given to charity.
The rite is frowned upon by many more mainstream Jews, but those
who practice it defend it.
	   ``I don't really believe this chicken can expiate my sins _ it's
symbolic, a way of preparing for what's to come,'' Zechariah Till
said after waving a squawking bird over his small sons' heads and
reciting the traditional prayer.
	   Israel's entire army observes a holiday fast, and military
messes served up a heavy, hearty meal just beforehand. Large
military installations have synagogue buildings, but remote
outposts set up makeshift ones in tents and bunkers.
	   The army insists religious observances don't compromise
preparedness _ a pledge that carries a special meaning this year,
the 25th anniversary of the Yom Kippur war.
	   Israel was caught badly off guard when Arab neighbors attacked
on Oct. 6, 1973, when the holy day fell that year. Almost 2,700
Israeli soldiers were slain in the 2 1/2-week conflict, shattering
the country's self-confidence about its military prowess.
	   As it normally does during Jewish holidays, Israel imposed a
blanket closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, refusing entry to
all Palestinians. Soldiers manned roadblocks and police checked
cars going into the Old City.
	   As a prelude to Yom Kippur, Jews are supposed to try to make
amends to fellow humans before they do with God. It's an old ritual
with modern touches like using e-mail to apologize for snapping at
a colleague or letting down a friend.
	   Yedideya Saidin, who runs a Jerusalem jewelry shop, looked up
from work over a fine silver chain to talk about cutthroat
competition in his trade.
	   ``You know how it is in business, sometimes you do things you
wish you hadn't,'' he said ruefully. ``So when this time of year
comes, we all just have to forgive each other.''
	   Sometimes, though, atonement is more of a formality.
	   On an Israeli TV talk-and-politics show aired Sunday, Jewish
settler leader Ahron Domb delivered an angry tirade against Yasser
Arafat. Then, in almost the same breath, he turned to Arafat's aide
Ahmed Tibi and asked pardon for any slights in the past year.
	   Tibi, a Palestinian who holds Israeli citizenship and is
familiar with the Yom Kippur custom, nodded. Then he gave Domb a
big grin.

Polish intellectuals urge resolution of Auschwitz cross problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A group of Polish intellectuals, including
two Nobel laureates, urged the government Tuedsay to end the
dispute over crosses near the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.
	   In a letter published Tuesday, Wislawa Szymborska and Czeslaw
Milosz, who won Nobel prizes for literature, and four other
intellectuals said the controversy over crosses on property
adjoining Auschwitz is harming Poland and its world image.
	   Jewish groups complain the crosses at a former Carmelite nunnery
disturb the memory of more than 1 million Jews killed by the Nazis
at Auschwitz and its nearby sister camp, Birkenau.
	   But some Poles say the crosses commemorate 152 Roman Catholic
resisters killed by the Nazis on the site.
	   The crosses include a tall, wooden one erected in 1988 by the
Carmelites and more than 200 others added in recent months by
conservative Catholics protesting the possible removal of the
larger cross, which was the backdrop of a 1979 Mass celebrated by
Polish-born Pope John Paul II at Birkenau.
	   ``The problem of Auschwitz crosses does not cease to trouble
Poles, offend Jews, and burden the world public opinion,'' said the
letter published in the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government indicated earlier this
year it would remove the papal cross, sparking protests by
conservative Catholics who erected the scores of smaller crosses.
Now the government says the smaller crosses will be removed once it
has completed a legal process to take control of the property from
a war victim's association that leases it.
	   The intellectuals urged Buzek to end ``provocations and
disturbances at Auschwitz in order that we could bow with peace and
dignity before the ashes of martyrs.'' The letter urged the
government to restore order at Auschwitz, instead of ``hiding
itself behind unnecessary procedural problems.''
	   Other signatories were Jerzy Turowicz, longtime editor of
Tygodnik Powszechny, the Krakow-based lay-Catholic weekly;
historian Jozef Gierowski; literary critic Jan Blonski; and
philosopher Wladyslaw Strozewski.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Troy Neel hit the winning two-run home run in the
eighth inning as the Orix BlueWave beat the Pacific League's
front-running Seibu Lions 4-2 at Kobe Tuesday.
	   Neel, formerly with the Oakland Athletics, hit his 26th homer of
the season after teammate Koichi Oshima had tied the score in the
same inning with a two-run homer.
	   The Lions, who ended their winning streak at three, are still
one game ahead of the second-place Nippon Ham Fighters, who were
idle Tuesday along with the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.
	   The Hawks are 2 1/2 games behind the Lions.
	   At Chiba, Tomohiro Kuroki pitched a two-hit shutout with seven
strikeouts and Koichi Hori hit a home run as the Chiba Lotte
Marines beat the Kintetsu Buffaloes 3-0.
	   Kuroki is 11-9 and Hori has nine homers.
	   In the Central League, Takanori Suzuki slugged a three-run home
run in the top of the ninth as the front-running Yokohama BayStars
beat the Yakult Swallows 5-2 at Tokyo's Jingu Stadium.
	   Suzuki has 16 homers.
	   The BayStars are five games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons, who beat the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 1-0 at Hiroshima.
	   Kazuyoshi Tatsunami singled home the only run against Nathan
Minchey in the sixth inning, and Ken Kadokura held the Carp to four
hits for his 10th victory against seven defeats.
	   Minchey, who gave up four hits and one run over eight innings,
took the loss. He is 14-11.
	   At Koshien Stadium, Masahiro Kawai singled home the winning run
in the eighth inning as the Yomiuri Giants edged the Hanshin Tigers
4-3 and extended their winning streak to seven.

Finish president meets newly elected Bosnian leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ On a one-day visit to the
Bosnian capital Tuesday, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari met
newly elected Bosnian leaders.
	   It was the first public appearance of the new members of the
Bosnian joint three-member presidency, elected in the Sept. 12-13
national ballot.
	   Ahtisaari separately met the Muslim member and current chairman
of the presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, as well as newly elected
Bosnian Serb and Croat members, Zivko Radisic and Ante Jelavic.
	   Both Radisic and Jelavic are for the first time serving in the
presidency. Their meeting with Ahtisaari was unofficial as the
international organization charged with Bosnian ballots has yet to
verify the results. Radisic will be the new presidency chairman for
the first eight months.
	   No statements were issued after the meetings. In a press
release, Izetbegovic said he expected the presidency to work much
better after the election of Radisic, who defeated the former Serb
member and hard-line candidate, Momcilo Krajisnik.
	   In Sarajevo, Ahtisaari also met senior international officials
charged with peace implementation to discuss the current political
situation in the region and implementation of the Dayton peace
agreement after the September elections.
	   Ahtisaari was also scheduled to visit Finnish soldiers serving
in the 35,000-strong NATO-led peace force.

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democrat
in line to be Germany's next chancellor, stepped down on Tuesday as
party chairman in his home state of Lower Saxony.
	   Schroeder tendered his resignation at a party board meeting in
Hanover so that a new leader could be voted on at a convention set
for Oct. 10, a state party spokesman said.
	   The board recommended Edelgard Bulmahn, a federal lawmaker who
was part of Schroeder's campaign team, for the job.
	   Following Schroeder's suggestion, the board also unanimously
nominated the state's current interior minister, Gerhard Glogowski,
to take Schroeder's place as Lower Saxony governor.
	   Glogowski said he expected to be confirmed in the job at a
special session of the state parliament on Oct. 19.

Investigators identify chassis of blast vehicle; not water tanker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RODRIQUE NGOWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Investigators are moving closer
to determining how a bomb entered the compound of the U.S. Embassy
here and later exploded, killing 11 people, a senior official said
Tuesday.
	   ``Investigators have identified the chassis (number) of the
vehicle that was used to deliver the bomb to the site,'' Home
Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed told The Associated Press.
	   He said the vehicle, which he did not identifiy further, was
destroyed except for the chassis, and the driver almost certainly
perished in the blast as well.
	   The Aug. 7 explosion blasted away a corner of the embassy
building in a residential neighborhood near the Indian Ocean and
slammed a water tanker truck against a wall.
	   At first, Tanzanian investigators and FBI agents looked at the
possibility that the tanker that periodically delivered water to
the embassy and other buildings in the area could have carried the
bomb inside the compound. But although the cab was destroyed, the
tanker portion remained intact.
	   ``When the vehicle arrived at embassy, the security camera
started focussing on it after embassy security staff became
suspicious, and, almost instantly, it went off,'' Ameir said.
	   ``Investigators suspect that the bomb was detonated using a
remote control.''
	   A large crater where the front entrance of the compound had been
appeared to indicate that the bomb vehicle could have approached
after the water tanker was already inside.
	   A nearly simultaneous bombing in neighboring Kenya killed 248
people at or near the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
	   Two suspects are in U.S. custody and have been indicted in a
U.S. federal court on charges of murdering the 12 Americans who
died in the blast.
	   In Dar es Salaam, an Egyptian and a Tanzanian born in Zanzibar
have been formally charged by a local court with 11 counts of
murder each.
	   No one appears to be in a hurry to publicize any direct links
between the bombers of the two embassies. But one official, who
asked not to be further identified, said the Egyptian, Mustafa
Mahmoud Said Ahmed, seemed to know a lot of people connected to the
Kenyan bombing.
	   Ameir said police are still looking for two more suspects who
owned a Suzuki car which possibly transported materials to make the
bomb and which was left with the Zanzibari suspect Rashid Saleh
Hemed.
	   ``Indications point to the fact that a lot of people either
knowingly or unknowingly were used in the manufacture of the
bomb,'' the Tanzanian official said.
	   One example he cited was metal shop owner Thomas Lyimo who was
detained and is cooperating with police. There is speculation the
bomb was attached to a vehicle that was in his shop without his
knowledge.
	   Tanzanian Police spokesman Aden Mwamunyange told The Associated
Press the investigation was ``going very well'' and is expected to
be concluded ``within the next two weeks'' when chief FBI
investigator Kenneth Piernick would return to Dar es Salaam for a
news conference.

Opposition says Albanian premier's resignation not enough
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with three new candidates for prime minister.
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's opposition Democratic Party
said Tuesday the resignation of Socialist Premier Fatos Nano was
not enough and demanded a ``technical government'' be set up to
arrange new elections.
	   Nano resigned Monday, two weeks after an opposition politician's
assassination sparked rioting led by the Democratic Party, with
angry protesters burning the first floor of the government building
housing Nano's office and took control of the parliament.
	   Socialist Party leaders were meeting Tuesday to nominate a
candidate to succeed Nano. Pandeli Majko, the 31-year-old general
secretary of the party, was expected to win the nomination.
	   Parliament selects the prime minister but the Socialists hold a
comfortable majority in the 155-seat chamber.
	   The Democrats, led by former President Sali Berisha, had been
demanding that Nano step down for weeks. But the party said Tuesday
that it was not satisfied with the resignation.
	   The party demanded a technical government _ comprised of experts
who are not committed to any party _ that could rule for up to a
year, until new elections could be organized.
	   In a statement, the party said such a government could also
establish public order and work towards passing the constitution. A
parliamentary commission has drafted the constitution and wanted to
hold a referendum on Nov. 28 to ratify it.
	   Until their demands are met, the Democratic Party said it would
continue holding street protests until its demands are met. It
called another protest for Wednesday.
	   Nano became prime minister last year after his Socialist Party
of former communists defeated Berisha's Democratic Party in
parliamentary elections that followed widespread lawlessness and
chaos sparked by the collapse of pyramid investment schemes in
which many Albanians lost their life savings.
	   In submitting his resignation, Nano told President Rexhep
Meidani that he had been unable to put together a new Cabinet
according to his own wishes and ideas. He acknowledged his
responsibility ``for everything this government has not done'' and
said that ``the chances of coming out of the crisis are little'' as
long as he remained in office.
	   He also admitted that communication with international leaders
had become strained since political tensions between him and
Berisha reached a fever pitch on Sept. 12, when unidentified gunmen
assassinated Berisha's associate Azem Hajdari.
	   Majko's nomination to head a new government was seen as a
significant move to gradually part with officials who had been
associated the former Communist party that ruled Albania for 46
years.
	   Unlike Nano, Majko, a trained engineer respected for his
moderate stance, is not a former communist but took part in student
demonstrations in 1990 that helped topple the communists from
power.

Priest sentenced to four years for sexual abuse of minors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ An appeals court in east Bohemia
found a Catholic priest guilty of sexual abuse of three minor boys
and sentenced him to four years in prison, the news agency CTK
reported Tuesday.
	   The priest, identified as Pavel Smekal, 39, was sentenced
already in June to three years in jail.
	   He appealed the verdict, but the appeals court in Hradec
Kralove, 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Prague, raised the
previous sentence by one year on Tuesday.
	   While Smekal maintains he is innocent, the judge condemned the
cynicism of the priest who abused minors dependent on him and
admiring him as their religion teacher, CTK said.

Fund for car bomb victims expected to help as many as 700 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A fund established to aid
survivors and relatives of victims of the worst terrorist strike in
Northern Ireland's 30-year conflict will make payments to up to 700
beneficiaries, its chairman announced Tuesday.
	   Twenty-nine people died and 370 people were injured in a car
bomb planted Aug. 15 in Omagh by a splinter Irish Republican Army
group dubbed the Real IRA.
	   Another 2,000 people, many of them suffering from mental trauma,
have visited their doctors since the attack, fund administrators
say.
	   ``All in all, at this time we believe we may end up making
payments to between 450 and 700 beneficiaries,'' said Sean O'Dwyer,
the fund's chairman.
	   The fund is expected to reach about 5 million pounds (dlrs 8.4
million). About 2 million pounds (dlrs 3.3 million) already has
been raised through donations and such events as a charity golf
tournament. Several other major events, including a concert in
Belfast's new Waterfront Hall, have been planned.
	   O'Dwyer said administrators would try to make the initial
payments as quickly as possible, citing the ``sheer magnitude of
numbers who have suffered, the circumstances of the atrocity and
the degree of injuries.''

Russian foreign ministry welcomes Mideast talks in US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Foreign Ministry praised three-way talks
on the Middle East held in the United States, a news agency said
Tuesday.
	   The talks between Palestinian, Israeli, and U.S. leaders should
bring ``a speedy overcoming of the deadlock in talks and a balanced
agreement,'' said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin,
according to Interfax.
	   Russia will continue to play an active part in the peace
process, Interfax cited Rakhmanin as saying.
	   Russia is officially a co-sponsor of the peace process, which
was launched by a conference in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. But the
United States has played a far greater role.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, and U.S. President Bill Clinton finished talks on
Monday in Washington as part of a U.S. drive to conclude a peace
accord by mid-October.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The six Arab states in the Gulf have agreed on a
unified customs law, and have sent a draft to the World Trade
Organization for comments, Al-Rai Al-Amm daily reported Tuesday.
	   These oil-rich countries have been trying to set up a customs
union for 15 years through the Gulf Cooperation Council, a
political and economic alliance of the six countries. However,
their efforts had been hampered by disagreements about tariff
levels.
	   Ibrahim al-Ghanem, Kuwait's director general of customs, told
Al-Rai Al-Amm that if the WTO did not recommend any major changes
to the law, it will be discussed at the GCC summit scheduled to
take place in the United Arab Emirates before the end of the year.
	   The WTO was mainly concerned about articles related to customs
tariffs, intellectual property rights, origin of products and
freedom of passage, the official said.
	   A GCC customs union is a key prerequisite demanded by the
European Union before the two blocs can reach a free trade
agreement.
	   The members of the GCC are: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan national airline, Royal Jordanian,
has increased flights to Saudi Arabia in a bid to encourage
religious tourism to the two neighboring countries, an airline
official said Tuesday.
	   Starting Thursday, it will fly eight times a week to Saudi
Arabia, two more than before, said Majdi Sabri, RJ's deputy
director-general for marketing.
	   Sabri, who clinched the agreement during a visit to Saudi Arabia
on the weekend, said more flights could be scheduled during the
Muslim pilgrimage to holy shrines in the Gulf state or when the
need arises.
	   Saudi Arabia is home to Islam's two holiest shrines in Mecca and
Medina. Jordan hosts graves of the followers of the 7th century
Prophet Mohammed of Islam and shrines holy to the Shiite Muslim
sect.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The head of the Beirut Chamber of
Commerce and Industry has been elected president of the 130-member
International Chamber of Commerce, according to an announcement
published Tuesday.
	   Adnan Kassar is the first Lebanese to be chosen as president of
the ICC, which works to uphold the principles of market economy,
free trade and investment, Beirut newspapers reported. He takes
over the two-year post in January.
	   Kassar, a banker, is also president of the Arab Chambers of
Commerce, vice president of the Mediterranean Chambers of Commerce
and the Lebanese-French Chamber of Commerce.
	   The ICC has more than 130 member states and it is considered the
voice of the international business community.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Shares of Lebanon Holdings, a dlrs 50
million investment fund registered in the Luxembourg, will become
the first to be cross-listed on the Beirut Stock Exchange and a
foreign bourse, a statement said Tuesday.
	   Trading in Lebanon Holdings shares on the BSE begins Wednesday,
said a statement issued by Lebanon Invest, its parent company.
	   ``The listing of Lebanon Holdings on the BSE offers
institutional and individual investors unique access to companies
that are otherwise not publicly traded,'' said Tarek Kettaneh,
senior manager at Lebanon Invest Asset Management S.A.L., the
investment adviser to the fund.
	   Lebanon Holdings invests in medium and large-size Lebanese
companies, particularly in the financial sector. So far, Lebanon
Holdings has invested dlrs 21.3 million in Lebanese companies and
is negotiating a further dlrs 5 million investment.
	   Lebanon Invest and SBC Warburg created the fund in August 1997
as a result of a mandate from the Investment Development Authority
of Lebanon. It is managed by the London-based Blackeney Management
Limited.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Holland agreed on Tuesday to grant Jordan
dlrs 2.34 million to finance 30 percent of an electricity project
in the Dead Sea, the state-run Petra News Agency reported.
	   Petra said the money will be spent on setting up a power station
on the eastern shores of the Dead Sea, the lowest point on earth 30
kilometers (18 miles) west of Amman.
	   It said the power station will provide electricity for hotels
and other projects under construction in that area.
	   The grant, which will be disbursed next month, is part of
Holland's financial assistance to Jordan.

Hingis beats Martinez in women's opener
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with later matches &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Top-ranked Martina Hingis opened the
women's era in the dlrs 6.7 million Grand Slam Cup by beating
Conchita Martinez 6-2, 7-5 Tuesday.
	   Eight women are participating in the lucrative event for the
first time since the introduction of the tournament in 1990 and
Hingis got the honor of playing the first women's match.
	   The Swiss, who will celebrate her 18th birthday Wednesday,
needed one hour and 20 minutes to overcome the 26-year-old Spaniard
and reach the semifinals of the women's draw.
	   Hingis also beat Martinez in the final of the Australian Open to
win her only Grand Slam title of the year.
	   The tournament nominally brings together players with the best
records in the four Grand Slam events of the year _ the Australian,
French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   But three men's Grand Slam champions of the year have decided to
skip the tournament despite its huge prize money _ Wimbledon
champion and top-ranked Pete Sampras, U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter and Carlos Moya, the French Open champion.
	   Only Australian Open champion Petr Korda is among the 12 men
here.
	   Hingis and Martinez played an erratic match and the Spaniard
didn't manage to hold serve until 5-2 in the second set.
	   She finally held for 5-3, then saved a match point and broke
Hingis to close within 5-4.
	   Martinez held again to level the score.
	   Hingis was taken to deuce before holding for 6-5 and she finally
closed the match in the next game on Martinez' serve, hitting a
return backhand winner to the line on her second match point.
	   The men's winner will receive dlrs 1.3 million, the women's
800,000.
	   While Hingis made sure of collecting at least dlrs 200,000 for
reaching the last four, Martinez picked up dlrs 100,000 as a
consolation for losing in the first women's round.

Israeli Arabs observe general strike; some West Bankers join

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stone-throwing protests in two other Arab towns,
solidarity march in West Bank &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Arab citizens observed a general
strike Tuesday and teen-agers hurled stones three Arab towns to
protest the government's expropriation of a 125-acre (50-hectare)
olive grove.
	   In a show of solidarity, shops in several West Bank towns were
shut for an hour. In the West Bank town of Nablus, some 200 people
marched in support of their Palestinian brethren living in Israel,
chanting ``We are one people, here and there.''
	   Israel has 1 million Arab citizens who make up 20 percent of the
population. Israeli Arabs have long complained of discrimination at
the hands of Israeli governments. Confiscation of Arab land is an
especially sore point.
	   The battle over land began Sunday in the town of Umm al-Fahm in
northern Israel when Israeli police dismantled a tent set up to
protest the expropriation of the olive grove. The land is to be
used for an army firing range, and the army said the land owner was
to be compensated with six times as much land elsewhere.
	   In response to the dismantling of the tent, hundreds of Umm
al-Fahm residents threw stones at police who responded with tear
gas and rubber bullets. At least 55 protesters and 15 police
officers were injured.
	   The intensity of the anger raised the question of whether the
protests would spread. On Monday, stone-throwing protests continued
in Umm al-Fahm and on Tuesday the protests spread to the biblical
town of Nazareth and to the village of Tira in northern Israel.
	   In Nazareth and Tira, demonstrators threw stones at passing
cars, Israel radio said.
	   In all, 14 protesters were arrested in Umm al-Fahm and Nazareth,
and six policemen were lightly hurt, the radio said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's former deputy prime
minister said Tuesday he was led handcuffed and blindfolded to a
police lockup where he was greeted with a thundering punch that
left one eye swollen and useless for two days.
	   ``I was boxed very hard on the left temple and right part of my
head and neck,'' Anwar told a court.
	   It was the first time since his arrest under a harsh security
law on Sept. 20 that Anwar had been seen and heard.
	   He was arraigned on five counts alleging corruption during his
tenure as finance minister and deputy prime minister before Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired him Sept. 2.
	   He also was charged with four counts of illegal homosexual acts
that are punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a lashing with
a whip.
	   The trial has been transferred to the High Court, which also is
to decide on his bail plea. No date was set.
	   ``I was hit very hard on the left part of my neck and slapped
left and right until blood flowed down my nose,'' Anwar told the
court, according to his lawyer Pawancheek Marican.
	   Anwar said his pleas for a doctor were ignored even when he told
police that he could not see with his left eye, walk properly or
use one of his arms, Marican added.
	   Anwar also said police moved him to solitary confinement on the
third day of his arrest and hustled him to and from various secret
hideouts. A police doctor was allowed to treat him on the fifth day
of his detention, during which neither his lawyers nor his family
were allowed to see him.
	   On Tuesday, police tried to keep him away from public scrutiny
and photographers, whisking him from a four-wheel-drive vehicle
into a secret passageway that led into the second-floor courtroom.
	   Anwar, 51, hugged his wife and daughter when he saw them in
court. He then displayed his bruises to his family while they
waited for the judge to turn up.
	   ``He said in court he fears for his life. His left eye is still
black and blue,'' said another of Anwar's lawyers, Kamar Ainah.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, later told reporters that she
followed her husband back to the federal police headquarters, where
an eye doctor examined his eye and determined that his retina
wasn't permanently damaged.
	   ``When I first saw him, I was shocked and stunned,'' said
Azizah, an eye specialist herself who gave up her practice years
ago to take care of their six children. ``After all he's been
through, his spirit is very strong and I'm proud of that.''
	   Calling her husband ``a victim of police brutality,'' Azizah
challenged the home minister _ Mahathir himself _ to justify her
husband's battered appearance.
	   ``I know my husband is innocent,'' said Azizah, looking shaken
and exhausted as she sat on a sofa with her eldest daughter, Nurul
Izzah, while around 70 photographers swarmed around them.
	   ``All these fabrications are just a way to bring him down so he
will not be able to stand for elections and continue his political
career,'' she said.
	   In an interview Monday, Azizah said she feared for her husband's
life because he knew too many government secrets.
	   Mahathir has said that he was compelled to fire Anwar because of
the allegations of homosexuality against his deputy. But Anwar says
that he incurred Mahathir's wrath by challenging his 17-year rule.

Indian prime minister welcomes French opposition to sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ India's prime minister on Tuesday welcomed the
French government's opposition to sanctions the United States and
other countries have imposed on New Delhi for staging nuclear
weapons tests last spring.
	   Courting India for Airbus and other contracts, conservative
French President Jacques Chirac invited Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee for lunch as part of a two-day visit by the Indian leader.
	   ``I thank President Chirac for displaying better understanding
of India's position on the question of nuclear tests,'' Vajpayee
told reporters afterward. ``It was plain that economic sanctions
will not help.''
	   France also came under fire in 1995 and early 1996 for
conducting a series of nuclear arms tests under atolls in French
Polynesia. However, in April France was one of the first countries
to sign an international test ban treaty.
	   Vajpayee, on the first day of a two-day visit, said his talks
with Chirac were held in a ``very cordial and friendly
atmosphere,'' touching on questions ``mutual, regional and global
in character.''
	   Rivals India and Pakistan conducted underground nuclear tests in
May, stirring fears of a nuclear arms race in South Asia. The
United States and other countries imposed sanctions on both
countries and demanded they sign the test ban treaty known as CTBT.
	   Chirac made no mention of sanctions. But he told reporters after
the lunch that he was ``happy to observe that India is open to any
solution in its interest ... that would allow for nonproliferation
in the world.
	   ``We hope to cooperate with India to find the best solution for
that,'' he said, adding India appeared willing ``to engage in
discussions with Pakistan to try to lower tensions and to support
peace.''
	   Earlier Tuesday, Vajpayee and Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin discussed economic issues, including possible Airbus
contracts, energy issues and scientific and cultural cooperation.
An aide to Jospin also expressed criticism of sanctions against
India and Pakistan.
	   Vajpayee meets with Defense Minister Alain Richard and other
officials on Wednesday, before leaving that evening.
	   The visit comes eight months after Chirac's January trip to
India which the French Foreign Ministry said laid the foundations
for a ``durable partnership.''

 &UR; Primakov threatens to fire separatist governors &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told leaders of
Russia's far-flung regions Tuesday that they should not consider
separatism and threatened to fire any who disobeyed the federal
government.
	   Russia's economic crisis has fed separatist feelings in many
regions. Some have threatened to withhold tax payments until the
national government pays its debts, while others suspended food
shipments to other regions in an effort to hold onto their
resources amid a wave of panic-buying.
	   Primakov called for ``the preservation of the integrity of the
state'' and said the regions cannot say ``they don't want to pay
taxes to the federal center.''
	   He said the national government would draft legislation setting
out procedures for firing those popularly elected governors who
abuse their power and take separatist moves in violation of Russian
law.
	   ``We must stop this feudal-type thinking, or we shall lose
Russia as a single state and our successors shall never forgive
us,'' he said.
	   Many governors taking part in Tuesday's meeting supported tough
action against separatists but also called on the government to
give broader powers to the regions.
	   ``Life demands that we redistribute assets, taxes and powers in
favor of the regions,'' said Alexander Lebed, the governor of the
rich Krasnoyarsk province in Central Siberia and a leading
presidential hopeful. ``Then, strong regions will help create a
stronger Russia.''
	   Chechnya, in southern Russia, is the only region that has
formally declared its independence. Russia still considers it part
of the country, although Chechnya has been running its own affairs
since Russia withdrew its troops in 1996 following a two-year war.

Budget leaks hint of fierce battle ahead for Norway's coalition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Before Norway's minority government could
even present its 1999 budget proposals, details that were leaked on
Tuesday had opposition parties predicting a tough time in
parliament for the moderate coalition.
	   The three-party coalition, led by Christian Democrat Prime
Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, took power last October, too late to
make major changes in the national budget presented by the outgoing
Labor Party government.
	   The budget Bondevik's government is due to present Monday is a
test of its own economic policies. It comes at a time when low oil
prices chilled an economic boom and sent interest rates soaring in
Norway, the world's second largest oil exporter.
	   The Oslo newspaper Dagbladet, which claimed to have seen a
portion of the budget draft, said it includes 10 billion kroner
(dlrs 1.3 billion) in government spending cuts.
	   The newspaper said it also calls for 4.2 billion kroner (dlrs
560 million) in tax increases, higher electricity rates and
expanding a program of paying parents to stay home with their small
children.
	   The coalition, with just 42 of parliament's 165 seats, needs the
support of other parties to pass its budget. The government refused
comment on the leaks, other than to say it would ask police to
investigate how the secret documents became public.
	   The Labor Party, the largest is Parliament with 65 seats, said
it seemed the coalition did not know whether to seek support from
the poltical right or the left. The right was likely to reject tax
hike, while Labor opposes expansion of the paid parenting program.
	   ``The government seems to be flailing in all directions,'' said
Hill-Martha Solberg, of the Labor Party. ``This seems more like a
maneuver than a budget the government hopes to get passed.''
	   The coalition of Christian Democrats, the Center Party and the
Liberals plans to seek support from both political blocs.
	   Bondevik on Thursday returned from 3 1/2 weeks on sick leave to
recover from depression brought on by overwork. Newspapers have
said the budget will be his toughest challenge yet, with a good
chance of his government falling.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungarian customs officials found
nearly 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of heroin at a southwestern border

agency reported Tuesday.
	   Quoting national customs headquarters, MTI reported that the
drugs were found late Monday, in a car driven by a Slovene citizen
at the Redics border crossing, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southwest
of Budapest.
	   The estimated street value of the haul is 290 million forints

Religious body proposes censorship of satellite televisions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ An influential Islamic body has proposed that the
government set up a television facility that would censor foreign
satellite broadcasts and redistribute the programs by cable.
	   However, the sanitized broadcasts will not be compulsory and
people would be free to receive uncensored versions with personal
satellite dish antennas as they are doing now, the Islamic
committee said.
	   ``Every country has the option of protecting its values and
morals ... some people want to refine satellite channels before
they receive them and this project provides them with that,'' Adel
al-Falah, the vice president of the committee, was quoted as saying
by the state-run Kuwait News Agency.
	   ``Satellite dishes will continue to be available and everybody
is free to choose whatever they want,'' he said.
	   Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, founded the
committee in 1991 to study how Sharia, or Islamic laws, could be
gradually and fully implemented in this modernized but
tradition-steeped country.
	   Fundamentalist Muslims have significantly grown in popularity
since the 1991 Gulf War that ended a seven-month Iraqi occupation
of this oil-rich Gulf state.
	   They have tried three times without success to amend the
constitution to make Sharia the sole source of legislation. But the
emir has rejected an outright amendment, saying Kuwait was already
guided by Islam and implementing Islamic laws did not need a change
in constitution.
	   The emir's reaction to the optional censorship proposal has not
been made public.
	   Al-Falah told KUNA that the proposed station would delay the
reception by one minute so that censors could cut unwanted material
before distributing it by cable.
	   Studies conducted by the committee showed that 20 percent of
Kuwaiti families owned satellite antennas in 1995, al-Falah said.
The percentage is believed to have gone up now.
	   KUNA said the studies also showed that 80 percent of those who
did not own satellite antennas were worried their families would be
exposed to Western programs that contradict with their religious
teachings.

Haiti hurricane death toll reaches 147; Caribbean toll at least

370 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The discovery of 60 more flood
victims from Hurricane Georges in a remote Haitian border town
pushed the nation's storm death toll to 147, the government said
Tuesday.
	   All told, at least 370 people were killed during Georges'
rampage through the Caribbean last week, including 210 in the
neighboring Dominican Republic.
	   In Haiti, as many as 85 people died in the southeastern town of
Fond Verrettes, about 35 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of
Port-au-Prince, the National Palace said Tuesday.
	   Victims died in flash floods unleashed by Georges' rains along
the mountains that divide Haiti from the Dominican Republic, which
shares the island of Hispaniola. At least 40 people remained
missing Tuesday, the government said Tuesday.
	   Dozens more had been reported killed in hurricane flooding in
the capital, Port-au-Prince, and Haiti's central Artibonite Valley.
	   Ruined roads and an overwhelmed administration made it difficult
for officials to assess the damage until Monday, the government
said. More details weren't immediately available Tuesday.
	   Georges also killed five people in Cuba, three in Puerto Rico,
three in St. Kitts and two in Antigua.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Levi Strauss Europe on Tuesday
announced plans to close four factories in France and Belgium with
the possible loss of 1,560 jobs.
	   The company, a unit of U.S. clothing manufacturer Levi Strauss
and Co., said it was forced to restructure because of falling
demand for denim jeans.
	   In a statement, Levi said the drop in demand was due to a
decline in the European youth population, a shift away from denim
products and increased competition from smaller ``own label''
brands.
	   Company officials said the French and Belgian plants were
singled out because of high labor costs and overcapacity.
	   The company needs to reduce that overcapacity ``and we do that
by closing high-labor cost plants,'' said Paul Scheltens, a
spokesman at the Levi Strauss Europe headquarters in Brussels.
	   Communications Manager Mark Elliott said the company started
talks Tuesday with workers' representatives on the proposed
closures. He said it was too early to say when the plants might
close.
	   Levi said it would set up a new management organization to
develop products ``that meet the needs of existing and potential
consumers.''
	   The restructuring envisages laying off 931 production staff at
factories in the Belgian towns of Gits, Wervik and Deurne, and 530
at a sewing plant in the northern French town of La Bassee.
	   One hundred office employees across Europe could also face
layoffs over the next year. No layoffs were announced for Levi's
European headquarters which employs almost 600 people.
	   ``We regret that these restructuring proposals might lead to
plant closures and layoffs, but these options have to be considered
given the current and future business realities,'' said Carl von
Buskirk, president of Levis Strauss Europe, Middle East and Africa.
	   The proposed layoffs would effect about 20 percent of Levi's
European workforce of 7,500. Apart from the French and Belgian
plants, Levi has manufacturing and finishing plants in Scotland,
Spain, Poland, Hungary and Turkey.

Four shot dead when soldiers, police clash in Borneo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES death toll, injuries; ADDS detail &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police clashed with troops after an
exchange of insults on the island of Borneo Tuesday, leaving four
people dead and 12 others injured, police and a news report said.
	   A police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said two
police officers and two soldiers had died from gunshot wounds.
	   ``I just heard that four officers were killed,'' said the
officer, who refused to give further details.
	   The clash between soldiers from a cavalry unit and members of
the police special mobile brigade broke out in Pontianak, about 800
kilometers (500 miles) north of Jakarta.
	   The official Antara news agency said the clash between the two
groups, who live in neighboring dormitories, began after an
exchange of insults between policemen competing in a walking event
and a carload of soldiers.
	   It quoted Col. Encip Kadarusman of the local military as saying
12 officers were hospitalized for serious wounds.
	   A police dormitory was badly damaged, he added without
elaborating.
	   Some witnesses said they heard gunshots and that some security
personnel had been wounded.
	   The walking competition was part of celebrations ahead of
national Armed Forces Day next Monday.
	   In Indonesia, the police force is part of the military.
	   However, in recent months there have been growing calls for the
police to be made a separate organization as part of a push for
greater democracy following the resignation of autocratic President
Suharto in May.

Croatia wants to boost trade with Romania

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Croatia's Premier Zlatko Matesa, who
arrived here Tuesday for a one-day visit with 100 Croat
businessmen, said he wants to increase trade between the two
countries.
	   ``Our political relations are better than the economic ones,''
Matesa told reporters, adding he was actively seeking ways to boost
bilateral trade.
	   After meeting Prime Minister Radu Vasile, the two suggested that
trade could be expanded in the fields of energy, transportation,
medicines and agriculture.
	   Romanian and Croat government officials signed four agreements.
	   Trade in the first six months amounted to only dlrs 10 million,
said Gabriel Dumitrescu, a director of the Foreign Trade Chamber.
	   Last year, bilateral trade reached dlrs 34 million. Romania
exports trucks, cars, train cars, meat and chemical products and
imports minerals.
	   Romania's economy has been hit by a recession and purchasing
power has dropped. Croatia is recovering after the war in former
Yugoslavia.

Iran, Iraq exchange remains of soldiers

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran and Iraq on Tuesday exchanged the
remains of 228 soldiers killed during their 1980-88 war, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Iran handed over the remains of 117 Iraqi soldiers killed during
the conflict, and Iraq delivered the bodies of 111 Iranian
soldiers, the agency said.
	   The remains were recovered in a joint search operation which
began in May, it said.
	   The exchange took place in Shalamcheh in southwest Iran.
	   The war, which killed or wounded at least a million people from
both sides, ended with a U.N. brokered cease-fire, but animosity
has persisted over the issue of prisoners.
	   The two countries recently exchanged thousands of prisoners of
war. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross,
some 75,000 POWs from both sides have been freed since the war
ended.

On Judaism's holiest day, soul-searching in Israel
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In synagogues great and small, in army tents
and border bunkers, by the ancient stones of the Western Wall,
Israelis on Tuesday were ushering in the holiest day of the Jewish
calendar.
	   Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, lasts from sundown Tuesday to
sundown Wednesday. Jews the world over mark it by praying and
fasting, soul-searching and repenting, seeking God's forgiveness.
	   ``It's the time to confess your sins right out loud,'' said
Jerusalem tour guide Shmaryahi Yahav, 69. ``You try to improve your
communication with God, and with other people too.''
	   But even on a day of introspection, real-world tensions
intruded.
	   Military security was tight, the Palestinian lands were sealed
off, and little progress was seen in a round of just-finished peace
talks in the United States. In the West Bank, a car packed with
powerful explosives blew up, raising suspicions it was being
readied for a suicide attack.
	   In Israel proper, the holiday presented a rare spectacle: that
of a frantic and frenetic country simply shutting down.
	   Streets emptied as people hurried home for a final pre-fast
meal. For 24 hours, shops and businesses are shuttered, buses and
trains stop running, and virtually no one drives.
	   There are no international or domestic flights. Seaports are
closed. Border crossings are shut. News broadcasts cease.
	   At the Western Wall in Jerusalem's walled Old City, Judaism's
holiest site, tens of thousands of Jews gathered for prayers,
swaying and chanting before the expanse of yellow stone.
	   The day marks something of a truce in skirmishes between
religious and secular Israelis. Even though most Israelis describe
themselves as secular, nearly all go to synagogue on Yom Kippur,
and most also fast.
	   Synagogues are so crowded that many require seat reservations,
but by tradition, no worshipper is turned away.
	   Just before the start of Yom Kippur, some ultra-Orthodox Jews
observe the ancient rite of kapparot, or sacrificing a chicken to
atone for sins.
	   In the ultrareligious Jewish neighborhood of Mea Shearim,
bearded Orthodox men with chicken feathers clinging to their long
black coats swung birds in awkward circles overhead, chanting
prayers as they did so.
	   Afterward, the chickens are slaughtered and given to charity.
The rite is frowned upon by many more mainstream Jews, but those
who practice it defend it.
	   ``I don't really believe this chicken can expiate my sins _ it's
symbolic, a way of preparing for what's to come,'' Zechariah Till
said after waving a squawking bird over his small sons' heads and
reciting the traditional prayer.
	   Israel's entire army observes a holiday fast, and military
messes served up a hearty meal just beforehand. Large military
installations have synagogues, but remote outposts set up makeshift
temples in tents and bunkers.
	   The army insists religious observances don't compromise
preparedness _ a pledge that carries a special meaning this year,
the 25th anniversary of the Yom Kippur war.
	   Israel was caught off guard when Arab neighbors attacked on Oct.
6, 1973, when the holy day fell that year. Almost 2,700 Israeli
soldiers were slain in the 2 1/2-week conflict, shattering the
country's self-confidence about its military prowess.
	   As it normally does during Jewish holidays, Israel imposed a
blanket closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, refusing entry to
all Palestinians. Soldiers manned roadblocks and police checked
cars going into the Old City.
	   As a prelude to Yom Kippur, Jews are supposed to try to make
amends to fellow humans before they do with God. It's an old ritual
with modern touches like using e-mail to apologize for snapping at
a colleague or letting down a friend.
	   Yedideya Saidin, who runs a Jerusalem jewelry shop, looked up
from work over a fine silver chain to talk about cutthroat
competition in his trade.
	   ``You know how it is in business, sometimes you do things you
wish you hadn't,'' he said ruefully. ``So when this time of year
comes, we all just have to forgive each other.''
	   Sometimes, though, atonement is more of a formality.
	   On an Israeli TV talk-and-politics show aired Sunday, Jewish
settler leader Ahron Domb delivered an angry tirade against Yasser
Arafat. Then, in almost the same breath, he turned to Arafat's aide
Ahmed Tibi and asked pardon for any slights in the past year.
	   Tibi, a Palestinian who holds Israeli citizenship and is
familiar with the Yom Kippur custom, nodded. Then he gave Domb a
big grin.

Mandela pledges support for anti-apartheid friend charged with
</HEADLINE>
fraud &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela said he
will help former African National Congress official Allan Boesak
pay his legal bills. Boesak is on trial for allegedly embezzling
aid money intended for the anti-apartheid struggle.
	   The former Cabinet minister who once headed the World Alliance
of Reformed Churches is accused of stealing money from the
Foundation for Peace and Justice.
	   Boesak has pleaded innocent to 32 charges of fraud and theft of
about a million rand, then worth about dlrs 300,000. Donations to
the foundation came from singer Paul Simon, the Coca-Cola
Foundation, Scandinavian aid agencies and other people and groups.
	   Trial has been delayed by a dispute over legal fees. Last week,
defense lawyers walked off the case after Boesak ran out of cash to
pay them.
	   Speaking at a news conference in Cape Town, Mandela said he
thought the trial so far had shown Boesak is innocent. He said he
would do what he could to help him finance his defense.
	   ``All of us who are friends of Boesak will do everything in our
power to ensure that he has got the resources to defend himself,''
he said.
	   The state Legal Aid Board offered cash to pay for Boesak's
defense, but it was not enough to cover the costs demanded by his
legal team, whom he hired after receiving an anonymous donation of
a million rand (dlrs 167,000).
	   Local newspapers reported Tuesday that Mandela had helped find
another anonymous donor to pay the shortfall in lawyers fees,
allowing the case to continue. It currently is postponed until
October 19.
	   ``I honestly don't know who the donor is,'' an elated Boesak
told the Cape Argus newspaper. ``But I assume there are enough
funds available so I can pay for the rest of the legal fees.''
	   Opposition parties have accused Boesak of using his political
contacts to influence his case. When he returned from the United
States to face trial, he was greeted at Cape Town airport by a
cheering crowd and Justice Minister Dullah Omar.
	   Freddie Steenkamp, Boesak's bookkeeper at the foundation, was
sentenced in 1997 to six years in jail after pleading guilty to
embezzlement. Steenkamp said he was merely following Boesak's
example.
	   Boesak gave up an appointment as ambassador to the United
Nations in Geneva when the scandal involving his charity emerged,
and took a lectureship in the United States for a year.

Construction begins on new Warsaw bridge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Construction began Tuesday on a new
highway bridge over the Vistula river that divides Warsaw.
	   Poland's first suspended bridge will span 477 meters (1,574
feet) and open in the year 2000, officials said. The estimated 100
million zloty (dlrs 27.7 million) cost will come from city funds
and private sponsors.
	   The bridge will help ease heavy traffic between eastern and
western Warsaw, a city of 1.7 million people. It will replace a
pontoon bridge built 14 years ago that was supposed to be used for
only three years.
	   Six bridges currently cross the Vistula in Warsaw, and five more
are planned in coming years.

Priest sentenced to four years for sexual abuse of minors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that priest was Roman Catholic, youngest victim was only
13. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ An appeals court in east Bohemia
found a Roman Catholic priest guilty of sexual abuse of three minor
boys and sentenced him to four years in prison, the news agency CTK
reported Tuesday.
	   The priest, identified as Pavel Smekal, 39, was sentenced
already in June to three years in jail.
	   He appealed the verdict, but the appeals court in Hradec
Kralove, 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Prague, raised the
previous sentence by one year on Tuesday.
	   While Smekal maintains he is innocent, the judge condemned the
cynicism of the priest who abused minors dependent on him and
admiring him as their religion teacher, CTK said.
	   The youngest victim was only 13.

Ukraine's rightist lawmakers boycott visiting Russian speaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Right-wing lawmakers in Ukraine's
parliament boycotted a visit by Russia's parliamentary speaker
Tuesday to protest his calls for Ukraine's closer integration with
Russia and Belarus.
	   The deputies shouted ``provocation'' and about 50 of them walked
out of their parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, when Gennady Seleznyov
urged Ukraine to join the loose union between Russia and Belarus,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Seleznyov, speaker of the Russian parliament's lower house, the
State Duma, led a Duma delegation to Kiev on Monday for two days of
talks with Ukraine's leaders. He held friendly meetings on Monday
with Foreign Minister Borys Tarasiuk and parliament Speaker
Oleksandr Tkachenko.
	   But on Tuesday, rightist lawmakers refused to greet Seleznyov
before he started his speech and interrupted him many times by
shouting.
	   The rightist lawmakers resent Russia, which to them still
symbolizes the time when Ukraine was part of the Russian-dominated
Soviet Union. They also oppose communism, and Seleznyov is a member
of the Russian Communist Party.
	   However, Seleznyov appeared undaunted by the reception.
	   ``We are one people, and no one should doubt it,'' he said after
addressing the Verkhovna Rada to confirm his commitment to what he
said in his speech.
	   Belarus and Russia have already signed a union treaty that
pledged close cooperation in many areas, but stopped well short of
creating a single state. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko
has called for the restoration of the Soviet Union.
	   ``We do not understand why Ukraine does not consider joining the
Russia-Belarus union. Our people need it,'' Seleznyov said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Leaders in Ukraine have been critical of Seleznyov's previous
overtures on integration, which were seen as a larger threat when
Russian Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said he would also push
for a peaceful restoration of the Soviet Union if he won
presidential elections in 1996.
	   Ukraine, at odds with its two neighbors because it is seeking
closer ties with NATO, is looking to the West as it tries to shed
dependence on Russia and recreate itself as the center of Europe.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said he ``objects absolutely''
the union among Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, the three Slavic
members of the former Soviet Union.
	   He said the three countries should instead focus on closer
economic ties and work on implementing previously signed
cooperation agreements.
	   The union between Russia and Belarus ``has come to nothing,''
Kuchma said.

Malaysian politician's remarks spark strong criticism in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Members of a prominent Muslim
organization on Tuesday accused visiting Malaysian politician
Ghafar Baba of insulting the Indonesian government, people and
press, and urged that he be sent home.
	   Baba arrived in Jakarta Saturday, saying he had come as a
concerned individual to clear up any erroneous perceptions about
events in Malaysia, where Anwar Ibrahim has been ousted as deputy
prime minister and charged with corruption and illegal sexual acts.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has faced rising
protests at home and growing criticism abroad over the actions.
	   At a news conference Sunday, Baba defended Anwar's removal and
denounced Indonesian media, saying they had sided with the
dismissed leader.
	   ``If the Indonesian people want a figure like Anwar, just take
him and make him your leader,'' said Baba, whose nation also is
Muslim.
	   He was quoted as saying that ``perhaps'' Anwar was more
qualified to be a leader in Indonesia ``because in this country
homosexuality is not against the law.''
	   In a protest at the Malaysian Embassy, members of the Indonesian
Committee for World Muslim Solidarity urged the embassy to send
Baba home.
	   ``I told them that if Baba could not immediately be sent home,
then there will be widespread demonstrations,'' committee chairman
Achmad Sumargono said.
	   He described Baba's remarks as ``contempt for the Indonesian
government, people and media.''
	   Baba was scheduled to fly home Tuesday anyway.
	   It was the group's second protest at the embassy. On Monday, it
failed in an attempt to hand in a statement because of a holiday at
the embassy.
	   Earlier, Ais Anantama Said, a legislator from the ruling Golkar
party, said Baba should be expelled and blocked from re-entering
Indonesia.
	   Sofyan Lubis, chairman of the Indonesian Journalists
Association, said the Indonesian press had reported only on the
process of democracy in Malaysia rather than Anwar's personal
affairs.
	   Some analysts have likened Mahathir to Indonesia's longtime
autocrat, Suharto, who was forced to quit as president in May amid
protests and deadly riots.
	   But Baba, who was replaced as deputy prime minister by Anwar in
1993, said it was wrong to compare Mahathir with Suharto.

Economic crisis prompts pro-Japanese sentiment in disputed islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The economic situation in Russia's Far East is so
difficult that it is raising pro-Japanese sentiment among residents
of the formerly Japanese Kuril Islands, a regional official was
quoted as saying Tuesday.
	   Vladimir Zema, head of the Yuzhno-Kurilsk district
administration, pleaded for help from President Boris Yeltsin,
saying the situation in the Kurils carried the potential for
``political losses'' for Russia, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Zema presumably was talking about the potential for residents of
the Kurils to demand a return to Japan. The islands, north of Japan
and east of the Russian mainland, were claimed by the Soviet Union
after World War II, and remain a major point of contention.
	   Zema said the islands have ``an extremely small reserve of
flour,'' and he fears having to cut bread production and raising
prices. He asked Yeltsin to provide emergency financial aid.

Panel criticizes Dutch fight against child pornography and abuse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch efforts to investigate and
prosecute child pornography and abuse are hampered by a lack of
cooperation between justice officials and the police, an
independent panel said Tuesday.
	   The group, which spent a year investigating child abuse in the
Netherlands, recommended establishing a national child porn
prosecutor to coordinate the fight against pedophilia and the
exploitation of children.
	   In a report published Tuesday, the group also said applicants
for jobs working with children should be screened for previous
child sex convictions.
	   Justice Minister Benk Korthals said he would investigate the
possibility of setting up a national body to prosecute child
pornography and pledged to intensify efforts to fight child abuse.
	   Korthals also said his ministry would seek to establish a
central register of convicted pedophiles where institutions like
schools and children's hospitals could check the criminal records
of job applicants.
	   Set up in 1997, the panel's findings come at a time when child
abuse is a hot issue nationwide following the discovery earlier
this year of a huge cache of child pornography in the apartment of
a convicted Dutch pedophile who spread the images worldwide via the
Internet.
	   The shocking material, including the sexual abuse of children
aged as young as 18 months, sparked calls for much tougher policies
to protect children from pedophiles.
	   The panel, which interviewed police, justice officials and
volunteers who deal with abused children, estimated that as many as
one in three girls and one in 14 boys aged under 18 has been
sexually abused in some way at some time.
	   School leaders reacted positively to the proposed central
register of convicted pedophiles but the idea was rejected by the
nation's biggest teachers' union which said even convicted child
sex offenders should be given a chance to reintegrate into society
if they have not re-offended for a number of years.
	   But the panel insisted new legislation was necessary.
	   ``Even if a new law prevented only one child per year being
abused, then it would have achieved part of its goal,'' the group's
report stated.

Ugandan security forces seize guns, explosives, military uniforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Security forces seized guns, explosives
and military uniforms during house-to-house searches in the eastern
part of Kampala over the weekend, an army spokesman said.
	   The seizure included a box of suspected TNT explosives, five
submachine guns and eight military uniforms, said the official, who
asked that his name not be used.
	   On Tuesday, the government-owned New Vision newspaper quoted
military spokesman Capt. Shaban Bantariza as saying the operation
was also aimed at catching people posing as Ugandan soldiers and
trying to recruit people to fight with rebels in neighboring Congo
who are trying to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   On Sunday, legislator Ken Lukyamuzi, who represents the district
in which the security raids took place, told a public rally the
army was recruiting veterans to fight in Congo, which Bantariza
denied.
	   ``This is the second operation, and more are coming,'' Bantariza
told the newspaper.
	   On Monday, police spokesman Bob Ngobi said about 200 people were
rounded up in the weekend raids and 15 remained in detention
because they were ``idle and disorderly.''
	   Bantariza told the newspaper eight of those picked up had been
handed over to police.
	   Security services have been on alert since the Aug. 7 bombings
of the U.S. embassies in neighboring Kenya and Tanzania in which
259 people died and hundreds more were seriously injured.
	   The alert heightened after police and FBI agents uncovered an
alleged plan to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Kampala as well as
Ugandan targets. Ugandan authorities are holding 17 people in
connection with that plan.

Thai central bank sues more finance company executives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank said Tuesday it
has filed criminal charges of financial wrongdoing against three
senior executives of the now-defunct Finance One, once the
country's largest finance and securities company.
	   The company, like dozens of others, was closed by the government
last year when it fell into virtual bankruptcy. Several banks were
also forced to halt business.
	   The central bank accuses the Finance One executives of failing
to adequately scrutinize loans to two affiliated companies.
	   Rathakorn Nimwatana, a central bank assistant governor, declined
to name the executives but told reporters one was formerly a
chairman, while the two others were managing directors overseeing
commercial lending and investment banking respectively.
	   Rathakorn said that from Nov. 29, 1996, to Feb. 24, 1997,
Finance One lent a total of 2.13 billion baht (dlrs 54.6 million)
to two holding companies without collateral.
	   The first company borrowed 1.50 billion baht (dlrs 38.5
million), while the other borrowed 623 million baht (dlrs 16
million). Both have the same headquarters and a ``large accumulated
net loss,'' Rathakorn said.
	   Under Thai law, the two affiliated companies can't be named
until the lawsuit is settled.
	   Rathakorn said Finance One continued to make loans despite
financial statements as of Oct. 31, 1996, that showed the two
companies were making net losses several times bigger than paid-up
capital.
	   ``The Finance One executives were wrong because they lent to
companies they knew had been making huge losses,'' Rathakorn said.
	   He added that auditors to the two companies said in a report
that accompanied the financial statements that neither was
financially viable. The auditors said both would be unable to repay
loans to Finance One.
	   ``These companies never paid interest or loan principal, causing
damage to Finance One and its depositors,'' Rathakorn said in a
prepared statement.
	   He said that if found guilty, the Finance One executives could
face five to 10 years in prison and a fine of 500,000 to 1 million
baht (dlrs 12,800 to dlrs 25,600).
	   In the meantime, he said, none of the executives could leave the
country and their assets would be frozen.
	   Rathakorn added this case was the first lawsuit filed against
Finance One but would not be the last.
	   ``We are likely to see more,'' he said.
	   The granting of loans to insiders with little or no collateral
seems to have been a common practice with Thai banks and finance
companies before the financial system all but collapsed last year.
	   The government has been struggling since then to restore the
health of the financial sector. Its most recent major move came in
August when it announced a comprehensive restructuring plan for
ailing banks.

Singapore tourism still falls, more Chinese, British visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore continued to experience steadily
declining tourism and business visits, with August's arrivals 11.7
percent down from the same month last year.
	   Visitor arrivals for year so far declined 16.8 percent from the
first eight months of 1997, reaching 4,180,411, the Tourism Board
said in a report Tuesday.
	   Bucking the trend were visitors from China, most of them on
holiday. Almost 31,000 arrived in August, a 54 percent increase
over the same month last year.
	   ``The United Kingdom remained the bright spot among major
long-haul markets,'' the Tourism Board said, reporting a 14.5
percent increase in British visitors in August. However, there were
fewer business travelers among those 33,000 arriving Britons, the
board said.
	   The biggest percentage drops by country were for Malaysia, with
26.5 percent fewer visitor arrivals, and Taiwan, with almost 24
percent fewer.
	   The number of Japanese visitors declined by 18 percent, although
that left 90,000 who came.
	   More than 76,000 Indonesians also arrived in August, a 16.2
percent decline from a year earlier.
	   The Tourism Board said economic weakness in Taiwan, Malaysia and
Indonesia accounted for the reduced number of travelers.

Chevenement taken out of intensive care, reading newspapers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement,
who lay in a coma for a week after suffering an allergic reaction
to anesthesia, on Tuesday was taken out of the intensive care unit
at a military hospital, the Defense Ministry announced.
	   The 59-year-old Chevenement, who suffered cardiac arrest before
undergoing gall bladder surgery Sept. 2 at the Val de Grace
military hospital, also has been taken off dialysis, the statement
said.
	   Dialysis is a procedure used to remove waste from blood when the
kidneys no long function properly.
	   ``(Chevenement's) respiratory progress is very satisfactory and
his neurological state is very favorable,'' the statement said,
adding that he nonetheless must remain hospitalized for several
more weeks.
	   Chevenement was taken off a respirator last Thursday.
	   The minister suffered an allergic shock minutes after doctors
administered anesthesia which contained curare, a muscle relaxant
that is known to cause an allergic reaction in some patients.
	   Interim Interior Minister Jean-Jack Queyranne told French radio
that Chevenement had regained virtually all his intellectual
faculties and was watching television and reading press reviews.
	   ``This positive evolution demonstrates Jean-Pierre Chevenement's
stature and his physical, personal strength,'' he told France Info.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin paid a
visit to Chevenement, who is a key figure in the French Cabinet.
	   Chevenement has held several ministry portfolios, including
industry, education and defense. He resigned as defense minister in
1991 to protest France's involvement in the Gulf War.
	   The Interior Ministry is responsible for the nation's police and
security forces.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with call to Schroeder, plan for meeting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Germany's chancellor-elect agreed Tuesday to come
to Moscow for a meeting with Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president's
office said.
	   Yeltsin extended the invitation during a telephone conversation
with Gerhard Schroeder, the Interfax news agency said. Yeltsin
congratulated Schroeder on his victory in Sunday's election, in
which he defeated Helmut Kohl, one of Yeltsin's staunchest allies.
	   No date for the meeting was set, but Yeltsin's press secretary,
Dmitry Yakushkin, said it would be held ``shortly,'' Interfax
reported.
	   Yeltsin also telephoned Kohl and thanked him for strengthening
Germany's ties with Russia, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Yeltsin and Kohl had a ``warm and sincere'' conversation, the
news agency said, quoting Yakushkin.

Turkey warns U.S. to stay out of its internal affairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey on Tuesday protested a U.S.
diplomat's criticism of a jail sentence given Istanbul's Islamic
mayor, telling its ally to stay out of its internal affairs.
	   The Foreign Ministry registered its objections with the U.S.
Embassy in Ankara, the capital.
	   ``We consider comments by a foreigner on a verdict by Turkey's
highest judicial authority as an intervention into our internal
affairs,'' the Foreign Ministry said.
	   U.S. Consul-General Carolyn Huggins met Monday with Mayor Recep
Tayyip Erdogan, saying afterward that his prosecution served to
``weaken confidence in Turkish democracy.''
	   The Foreign Ministry said her comments went against diplomatic
custom.
	   Erdogan was sentenced to 10 months in prison for reading a
strident religious poem at a rally in December. The sentence,
upheld by an appeals court last week, means a lifetime ban from
public office for a man who was seen as a future leader of Turkey's
Islamic movement.

	   SAN JUAN DE LA MAGUANA, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Fallen bridges
and washed-out roads isolated one western Dominican town since
Hurricane George pounded it a week ago, but relief workers are
finally glimpsing the devastation in San Juan de la Maguana.
	   Shantytowns perched on a river's edge were buried under several
feet (a meter) of mud. Dazed residents trudged through the muck to
examine their flattened adobe and plywood homes while rescue
workers searched for bodies.
	   Residents walked nonchalantly Monday past the rotting carcass of
a horse buried chest deep in mud, its head arching toward the sky.
	   At least 76 people were killed here, the Red Cross has reported.
The exact toll remained unclear, however. Local hospital officials
said they had documented 19 dead, but suspected that many more
remain buried by relatives or trapped under the mud.
	   Georges killed at least 370 people, including at least 147 in
nearby Haiti, as it spun westward through the Caribbean last week.
	   While all Dominicans were affected one way or the other, it
appears the vast majority of the 210 dead nationwide were those too
poor to afford a better place to live. Most of the victims lived in
flimsy low-lying homes which were no match for the hurricane.
	   Flooding in this farming center of 20,000 people, located 75
miles (125 kilometers) west of the capital Santo Domingo, was
aggravated when workers at a dam upstream opened floodgates to
relieve pressure on the dam.
	   After a week of waiting for help to arrive, hurricane victims on
Monday waded into subsiding waters to guide the first relief trucks
into town.
	   In a small cemetery outside town, the graves of eight people
were marked by a two-foot-high (60-centimeter) mound covered with
red and purple flowers and crosses made of sticks. Nine other storm
victims were buried nearby.
	   Residents said they had some warning but were unprepared for the
disaster.
	   ``They told us before it happened, but I didn't think it would
be this bad,'' said Alejandro Mateo, 68, who fled his yellow
clapboard house in the Monte de Oca neighborhood as the water rose.
	   Until Monday, downed trees and bridges and raging streams
prevented rescuers from reaching the town by land or helicopter.
Both the U.S. Peace Corps and the U.S. Agency for International
Development said getting to San Juan was a priority.
	   Children dashed across a field Monday to collect packets of
disaster supplies dropped by a small Peace Corps plane buzzing over
the town. Doctors awaited medical supplies to vaccinate residents
against diseases and prepared for a surge in dengue and malaria,
both carried by mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water.
	   Two flatbed trailers carrying 110-pound (50-kilogram) bags of
rice donated by Australia arrived Monday afternoon, and workers
prepared the trucks for a push across a flooded roadway leading to
town.
	   A barefoot boy squatted in the shade beneath one of the trucks,
collecting falling grains of rice in a tattered red baseball cap.
	   U.S. helicopters were expected to fly in more supplies Tuesday.

Gypsy housing estate faces suspension of utilities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Tenants in one of the country's
largest Gypsy housing complexes face suspension of heat and running
water due to ``astronomic'' debts in back rent, officials said
Tuesday.
	   None of the 1,500 Gypsy inhabitants of the Chanov housing estate
in the town of Most, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Prague,
has paid rent in years, said Mayor Jiri Sulc by telephone.
	   The debts have already reached 25 million koruna (dlrs 830,000),
he said.
	   ``So far, the utility costs have been paid from the town's
budget, but funds are running out as rents in rent-controlled homes
and heating prices are rising steeply,'' said Sulc.
	   Running the housing estate costs tax payers 800,000 koruna (dlrs
27,000) a month, but the council says it only has enough money to
cover utilities till the end of September.
	   ``It's unfair on those who pay their rent on time,'' Sulc said.
``We can't support dodgers.''
	   Authorities fear, however, suspending utilities could worsen the
hygienic situation at Chanov, forcing the tenants to leave and
eventually squat other abandoned buildings in town.
	   An estimated 200,000 Gypsies, also known as Roma, live in the
Czech Republic. Human rights groups list an estimated 60-70 percent
unemployment as the most serious problem facing the Roma.

Britain's Blair seeks to rally his increasingly restive Labor
</HEADLINE>
Party &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Blair speech; trims previous &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Declaring he would rather be unpopular
than wrong, Prime Minister Tony Blair told his Labor Party
activists Tuesday that he will stick to an anti-inflationary
economic policy _ despite taunts he has become conservative and
authoritarian.
	   ``So we have set a tough inflation target. We will meet it,''
Blair declared, delivering his keynote address to the Labor Party's
annual conference. ``There will be no backing down.''
	   Blair flatly rejected calls by moderate trade union leaders and
a reviving left-wing of his party to restore to politicians the
authority to set interest rates, which he handed to the Bank of
England after Labor's landslide election victory 17 months ago.
	   The bank, under instruction to target inflation at 2.5 percent,
has resisted calls to lower interest rates, now 7.5 percent. This
has fueled the strong value of the British pound, making exports
expensive and encouraging cheap imports.
	   Many fear that _ aided by Asia's economic crisis _ unemployment,
which has fallen steadily since Labor took office, will rise
sharply within the next year.
	   Delegates gave muted applause in the Winter Garden conference
center as Blair, head of the centrist so-called ``New Labor''
party, said he could not intervene to devalue the pound.
	   He rejected charges of authoritarianism and adopting the
policies of the defeated Conservative Party.
	   ``Don't give me this nonsense that we're just a more moderate or
competent Tory government,'' said Blair, listing recent increases
in welfare and health spending, minimum wage rules and increases in
overseas aid.
	   Hailing the election victory of Gerhard Schroeder's Social
Democrats in Germany, Blair said the center-left has revived across
Western Europe, ending the dominance of conservative parties.
	   ``Five years ago, people said the politics of fairness was
finished, that only losers cared about social justice,'' Blair
said. ``Today, of 15 European Union countries, 13 have center-left
governments.''
	   Unveiling an initiative said to have been prompted by a meeting
this month with New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Blair announced a
program of ``zero tolerance'' policing in 20 high-crime, inner-city
areas across the country.
	   Critics, however, noted that no provision for extra policing
seemed to accompany it.
	   Left-wingers, enjoying a moderate revival during the six-day
conference, have accused Blair of ignoring dissent over his ``New
Labor'' centrist policies.
	   ``This control-freakery represents an actual danger to our
democracy if it continues,'' lawmaker Ken Livingstone told a
left-wing meeting Monday.
	   Left-wingers charge Blair with expunging dissidents as
candidates for next year's European Parliament elections, reducing
the six-day conference to a rally by permitting few votes on
policy, and having party headquarters control which delegates are
called for debates.

Official results confirm Meciar wins Slovakian ballot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's
party won Slovakia's general elections last week, according to
official results released Tuesday.
	   But a close aide acknowledged the party of the authoritarian
leader will likely end up in the opposition nonetheless.
	   Meciar's HDZS party was just ahead of the second-place Slovak
Democratic Coalition and lacking allies with enough seats in
Parliament to permit it to form a governing coalition. That means
it will likely be unable to form a majority government, said Gustav
Krajci, Meciar's interior minister.
	   Krajci said Meciar's party received 27 percent of the
Friday-Saturday vote and the Slovak Democratic Coalition got 26.3
percent.
	   Meciar himself got the most individual votes _ 470,556. Mikulas
Dzurinda, the leader of the Slovak Democratic Coalition, received
304,071.
	   The Central Election Commission reported that the Slovak
elections were free and fair. Kare Vollan, head of the observer
mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
said the fact that representatives of all 17 political parties
signed the election's official results means ``there will be no
disputes and questions.''
	   Starting Tuesday, the chairman of the parliament has 30 days to
call the new parliament into session, which will accept the
resignation of the old government and vote the new government into
office.
	   The four opposition parties gained a 93-seat majority in
parliament, compared to Mecca's party and his coalition partner,
the Slovak National Party.

Sri Lankan plane missing

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A plane carrying 55 people disappeared
Tuesday after taking off from Sri Lanka's troubled Jaffna peninsula
en route to the capital, aviation officials said.
	   A joint search by Indian and Sri Lankan air force planes was
halted at dusk with no clue about the plane's fate, aviation
officials said.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said navy
gunboats were still in the area looking for debris. They said those
on board the Ukrainian-built Antonov-24 included two Russian
pilots, five Sri Lankan crew members and 48 Sri Lankan passengers.
	   The plane left the Palali airport in Jaffna at shortly after
noon (0700 GMT) and lost radio contact within minutes. There was no
distress signal from the crew, the officials said.
	   They did not know whether the plane had crashed or was downed by
Tamil Tiger rebels fighting a separatist war in northern Sri Lanka
since 1983. The air search will resume Wednesday.
	   Government-held Jaffna, on the northern tip of this Indian Ocean
island, is linked to the rest of Sri Lanka only by air and sea
because of fighting between the army and secessionist ethnic Tamils
along the land route.
	   Lionair, which owns the missing plane, is one of two private
companies providing civilian air service between Colombo and
Jaffna. The airlines' planes normal flight path is over the sea
just along the coast, past areas held by rebels.
	   Two weeks ago, the Defense Ministry said the other airline,
Monara, had received an unsigned letter saying its planes would be
attacked if it did not cease service. Monara stopped flights for
two days, but then decided to resume.
	   It was not immediately clear if Lionair received a similar
threat.
	   Though the letter to Monara was anonymous, suspicion fell on the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam separatists, who have tried to
sabotage attempts to restore normalcy on Jaffna.
	   Earlier this month, the rebels were blamed in a bombing that
killed the new mayor of Jaffna city, the main city on the
peninsula, along with its military and police commanders.
	   Just a few months before the bombing, the previous Jaffna mayor
was shot and killed while she met with residents. That attack also
was blamed on the Tigers.
	   The Tigers seized Jaffna in 1990 and proclaimed a government for
the more than 1 million people who live in northern Sri Lanka,
where Tamils predominate. Sri Lanka's army retook the city in 1995
after a 50-day offensive.

Inquiry finds deputy PM got corrupt payment in mercenary affair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Former Deputy Prime
Minister Chris Haiveta received a ``corrupt and improper payment''
that may have been connected to mercenary company Sandline
International's contract with the government, an inquiry found
Tuesday.
	   The report of the second Commission of Inquiry into the
government's contract with London-based Sandline, chaired by
Justice Sir Kubulan Los, was presented in Parliament by Prime
Minister Bill Skate.
	   Skate announced the second inquiry into Sandline shortly after
he was elected in July 1997, after campaigning against the former
administration's aborted plan to use mercenaries to end the
10-year-old Bougainville secessionist crisis.
	   Haiveta on Tuesday denied the findings in the report, saying
they were ``simply untrue'' and had ``no basis in evidence.''
	   The inquiry found that Haiveta had bought a house in Port
Moresby and a part payment was made in Australia with funds from a
Swiss account ``three months before the Sandline contract saga.''
	   ``Nevertheless the commission believes that it (the transfer of
funds) may have been connected to that contract,'' the report said.
	   ``The commission has reached the irresistible conclusion that
the money Mr. Haiveta transmitted from Switzerland was a corrupt
and improper payment.''
	   The payment of 150,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 87,000) was
made in November 1996, from Switzerland to the Cairns bank account
of a doctor who was selling his house in Port Moresby to Haiveta.
	   The commission said the evidence on the purchase of a house by
Haiveta confirmed a suspicion based on other circumstances that
Haiveta had received a corrupt and improper payment.
	   The commission observed that Haiveta was a ``strong proponent''
of the Sandline contract and went to ``extraordinary means'' to
send U.S. dlrs 18 million to Sandline International in Hong Kong in
January 1997.
	   Haiveta had also falsely denied that he had deliberately planned
to meet Sandline personnel on a trip to Hong Kong in February 1997,
when a U.S. dlrs 500,000 cash withdrawal was made from the Sandline
account in Hong Kong.
	   The commission also observed that Haiveta had money and assets
acquired within the past 18 months that could not be wholly
accounted for from his and his wife's means.
	   In addition, Haiveta's evidence did not appear to be consistent
with income disclosed in the bank accounts held for himself and
Mrs. Haiveta, it said.
	   The commission said Haiveta's credibility was in question and he
had avoided telling the truth to both Sandline inquiries.
	   Haiveta said in a statement that he had referred the report to
his lawyers. He accused Skate of engaging in a ``political witch
hunt'' against him.
	   The first inquiry into the government's U.S. dlrs 34 million
contract with U.S.-based Sandline International cleared Haiveta,
former Prime Minister Julius Chan and former Defense Minister
Mathias Ijape of allegations that they corruptly benefited from the
deal.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Leading Christian Democrats called for a
sweeping renewal of the party Tuesday after outgoing Chancellor
Helmut Kohl led it to its worst defeat in 50 years in a national
election.
	   The Christian Democratic Union has dominated German postwar
politics by attracting a wide range of conservative voters. But
young members in particular worry that the party has fallen behind
the national mood during Kohl's 25-year chairmanship and his 16
years as chancellor.
	   One leading Christian Democrat implored the party to reshape as
a vigorous opposition party or risk seeing its support shrivel
further.
	   Kohl, whose campaign motto was ``Stability, not risk,'' cleared
the way for fresh faces Sunday after years of quieting internal
dissent. Conceding defeat to Social Democratic challenger Gerhard
Schroeder, he also announced he would step down as party chairman.
	   Kohl's protege Wolfgang Schaeuble, 55, is likely to succeed him,
and appealed for unity.
	   ``Everybody has to realize that overcoming such an election
defeat, and dealing with the end of the Kohl era, is a difficult
task,'' he said in an interview with Stern magazine published
Tuesday. ``All of us have to be disciplined now.''
	   But younger party figures who chafed under Kohl _ known as the
``Wild Youth'' _ took the opportunity to call for an overhaul.
	   One of them, Peter Mueller, said the party had failed to reach
out to intellectuals and environmentalists.
	   Mueller, a CDU leader in Saarland state, on the French border,
said the party lost backing because ``we are refusing to accept
realities in society'' _ for example, that families have fewer
children and that Germany is ``a nation of immigrants,'' despite
statements by the outgoing government that is is not.
	   ``We can only change that if the party reviews its politics and
comes up with a new approach,'' he said in a radio interview.
	   Lower Saxony governor Kurt Biedenkopf, a longtime Kohl critic
inside the party, said the CDU must modernize itself and not
continue working ``as if we were about to take over the government
again tomorrow.''
	   Biedenkopf's state was the only one in the east that voted for
the Christian Democrats on Sunday, largely due his popularity.
	   Schroeder captured many middle-of-the-road voters from the CDU
with his campaign for a ``new center'' in German politics. The CDU
and its Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union, slumped to 35
percent of the vote Sunday _ their worst showing since the first
postwar election in 1949.
	   Widespread weariness with Kohl was only one reason for the
crushing defeat. Over the decades, Roman Catholic voters'
identification with the party has waned as Germans have become less
religious.
	   One of the party's main unifying points was the fight against
communism during the Cold War, which Kohl helped to end by pushing
through German unification in 1990.
	   In recent years, the party was held together primarily by Kohl's
iron will to stay in power, highlighted when he ran for a fifth
term this year after promising to make way for a younger candidate.

Congolese rebels say Kabila recruting former Hutu commanders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels said Tuesday government
security officials have enlisted dozens of former commanders in the
the Rwandan Hutu army to fight on the side of President Laurent
Kabila in the eight-week insurgency in the vast central Africa
nation.
	   Rwanda, which together with Uganda is believed to be sponsoring
the rebellion, has repeatedly threatened to intervene in the
conflict to protect its territory from attacks by the former Hutu
soldiers and militiamen.
	   Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader, said former top Hutu military
commanders who fled Rwanda in mid-1994 fearing reprisals for the
1994 genocide, were recently recruited from refugee camps in the
Republic of Congo, to the north of Congo.
	   Among those who have left the camps on the north bank of the
Congo River and reportedly moved to the Congolese capital,
Kinshasa, are Maj. Gen. Augustin Bizimungu, a former chief
commander during the 1994 Hutu government-organized slaughter of
more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   Last week, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees asked
authorities in Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo, to
relocate thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees from the camps to avoid
their conscription into the war in neighboring Congo.
	   The U.S. State Department has also expressed concern over
allegations that Kabila's army has equipped and trained at least
10,000 former Rwandan troops involved in the 1994 genocide at
Kamina air base in southwestern Congo.
	   Kabila's government denies the accusation.
	   But both rebel commanders and Rwandan Hutu fighters taken
prisoner in recent attacks in and around the rebel stronghold of
Goma in eastern Congo said the Hutus had been fighting on Kabila's
side.
	   Maj. Sylvain Buki, a former Congolese intelligence officer and
one of the organizers of Aug. 2 rebellion, said even before his
10th Brigade in Goma took up arms against Kabila, they had been
ordered to transfer all captured Hutu fighters to Kamina.
	   ``We were ordered to tranfer them for national service, which
included military training,'' Buki said. ``Kabila used them for
preparing attacks on Rwanda.''
	   Rwanda and Uganda backed an earlier 1996-97 rebellion that
toppled former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and installed Kabila in
power in May 1997.
	   But both countries have been disappointed with his performance,
particularly his failure to secure their common border from rebel
attacks.
	   Buki and Karaha said the Hutu fighters captured in the Sept. 14
attack on Goma airport said they had been coordinating with
government forces.
	   Joined by Rwandan troops from across the border, the Congolese
rebels repelled the attack in which at least 300 people died.
	   About 50,000 Hutu refugees are believed to live in the Republic
of Congo and the Central African Republic since they fled Rwanda in
1994, together with close to 1 million civilian refugees.
	   After Rwandan-backed rebels attacked the refugee camps in
eastern Congo in October 1996 to dislodge Hutu fighters, most of
the refugees returned home.
	   But Hutu hardliners escaped through the Democratic Republic of
Congo to Congo-Brazzaville and the Central African Republic.

Pakistani opposition demands parliamentary debate on charges
</HEADLINE>
against Sharif &QL; 
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani opposition lawmakers
Tuesday demanded a parliament debate on a police report which
accused Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of siphoning millions of
dollars from his country's coffers into offshore bank accounts.
	   Britain's Sunday Observer on its Sept. 27 issue quoted a report
prepared by the Pakistani Federal Investigation Agency which said
the Sharif family was evaded taxes, defaulted on loans and has
illegally transferred funds into overseas accounts.
	   ``International thieves ... they have made the country
bankrupt,'' shouted opposition members on the floor of the National
Assembly (lower house) as the speaker squelched a debate on graft
charges against Sharif.
	   The government and the opposition legislators traded charges and
countercharges on the floor of the parliament.
	   ``It is a very serious charge,'' said Naveed Qamar, a member of
the main opposition Pakistan Peoples' Party. ``Parliament should
immediately start debate on the issue.''
	   The opposition lawmakers demanded Sharif's resignation and asked
him clarify his position. Sharif did not attend the parliament
session.
	   Sharif, scion of a rich business family, first became prime
minister in 1990. But his government was dismissed halfway through
his five-year term in 1993 on charges of corruption.
	   The Sharif family owns steel, paper sugar and textile mills and
its business empire spread during 1980s and 1990s when Nawaz Sharif
was in power.
	   The Observer, quoting the report of the agency known as the FIA,
said Sharif's assets include four apartments in London's exclusive
Mayfair district, worth more than 3 million pounds (dlrs 5.0
million), and the prime minister's family allegedly have more than
dlrs 70 million in foreign bank accounts.
	   The 200-page report was given to the newspaper by the FIA's
former second-in-command, Rehman Malik.
	   Malik was arrested soon after Sharif returned to power, in
apparent reprisal for his investigations of Sharif during his first
term. Malik was later released by a court on bail, but he fled to
London after a June assassination attempt.
	   Law Minister Khalid Anwar Monday told reporters that the
allegations were totally incorrect, misleading and based on forged
documents.
	   ``Rehman Malik is an outlaw against whom an international arrest
warrants have been issued. Anwar said. ``It is not an official
report of the FIA,'' he said.
	   The opposition has demanded an independent probe.
	   The Observer report comes as a serious political blow to Sharif
government as it faces an economic crisis and mounting opposition
over a proposed constitutional amendment that would introduce
strict Islamic laws.

Opposition says Albanian premier's resignation not enough

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Berisha statement.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's opposition Democratic Party
said Tuesday the resignation of Socialist Premier Fatos Nano was
not enough and demanded a ``technical government'' be set up to
arrange new elections.
	   Nano resigned Monday, two weeks after an opposition politician's
assassination sparked rioting led by the Democratic Party, with
angry protesters burning the first floor of the government building
housing Nano's office and took control of the parliament.
	   Socialist Party leaders were meeting Tuesday to nominate a
candidate to succeed Nano. Pandeli Majko, the 31-year-old general
secretary of the party, was expected to win the nomination.
	   Parliament selects the prime minister but the Socialists hold a
comfortable majority in the 155-seat chamber.
	   The Democrats, led by former President Sali Berisha, had been
demanding that Nano step down for weeks. But the party said Tuesday
that it was not satisfied with the resignation.
	   The party demanded a technical government _ comprised of experts
who are not committed to any party _ that could rule for up to a
year, until new elections could be organized.
	   In a statement, the party said such a government could also
establish public order and work towards passing the constitution. A
parliamentary commission has drafted the constitution and wanted to
hold a referendum on Nov. 28 to ratify it.
	   Until their demands are met, the Democratic Party said it would
continue holding street protests until its demands are met. It
called another protest for Wednesday.
	   But in a separate statement issued later Tuesday, Berisha called
on Albanians and public officials to trust the new ``political
solutions'' that are to be drawn up by the newly appointed prime
minister.
	   ``As the former president, I encourage the Democratic Party and
its allies for a more constructive spirit and a sense of compromise
to take part in a dialogue which is necessary to create a
government with a broader base,'' read the statement.
	    &UR; Nano became, 10th graf pvs.

Spanish Gov't says ETA must make next move to start peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed separatist group ETA's recent
cease-fire is not enough to constitute the start of a Basque peace
process, the government said Tuesday.
	   ``We can't speak of a peace process yet. What we have is a
suspension of activities by ETA,'' said government spokesman Josep
Pique. ``It's up to the violent ones, not us democrats, to prove
they are serious about peace.''
	   Pique was speaking after conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar met with Xabier Arzalluz, the leader of the Basque
Nationalist Party, the troubled northern region's governing party.
	   The meeting wrapped up a series of talks by Aznar to sound out
other parties' opinion of the ETA cease-fire and the future of the
Basque region.
	   ETA, which has killed nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign
for Basque independence, began an indefinite and condition-free
cease-fire Sept. 18.
	   The truce was the product of months of talks between Arzalluz's
party and the ETA-allied Herri Batasuna coalition. It comes before
Basques go to the polls to vote in a new regional government and
parliament on Oct. 25.
	   Speaking Tuesday, Arzalluz, whose party nominally backs a future
Basque independent state, said there were several points of serious
disagreement with Aznar but insisted the most important thing for
the moment was the consolidation of peace.
	   Arzalluz, known for his sporadic outlandish nationalist
statements, grabbed headlines this weekend when in an election
rally he claimed Basques did not fit in the current Spanish
constitution.
	   Aznar's Popular Party has demanded that the constitution must be
fully respected in any process toward Basque peace.
	   ``Terms of independence must be discussed within the
constitution, everything else is the law of the jungle,'' the
leader of the Popular Party in the Basque region Carlos Iturgaiz
said Tuesday.
	   Despite demands that the government make a reciprocal gesture to
ETA, Aznar's government has insisted that a lengthy, violence-free
period must pass before there can be any suggestion of peace talks
or concessions.

Blair urges politicians to compromise over arms deadlock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday
urged Northern Ireland leaders ``to close their ears to the
prejudices of their own parties'' and enact the Belfast peace
agreement in full.
	   Addressing the annual conference of his Labor Party, Blair
didn't explore in detail the difficulties confronting April's
accord on how Protestants and Catholics should jointly govern
Northern Ireland.
	   But in a series of meetings Wednesday, Blair expected to tackle
the key issues dividing David Trimble, the Protestant leader of the
still-unformed government; Seamus Mallon, Trimble's moderate
Catholic deputy, and Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn
Fein party.
	   Adams wants two posts for Sinn Fein in a new multi-party
administration for Northern Ireland to be led by Trimble and
Mallon. But Trimble is insisting that the Irish Republican Army
start disarming first as proof that its 14-month-old truce is
sincere.
	   April's agreement called for the IRA and the province's outlawed
pro-British paramilitary groups to disarm under international
supervision by mid-2000, but set no deadline for the process to
start.
	   Mallon has criticized both Trimble and Adams, saying that the
argument over IRA weaponry was ``being used as a smokescreen to
cover up an unwillingness on either or both sides to actually
assume the responsibilities that this agreement places upon all
political parties.''
	   But Trimble emphasized that the IRA needed to start meeting its
``responsibilities'' if it wanted to enjoy benefits from the
agreement, such as the early paroles for IRA prisoners that began
this month.
	   In his speech, Blair said the ``vast decent majority of people
in Northern Ireland'' wanted compromise but required ``people to
lead them.''
	   He said those on the side of peace included Trimble and Mallon.
To applause he added, ``And yes it takes people like Gerry Adams,
David Ervine and Gary McMichael, too.''
	   Ervine and McMichael lead parties linked with the two major
pro-British paramilitary groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force and
Ulster Defense Association, which in 1994 halted their campaign of
killing Catholics.

Jalabert threatened with expulsion from world championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Cycling governing body UCI is set to ban Laurent
Jalabert, the world's top-ranked cyclist, from next week's world
championship after he compared top officials to neo-Nazis, the
French daily L'Equipe reported Tuesday.
	   Frenchman Jalabert recently described the UCI as a
``dictatorship'' and its commissioners as ``half Dracula and half
neo-Nazi.''
	   UCI president Hein Verbruggen told L'Equipe that Jalabert has
until Sunday to write that he's sorry or be excluded from the world
championships, which begin Tuesday in Maastricht, the Netherlands.
	   ``If Laurent Jalabert doesn't send us a letter of apology before
October 4, if he maintains his attitude, he will be excluded from
the world championships,'' Verbruggen said.
	   That suspension could last between one and six months, he said.
	   ``We can not let this pass,'' Verbruggen said. ``Jalabert wanted
to put his comments on the table wittily, but I find his sense of
humor intolerable. Comparing people to neo-Nazis, that's not funny
and that's going too far.''
	   Jalabert has promised to apologize, but has still not done so,
Verbruggen said.
	   Still, Jalabert has already said that he might not be interested
in competing in the world championships, citing exhaustion and poor
health.
	   Meanwhile, the Festina team might challenge its expulsion from
the world championships, L'Equipe said.
	   Festina was kicked out of the Tour de France after admitting to
using the banned doping substance EPO. Earlier this month the
French Cycling Federation delayed disciplinary action, meaning that
the team is still ineligible for the world championships.
	   Festina members affected are Laurent Brochard, Pascal Herve,
Christophe Moreau, Didier Rous and Richard Virenque.
	   But according to the newspaper, Festina lawyers will argue that
there should be a presumption of innocence in favor of the
cyclists, and that the federation has no right to effectively bar
them from competition at this stage.
	   The deadline for entries to the competition is due to pass
Tuesday.
	   Separately, the newspaper reported that four cycling sponsors -
BigMat, Casino, Cofidis and Le Francaises des Jeux - want to draw
up a code of conduct to prevent repeats of the doping controversies
that marred the Tour de France.
	   Meeting last Friday in Paris, the sponsors agreed that doping
cases should be dealt with more quickly, and that there should be
stiffer sanctions for offenders.
	   ``We want to contribute to the redefinition of the rules that
must govern professional cycling,'' the group said, adding that
they want to establish ``a charter that is respectable and
respected.''

Ukraine's central bank to consult with the IMF over anti-crisis
</HEADLINE>
measures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Officials from Ukraine's central bank plan
talks with the International Monetary Fund this week on the
country's economic problems.
	   National Bank officials, headed by bank chief Viktor Yuschenko,
are scheduled to leave for Washington on Wednesday.
	   They plan to consult with the IMF about measures to stabilize
Ukraine's financial markets and stop the fall of the national
currency, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The hryvna has plunged in the past month following the financial
crisis in neighboring Russia. It was trading at 3.39 to the U.S.
dollar on Tuesday, close to the upper limit of the government-set
trading band of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar.
	   The IMF approved a dlrs 2.2 billion loan to Ukraine earlier this
month, but delivery of loan installments depends on fulfilling
conditions for improving the economy. A dlrs 70 million installment
is scheduled to be disbursed in November, Interfax said.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Top-ranked Martina Hingis opened the
women's era in the dlrs 6.7 million Grand Slam Cup by beating
Conchita Martinez 6-2, 7-5 Tuesday.
	   The Swiss, who will celebrate her 18th birthday Wednesday,
needed one hour and 20 minutes to overcome the 26-year-old Spaniard
and reach the semifinals of the women's draw.
	   ``I felt very well as a 17-year-old for the last time,'' Hingis
said.
	   ``Tomorrow, I am one day older, but that won't change much. I've
been getting ready and waiting for this moment for two years,''
Hingis said.
	   Eight women are participating in the lucrative event for the
first time since the introduction of the tournament in 1990 and
Hingis got the honor of playing the first match.
	   Hingis also beat Martinez in the final of the Australian Open to
win her only Grand Slam title of the year, and again earlier this
month in leading Switzerland to the Fed Cup title.
	   The tournament nominally brings together players with the best
records in the four Grand Slam events of the year _ the Australian,
French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   But three men's Grand Slam champions of the year have decided to
skip the tournament despite its huge prize money _ Wimbledon
champion and top-ranked Pete Sampras, U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter and Carlos Moya, the French Open champion.
	   Only Australian Open champion Petr Korda is among the 12 men
here.
	   In the opening men's match, Jonas Bjorkman rallied from a 5-1
deficit in the opening set to beat Tim Henman 7-5, 6-4.
	   Bjorkman saved three set points and broke Henman's serve when
the Briton committed a double-fault in the seventh game.
	   The Swede, fresh off leading Sweden into the Davis Cup final,
then rolled through the next five games to clinch the set. He broke
serve again in the fifth game of the second.
	   Bjorkman, currently No. 13 on the ATP computer rankings, reached
the quarterfinals of two Grand Slam events this year, in Australia
and at the U.S. Open.
	   Henman's best Grand Slam showing this year was at home, when he
reached the semifinals at Wimbledon. He is ranked 11th.
	   The women are fully represented, with Monica Seles the only
absentee from the top ranks. Seles refuses to play in Germany since
her stabbing at a tournament in Hamburg in 1993.
	   Hingis and Martinez played an erratic match and the Spaniard
didn't manage to hold serve until 5-2 in the second set.
	   ``It was a good match until 5-2 in the second set. Then she hit
exactly the corner,'' Hingis said. ``Then she hit exactly the
corner. I thought that was over, that's it. It somehow caught me
off balance.''
	   Martinez finally held serve for 5-3, then saved a match point
and broke Hingis to close within 5-4. She held again to level the
score.
	   Hingis was taken to deuce before holding for 6-5 and she finally
closed the match in the next game on Martinez' serve, hitting a
return backhand winner to the line on her second match point. She
extended her career record against Martinez to 6-2.
	   The men's winner will receive dlrs 1.3 million, the women's
800,000. But there are no ranking points at stake.
	   While Hingis made sure of collecting at least dlrs 200,000 for
reaching the last four, Martinez picked up dlrs 100,000 as a
consolation for losing in the first women's round.
	   ``It's a really a great tournament,'' Hingis said. ``It's like
starting in the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam. There are no points
to win, so you can really have fun playing.''
	   ``Of course, there is always the money, which isn't bad for
three matches,'' Hingis said.
	   Henman also picked up dlrs 100,000, while Bjorkman made sure of
earning at least dlrs 175,000.

Opposition says Albanian premier's resignation not enough
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Berisha statement.
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's opposition Democratic Party
said Tuesday the resignation of Socialist Premier Fatos Nano was
not enough and demanded an interim government be set up to arrange
new elections.
	   Nano resigned Monday, two weeks after an opposition politician's
assassination sparked rioting led by the Democratic Party, with
angry protesters burning the first floor of the government building
housing Nano's office and took control of the parliament.
	   Socialist Party leaders were meeting Tuesday to nominate a
candidate to succeed Nano. Pandeli Majko, the 31-year-old general
secretary of the party, was expected to win the nomination.
	   Parliament selects the prime minister but the Socialists hold a
comfortable majority in the 155-seat chamber.
	   The Democrats, led by former President Sali Berisha, have been
demanding for weeks that Nano step down. But the party said Tuesday
that it was not satisfied with the resignation.
	   The party demanded an interim government _ comprised of experts
who are not committed to any party _ that could rule for up to a
year, until new elections could be organized.
	   In a statement, the party said such a government could also
establish public order and work toward passing the constitution. A
parliamentary commission has drafted the constitution and wants to
hold a referendum on Nov. 28 to ratify it.
	   Until their demands are met, the Democratic Party said it would
continue holding street protests until its demands are met. It
called another protest for Wednesday.
	   But in a later statement Tuesday, Berisha urged Albanians and
public officials to trust the new ``political solutions'' that are
to be drawn up by the newly appointed prime minister.
	   ``As the former president, I encourage the Democratic Party and
its allies for a more constructive spirit and a sense of compromise
to take part in a dialogue which is necessary to create a
government with a broader base,'' read the statement.

Airplane carrying Ugandan officers missing in Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and updates throughout with confirmation that plane
missing; details

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A light airplane carrying civilians and a
top Ugandan army officer to a town controlled by rebels in
northeastern Congo has gone missing, the army spokesman said
Tuesday.
	   Capt. Shaban Bantariza said the aircraft chartered from Tropical
Airways left Entebbe Friday for Bunia, about 370 kilometers (230
miles) north of Congolese rebel headquarters in Goma at the head of
Lake Kivu.
	   He said the civilian aircraft was carrying two Ugandans, two
foreign civilians whose nationalities he did give and Col. Jet
Mwebaze, a brother of Brig. James Kazini, the acting chief of staff
of the Ugandan armed forces.
	   Shaban said shortly before the plane disappeared, it had been
seen hovering at a low altitude after it crossed the border into
Congo near Kasese, about 280 kilometers (175 miles) west of
Kampala, apparently looking for a place to land.
	   He said the plane probably crashed. He ruled out the possibility
it had been shot down by forces loyal to Congolese President
Laurent Kabila since his troops do not control any airstrips in the
northeastern Congo region.
	   Bunia is 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of the Ugandan border.
	   Witnesses in Bunia say Ugandan troops are guarding the airport
there.
	   Kabila accuses Uganda and Rwanda of backing the eight-week
rebellion by disgruntled soldiers and political opponents.
	   Under an agreement signed earlier this year by Kabila and
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Uganda sent troops to the border
areas of eastern Congo in an attempt to flush out Ugandan rebels
who were attacking Uganda.
	   Museveni told parliament last week that he would keep Ugandan
troops in Congo as long as there was a threat to Ugandan security.
	   He has denied Kabila's claims that Ugandans are fighting
alongside the Congolese rebels.
	   The Alliance of Democratic Forces rebels who are trying to oust
Museveni operate from bases at the foot of the Rwenzori Mountains
inside Congo.
	   Shaban denied reports that an air strike Sunday on the Ugandan
village of Bukaka outside Bundibugyo, about 380 kilometers (235
miles) west of Kampala at the northern tip of the Rwenzori
mountains, had been carried out by Congolese forces loyal to
Kabila.
	   He said the army had information that the attacks were carried
out by Sudan, which Uganda claims has been flying supplies into
airstrips in northeastern Congo for the ADF fighters and has been
accused of helping Kabila to fight the Congolese rebellion.
	   Sudan denies the claims.

Germany has paid 1.1 billion marks to Jews persecuted by Nazis
</HEADLINE>
since 1992 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The German government said Tuesday it has
paid more than 1.1 billion marks (dlrs 654.8 million) since 1992 to
Jews persecuted by the Nazis who are now struggling under financial
hardships.
	   According to a government statement, the money was paid by the
Finance Ministry under an agreement signed in 1992 with the Jewish
Claims Conference, which represents persecuted Jews and distributes
the payments to those eligible worldwide.
	   The agreement applies to those who suffered severe persecution
and are now living under economic hardship.
	   In most cases the money was paid to people now living in Israel
and the United States who were used by the Nazis for slave labor or
imprisoned in concentration camps for six months or more, according
to the statement.
	   A total of 377.65 million marks (dlrs 244.79 million) was in
one-time aid of up to 5,000 marks (dlrs 3,000) to 75,530 people
eligible as of June 30, the statement said.
	   Continuing payments were made to 21,620 victims in Israel and
11,636 in the United States and amounted to a total of 511,48
million marks (dlrs 304.45 million), the statement said.
	   One-time payments amounting to 182.8 million marks (dlrs 108.8
million) were also made to 28,331 applicants, about half of which
were held by the Nazis in concentration camps, while the remainder
were forced to live in ghettos or otherwise persecuted, the
statement said.
	   Another 35 million marks (dlrs 20.83 million) has been made
available to support homes and care facilities for the aged, with
25 million marks (dlrs 14.88 million) earmarked for such projects
in Israel, the government said.
	   The remainder of the funds were divided between projects in
Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, France, Great Britain,
Canada, and the United States, the statement said.
	   In all, Germany has paid a total of 122 billion marks (dlrs
72.62 billion at today's exchange) in restitution and other
payments to victims of the Nazis since the war, a Finance Ministry
spokesman in Bonn said.

Ukrainian courts sentence 81 people to death this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian courts have sentenced 81 people
to death so far this year, but none of the sentences have been
carried out, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Two of those sentenced to death are women, ITAR-Tass said,
citing Ukraine's Supreme Court.
	   Ukraine pledged to halt capital punishment when it joined the
Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights
organization, in 1995. However, 180 people were killed before the
former Soviet republic started to comply with the moratorium in
March 1997.
	   Ukraine's legislature recently gave preliminary approval to a
new criminal code that permits use of the death penalty only during
martial law.
	   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, said
Ukraine was second only to China in the use of capital punishment
in 1996.

Secretary debunks Vatican reports after John Paul I's death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Pope John Paul I's death 20 years ago, after only 33
days in the papacy, raised a slew of conspiracy theories by those
refusing to believe the Vatican's version.
	   Now, a top aide to the late pope has gone on television
suggesting the Vatican may have itself to blame for the
speculation.
	   Monsignor John Magee, now a bishop in Ireland, insists John Paul
died of natural causes _ a heart attack _ but debunked some of the
reports from the Vatican following the death on Sept. 28, 1978.
	   ``When you begin to change things, even a coffee can raise
suspicions,'' Magee said in an interview broadcast this week on
Italian state television, RAI.
	   Magee, who was the pope's secretary, singled out the Vatican's
official version that he discovered the pope's body. He said it was
actually a nun, Sister Vincenza.
	   He said the Vatican's secretary of state, the late Cardinal Jean
Villot, believed it was more ``convenient'' to give that version.
	   He told The Associated Press by telephone from Cloyne, Ireland,
that the nun always brought the pope a cup of coffee and left it
outside his door, but finding it untouched that morning burst in
the room and found John Paul dead. He said she then alerted him.
	   Magee also challenged a report at the time that the pope was
reading a religious tract the night before his death. Instead, the
former secretary said John Paul was reading some of the homilies he
had delivered while archbishop of Venice.
	   Some of the theories about his death have suggested he was
poisoned, claiming he planned to expose a Vatican banking scandal
or planned to revolutionize the Vatican.
	   Magee said he has raised these issues in the past, but it was
the first time he gave a television interview on the pope's death.

Hundreds of Ukrainian nuclear plant employees demonstrate in Kiev

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from nuclear plants union leader in
grafs 5-6 &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ About 300 angry workers from Ukraine's
nuclear power plants demonstrated Tuesday at the government
headquarters and demanded overdue wages.
	   Wearing the white uniforms of nuclear plant operators, the
protesters from Ukraine's five nuclear plants occupied the pavement
in front of the Cabinet building, chanting, ``wages, wages,
wages.''
	   The demonstration began while union representatives were
negotiating with government officials on the delayed salaries, some
of which are six months overdue.
	   The government said Friday it planned to release 63 million
hryvna (dlrs 19 million), which is 10 million hryvna (dlrs 3
million) less than the total wage debt to nuclear plant employees.
But a final decision was still pending.
	   The union leader representing nuclear workers said the
demonstration would continue until the government agrees to pay
back salaries and warned that the problem could lead to safety
problems at nuclear facilities.
	   ``We do not want the Chernobyl catastrophe to repeat,''
Oleksandr Yurkin said, referring to the 1986 explosion and fire at
the Chernobyl nuclear plant.
	   Ukraine's nuclear power plants account for about half of all
electricity generated in the former Soviet republic. But the plants
are owed hundreds of millions of dollars for electricity they have
supplied, and can barely make ends meet.
	   Officials from various nuclear plants have complained that most
of what the state owes them has already been lost because of a
recent sharp devaluation of the national currency.
	   Over the weekend, about 3,000 people demonstrated at the
Zaporizhia nuclear plant, while dozens of workers at the Yuzhnaya
plant have stayed for nearly a week at a self-made tent camp on the
plant's grounds.
	   Organizers have said their protest was not intended to hamper
the plants' work, and government officials said Tuesday they were
closely watching safety conditions at the nuclear facilities.
	   ``As soon as we see that a plant or a reactor is operating even
just a little below the necessary safety levels, we will
immediately shut it down,'' Environment and Nuclear Safety Minister
Vasyl Shevchuk said.

East Timor rebel leader vows to keep fighting Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A leader of East Timor's guerillas said
Tuesday that the armed struggle for independence would continue
because Indonesia has refused to negotiate an end to Jakarta's rule
in the half-island territory.
	   ``We've no other choice than to keep on fighting,'' Taur Matan
Ruak said in an interview broadcast on Portuguese state radio RDP.
	   ``We've have several times stated our willingness to negotiate a
solution with the Indonesians, without pre-conditions ... but
(Indonesian President) Habibie has never made himself available,''
Ruak said in Portuguese by phone from East Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, 2,000 kilometers (1,300 miles)
east of Jakarta, in 1975, a year after the departure of Portugal's
colonial administration a year earlier.
	   The guerillas _ who are thought to number fewer than 100 and who
operate out of the thick bush in East Timor's mountainous interior
_ have launched sporadic attacks on Indonesian outposts in the
territory over the past 20 years, killing dozens of Indonesian
troops.
	   However, they ceased military activity in the hope that
President B.J. Habibie would adopt a softer line on East Timor than
his predecessor Suharto, who stepped down last May.
	   Habibie has offered to grant some autonomy to East Timor and to
release imprisoned rebel leader Xanana Gusmao in exchange for
international recognition of the region as Indonesia's 27th
province.
	   Gusmao's release was a ``fundamental'' first step in negotiating
a lasting solution for the territory, Ruak said, adding that
autonomy would be only an interim solution on the road to full
independence.
	   The United Nations is brokering ongoing talks between Lisbon and
Jakarta on East Timor. The next meeting is scheduled for New York
on Oct. 6.
	   Portugal insists that a referendum be held in East Timor on the
territory's future.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ U.S. Air Force officials struck a deal
with a Turkish labor union on Tuesday, ending a 69-day strike at
NATO bases in Turkey just days ahead of a planned military
exercise.
	   ``The workers will return to their posts on Wednesday,'' said
Tevfik Mustu, a union official.
	   The breakthrough came when the Air Force agreed Monday to a 20
percent salary increase retroactive to April 1 and guaranteed there
would be no layoffs among the 1,800 striking workers. Each worker
will also get dlrs 800 in partial compensation for lost wages,
Mustu said.
	   The union said the salary hike amounted to a 50 percent increase
as of Oct. 1 including inflation readjustments.

wreckage &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Crash investigators want to bring in
more heavy equipment to recover wreckage from Swissair Flight 111
before the beginning of the North Atlantic winter storm season.
	   Investigators are worried that currents stirred by surface
storms will scatter human remains and debris on the bottom of the
ocean, making recovery more difficult.
	   ``In November, it's not fit for man or beast out on the ocean
and we've got to contend with that,'' Jim Harris, spokesman for the
Transportation Safety Board of Canada, said Monday.
	   Investigators have set an Oct. 31 deadline to recover all the
wreckage. So far, only 10 percent or less of the 61-meter-long
(200-foot-long) MD-11 has been brought ashore since it crashed on
Sept. 2, killing all 229 people on board. The flight was enroute
from New York to Geneva, Switzerland.
	   The U.S. Navy salvage ship USS Grapple used its heavy-lift
capabilities earlier this month to haul up some large pieces _ the
nose landing gear, the main left landing gear and a seven-meter
(23-foot) section of fuselage.

Airplane carrying Ugandan officers missing in Congo

 &UR; Eds: ADDs dropped word ``not'' graf 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A light airplane carrying civilians and a
top Ugandan army officer to a town controlled by rebels in
northeastern Congo has gone missing, the army spokesman said
Tuesday.
	   Capt. Shaban Bantariza said the twin-engine Islander aircraft
chartered from Tropical Airways left Entebbe Friday for Bunia,
about 370 kilometers (230 miles) north of Congolese rebel
headquarters in Goma at the head of Lake Kivu.
	   He said the civilian aircraft was carrying two Ugandans, two
foreign civilians whose nationalities he did not give and Col. Jet
Mwebaze, a brother of Brig. James Kazini, the acting chief of staff
of the Ugandan armed forces.
	   Shaban said shortly before the plane disappeared, it had been
seen hovering at a low altitude after it crossed the border into
Congo near Kasese, about 280 kilometers (175 miles) west of
Kampala, apparently looking for a place to land.
	   He said the plane probably crashed. He ruled out the possibility
it had been shot down by forces loyal to Congolese President
Laurent Kabila since his troops do not control any airstrips in the
northeastern Congo region.
	   Bunia is 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of the Ugandan border.
	   Witnesses in Bunia say Ugandan troops are guarding the airport
there.
	   Kabila accuses Uganda and Rwanda of backing the eight-week
rebellion by disgruntled soldiers and political opponents.
	   Under an agreement signed earlier this year by Kabila and
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Uganda sent troops to the border
areas of eastern Congo in an attempt to flush out Ugandan rebels
who were attacking Uganda.
	   Museveni told parliament last week that he would keep Ugandan
troops in Congo as long as there was a threat to Ugandan security.
	   He has denied Kabila's claims that Ugandans are fighting
alongside the Congolese rebels.
	   The Alliance of Democratic Forces rebels who are trying to oust
Museveni operate from bases at the foot of the Rwenzori Mountains
inside Congo.
	   Shaban denied reports that an air strike Sunday on the Ugandan
village of Bukaka outside Bundibugyo, about 380 kilometers (235
miles) west of Kampala at the northern tip of the Rwenzori
mountains, had been carried out by Congolese forces loyal to
Kabila.
	   He said the army had information that the attacks were carried
out by Sudan, which Uganda claims has been flying supplies into
airstrips in northeastern Congo for the ADF fighters and has been
accused of helping Kabila to fight the Congolese rebellion.
	   Sudan denies the claims.

Greens' German success reflects movement's growth in Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC;  Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Greens' success in Germany's
national elections is only the latest bloom for a movement that has
flowered in much of Europe _ now part of three countries'
governments and holding a potentially key role in Sweden.
	   After grabbing international attention in the early 1980s when
the intense and charismatic Petra Kelly led the party to prominence
in Germany, the Greens faded, winning seats in European
parliaments, but remaining marginal.
	   But in the latter half of the 1990s, the Greens joined governing
coalitions in Finland, Italy and France and now have been invited
to join Germany's Social Democrats in governing Europe's biggest
nation.
	   ``There is a fresh wind of reform in Europe. The age of
conservative and neoliberal governments in the EU has definitely
come to an end,'' proclaimed Magda Aelvoet of Belgium, president of
the Green Group in the European Parliament.
	   The Greens have used their rising power to considerable effect
on their core environmental issues. In Italy, Greens Environment
Minister has been influential in pushing through legislation
increasing the number of national parks, imposing stricter criteria
for sewage treatment and forcing manufacturers of Italy's
ubiquitous mopeds to build less-polluting models.
	   France's Enviroment Minister Dominique Voynet organized last
week's ``Day Without Cars,'' where streets were blocked to motor
vehicles in 35 cities and pushed through legislation allowing only
new cars with catalytic converters to drive in Paris during
high-pollution days.
	   But it is in Sweden where the party may face its first serious
test of its ability to handle issues other than the environment.
	   Because of a weak showing by the governing Social Democrats in
this month's national elections, the Greens ended up being key to
the party retaining power. The Social Democrats declined to invite
the Greens into a coalition, but must rely on their support _ and
that of the ex-Communist Left Party _ to have a majority in
parliament.
	   Many analysts have predicted the awkward assemblage will quickly
collapse because the Greens and the Left would force the Social
Democrats to abandon economic pragmatism in order to push for
funding of pet programs.
	   The first test will be with the national budget, which is to be
presented Oct. 13, and the parties have been negotiating on it for
several days. So far, the Greens have been showing a practical
streak.
	   The party is going along with the Social Democrats' schedule for
paying off the national debt _ which the Left Party wants to slow
down. And the Greens may end up helping the Social Democrats back
out of what is now widely considered a badly conceived promise to
set a maximum cost for child day-care of 700 kronor (dlrs 85) a
month.
	   That's less than many people pay now and the proposal could be
costly. But the Greens object to it on the grounds that it would be
unfair to charge the wealthy so little _ an objection that may give
the Social Democrats a graceful way to abandon the idea.
	   Tougher issues are on the horizon. The Greens, like the Left,
oppose Sweden's membership in the European Union and want a
referendum held quickly on whether Sweden should join the EU's
unified currency. Surveys have indicated most Swedes oppose
membership in the currency system and the Greens and the Left
contend that voting to stay out of it would be tantamount to
withdrawing from the EU.
	   While the Social Democrats aim to keep Sweden's purse-strings
tight as the country recovers from economic hard times, the Greens
are firm in their push for more funding for environmental programs
and plan to flex their power.
	   ``The Greens have no interest in standing with a budget that
doesn't contribute to the environment,'' top party official
Marianne Samuelsson warned this week, according to the newspaper
Dagens Nyheter.

New bid disrupts proposed retail takeover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A surprise bid by an unlisted
company has disrupted plans by Vendex International and Koninklijke
Bijenkorf Beheer (KBB) to merge the country's top department store
chains.
	   Since February, Vendex has been in the process of acquiring its
competitor KBB in a 1.7 billion-guilder (dlrs 894 million) deal for
all outstanding KBB shares.
	   But the unlisted Dutch group WE International BV announced
Monday it is willing to pay 1.9 billion guilders (dlrs 1 billion)
for KBB.
	   The offer will likely force Vendex to up its bid, analysts said
Tuesday.
	   ``If there's an offer like that, Vendex will have to discuss the
offer, unless it becomes clear quickly that the WE International
offer doesn't hold water,'' said analyst Peter Wortel with Delta
Lloyd in Amsterdam.
	   WE International, which has 260 clothing stores in six European
countries, has said it intends to make only a friendly offer. But
KBB's management, as well as Vendex, could feel the pressure of
KBB's shareholders.
	   A group of shareholders, controlling about 40 percent of the KBB
stock, has always maintained that the Vendex offer is too low.
	   The original merger aimed to bring together under one parent
company the top Dutch department store chains Vroom and Dreesmann,
De Bijenkorf and Hema.

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The president of the rebel region of
Chechnya rebuffed calls for his resignation Tuesday and proposed
the public execution of one of his most outspoken political foes.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov has been increasingly under fire from
his political opponents, led by former rebel leaders Salman Raduyev
and Shamil Basayev. At their behest, a congress of veterans passed
a vote of no confidence in Maskhadov.
	   The political battle is being fought against a backdrop of
continued lawlessness and violence in Chechnya, which fought a
two-year war of secession against Russia and now considers itself
fully independent. Chechen gunmen clashed with Russian police in a
neighboring region Tuesday.
	   Russia continues to consider Chechnya a semi-autonomous Russian
republic, and no country has recognized the Chechen claim to
independence.
	   Russia's former security chief, Alexander Lebed, who negotiated
an end to the Chechen war in 1996, said attacks on the Chechen
president could push the southern region into a civil war.
	   ``Maskhadov is a reasonable man, and without him Chechnya would
turn mad,'' Lebed said at a news conference in Moscow.
	   He added that Maskhadov is capable of reining in his foes. ``As
an experienced general, Maskhadov has kept his reserves intact,''
Lebed said.
	   Raduyev, who gained notoriety for a hostage-taking raid in
Russia during the war, said Maskhadov was guilty of ``violating the
constitution and of inability to rule the country,'' according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   Raduyev said Maskhadov deserved to be prosecuted and should step
down from his post for ``aggravated crimes against the Chechen
people.''
	   Maskhadov tried to blunt the criticism by taking over the
stadium where his opponents had planned to hold the congress. He
presided over a military ceremony at the stadium while the veterans
held their congress nearby.
	   Addressing his group, Maskhadov said that Raduyev deserves to be
shot in a central square in Grozny, the Chechen capital, where a
number of public executions have taken place, Russian news agencies
reported.
	   Maskhadov's move only further infuriated the congress.
	   Basayev, who came in second in the presidential election and
served as prime minister under Maskhadov for the first six months
of this year, has become increasingly critical of the president
since stepping down.
	   He said the president had ``distanced himself from the people''
and was ``unable to rule the country.''
	   Maskhadov was a leading rebel commander during the war and won a
landslide election victory in January 1997. But he has been unable
to stem a wave of kidnappings and other crimes that has plagued
Chechnya and often spilled into neighboring regions.
	   In the latest incident on Tuesday, Russian police in the
southern region of Dagestan, which borders Chechnya, fended off an
attack by a group of Chechen gunmen who tried to kidnap a regional
leader, Interfax reported.
	   The clash left six assailants dead and 10 wounded, and two
police officers were also wounded, the report said, quoting local
officials. The local leader and his driver were released but also
wounded.
	   Maskhadov's moves to crack down on crime have proven largely
ineffective because the Chechen opposition has refused to heed many
of his orders and accused him of maintaining too-close relations
with Russia.

Oil officials: China searching for oil in southern Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ China's National Petroleum Corp. has begun
surveying its concession in southern Iraq for oil, Iraqi Oil
Ministry officials disclosed on Tuesday.
	   It was unclear if the activity violates U.N. sanctions, which
ban most trade and financial dealings with Baghdad.
	   The Iraqi officials said the state-owned Chinese company had
begun work under an agreement it signed with Baghdad in June 1997
for development of the Al-Ahdab field.
	   China is one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council and has long opposed the continuation of U.N. sanctions on
Iraq.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil, ban air travel and bar most financial
transactions.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions will not be
lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq on Aug. 5 announced it no longer would cooperate with the
inspectors, and the Security Council has suspended its regular
review of the sanctions to try to force Baghdad to change its mind.
	   CNPC has rights to the Al-Ahdab field, expected to yield a
billion barrels of oil, in Kut province, which is 170 kilometers
(l05 miles) south of Baghdad.
	   A Baghdad magazine, Nabed al-Shabab, reported Tuesday that joint
Chinese-Iraqi teams of engineers were conducting surveys at
Al-Ahdab.
	   The magazine quoted Karim Ahmad, a senior Iraqi oil official, as
saying ``exploration has been going on for about two months.''
	   The Oil Ministry officials, speaking on the customary condition
of anonymity, confirmed reports in the state-run press this week
that China and Iraq have set up a joint company to drill at
Al-Ahdab.
	   They said the Chinese company was working through an Iraqi firm,
the General Company for Oil Explorations, which has been digging
exploratory wells.
	   The officials said the Chinese contractor already has supplied a
detailed plan for development of Al-Ahdab and that the Iraqi side
has accepted it.
	   China also is obligated by the dlrs 1 billion pact to gather the
geological and seismic information needed to start production.
	   Iraq has the world's second largest reserves of oil after Saudi
Arabia.
	   Russia, another permanent member of the Security Council, also
has signed an oil development deal with Iraq.
	   On Tuesday, the Middle East Economic Survey, published in
Cyprus, said that work by a Russian consortium led by Lukoil ``is
inching ahead'' in its concession of West Qurna, which is 200
kilometers (120 miles) south of Kut.
	   MEES said the consortium was ``encountering not only
sanctions-induced problems but also financial difficulties as a
result of Russia's economic crisis.''
	   It said Lukoil ``has been able to carry out a very limited
amount of work on the ground in Iraq'' in the deal, which was
structured so it would not violate U.N. sanctions by delaying
actual development work.
	   Russia's dlrs 3.5 billion contract was signed in March 1997 and
calls for the development of up to 8 billion barrels of proven
reserves over a 23-year period.
	   Plans call for production of 100,000 barrels a day of crude by
March 2000.

Fourteen killed in two rebel attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed 14 people,
including eight who were burned to death, in two separate weekend
attacks just south of the capital, local government officials said
Tuesday.
	   Clement Nderabandi, administrator of the Kanyosha commune about
15 kilometers (9 miles) south of the Bujumbura, said rebels burned
alive eight people in an attack Saturday night, and killed another
six people in his commune or province on Sunday.
	   Two of the victims were local government officials, Nderabandi
said.
	   It was unclear what kind of weapons were used, and no additional
information was immediately available.
	   More than 200,000 Burundians, mostly civilians, in the violence
that broke out after Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's
first democratically elected president, a Hutu, in October 1993.
	   In Rural Bujumbura province alone, at least 60 local government
officials have been slain.
	   The rebels are fighting now to oust President Pierre Buyoya, a
Tutsi former military officer who took control in a bloodless coup
in July 1996 saying he was the only one who could stop the
bloodshed.
	   Although Tutsis only make up 14 percent of Burundi's population
of 6 million, they have controlled the country for all but four
months since independence from Belgium in 1962. Hutus make up 85
percent of the population.
	   All-party peace talks aimed at ending the fighting began in
Arusha, Tanzania in June, where the parties agreed to a cease-fire
that was to coincide with the second round of talks on July 20.
	   The talks resumed on schedule, and although there have been some
attacks and clashes reported, they have occurred with far less
frequency than before.
	   Burundian military officials have said the cease-fire is not
applicable to the army since it has a duty ``to protect citizens.''
	   A third round of talks was set for Oct. 12 in Arusha.

Ethiopian Airlines to resume flights to Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with grafs 11 and 12 with Eritrea statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopian Airlines will resume
flights in November from Addis Ababa to the Sudanese capital
Khartoum after a three-year suspension, a senior official of the
state-owned airline said Tuesday.
	   Promotion and customer services manager Kagnew Fissiha told
reporters the national carrier will begin with two flights a week
between Addis and Khartoum.
	   The resumption of service is a sign of the growing improvement
in relations between Ethiopia and Sudan which were severely
strained in June 1995 after Ethiopia accused Sudanese intelligence
services of masterminding an assassination attempt on Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa.
	   Mubarak was on the way from the Addis Ababa airport to the
Organization of African Unity headquarters to attend a heads of
state summit when gunmen opened fire on his motorcade.
	   Mubarak escaped injury.
	   The Ethiopian government immediately ordered the airline to stop
flights to Khartoum and reduce from 20 to three the number of
Sudanese diplomats accredited in the Ethiopian capital.
	   Political analysts in Ethiopia say relations between Ethiopia
and Sudan have improved partly because of Ethiopia's border dispute
with Eritrea.
	   Eritrea and Ethiopia are Sudan's eastern neighbors.
	   Eritrea hosts the National Democratic Alliance, a grouping of
political parties from northern Sudan whose armed wing has been
hitting targets in eastern Sudan.
	   The NDA is allied with the Sudan People's Liberation Army which
has been waging a 15-year war for autonomy in the predominantly
Christian, African and animist south which has been traditionally
dominated by the Muslim and Arab-led north.
	   On Tuesday, the Eritrean government issued a statement saying
accusation by Khartoum that Eritrea was fighting with the SPLA is
``mendacious'' and ``has no basis whatsoever.''
	   ``Khartoum has a well-known pattern of behavior of apportioning
blame to neighboring countries for acts carried out by Sudanese
opposition forces,'' the statement said.
	   Eritrea also accuses Sudan of hosting Eritrean exiles opposed to
President Isaias Afwerki.
	   Ethiopian Airlines is the only carrier in eastern Africa with
direct flights to the United States. It operates a weekly flight
between Addis Ababa and Washington, D.C. with a stop in Rome.

East Timor rebel leader vows to keep fighting Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS to CORRECT spelling of guerrillas sted guerillas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A leader of East Timor's guerrillas said
Tuesday that the armed struggle for independence would continue
because Indonesia has refused to negotiate an end to Jakarta's rule
in the half-island territory.
	   ``We've no other choice than to keep on fighting,'' Taur Matan
Ruak said in an interview broadcast on Portuguese state radio RDP.
	   ``We've have several times stated our willingness to negotiate a
solution with the Indonesians, without pre-conditions ... but
(Indonesian President) Habibie has never made himself available,''
Ruak said in Portuguese by phone from East Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, 2,000 kilometers (1,300 miles)
east of Jakarta, in 1975, a year after the departure of Portugal's
colonial administration a year earlier.
	   The guerrillas _ who are thought to number fewer than 100 and
who operate out of the thick bush in East Timor's mountainous
interior _ have launched sporadic attacks on Indonesian outposts in
the territory over the past 20 years, killing dozens of Indonesian
troops.
	   However, they ceased military activity in the hope that
President B.J. Habibie would adopt a softer line on East Timor than
his predecessor Suharto, who stepped down last May.
	   Habibie has offered to grant some autonomy to East Timor and to
release imprisoned rebel leader Xanana Gusmao in exchange for
international recognition of the region as Indonesia's 27th
province.
	   Gusmao's release was a ``fundamental'' first step in negotiating
a lasting solution for the territory, Ruak said, adding that
autonomy would be only an interim solution on the road to full
independence.
	   The United Nations is brokering ongoing talks between Lisbon and
Jakarta on East Timor. The next meeting is scheduled for New York
on Oct. 6.
	   Portugal insists that a referendum be held in East Timor on the
territory's future.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's opposition Democratic Party
said Tuesday the resignation of Socialist Premier Fatos Nano was
not enough and demanded a ``technical government'' be set up to
arrange new elections.
	   Nano resigned Monday, two weeks after an opposition politician's
assassination sparked rioting led by the Democratic Party, with
angry protesters burning the first floor of the government building
housing Nano's office and took control of the parliament.
	   Socialist Party leaders met Tuesday to vote on a candidate to
succeed Nano. Pandeli Majko, the 31-year-old general secretary of
the party, won the nomination.

Syria: Peace talks can restart only on basis of land for peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Syria's foreign minister said Tuesday that
his country remains committed to peace with Israel, but only on the
basis of land for peace.
	   ``The entire peace process is on the wane so long as the Israeli
government rejects the land-for-peace principle,'' Farouk al-Sharaa
told world leaders at a U.N. General Assembly session.
	   He said Syria ``was and is committed to peace, considering it a
strategic option which requires the resumption of negotiations.''
	   In return for peace, Syria demands the return of the Golan
Heights, which Israel captured in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967.
Syria has refused to resume peace talks, which broke off in
February 1996, until Israel agrees to a complete return of the
plateau. The Israeli government says the heights are essential to
national security.
	   Sharaa blamed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the
impasse in the peace talks, and accused him of ``trying to impose a
peace on the Arabs on the basis of occupation and settlement.''
	   Without naming Turkey, which has signed a military pact with
Israel, Sharaa said Israel was trying to establish a military
alliance in the region that would undermine the peace process and
endanger the Middle East.
	   He also called for a timetable for the lifting of U.N. sanctions
on Iraq, and said the economic embargo on Libya also should end.
	   Sharaa condemned last month's U.S. bombing of a pharmaceutical
plant in Sudan that Washington accused of manufacturing deadly
agents for chemical weapons. Sudan said the factory only made
medicine.
	   Sharaa said Syria backed a Sudanese request for a fact-finding
mission to the site to determine the truth.

Aga Khan appeals for dialogue among Afghan rivals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Aga Khan appealed Tuesday for talks among
Afghanistan's warring factions, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``All the Afghans should promptly resume an open and fraternal
dialogue, thereby turning Islamic peace ethics into a national
reality and putting an end to hatred and division,'' the Aga Khan
said in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan.
	   The Aga Khan, spiritual leader of the world's Ismaili Muslim
community, is in Tajikistan for talks with the government of the
former Soviet republic in Central Asia and with Afghan religious
leaders.
	   The Aga Khan said his ``heart overflows with sorrow from the
very idea that Muslims are now fighting against Muslims.''

Spain says ETA must make next move to start peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed separatist group ETA's recent
cease-fire is not enough to constitute the start of a Basque peace
process, the Spanish government said Tuesday.
	   ``We can't speak of a peace process yet. What we have is a
suspension of activities by ETA,'' said government spokesman Josep
Pique. ``It's up to the violent ones, not us democrats, to prove
they are serious about peace.''
	   Pique spoke after conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
met with Xabier Arzalluz, the leader of the Basque Nationalist
Party, the governing party of the troubled northern region. The
meeting was the last in a series to get other parties' opinions on
the ETA cease-fire and the future of the Basque region.
	   ETA, which has killed nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign
for Basque independence, began an indefinite cease-fire on Sept.
18.
	   The truce was the product of months of talks between Arzalluz's
party and the ETA-allied Herri Batasuna coalition. It comes before
Basques go to the polls Oct. 25 to vote for a new regional
government and parliament.
	   Speaking Tuesday, Arzalluz, whose party nominally backs a future
Basque independent state, said there were several points of serious
disagreement with Aznar but insisted the most important thing was
the consolidation of peace.
	   Arzalluz, known for his outlandish nationalist statements,
grabbed headlines this weekend when in an election rally he claimed
Basques were not covered by the current Spanish constitution.
	   Aznar's Popular Party has demanded that the constitution must be
fully respected in any peace process.
	   ``Terms of independence must be discussed within the
constitution, everything else is the law of the jungle,'' the
leader of the Popular Party in the Basque region Carlos Iturgaiz
said Tuesday.
	   Despite demands that the government make a reciprocal gesture to
ETA, Aznar's government has insisted that a lengthy, violence-free
period must pass before there can be peace talks or concessions.

European leagues unite against FIFA tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ European soccer leagues escalated their
confrontation with FIFA on Tuesday, saying they would refuse to
release players for the Confederation Cup tournament in January.
	   Representatives of the English and Scottish leagues said they
had joined those from Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Portugal,
Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland, Greece and the Netherlands in
defying FIFA.
	   Meeting in Brussels, Belgium, the delegates said their clubs
would not release any players for the Jan. 8-20 tournament in
Mexico because of conflicts with domestic league play.
	   ``There was a very strong feeling among delegates in Brussels
today that this competition will only congest the fixture list and
put increased strain on the players selected,'' Scottish Premier
League chief executive Roger Mitchell said.
	   ``The Confederations Cup is played in the middle of most
countries' championship schedules and there was an overwhelming
feeling it didn't make sense to have players taken away from their
clubs at this stage.''
	   FIFA said last week that it would reduce the time clubs are
required to make their players available for the Confederation Cup,
but that was not enough to head off a mass revolt by the European
leagues.
	   The United States, Mexico, Bolivia, Brazil, France, Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and the winner of the current Oceania contest in
Brisbane, Australia, will participate in the eight-nation
tournament.
	   Clubs in Italy and England, especially, would be hard hit by the
loss of French, Brazilian and American players.
	   Italy's Serie A has 12 French players and eight Brazilians,
including Inter Milan's Ronaldo, who could be called up for the
tournament. They would miss three rounds of Serie A play.
	   In England, Arsenal would lose French players Emmanuel Petit and
Patrick Vieira, while Chelsea would lose its French stars, Marcel
Desailly and Frank Leboeuf. Two U.S. goalkeepers, Kasey Keller of
Leicester and Brad Friedel of Liverpool, could also be called up.
	   Mitchell said the Confederation Cup could lead to player
``burnout'' in an already crowded soccer fixture list.
	   ``There is a real risk if this trend of fixture overcrowding
continues that the top players in our game will have virtually no
break,'' he said.
	   ``When you take into account domestic and European club
competitions as well as international and other representative
matches, it has to be regarded as one of the major problems facing
professional players today.
	   ``There is a real danger of burnout and of greatly increased
risk of injury if players are not given sufficient time to
recuperate from long and grueling seasons.''
	   Scotland is introducing a three-week winter break this January _
the same time period as the Confederation Cup.

Czech PM says election should end Slovakia's `isolation'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Available

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman on
Tuesday welcomed the results of last week's elections in Slovakia,
saying they signal a new era in the country's relations with the
outside world.
	   ``Until now, Slovakia lived in a kind of non-splendid
isolation,'' Zeman told a news conference after talks at European
Union headquarters.
	   ``This non-splendid isolation is over. The victory is on the
side of democratic political forces,'' Zeman said.
	   Deputy-prime minister, Egon Lansky, said the Czech government
would work to bring Slovakia as close as possible to the EU.
Slovakia broke with the Czech Republic in 1993.
	   The Czech Republic is among the six countries which the EU put
on a ``fast-track'' to join the EU, probably around the middle of
the next decade.
	   Neighboring Slovakia was left off the list, mainly because of EU
concerns about the rule of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, who is
expected to be pushed out of power by the results of the election
held Friday and Saturday.
	   Zeman said the Czech Republic hoped to join the EU in 2003 or
2004. ``These are not my estimates, but those of responsible people
from the EU,'' he said.
	   EU Commission President Jacques Santer said his talks with the
Czech premier were very positive. ``We find no clouds in our
heavens,'' he said.
	   Zeman said his center-left cabinet is committed to meeting the
economic criteria to qualify for EU membership.
	   He pledged to complete the privatization of the banking sector
by the year 2000 and said the government was working on programs to
bring sectors such as justice, agriculture and regional
administration up to EU standards.
	   ``We understand that the problem is not only how we manage our
foreign policy but also domestic policy, such as adapting our
domestic legislation,'' Zeman said.
	   Apart from the Czech Republic, the EU has opened fast-track
membership talks with Poland, Hungary, Slovenia and Estonia, and
Cyprus.
	   Slovakia is included among a second batch of candidates, along
with Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Bulgaria, which the EU says
need more preparation before starting membership talks.

Gauze, zebra stripes, citrus colors: London's new fashion tips
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wisps of muslin, gauze and parachute silk. Zebra
stripes, fuchsia and searing citrus. Gray. Sequins. Cashmere
cardigans, crochet, clogs. Long skirts, square necklines,
asymmetric cuts.
	   Fashion followers, take note: These are the hot features for the
spring and summer of 1999, according to the designers who staged
shows during London Fashion Week, which ended Tuesday.
	   ``It's all about a certain woman, and that woman is brave and
adventurous and ... very beautiful, very sexy,'' enthused Vivienne
Westwood, the eccentric doyenne of British fashion, whose Red Label
designs included flirty ruched skirts in fuchsia and plum tartan,
and wide purple camouflage trousers, enlivened with orchids and
feathers.
	   Hilary Alexander, fashion editor of The Daily Telegraph,
characterized the overall look as ``slouch chic; sophisticated
simplicity in a riot of color.''
	   ``Skirts may be long and full, but they float around the calves
or ankles,'' she wrote. ``T-shirts and tunics are tweaked and
tucked at the neck, bust or waist to ripple round the curves; coats
and jackets are cut open at the seams to fly out over the dress
beneath.''
	   More than 50 designers held catwalk shows _ the most ever _ and
another 140 exhibited shoes, bags and other fashion accessories at
the Natural History Museum, home of London Fashion Week.
	   The hottest tickets were for Westwood; Alexander McQueen, now at
Givenchy; Hussein Chalayan, and a raft of bright young things,
including Matthew Williamson, Anthony Symonds and Andrew Groves,
who once sent a cocoon-shaped dress down the catwalk infested with
live flies.
	   Celebrities like ``Posh Spice'' Victoria Adams and Simply Red
singer Mick Hucknall came by to see top models, including Jodie
Kidd, Honor Fraser and Helena Christensen, lured out of retirement
for Williamson's show.
	   Elizabeth Jagger, the 14-year-old daughter of Rolling Stone Mick
Jagger and American model Jerry Hall, closed Westwood's show in a
flowing fuchsia dress with a giant orchid in her hair as she
pretended to play an accordion. Earlier, she strutted in a tailored
tartan outfit, teamed with ripped tights and platform boots.
	   At Red or Dead, the look was crumpled chic, with ruffled
knee-length skirts and shirts with wrinkled cuffs.
	   Funky club wear in searing oranges and wild yellows contrasted
with black miniskirts and military-style khaki trousers. Male
models flexed in transparent fishnet T-shirts.
	   Irish designer John Rocha used a palette of fawn, white and gray
for his outfits with distressed hems, asymmetric fitted tops and
crochet vests, combined with floor-length skirts atop ruffled
petticoats.
	   For shock value, Williamson put Christensen in a sculpted cream
embroidered jacket _ over a pair of sequined fuchsia bikini briefs.
Kidd modeled a series of sheer chiffon beaded gowns with thigh-high
slits that left little to the imagination.
	   New York designer Betsey Johnson, famed for her sexy club wear,
produced a look that one fashion writer dubbed ``Lolita meets
Latino'': cocktail dresses with billowing ballerina skirts and
tight laced bodices, and capri pants with camisoles _ all in
acid-bright colors.
	   For the men, there were skinny trousers with provocative cutouts
over the buttocks, and scarlet briefs printed with black spiders.
	   McQueen featured disabled American model Aimee Mullins, 22, who
was born without fibulas and had her lower legs amputated as a
child.
	   She strutted the catwalk in a pair of prostheses specially
created out of varnished wood to resemble sexy high-heeled boots,
showing metal mesh dresses adorned with rhinestones, bodices and
skirts in sculpted wood and tiered flamenco skirt in cream lace.
	   McQueen said he was ``not doing this to save the world. I
suppose that the idea is to show that beauty comes from within.''
	   Mullins, a Paralympic medal winner for sprinting, said she wants
``to be seen as beautiful because of my disability, not in spite of
it.''
	   Spanish designer Amaya Arzuaga showed daring asymmetric
necklines, exaggerated cowl collars, body-hugging leather tops,
tiny boleros, loose crochet skirts and a sensational series of
fluid jersey dresses with daring cutouts at the hip.
	   As Symonds showed his simple sequined creations, thieves broke
into his showroom and made off with 30,000 pounds (dlrs 48,000)
worth of clothing, samples and patterns.
	   The fashion world is increasingly competitive, and six designers
have had outfits stolen in recent months.

German man killed, 10 injured by exploding Russian tank shell
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JENA, Germany (AP) _ A 32-year-old German man was killed and 10
people slightly injured Tuesday when a Soviet-made tank shell
exploded in a basement in the eastern town of Jena, police said.
	   Police said the man, who was known to dabble in chemical
experiments and pyrotechnics, had apparently been trying to open
the shell, causing it to explode. Police did not say where he had
gotten it.
	   State prosecutor Arnd Koeppen said there was no evidence the man
belonged to any extremist group, but an investigation continues.
	   Among the injured from broken glass were six children playing
outside the apartment building, which houses about 60 people. The
apartments were left largely undamaged.
	   The unemployed man lived in an upstairs apartment with his
mother, who was out of town at the time, police said.
	   A search of his room uncovered amateur chemical laboratory
equipment and literature that could be used in creating explosives.
Two years ago the man was fined for illegally exploding pyrotechnic
devices in an open field.

Hazing remains a serious problem in Russia's military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian military should create watchdog groups
to stop widespread hazing in the armed forces, Russia's military
prosecutor said Tuesday.
	   Chief Military Prosecutor Gen. Yuri Dyomin told a conference on
preventing hazing that the practice remains one of the most serious
problems in Russia's underfed and cash-strapped military, and must
be stopped, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The government has tried to curb the practice before. But
vicious hazing of young recruits by longer-serving soldiers or
officers remains widespread.
	   Youths and their parents do all they can to avoid the military,
which is also plagued by desertions and has a high rate of
suicides.

Germany's Schroeder to meet Chirac, Jospin on Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Aiming to reaffirm close ties between Paris and
Bonn, Germany's future chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Wednesday
would make France his first trip abroad barely two days after being
elected, officials confirmed Tuesday.
	   Schroeder, feared by some in Paris to be less faithful than
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the Franco-German axis driving European
unification, was to lunch Wednesday with President Jacques Chirac.
	   The Social Democrat, who on Sunday defeated conservatives
supporting Kohl, would meet with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in
the afternoon, officials said. He was to hold a news conference at
1500 GMT Wednesday at the German Embassy.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Tuesday that
Schroeder's visit ``shows the irreplaceable reality, the strength
and character of Franco-German relations.''
	   Those relations, he told Europe 1 radio, ``couldn't not remain
the motor'' of European unification.
	   France and Germany have been the main forces behind forging a
stronger European Union, including creation of the euro single
currency that takes effect among 11 of the 15 EU nations in
January.
	   Schroeder has said he wants closer ties with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, but Vedrine said it ``doesn't replace''
relations with France. ``You have to take that very calmly. It's
not competition. It's not an alternative.''
	   A new, more affirmative German identity, Vedrine said ``is
rather healthy for Europe today'' and is ``not a problem.''
	   Schroeder's Social Democrats achieved a clear victory in the
general elections on Sunday and will likely form a coalition
government with the environmentalist Greens party.

East Timor rebel leader vows to keep fighting Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A leader of East Timor's guerrillas said
Tuesday that the armed struggle for independence would continue
because Indonesia has refused to negotiate an end to Jakarta's
rule.
	   The guerrillas _ thought to number fewer than 100 _ have
launched sporadic attacks from the mountainous interior over the
past 20 years, killing dozens of Indonesian troops at outposts on
the island territory.
	   However, they ceased military activity in the hope that
President B.J. Habibie would adopt a softer line on East Timor than
his predecessor Suharto, who stepped down last May.
	   ``We've no other choice than to keep on fighting,'' Taur Matan
Ruak said in an interview broadcast on Portuguese state radio RDP.
	   ``We've have several times stated our willingness to negotiate a
solution with the Indonesians, without pre-conditions ... but
(Indonesian President) Habibie has never made himself available,''
Ruak said in Portuguese by phone from East Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, 2,000 kilometers (1,300 miles)
east of Jakarta, in 1975, a year after the departure of Portugal's
colonial administration a year earlier.
	   Habibie has offered to grant some autonomy to East Timor and to
release imprisoned rebel leader Xanana Gusmao in exchange for
international recognition of the region as Indonesia's 27th
province.
	   Gusmao's release was a ``fundamental'' first step in negotiating
a lasting solution for the territory, Ruak said, adding that
autonomy would be only an interim solution on the road to full
independence.
	   The United Nations is brokering ongoing talks between Lisbon and
Jakarta on East Timor. The next meeting is scheduled for New York
on Oct. 6.
	   Portugal insists that a referendum be held in East Timor on the
territory's future.

Police evacuate building after bomb threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian police on Tuesday evacuated and
searched a building for a bomb minutes before U.S Ambassador Daniel
Kurtzer was scheduled to arrive for a meeting, police officials
said.
	   Police said an anonymous caller claimed that a bomb had been
planted in offices of an American institution in the building,
which is in downtown Cairo.
	   The ambassador and others were let into the building after no
explosive device was found, the officials said. They spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy said he had no knowledge of the
bomb scare.
	   Security for the U.S. Embassy and other American institutions
has been stepped up since the twin bombings on Aug. 7 of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Kosovo Albanians caught in forest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) - A group of Kosovo Albanians were caught
Tuesday in a forest in southeastern Hungary, the state news agency
MTI reported.
	   The group was noticed by a forest ranger, who notified border
guards. They rounded up 15 men, nine women and three children, who
had entered Hungary illegally. The oldest is over 60 years of age
and the youngest is only 5 months.
	   They had no travel documents and traveled came without the aid
of people smugglers, getting as far as Asotthalom, 160 kilometers
(100 miles) southeast of Budapest, before they were caught.
	   On Sept. 23, 31 and on Sept. 10, 55 Kosovo Albanians were caught
by border guards.
	   If such illegal immigrants request asylum, they are declared
refugees of war and granted asylum for the duration of the
conflict.
	   However, some Kosovo Albanians seek to go further west, trying
to cross into European Union member countries or applying for
refugee status with western embassies.
	   On Monday, a group of Kosovo Albanians occupied the grounds of
the Canadian Embassy in Budapest, hoping to pressure Canadian
authorities into granting them refugee status.
	   After nine hours of tense negotiations, riot police removed them
from the compound.
	   Serb and Yugoslav forces wage a bitter campaign against rebel
ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern Kosovo province that has
killed hundreds of people and forced 275,000 to flee their homes.
	   The republics of Serbia and Montenegro make up Yugoslavia, which
borders Hungary to the south.

Nominations deadline nears, Moroccan enters WTO leadership contest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A former Moroccan trade minister has been
nominated by his country to become the World Trade Organization's
new director-general, the global trade body said Tuesday.
	   As the October 1 deadline for nominations nears, Hassan
Abouyoub, 46, is the latest of four candidates formally selected by
their governments to take on the post which former Italian trade
diplomat Renato Ruggiero will vacate by the end of April next year.
	   The others are Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi,
52, former Prime Minister of New Zealand Michael Moore, 49, and
senior Canadian diplomat and former trade minister Roy Maclaren,
65.
	   Abouyoub led Morocco's entry to the 133-nation WTO's
predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and its
trade negotiations with the European Union. He is now an ambassador
in charge of trade negotiations.
	   Maclaren, a director of Deutsche Bank in Canada from 1984-1993,
was Canada's international trade minister from 1993 to 1996 and
negotiated the final stages of the North American Free Trade
Agreement and of the Uruguay Round of the GATT. Since 1996, he has
been Canada's ambassador in London.
	   Former printer and trade union researcher Moore is an ex-leader
of New Zealand's center-left Labor Party, was prime minister in
1990 and remains a member of Parliament and opposition foreign
affairs spokesman.
	   Supachai is also Thailand's commerce minister and is a former
president of the Thai Military Bank.
	   Although the deadline is October 1, trade officials say other
candidates could come forward at a later date and the WTO's General
Council would have to decide whether to accept their nominations.
	   One of those whose name has arisen is that of Brazilian external
relations minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia, who could join the race
when his country's presidential elections end next month.
	   The contest will be decided by consensus rather than a vote and
the general council is hoping to confirm the appointment by the end
of this year, a WTO spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Ambassador John Weekes, chairman of the general council, has
reminded members of the need to reach an agreement quickly, thereby
avoiding the regional candidacies which deadlocked the last
leadership contest in 1995.
	   A power struggle between blocs of countries pushing their own
candidates caused a lengthy delay before a leader was chosen and
harmed the credibility of the WTO as an authoritative global trade
policeman.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's Democratic Party said Tuesday
the resignation of Socialist Premier Fatos Nano was not enough and
demanded an interim government be set up to arrange new elections.
	   Nano resigned Monday, two weeks after rioting in the wake of a
politician's assassination pushed the Balkan nation to the brink of
anarchy.
	   Socialist Party leaders met today to vote on a candidate to
succeed Nano. Pandeli Majko, the party's 31-year-old general
secretary, won the nomination. Parliament selects the prime
minister, and the Socialists hold a majority in the 155-seat
chamber.
	   Majko's nomination to head a new government was seen as a move
to gradually part with officials who had been associated with the
former Communist Party that ruled Albania for 46 years.
	   Majko, an engineer respected for his moderate stance, was not a
communist. He took part in 1990 student demonstrations that helped
topple the communists.
	   But the opposition Democratic Party of former President Sali
Berisha, which demanded Nano's resignation, wants to establish a
government that would rule for up to a year, until new elections
could be held.
	   In a statement, the party said the temporary government would
establish public order and work toward passing the constitution. A
parliamentary commission has drafted the constitution and wanted to
hold a referendum Nov. 28 to pass it.
	   The Democratic Party said it would continue holding street
protests until their demands are met. They called another protest
for Wednesday.
	   But in another statement Tuesday, Berisha called on Albanians
and public officials to trust the new ``political solutions'' that
will be presented by the future prime minister.
	   Nano became prime minister last year after his Socialist Party
of former communists defeated Berisha's Democratic Party in
parliamentary elections.
	   The internationally supervised vote followed widespread
lawlessness that erupted after the collapse of phony pyramid
schemes, which cost many Albanians their life savings.
	   Before Nano resigned, Interior Minister Perikli Teta, a member
of the small Democratic Alliance, also quit under mounting pressure
for failing to improve public security.
	   Nano stepped down after he told President Rexhep Meidani that he
had been unable to put together a new Cabinet according to his
wishes and ideas. He acknowledged his responsibility ``for
everything this government has not done'' and said that ``the
chances of coming out of the crisis are little.''
	   Rioting began a day after unidentified gunmen assassinated Azem
Hajdari, a close Berisha associate. Angry protesters burned the
first floor of the government building housing Nano's office and
seven government cars parked outside.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Regional governor Alexander Lebed said Tuesday he
would take part in a nationwide labor protest next month and called
on local authorities to prevent it from turning violent.
	   The strikes and marches set for Oct. 7 are being organized by
unions and opposition parties, including the Communists, to demand
President Boris Yeltsin's resignation over unpaid wages and
pensions and other economic woes.
	   ``The people will take to the streets because they have grown
tired of that hopeless life,'' said Lebed, a retired general and
national security advisor who now is governor of the vast
Krasnoyarsk region in Central Siberia.
	   ``The local authorities must do everything to ensure the
protests are carried out in a civilized and well-organized way,''
he said at a news conference. ``To achieve that, we must head (take
part in) those actions.''
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his supporters planned to
block seven highways in the Moscow region on Wednesday as a preview
to the Oct. 7 protests, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Protesters will allow ambulances, fire engines and trucks
carrying perishable food to pass, Zyuganov said.
	   Lebed refused to say whether he would join the call for
Yeltsin's resignation, saying he is still considering the issue.
But he reiterated his long-time criticism of Yeltsin, accusing him
of bringing Russia to ruin.
	   ``We now have an elderly and overworked person ... who is
disliked by parliament and people, to put in the mildest way
possible,'' Lebed said of Yeltsin, who is 67.
	   He warned the government against any attempts to curb the
protests by force.
	   ``That would be a big stupidity on the part of the government to
use force,'' he said. ``I don't think it will come to shooting.''
	   Lebed, who came in third in Russia's 1996 presidential election,
remained coy about his plans for the next race in 2000.
	   ``I haven't yet decided anything,'' he said. ``The presidential
race means nerves, time and money. When all these components are
present, I will make the decision.''
	   Lebed has previously said he would not run unless he solves the
problems of the Krasnoyarsk, where he was elected governor in May.
Many observers consider the governorship a stepping stone to the
presidential election, while others warn that Lebed may undermine
his chances if he fails to improve conditions in the region.
	   Lebed strongly backed Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny
Primakov, and voiced hope that his government could find solutions
to deal with the national economic crisis.
	   ``Primakov's success will be the success of all Russia. We don't
have a place to retreat,'' he said.

Italy to impose visas for Bosnia on Jan. 1, 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Italy will impose visas for
Bosnian citizens on Jan. 1, 1999, the Bosnian news agency Onasa
reported Tuesday.
	   Italian Ambassador to Bosnia Michele Valensise on Tuesday
informed Bosnian Deputy Foreign Minister Fuad Sabeta of the Italian
government's intention.
	   The move is in accordance with the Schenengen agreement, said a
statement issued by the Bosnian Foreign Ministry.
	   Valensise handed to Sabeta a diplomatic note confirming the
planned introduction of visas starting next year when the Italian
Embassy in Bosnia will be able to issue visas.
	   Italy is the last country, which signed the Schengen agreement,
to impose visas for Bosnian citizens.

Jordan seeks to revive plan to pipe water from Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan is seeking to revive talks with Iraq
on constructing two pipelines to carry water and oil to the
kingdom, government officials said Tuesday.
	   They said Water Minister Hani Mulqi would visit Baghdad in early
October to discuss the plans with Iraqi energy and water officials.
Mulqi also is minister of energy and mineral resources.
	   ``Jordan wants to explore all possible means and ways to
overcome its chronic water shortages,'' said one of the officials.
All spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In 1979, Jordan opened talks with Baghdad on a pipeline to carry
water from the Euphrates River to a purification plant on Jordan's
eastern border. The talks stopped six years later because neither
country had the money for the multibillion dollar project.
	   A British firm that conducted a feasibility study in the early
1980s said the proposed water line could supply Jordan with 160
million cubic meters (5.6 billion cubic feet) of water a year. That
would supply about 20 percent of the country's needs.
	   In the late 1980s, Jordan and Iraq discussed constructing a
750-kilometer (450-mile) pipeline to carry oil for Jordan's use and
for export. The oil pipeline alone would cost dlrs 2 billion.
	   Jordan imports the 90,000 barrels of oil it uses daily from Iraq
via a fleet of trucks.
	   The desert kingdom suffers from acute water shortages. During
the summer, each home receives water just once a week under a
national rationing program.
	   Last month, Jordan imported drinking water from Saudi Arabia
after it was found that tap water in some Amman suburbs contained
worms and larvae that could damage public health.

Manchester United plays Bayern 40 years after Munich plane crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It's not an exaggeration to say that Manchester
United's match at Bayern Munich Wednesday will make history.
Several chapters.
	   It's only one of 12 games in the second rotation of the
Champions League, but all the rest pale by comparison.
	   It's 40 years since eight Manchester United players were killed
as their plane tried to take off in a snowstorm from the Munich
airport. The Feb. 6, 1958 crash virtually wiped out one of Europe's
best teams as it was returning from a Champions Cup match in
Belgrade.
	   Wednesday's game at Olympic Stadium marks, astoundingly,
United's first ever competitive game with Bayern Munich _ excluding
friendlies _ and the first return to Munich for a full-blown match
since the 1958 tragedy.
	   ``It's quite surprising, but the two have never played in a
European competition,'' said Mark Wylie, curator of the Manchester
United Museum.
	   The match _ where the two European powers both need victories
after failing to win in the first rotation two weeks ago _ will
open after a moment of silence for the eight players and 15 other
passengers who were killed.
	   The other key match Wednesday also features an English club as
Premier League champions Arsenal play at Wembley Stadium in front
of 70,000 _ 10,000 of them supporting the Greek opposition
Panathinaikos.
	   Here's a quick look at the matchup in the six groups.
 &UR; GROUP A &QC; 
	   Ajax vs. Porto: Ajax will be without injured sweeper Danny Blind
after its 0-0 draw two weeks ago against Croatia Zagreb. Ajax's
struggling frontline should be helped by the return of Georgian
striker Shota Arveladze. Porto, coming off a 2-2 draw with
Olympiakos, will be without injured goalkeeper Ivica Kralj.
	   Olympiakos vs. Croatia Zagreb: Olympiakos will be without
suspended players Grigoris Georgatos and striker Peter Oforiquaye.
The club is fresh from a shock 1-0 league loss to Paniliakos.
Croatia will be without frail striker Robert Prosinecki, who is
recovering from last week's back surgery.
 &UR; GROUP B &QC; 
	   Galatasary vs. Athletic Bilbao: Galatasary, which got a 2-2 draw
with Juventus two weeks ago, is coming off a 2-0 league loss to
Genclerbirligi. Bilbao, with a 1-1 draw in the opening rotation
against Rosenborg, is injury free and will see the return of
midfielder Bittor Alkiza.
	   Rosenborg vs. Juventus: Rosenborg has all but clinched its
seventh straight Norwegian title. Striker Sigurd Rushfeldt injured
an ankle over the weekend but should play. Juventus is coming off a
1-0 loss to AC Milan. French World Cup star Zinedine Zidane is
expected back from a knee injury. Missing for Juventus _ finalists
the last three years in this cup _ will be suspended goalkeeper
Angelo Peruzzi.
 &UR; GROUP C &QC; 
	   Spartak Moscow vs. Real Madrid: Spartak, 2-0 winners over Sturm
Graz, was pounded 4-1 in league play over the weekend by CSKA
Moscow. Spartak will be without Belarussian defender Miroslav
Romashchenko, who has a leg injury. An 86,000 sellout is predicted
at Luzhniki Olympic Stadium. Real Madrid, the holders, beat Inter
Milan 2-0 in the first rotation. Key defender Manuel Sanchis is
back after being rested. Young striker Fernando Morientes will miss
with the flu. Davor Suker is injured with Raul Gonzalez and Pedrag
Mijatovic expected to play up front.
	   Inter Milan vs. Sturm Graz: Inter will be without Ronaldo and
Roberto Baggio, who both have knee injury while Chilean forward
Ivan Zamorano is 50-50 as he battles a fever. Sturm goalie
Kazimierz Sidorczak is likely to miss with an injury.
 &UR; GROUP D &QC; 
	   Barcelona vs. Brondby: Barcelona, after a 3-3 draw at Manchester
United, will play Sonny Anderson up front with Spaniard Abelardo
Fernandez. Patrick Kluivert is not eligible. Brondby, 2-1 winners
over Bayern Munich, will be without suspended defender Soren
Colding.
	   Bayern Munich vs. Manchester United: Bayern Munich can't afford
to lose. ``The train will be gone,'' said goalie Ollie Kahn. Bayern
Munich will be without midfielder Mario Basler and defender Thomas
Helmer. The rejuvenated German side under new coach Ottmar Hitzfeld
has won six straight league matches. Winger Ryan Giggs will miss
with a foot injury and midfielder Nicky Butt is suspended for Man
United.
 &UR; GROUP E &QC; 
	   Arsenal vs. Panathinaikos: England international David Seaman
should be ready for Arsenal, which drew 1-1 at Lens two weeks ago.
Midfielder Ray Parlour is doubtful with an injured ankle.
Panathinaikos, 2-1 winners over Dynamo Kiev, will miss Polish
striker Krzysztof Warzycha, who is injured.
	   Dynamo Kiev vs. Lens: Dynamo is healthy and a 70,000 full house
is expected in Kiev. The Ukranian champions are coming off a
disappointing 3-3 league draw with Tavria. Lens is likely to be
without injured defender Philippe Brunel.
 &UR; GROUP F &QC; 
	   Benfica vs. PSV Eindhoven: The Portuguese lost 1-0 two weeks ago
to Kaiserlautern. Benfica will rely on striker Nuno Gomes, who had
a hat-trick in weekend league play. Eindhoven, 2-1 winner over HJK
Helskini, will play without captain Andre Ooijer, who is out for
six weeks with a knee injury. PSV slumped to a 4-1 loss over the
weekend to AZ Alkmaar.
	   HJK Helsinki vs. Kaiserlautern: HJK has three players suspended:
goalkeeper Tommi Koivistoinen, wingback Aarno Turpeinen and striker
Mike Kottila. German champion Kaiserlautern lost 3-2 in league play
last weekend to VfL Bochum. Defense has been the problem. It's now
further suspect by the loss of defender Michael Schjoenberg, who
broke his leg in the Bochum match.

Aga Khan appeals for dialogue among Afghan rivals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Aga Khan appealed Tuesday for talks among
Afghanistan's warring factions, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``All the Afghans should promptly resume an open and fraternal
dialogue, thereby turning Islamic peace ethics into a national
reality and putting an end to hatred and division,'' the Aga Khan
said in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan.
	   The Aga Khan, spiritual leader of the world's Ismaili Muslim
community, is in Tajikistan for talks with the government of the
former Soviet republic in Central Asia and with Afghan religious
leaders.
	   The Aga Khan said his ``heart overflows with sorrow from the
very idea that Muslims are now fighting against Muslims.''

Step toward trial of Panamanian ex-leader for money-laundering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French justice officials took a step closer to
trying former Panamian dictator Manuel Noriega for money-laundering
Tuesday, wrapping up their probe and sending the evidence to a
court.
	   The investigation also sent to the Paris Correctional Court
evidence against Noriega's wife Felicidad, judicial sources said
Tuesday on condition of anonymity.
	   The court is to set a date for a trial. Noriega, serving a
40-year sentence in a U.S. prison for a drug trafficking conviction
and ineligible for parole before 2016, would be tried in absentia,
the sources said.
	   Mrs. Noriega has faced an international arrest warrant since
November 1996.
	   Paris investigative Judge Patrick Fievet launched probe of
Noriega's assets in France after a U.S. invasion in December 1989
toppled the dictator.
	   Noriega, linked to Colombian drug traffickers, is accused of
laundering dlrs 15 million through his bank accounts in France at
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), which closed
its doors in 1991 due to international fraud.

Human rights commission criticizes Norway in free speech case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ In a rare slap to Norway, the European Human
Rights Commission on Tuesday said a small newspaper's libel
conviction for harshly criticizing seal-hunters amounted to
suppression of free speech.
	   The commission ordered the case be sent to the European Human
Rights Court.
	   ``This is the first time the commission has found a violation of
free speech in a case against Norway,'' Gro Hillestad Thune, a
Norwegian member of the commission, was quoted as telling the
Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   The north Norway newspaper Bladet Tromsoe was convicted in 1992
of libeling seal-hunters when it published a government inspector's
report on their killing methods, which included bludgeoning seal
pups.
	   The inspector accused the seal-hunters of violating rules.
	   Hunters sued the newspaper for libel and the paper was ordered
to pay 272,000 kroner (dlrs 36,200) to the hunters. Norwegian libel
law says a paper must be able to prove the truth of what it
reports. Many other countries have the more lenient standard that a
plaintiff must be able to prove a report's falsity.

Right-wing leader defends police killing gangsters in gunbattles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Right-wing leaders in India's largest city
Bombay Tuesday defended police shooting dead criminals in a series
of gunbattles which a judge's report has said were staged.
	   Manohar Joshi, chief minister of the western Indian state of
Maharashtra, of which Bombay is capital, told reporters that such
encounters between police and criminals were justified and
unavoidable.
	   Bal Thackeray, head of Joshi's Hindu nationalist Shiv Sena
party, also said he supported such ``encounter killings.''
	   ``Gangsters are a burden on society. They are free to kill
people and are saved by human rights organizations,'' said
Thackeray who holds no official government post, but is one western
India's most powerful politicians.
	   He was referring to civil rights activists who have filed
petitions in the Bombay High Court alleging that the gunbattles
were staged. He said such criticism demoralized the police.
	   Both leaders were reacting to a report by city judge A.S. Aguiar
released on Monday, which said police claims that gangsters were
killed in gunbattles were not genuine. Judge Aguiar probed police
killing of three men in August and September last year and
concluded they were killed in cold blood.
	   The report criticized police officers for being trigger-happy
and said there was no evidence to show that the criminals were
armed at the time of their death. More than 100 men described as
gangsters by the police have been killed in gunbattles this year.
	   Bombay police maintain they opened fire on criminals in
self-defense. Police frequently provide security to wealthy
entertainment industry personalities and real estate developers
targeted by gangsters demanding protection money.
	   Several influential individuals, who did not ask for police
security, were gunned down by gangsters after refusing to pay up
protection money.

Kosovo Albanian women, children, old men massacred

	   OBRIJA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The bodies of 15 ethnic Albanians
tell why the West wants fighting in Kosovo to stop. Men, women --
even infants -- lay on the ground Tuesday, their throats cut, some
missing limbs, most with bullets in the back of their heads.
	   Ethnic Albanians say the victims were slaughtered Sunday after a
Serb attack against the Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for
independence for this majority Albanian province. Most were slain
in a makeshift camp in the forest where they were hiding after Serb
troops overran their communities.
	   The killers slit the throat of a 10-year old boy, blew out his
mother's brains, cut open the stomach of another female relative
and shot a pregnant woman in the head. Two days later, the victims
remained unburied, sprawled in the forest where they died.
	   ``Serb police executed everybody,'' said one trembling elderly
man, who identified himself only as Fazli.
	   As he spoke, witnesses heard the occasional crackle of rifle
fire ringing through the valley about 40 kilometers (24 miles) west
of Pristina. The thud of two mortar rounds echoed as a Serb police
armored personnel carrier escorted out about a dozen ethnic
Albanian women and children on the back of a trailer drawn by a
tractor.
	   There was no comment from Serb police about the killings. The
day before their deaths, KLA fighters killed seven Serb policeman
in the area.
	   Both sides have accused the other of massacring civilians since
President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Albanian
secessionists seven months ago. Serbs say at least 39 Serbs were
tortured, mutilated and killed near Glodjane earlier this month
after they were kidnapped by ``terrorists.''
	   Fearing a humanitarian disaster, the U.N. Security Council has
demanded an immediate cease-fire, and NATO has threatened
airstrikes if the government ignores the order.
	   According to friends and relatives of the victims, masked Serbs
in green and blue uniforms descended on this town, which the Serbs
call Obrinje, on the weekend, capturing a man in his 60s.
	   Wielding a knife from the man's own kitchen, the attackers
forced him to take them to where refugees were hiding. The man's
body was found at the edge of the camp. The back of his head was
blown off, his throat was slit and the butcher knife carefully
placed on his chest.
	   In the camp, the attackers shot a man and a women, both
65-years-old, while they lay in a makeshift tent that sheltered
them since they fled their home days earlier.
	   Their bodies were spread on the blankets, surrounded by their
blood-spattered clothing, pots and pans. The woman's right foot was
partially amputated and her mouth was gaping open.
	   According to residents, six women tried to escape with four
children. But the attackers caught up with them in a shallow ditch.
Their bodies were lying in the ditch.
	   The attackers slit the throat of a 10-year-old boy and shot
women and children in the back of the head at point-blank range.
The body of an 18-month-old boy, whom survivors called Valmir, lay
half hidden under the body of his 38-year-old mother, who received
a bullet in the back of the head.
	   Valmir's minute right had was raised and stiffened in a
defensive posture. His pacifier was still dangling from the dried
blood on his chin.
	   In a house leading up to the refugee camp lay the charred body
of an elderly man, burned with his house and the rest of his
belongings.
	   Two brothers, one 40 years old and the other 55, lay sprawled in
the tracks of a tank that plowed through the woods near the refugee
camp. Attackers shot both of them in the back of the head.

Tyson misses deadline for psychological reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson missed a deadline for submitting
psychological reports to boxing authorities in the state of Nevada,
upsetting at least one boxing commissioner.
	   Tyson's advisers said the tests at Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston simply took too long and doctors were unable to
get the reports together in time for the commission's 5 p.m. Monday
deadline.
	   Dr. Ronald Schouten, head of the team that examined Tyson, sent
a letter to commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem, saying the
reports would be completed Wednesday.
	   ``Unfortunately, due to the length of the evaluation process,
the scoring on the psychological and neuropsychological testing
have not been completed,'' Schouten wrote.
	   Ghanem said he was disappointed the reports were not ready. The
Nevada Athletic Commission meets Saturday to determine whether
Tyson will be able to get back the boxing license stripped from him
for biting Evander Holyfield's ears.
	   ``I don't know what is going on, but it is very disappointing,''
Ghanem said.
	   Tyson's testing took longer than expected, adviser Jeff Wald
said. Tyson began undergoing examination on Wednesday and it was
completed Sunday.
	   ``It takes time to write this up,'' Wald said. ``We can't
dictate to the doctors. They did an incredibly thorough job, and
out of fairness, I don't know why (being late) would be held
against us since we can't control it.''
	   The testing had appeared to be the only obstacle standing in the
way of the commission relicensing Tyson, following a marathon
hearing Sept. 19. But Ghanem and commissioner James Nave now say
they want to hear about Tyson's alleged altercation with two men
following a traffic accident in suburban Washington, D.C., before
they make a decision.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to reflect Arafat's announcement Tuesday
that he will accept deal. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The words Yasser Arafat didn't say spoke
louder than the ones he did.
	   The Palestinian leader called on world leaders during his United
Nations address Monday to support Palestinian statehood. But he
stopped short of threatening to unilaterally declare independence
on May 4, 1999, the deadline for the completion of peace accords
with Israel.
	   The carefully worded speech was a small victory for Israel,
which has vehemently lobbied the world body against accepting
Palestinian statehood. But for the Palestinians and the United
States, a summit Monday in Washington seemed to end without a deal
for an Israeli troop withdrawal.
	   Tuesday, however, Arafat said after meeting with U.S. President
Bill Clinton that he has accepted a proposal under which Israel
would surrender another 13 percent of the West Bank. He said he
hopes a West Bank agreement can be concluded in October.
	   On Monday, before flying home for Yom Kippur, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed at the White House that he
was relinquishing the Jewish state's claim to more land on the West
Bank provided it would not be used as a base for attacks on Israel.
	   The key provision accepted by Netanyahu would bring Israel's
withdrawal from 13 percent of the land captured from Jordan in
1967. That would be on top of 27 percent already pledged to the
Palestinian Authority along with most of the Gaza Strip.
	   Under the proposal, 3 percent of the land that Israel yields
would become a nature preserve under joint Israeli-Palestinian
security oversight.
	   Arafat has used the statehood issue as a wild card since the
deadlock began in the spring of 1997, saying that he could declare
independence without an agreement from Israel.
	   Netanyahu hinted that he would counter such a move by annexing
more Palestinian areas, a scenario that would probably drag the
sides into armed conflict. The United States took Netanyahu
seriously and publicly said this week that it would not support
unilateral declarations. The pressure led to a watered-down speech
by Arafat, who still called on the U.N. to support Palestinian
statehood but avoided threats.
	   A White House official told reporters that the Palestinian
leader had reviewed his speech with Clinton.
	   The Palestinians, who already agreed to U.S. proposals that
would give them less land now than they had hoped for, want Israel
to carry out its commitments to withdraw from war-captured
territory. It is the same thing they have asked for since accepting
the U.S. plan this spring.
	   Also unchanged is the May 1999 deadline when the historic Oslo
peace accords, signed five years ago on the White House lawn, will
expire. When Netanyahu and Arafat return to Washington in October,
only six months will remain before the deadline.

Ukraine eliminates another SS-24 ballistic missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Senior American and Ukrainian defense
officials observed the destruction of a Ukrainian SS-24 missile
silo Tuesday, another step in joint efforts to rid the former
Soviet republic of its nuclear weapons arsenal.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Edward Warner and Ukrainian
Deputy Defense Minister Volodymyr Mykhtiuk witnessed the events at
the Pervomaisk missile base in southern Ukraine.
	   On Monday, the U.S. and Ukrainian delegations observed
elimination of a TU-160 strategic bomber at the Pryluky air base in
northern Ukraine.
	   Ukraine inherited the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal with
the 1991 Soviet collapse. It has surrendered all its nuclear
warheads to Russia and pledged to remain nuclear-free, but still
needs to destroy some of the nuclear infrastructure.
	   The country has destroyed 120 of 176 missile silos it inherited
from the former Soviet Union, according to the Interfax news
agency. Seventy-two of the silo sites have been restored for
agricultural purposes.
	   The elimination of all TU-160 bombers and SS-24 ballistic
missiles, scheduled to be finished by December 2001, will complete
Ukraine's efforts in eliminating its nuclear weapons
infrastructure, for which the country has received dlrs 520 million
from the American government.

 &UR; Serbs claim withdrawals, Albanians new fighting
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with diplomat's comments.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army pulled out of an
area of recent conflict on Tuesday, in an apparent move to back up
government claims of an end to the Kosovo offensive. But Albanians
reported new, large-scale deployments and fresh fighting.
	   About 150 military vehicles were seen passing through Caglavica,
just south of Pristina, from the direction of Suva Reka, farther to
the southwest. Tanks made up at least a third of the convoy.
	   Serbian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said three
army units _ they did not specify how many troops _ were pulled
back into Pristina alone, along with similar withdrawals from
recently fought-over regions south of the capital back to the
cities of Prizren and Urosevac.
	   Still, beyond the convoy seen at Caglavica, it was unclear
whether a large-scale pullback, as demanded by NATO, had begun, or
if new offensives were in progress, as claimed by the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Information Center.
	   Tensions between Kosovo's Serbs and Albanians were stoked with
the discovery of 15 Albanian men, women and children _ apparently
refugees _ who were shot in the back of the head at a makeshift
camp in a wooded section of the Drenica region, west of Pristina.
Albanians said they were massacred by the Serbs on Sunday. There
was no immediate Serb response.
	   The bodies were seen Monday by diplomats from the United States
and other countries. Two of the bodies had been decapitated. One
woman was missing her foot. Another's stomach was cut up and her
head was split in half.
	   The Albanians said a baby was left alive in a pool of her dead
mother's blood.
	   The diplomats _ members of a permanent observer mission to
Kosovo _ refused to discuss what they saw before reporting to their
government. But on Tuesday, Jack Zetkulic, deputy chief of mission
at the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade said he and others touring refugee
sites inhabited by some of the estimated 275,000 people driven from
their homes in the seven-month crackdown, were shown ``some
harrowing photographs'' and a report on the alleged massacre from
the observer group.

Kurds' self-proclaimed parliament meets in Rome; Turkey protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A group of Italian lawmakers welcomed Turkish Kurds'
self-proclaimed parliament-in-exile into Italy's parliament
building Tuesday, drawing protests from Turkey's government.
	   The 65 Kurds pledged to fight for a Kurdish homeland in Turkey.
They asked that Italy _ Turkey's second-largest trade partner _ put
pressure on Turkey to help them realize their goal, drawing
statements of support from their Italian hosts.
	   ``I find it hypocritical that some members of Italian political
parties support the vindication of the Kurds but don't recognize
Kurdish self-determination,'' said Ramon Mantovani, a lawmaker of
Italy's Communist Refoundation party.
	   The roughly 100 lawmakers invited the Kurdish group. It included
some former members of Turkey's parliament, who fled the country
when their party was shut down in 1994 for ties with Kurdish
rebels.
	   Italy's government stressed that the Italian lawmakers acted
without its sanction.
	   But Turkey said the government bore some responsibility.
	   ``Some Italian parliament members have engaged in a coalition
with people against the peace and unity of Turkey,'' Turkey's
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   ``It has been noted with regret that senior officials in Rome
have failed in taking effective measures to prevent this.''
	   The first meeting of the parliament-in-exile caused a diplomatic
clash between the Netherlands and Turkey, which recalled its
ambassador for two months and suspended arms purchases from the
Dutch.
	   Later meetings in Russia, Norway, Austria and Denmark also
prompted protests.
	   In the Foreign Ministry statement, Turkey said Tuesday's
meetings went against the friendship between Turkey and Italy and
against Italian commitments to fighting international terrorism.
	   The rebels are fighting for greater autonomy for Turkey's Kurds;
the 14-year-old war has killed more than 37,000 people.

German chancellor-elect to visit Washington, Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder will
visit President Bill Clinton in Washington soon, probably before he
is confirmed in office, a close aide said Tuesday.
	   The visit follows Schroeder's broad assurances that Germany's
foreign policy will not change under his center-left government,
which defeated long-serving Chancellor Helmut Kohl in elections
Sunday.
	   He also spoke by telephone Tuesday with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and agreed to visit Moscow ``shortly,'' but probably not
until after he officially becomes chancellor, said the aide,
Uwe-Karsten Heye.
	   The newly elected parliament was expected to formally swear in
Schroeder as chancellor on Oct. 22 so he can attend a European
Union summit in Austria that weekend as Germany's leader.
	   Schroeder makes his first foreign visit _ to Paris _ on
Wednesday.
	   Schroeder's trip to France, Germany's closest European partner,
is meant to stress his theme of continuity in foreign policy.
Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl made the same journey in 1982 when
he was first elected.
	   Schroeder was to have lunch with French President Jacques Chirac
and meet Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in the afternoon before
holding a news conference at the German Embassy.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian officials said Tuesday
that a Mideast summit in Washington produced little to help their
cause and that despite a moderate tone by Yasser Arafat, statehood
for them is just around the corner.
	   As Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton met again Tuesday to
discuss Israeli demands for tougher security measures, a car rigged
with explosives blew up in the West Bank, killing a Palestinian
militant and raising suspicion it was being prepared by the
militant group Hamas for an attack in Israel on the eve of
Judaism's holiest day.
	   In Washington, Arafat said he had accepted Israeli modifications
to a U.S. peace proposal in which Israel will withdraw its troops
from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The proportion of land to be handed over was one of several
obstacles in the way of a deal signing for the long overdue Israeli
troop withdrawal, but others such as Israeli demands for tougher
Palestinian security measures are still unresolved.
	   Tuesday's announcement by Arafat marked a second concession by
the Palestinians during a week of diplomatic efforts by the Clinton
administration to bring the sides closer to agreement and end 18
months of stalemate.
	   But the concessions, including a toned-down speech by Arafat to
the United Nations Monday, left many Palestinians wondering what
they gained from the process.
	   ``I don't believe that we got anything in return,'' said former
Palestinian negotiator Hanan Ashrawi. ``What we heard from
President Clinton was promise to continue with procedure and not
substance.'' Ashrawi blamed the United States for refusing to
pressure Israel or keep its promises to the Palestinians.
	   Palestinian Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Nabil Amr said
Arafat's speech avoided threats on unilateral declarations ``to
open the way to a more serious effort by the Americans to rescue
the peace process. However, that does not mean that he or the
Palestinian people have abandoned the idea of statehood,'' he told
The Associated Press.
	   The Palestinians have accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of placing new demands on them in an effort to keep the
process deadlocked.
	   Despite expressing optimism after Monday's tri-lateral summit at
the White House with Arafat, Netanyahu told reporters that
``nothing would be agreed to until everything is agreed to.''
	   Israel has said that it would only turn over more land if the
Palestinians could guarantee it would not be used as a haven for
militants.
	   Tuesday, a large explosion in the small Palestinian village of
Beitunia, outside of Ramallah, rocked an industrial area and killed
a member of the militant group Hamas and wounded two other
activists.
	   The loud boom which resonated across the village came from a car
rigged with large amounts explosives. Palestinian security
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity hinted that the car
may have exploded prematurely while being prepared for a suicide
attack. The officials said they were investigating.
	   The force of the blast cut the white Volkswagen in half and blew
out the doors and roof, leaving only the hood and front seats.
	   The explosion killed Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, 35, from the West
Bank village of Biddou. The two injured men, brothers from Biddou,
were taken to Ramallah Hospital where they were placed under police
guard, said Ramallah Police Chief Kamal Sheik.
	   All three were known Hamas activists, security officials said.
	   The scene of the blast was not far from where the body of the
chief Hamas bombmaker, Mohiyedine Sharif, was found in the spring
after a similar car explosion.
	   In Israel, there was no official comment on the explosion as
government offices shut down and Jews prepared for the holy day of
Yom Kippur _ the Day of Atonement _ which began at sundown Tuesday
and ends Wednesday at dusk.
	   Fearing attacks by Hamas, Israel's army had sealed off the West
Bank and Gaza Strip barring Palestinians from entering into Israel
proper just hours before the bomb in Ramallah went off.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army pulled out of an
area of recent conflict Tuesday, in an apparent move to back up a
government pledge to end to the Kosovo offensive. But Albanians
reported new, large-scale troop deployments and fresh fighting.
	   The pullbacks claimed by the Serbs were in apparent reaction to
NATO's decision to step up plans for airstrikes after repeated
warnings to end its offensive against rebels in the southern Kosovo
province. The majority ethnic Albanian province is part of Serbia,
the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   About 150 military vehicles were seen Tuesday passing through
Caglavica, just south of the provincial capital, Pristina. Tanks
made up at least one-third of the convoy.
	   Serbian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported
three army units were pulled back into Pristina, and similar
withdrawals from recent battlegrounds south of the capital. They
did not say how many troops were withdrawn.
	   Still, beyond the convoy seen at Caglavica, it was unclear
whether a large-scale pullback, as demanded by NATO, had begun, or
if new offensives were in progress, as claimed by the ethnic
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center.
	   Since the Serbian crackdown began in February, hundreds of
people have been killed and an estimated 275,000 driven from their
homes.
	   Foreign diplomats visiting the refugees on Tuesday saw the
bodies of 15 ethnic Albanian men, women and children who were shot
in the back of the head at a makeshift camp in a wooded section of
the Drenica region, west of Pristina. Ethnic Albanians said the
Serbs carried out the massacre Sunday.
	   There was no immediate Serb response.
	   Two of the bodies had been decapitated. One woman was missing
her foot. Another's stomach was cut up and her head was split in
half. The ethnic Albanians said a baby was left alive in a pool of
her dead mother's blood.
	   The diplomats _ members of a permanent observer mission to
Kosovo _ refused to comment before reporting to their government.
But Jack Zetkulic, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in
Belgrade, said those touring refugee sites were shown ``some
harrowing photographs'' and an observer group report on the alleged
massacre.
	   Both sides have been accused of massacres. Serbs have said that
at least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and killed earlier this
month near Glodjane in western Kosovo after they were ``kidnapped
by the terrorists.''
	   Most Kosovo Albanians favor independence and support the Kosovo
Liberation Army's struggle to achieve that goal. But with the
guerrillas no match for much better-armed Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army, they may have no choice but to settle for some sort
of autonomy, as outlined in a U.S.-backed plan promoted by moderate
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the KLA urged the world to act ``more
justly, swiftly and energetically, or the consequences of the
Kosovo war would be reflected in the whole of Balkans and wider.''
The rebels pledged to fight on despite a string of defeats which
have driven them from most of their former strongholds.
	   Serb claims of pullbacks followed Monday's announcement that
government forces had crushed the secessionist Kosovo Liberation
Army after seven months of fighting and that special police units
would be returned to their barracks.
	   Despite the pullback claims, the Kosovo Information Center,
which reflects the views of the moderate Kosovo Albanian
leadership, reported ``heavy'' Serb attacks Tuesday around the
towns of Stimlje and Urosevac, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south
of Pristina.
	   Later, in a separate report, the information center claimed that
200 tanks were seen heading into Kosovo from the rest of Serbia in
the region of Podujevo, north of Pristina. That claim, too, could
not be verified.
	   Diplomatic efforts continued Tuesday to move both sides to agree
on the U.S.-backed autonomy plan and end fighting in the province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met in Belgrade with Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic and later went to Kosovo, for likely
talks with Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders.

Libya questions U.S.-British proposal for Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Libya outlined its problems Tuesday with a
proposal to try two Libyan suspects in the Pan Am bombing, saying
it needed security guarantees for the accused and questioning why
it must provide witnesses for the prosecution.
	   In a speech to the General Assembly's annual debate, Libyan U.N.
Ambassador Abuzed Dorda also said the two men, if convicted, should
serve their sentences in the Netherlands or Libya, not in Britain
as the proposal calls for.
	   Libya has accepted the proposed trial before a Scottish court in
the Netherlands, he said, ``but will not accept the setting of any
conditions in relation to the implementation of that proposal.''
	   Dorda outlined questions Libya needed answered before it would
turn over the two intelligence agents, who are accused of planting
a bomb aboard the flight. The plane exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   Libya has refused to hand over the men, fearing they wouldn't
get a fair trial in the United States or Britain. The U.S. and
British governments proposed a Netherlands trial last month in an
attempt to close the decade-old case.
	   The United States and Britain termed the proposal a
take-it-or-leave-it deal, and threatened Libya with more sanctions
if it didn't promptly turn the men over. As an incentive, the U.N.
Security Council agreed to suspend sanctions, which bar air travel
to and from Libya, once the two arrive in the Netherlands.
	   Dorda said that agreement must be reached on what witnesses will
be called, where the suspects would be jailed if convicted and how
they would be transferred safely to and from the Netherlands.
	   Libya needed guarantees that the two suspects, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, wouldn't be extradited to the
United States or Britain, and that their legal, social, personal
and religious rights would be guaranteed, he said.
	   He questioned why Libya was being forced to provide evidence and
witnesses for a trial, saying the demand ``contradicts logic and
law.
	   ``Libya has not accused the two suspects. It is the United
States and the United Kingdom that claim to possess evidence which
justify that suspicion. Only they have the responsibility to
provide the evidence and the witnesses for the prosecution in order
to prove their case,'' Dorda said.
	   But he concluded by pledging Libya's desire to close the case.
	   ``We would like to confirm our seriousness and our desire and
our willingness to close the file of this case and other files as
well, and open a new chapter in our relations with the countries
concerned based on mutual respect and non-interference in internal
affairs,'' Dorda said.

Greens play down concerns over pacifist platform

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Greens leaders on Tuesday played down
demands by the party's radical pacifist and environmental wing
ahead of coalition talks with the Social Democrats later this week.
	   Among the ideas being floated in media interviews: Lawmaker
Christian Stroebele said he wanted the new government to halt work
on a high-speed magnetic levitation train from Berlin-Hamburg.
Parliamentarian Heide Ruehle asserted the party should push for a
commitment to scrap nuclear energy.
	   Party leaders, however, fear that such demands will hurt the
Greens' chances of entering the federal government for the first
time.
	   Moderate lawmaker Antje Vollmer said the party would make a
mistake by for fighting for unrealistic concessions when coalition
talks open Friday. ``Let's get serious now,'' she said.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder already has made clear that
the Social Democrats, as the dominant partner, would not tolerate
radical causes supported by many Greens. In an interview with Der
Spiegel news magazine, he warned the Greens ``not to be pushy with
their demands.''
	   The Greens' leading moderate and a possible candidate for
foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, played down the party's
anti-military platform _ which calls for scrapping NATO _ saying it
would not make the nation an uncertain ally.
	   ``We don't want Germany to go down a separate path'' from its
allies, he said late Monday on German television. ``It will be
difficult to govern the country with rebellious policies. The point
is to make successful policies as a party in government.''
	   Schroeder himself has assured the world that Germany's foreign
policy will not change, and addressed concerns over the Greens'
role in setting the defense agenda during a press conference
Monday.
	   ``Nobody needs to be afraid. We will ensure continuity in
foreign policy,'' Schroeder said. ``The international community can
rely on Germans to remain good partners.''
	   As a first sign of continuity, Schroeder planned to visit Paris
on Wednesday in a symbolic trip to the capital of Germany's closest
European partner. Chancellor Helmut Kohl made the same journey in
1982 after becoming chancellor.
	   Schroeder also plans trips to Washington to meet with Bill
Clinton and to Moscow to meet with Boris Yeltsin in the coming
weeks, a top aide, Karsten-Uwe Heye, said Tuesday.
	   Not only has Schroeder vowed to continue Kohl's foreign
policies, but the future chancellor also said Monday he might
consult his predecessor directly for advice on diplomacy.
	   The new government's defense policies could first be tested on
the issue of German involvement in possible NATO strikes in the
Serb-ruled Yugoslav republic of Kosovo.
	   The outgoing Cabinet was to meet Wednesday to confirm Germany's
offer to offer 14 fighter planes to participate in possible NATO
air strikes. The offer requires no parliamentary action but German
participation in NATO strikes would require lawmakers' approval.
	   That would fall to the outgoing parliament if the decision came
before the new legislature is confirmed.
	   Germany's constitution gives no deadline for forming a
government, but the new parliament must convene by Oct. 27.
	   Sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the newly
elected lawmakers likely will hold their first session on Oct. 20
or 21 so they can formally elect Schroeder as chancellor before a
European Union summit on Oct. 24-25.
	   Meanwhile, leading Christian Democrats called for a sweeping
renewal of the party Tuesday after outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl
led it to its worst defeat in 50 years in a national election.
	   Lower Saxony governor Kurt Biedenkopf, a longtime Kohl critic
inside the party, said the CDU must modernize itself and not
continue working ``as if we were about to take over the government
again tomorrow.''

Prague oust Schalke in penalty shootout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Slavia Prague ousted Schalke 5-4
in a penalty shootout Tuesday when keeper Radek Cerny batted away
the final shot by Germany's 1997 UEFA Cup champions.
	   Cerny blocked Marco van Hoogdalem's weakly placed shot from the
spot to decide the first round, second leg shootout after the two
teams went 1-1 on agregrate for their two matches.
	   Schalke, which also reached the quarterfinals last year, won 1-0
at home but Richard Dostalek scored the 1-0 in the 17th minute to
even up the series.
	   The 24-year-old Czech national team player, after the German
team dominated the opening minutes, stunned Schalke by whirling and
firing a hard shot that flew into the left corner of the net.
	   The ball had dropped behind him when Schalke defender Michael
Brueskens's kick to clear a long pass misfired.
	   Schalke, whose last international shootout in May 21, 1997 beat
Inter Milan in the UEFA Cup final, then attacked the rest of the
way but rarely proved dangerous.
	   The German club, dead last in the Bundesliga in goal production
this season, once again proved punchless.
	   When the injured Marc Wilmonts, who has scored eight UEFA Cup
goals, was inserted into the match, Schalke suddenly came alive and
appeared close to scoring the goal needed to advance.
	   Seconds after Wilmonts entered in the 72nd minute, he fired a
sharply angled shot from the left that surprised Cerny, who batted
it away.
	   But when Wilmonts left hobbling again nine minutes into the
first extra-time period, Schalke again was flat and held on for the
penalty contest.

Iran denies allegations it plotted with Saudi exile against U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran on Tuesday denied allegations in a
U.S. criminal complaint that it plotted attacks on U.S. military
forces with the Saudi exile wanted in last month's U.S. embassy
bombings in Africa.
	   ``The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran categorically
rejects terrorism in all forms and manifestations, irrespective of
its motivations,'' the Iranian mission to the United Nations said
in a statement.
	   The complaint unsealed Friday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan charged Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a ranking member of the al
Qaeda terrorist group headed by Osama bin Laden, with murder
conspiracy and use of weapons of mass destruction in an
international plot to kill U.S. citizens.
	   According to a member of al Qaeda who was recruited by the FBI
as a confidential informant, the plot included an unfulfilled plan
by bin Laden in 1992 to join forces with ``Shiite Muslim terrorist
organizations, including the government of Iran and its affiliated
terrorist group, Hezbollah,'' the complaint said.
	   The complaint alleged that the plan was aimed at launching
attacks on U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia.
	   In its statement, the Iranian mission said it ``categorically
denies that it has any sort of relations, coordination or agreement
with bin Laden or his associates for any purpose.''
	   The Iranian government ``does not allow or tolerate that its
territory be used by terrorists for the purpose of instigating,
planning, financing or supporting terrorist activities in other
countries,'' it said.
	   Iran said it had condemned the Aug. 31 bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which killed 259 people, and it
pledged to work for a coordinated global response to terrorism.
	   Salim was accused of helping finance, train and arm members of
al Qaeda, including the alleged embassy bombers.
	   He is in custody in Germany awaiting extradition to the United
States. The German Justice Ministry has to approve the extradition.

Governing party decides to drop Meciar to form a new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with word that Meciar will not be

officials; EDITS throughout. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The governing party of Premier
Vladimir Meciar has decided to nominate someone else to try to form
a new government following parliamentary elections last week, party
officials said Tuesday.
	   But the decision to drop Meciar may not be enough for the ruling
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia to remain in power because the
combined opposition has won a majority of seats in the new
parliament in the ballot held Friday and Saturday last week.
	   Interior Minister Gustav Krajci said Tuesday that Sergej Kozlik,
the vice chairman of Meciar's party, or someone else will be
appointed to put together a new Cabinet, but not Meciar. Krajci
said that Meciar will have to respect the decision.
	   Kozlik said that the decision about who will be appointed to
form the new government has not been officially made.
	   ``There were internal talks that it will not be Meciar. We just
have to wait for the official decision,'' Kozlik told Radio Twist
on Tuesday, referring to an unspecified agreement inside Meciar's
party.
	   But Krajci also made clear that his party may be forced to go
into opposition.
	   ``Do you see any other solution? We will try to form a
government, but it is not probable that we will be able to form a
majority government,'' he said.
	   A final decision on who will be the governing party's candidate
for prime minister will be made at a party congress on Saturday,
other officials said.
	   Meciar's party won the parliamentary elections with 27 percent,
but did not gain a constitutional majority. The party holds only 43
seats in the parliament. The party's future coalition partner, the
Slovak National Party, gained 14 seats.
	   The combined opposition now has a constitutional majority of 93
seats, enough to enact key legislation and change the constitution
if it manages to agree on a new prime minister and government.
	   Lubomir Andrassy, the spokesman for the Democratic Left, the
second largest opposition party, said earlier Meciar's party had
the right to form the new government. But he said his party will
not enter into a coalition with Meciar.
	   ``It is up to Meciar's party whom they will appoint to form the
new government,'' said Andrassy.
	   The other three opposition parties have made clear they will not
be partners in a coalition with Meciar.

Hingis turns 18, gets to drive the cars, but may lose No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Finally, she'll get to take that Porsche
out for a spin.
	   Martina Hingis, the top-ranked female tennis player, celebrates
her 18th birthday Wednesday and fast cars are on her mind. And
soccer matches.
	   ``Turning 18 is a new stage. I've been waiting for it,'' Hingis
said.
	   ``I won Filderstadt before, where I got a Porsche. It's staying
at home in the garage. I can't drive it.
	   ``Now, if you turn 18, I'm able to drive those cars. I don't
need anybody else from my family to drive me. I'm able to move more
freely,'' she said in Munich, where Hingis is competing at the
Grand Slam Cup.
	   ``Apart from that, I will continue going to the tournaments with
my mom to coach me.
	   ``I think you certainly get more independent. You can take
decisions on your own.
	   ``But nevertheless, I'm not going to believe that now I'm 18 and
I can decide everything without asking or consulting my mother and
my team,'' Hingis said.
	   Hingis is coached by her mother, Melanie Molitor, who usually
accompanies her at tournaments.
	   ``Before, my mother had to sign when I was asked to sign
something. Now I can sign on my own.''
	   Hingis could pick up another brand new Porsche next week in
Filderstadt, Germany, where the car company is the main sponsor.
	   But Hingis could also lose her No. 1 ranking, which she has held
since March 31, 1997.
	   After winning three of the four Grand Slam tournaments last year
(Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open) and reaching the final
of the French Open, Hingis captured only one this year _ the first
one in Australia.
	   Since then, she has won only three more titles, at Indian Wells,
Hamburg and Rome, and she is being challenged by Lindsay Davenport,
who beat her in the U.S. Open final earlier this month.
	   Her tournament singles record is 54-10, and she has been beaten
three times by Davenport, and twice each by Venus Williams and
Monica Seles.
	   Davenport is now only 26 points behind in the rankings and could
capture the No. 1 spot in Filderstadt.
	   But right now, Hingis is too busy celebrating to worry about the
ranking.
	   One of her German sponsors (Opel) is preparing ``something big,
something special,'' which could result in another car.
	   ``I don't know, it may be a big media hype.''
	   ``I want to see the soccer match tomorrow night against
Manchester United,'' Hingis said.
	   The Champions League match between Bayern Munich and Manchester
United is being played next door to the tennis hall at the Olympic
stadium.
	   ``I will definitely be there,'' Hingis said.
	   ``Maybe on Thursday I will have the opportunity to have a quick
look at the Oktoberfest.''
	   And just in case she runs out of pocket money while trying out
the beer and the Bavarian wurst, Hingis could end her week in
Munich earning dlrs 800,000 _ the first-place prize for women at
the lucrative Grand Slam Cup _ after three matches.
	   Just by clearing the first hurdle, a 6-2, 7-5 victory over
Conchita Martinez on Tuesday, earned Hingis at least dlrs 200,000.
	   ``It's really a great tournament I would say. There are no
points to win so you can really have fun playing,'' Hingis said.
``Of course, there's always the money, which isn't bad for three
matches.''

	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Despite fears of an economic downturn,
Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday told Labor Party activists
that he will not intervene to devalue the British pound nor boost
state spending.
	   ``Of course we'd rather be popular ... but better to be
unpopular than wrong,'' said Blair, delivering his keynote address
at his governing party's six-day annual conference in this northern
seaside town.
	   Left-wingers, who oppose in principle Blair's ``New Labor''
centrist policies, and moderate trade unions worried about high
interest rates and the strong British pound making exports
expensive, have both urged a fundamental economic rethink.
	   In particular, they want Blair to restore to politicians the
authority to set interest rates, a power he handed to the Bank of
England after Labor's landslide election victory 17 months ago.
	   Blair's refusal to intervene over the pound and let up on
anti-inflationary policies was greeted with muted applause by
delegates gathered in a hall decorated with brightly colored New
Labor slogans, such as ``Action on Crime'' and ``More Money for
Schools and Hospitals.''
	   But he received the traditional standing ovations at the end of
a speech dotted with disclaimers that he is personally
authoritarian and politically aping policies of the defeated
Conservative Party.
	   Hailing the election of Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats in
Germany, Blair said the center-left has revived across Western
Europe.
	   ``Five years ago, people said the politics of fairness was
finished, that only losers cared about social justice,'' Blair
said. ``Today, of 15 European Union countries, 13 have center-left
governments.''
	   Blair is still popular with voters. But aides acknowledge that
the year ahead will be tough. This will likely fuel dissent within
the party and encourage working-class voters to stay home during
next year's elections to the European Parliament and new separate
assemblies for Scotland and Wales.
	   In Blackpool, the left-wing has enjoyed a modest revival. It won
four of the six seats chosen by rank-and-file party members on the
32-seat governing National Executive Committee, and it announced
plans to fight further ballots with organized leftist slates.
	   Blair reached out to the rank-and-file, who are traditionally to
the left of the leadership, by emphasizing his government's
increased spending on health and education, introducton of a
mininum wage, and plans to strip hereditary peers of voting powers
in the House of Lords.
	   ``Yes, we are New Labor,'' he said. ``But don't give me this
nonsense that we're just a more moderate or competent Tory
government,'' he said.
	   Left-wingers charge Blair with dropping dissidents as candidates
for next year's elections and reducing the six-day conference to a
rally by permitting few votes on policy.
	   Unveiling an initiative said to have been prompted by a meeting
this month with New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Blair announced a
program of ``zero tolerance'' policing in 20 high-crime, inner-city
areas across the country.
	   Critics, however, noted that no provision for extra policing
seemed to accompany it.

Hingis beats Martinez in women's opener

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Top-ranked Martina Hingis opened the
women's era in the dlrs 6.7 million Grand Slam Cup by beating
Conchita Martinez 6-2, 7-5 Tuesday.
	   The Swiss, who will celebrate her 18th birthday Wednesday,
needed one hour and 20 minutes to overcome the 26-year-old Spaniard
and reach the semifinals of the women's draw.
	   ``I felt very well as a 17-year-old for the last time,'' Hingis
said.
	   ``Tomorrow, I am one day older, but that won't change much. I've
been getting ready and waiting for this moment for two years,''
Hingis said.
	   Eight women are participating in the lucrative event for the
first time since the introduction of the tournament in 1990 and
Hingis got the honor of playing the first match.
	   Hingis also beat Martinez in the final of the Australian Open to
win her only Grand Slam title of the year, and again earlier this
month in leading Switzerland to the Fed Cup title.
	   The tournament nominally brings together players with the best
records in the four Grand Slam events of the year _ the Australian,
French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   But three men's Grand Slam champions of the year have decided to
skip the tournament despite its huge prize money _ Wimbledon
champion and top-ranked Pete Sampras, U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter and Carlos Moya, the French Open champion.
	   Only Australian Open champion Petr Korda is among the 12 men
here.
	   In the opening men's match, Jonas Bjorkman rallied from a 5-1
deficit in the opening set to beat Tim Henman 7-5, 6-4.
	   Bjorkman saved three set points and broke Henman's serve when
the Briton committed a double-fault in the seventh game.
	   The Swede, fresh off leading Sweden into the Davis Cup final,
then rolled through the next five games to clinch the set. He broke
serve again in the fifth game of the second.
	   Bjorkman, currently No. 13 on the ATP computer rankings, reached
the quarterfinals of two Grand Slam events this year, in Australia
and at the U.S. Open.
	   Henman's best Grand Slam showing this year was at home, when he
reached the semifinals at Wimbledon. He is ranked 11th.
	   In the final match of the day, Felix Mantilla beat Nicolas
Escude 6-3, 6-3. Mantilla and Bjorkman advanced to the men's
quarterfinals.
	   The women are fully represented, with Monica Seles the only
absentee from the top ranks. Seles refuses to play in Germany since
her stabbing at a tournament in Hamburg in 1993.
	   Hingis and Martinez played an erratic match and the Spaniard
didn't manage to hold serve until 5-2 in the second set.
	   ``It was a good match until 5-2 in the second set. Then she hit
exactly the corner,'' Hingis said. ``Then she hit exactly the
corner. I thought that was over, that's it. It somehow caught me
off balance.''
	   Martinez finally held serve for 5-3, then saved a match point
and broke Hingis to close within 5-4. She held again to level the
score.
	   Hingis was taken to deuce before holding for 6-5 and she finally
closed the match in the next game on Martinez' serve, hitting a
return backhand winner to the line on her second match point. She
extended her career record against Martinez to 6-2.
	   The men's winner will receive dlrs 1.3 million, the women's
800,000. But there are no ranking points at stake.
	   While Hingis made sure of collecting at least dlrs 200,000 for
reaching the last four, Martinez picked up dlrs 100,000 as a
consolation for losing in the first women's round.
	   ``It's a really a great tournament,'' Hingis said. ``It's like
starting in the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam. There are no points
to win, so you can really have fun playing.''
	   ``Of course, there is always the money, which isn't bad for
three matches,'' Hingis said.
	   Henman and Escude also picked up dlrs 100,000, while Bjorkman
and Mantilla made sure of earning at least dlrs 175,000.

Ugandan leader flies to Libya, apparently violating U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda flew to
Libya on Tuesday, apparently violating U.N. sanctions that ban air
travel to the North African country, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
	   Museveni told reporters on arrival in the Libyan capital Tripoli
that he will discuss with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi the
situation in Africa and several other issues of common interest,
the agency said.
	   At least six other African leaders have violated the sanctions
with flights to Tripoli.
	   The Organization of African Unity earlier this year said it no
longer would abide by the sanctions when travel to Libya was
required for humanitarian activities or official business.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions in 1992 to try
to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270
people.

Report: Russian gets new tax chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with Fyodorov interview,
details on tax collection, talks with bankers and exporters.

 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With tax revenues plunging, Russia named a new tax
chief Tuesday who faces the elusive task of trying to coax more
money out of a shrinking economy.
	   His predecessor immediately predicted that the new head of the
tax service, Georgy Boos, would fail. Boris Fyodorov, the last
great hope of market-oriented economic reformers, said the new
coalition government had no real interest in collecting taxes and
would probably collapse in a matter of months.
	   ``In the last two weeks in the government, nobody asked me a
single time how much tax we collected,'' Fyodorov said. ``Nobody
cares. Obviously if you have a license to print money ... why make
enemies, why go after private individuals, why be tough?''
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has insisted that tax collection
remains at the heart of his plans to resuscitate the economy. But
Primakov said Tuesday that tax collection in September was only
about half what the government had projected.
	   He hinted at the ultimate cost of the failure, conceding the
government probably doesn't have enough money to maintain the
social safety net.
	   And, giving further texture to the human cost of the crisis,
Primakov said food imports had declined by 83 percent in September.
	   ``This situation has undermined the available food stockpiles in
the large industrial centers,'' he said, according to ITAR-Tass. He
added that the problem was exacerbated by Russia's poor harvest
this year.
	   The government held sensitive meetings with exporters and with
foreign and domestic banks.
	   The talks with bankers on restructuring domestic debt led to no
simple resolution. Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said all
investors approved of the government's restructuring ideas, but
other participants in the meeting said the only point of agreement
was that another meeting would be held later in the week.
	   At the talks with exporters, Primakov warned that the government
plans to stiffen the rules that require them to turn in a portion
of their non-ruble earnings _ one of the ways the government plans
to maintain its foreign currency reserves.
	   Nearly three weeks into Primakov's term in office, the
government is still moving hesitantly to tackle the economic
problems that are crippling the country and that threaten to
scuttle many of the economic gains that Russia has made since the
1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The government intends to unveil a detailed economic plan by
Oct. 8, government spokesman Andrei Korotokov said Tuesday. That is
the day after Communists and labor unions plan a nationwide day of
protest.
	   The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has played a
major role in the current economic crisis. The government has been
running a large budget deficit for years and regularly lacks money
to pay millions of state workers on time.
	   Fyodorov was hailed as the best man for the job when he became
tax chief last spring. But he was dismissed by Yeltsin on Monday
and replaced by Boos, a 35-year-old member of the parliament's
budget affairs committee and the pro-government Our Home Is Russia
faction.
	   Fyodorov said he still believed Russia's tax collectors could
succeed, despite the economic collapse.
	   ``I think it's possible to collect more taxes, that there are a
lot of places where the tax man has not come,'' he said in an
interview with Dow Jones Newswires.
	   But with the economy in decline, and most bank accounts frozen,
tax collection has become increasingly difficult in recent weeks.
Primakov told his Cabinet that the government was taking urgent
measures to improve matters, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   He has already said he intends to lower the tax rate to
encourage compliance.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian officials said Tuesday
that a Mideast summit in Washington helped their cause little and
that statehood for them is just around the corner _ despite Yasser
Arafat's moderate tone.
	   As Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton met again Tuesday to
discuss Israeli demands for tougher security measures, a car rigged
with explosives blew up in the West Bank, killing a Palestinian
militant and raising suspicion it was being prepared by the
militant group Hamas for an attack in Israel on the eve of Yom
Kippur, Judaism's holiest day.
	   In Washington, Arafat said he had accepted Israeli modifications
to a U.S. peace proposal in which Israel will withdraw its troops
from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The proportion of land to be handed over was one of several
obstacles in the way of a deal signing for the long overdue Israeli
troop withdrawal, but others such as Israeli demands for tougher
Palestinian security measures are still unresolved.
	   Tuesday's announcement by Arafat marked a second concession by
the Palestinians during a week of diplomatic efforts by the Clinton
administration to bring the sides closer to agreement and end 18
months of stalemate.
	   But the concessions, including Arafat's toned-down speech Monday
to the United Nations, left many Palestinians wondering what they
gained from the process.
	   ``I don't believe that we got anything in return,'' said former
Palestinian negotiator Hanan Ashrawi. ``What we heard from
President Clinton was promise to continue with procedure and not
substance.'' Ashrawi blamed the United States for refusing to
pressure Israel or keep its promises to the Palestinians.
	   Palestinian Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Nabil Amr said
Arafat's speech avoided threats on unilateral declarations ``to
open the way to a more serious effort by the Americans to rescue
the peace process. However, that does not mean that he or the
Palestinian people have abandoned the idea of statehood,'' he told
The Associated Press.
	   The Palestinians have accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of placing new demands on them in an effort to keep the
process deadlocked.
	   Despite expressing optimism after Monday's summit at the White
House with Arafat, Netanyahu told reporters that ``nothing would be
agreed to until everything is agreed to.''
	   Israel has said that it would only turn over more land if the
Palestinians could guarantee it would not be used as a haven for
militants.
	   On Tuesday, a large explosion in the small Palestinian village
of Beitunia, outside of Ramallah, rocked an industrial area and
killed a Hamas militant and wounded two others, security officials
said.
	   The loud boom which resonated across the village came from a car
rigged with large amounts of explosives. Palestinian security
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, hinted that the car
may have exploded while being prepared for a suicide attack. The
officials said they were investigating.
	   The force of the blast cut the white Volkswagen in half and blew
out the doors and roof, leaving only the hood and front seats.
	   The explosion killed Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, 35, from the West
Bank village of Biddou. The two injured men were taken to Ramallah
Hospital where they were placed under police guard, said Ramallah
Police Chief Kamal Sheik.
	   The scene of the blast was not far from where the body of the
chief Hamas bombmaker, Mohiyedine Sharif, was found in the spring
after a similar car explosion.
	   In Israel, there was no official comment on the explosion as
government offices shut down in preparation for the holy day of Yom
Kippur _ the Day of Atonement _ which began at sundown Tuesday and
ends Wednesday at dusk.
	   Fearing attacks by Hamas, Israel's army had sealed off the West
Bank and Gaza Strip barring Palestinians from entering into Israel
proper just hours before the bomb in Ramallah went off.

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ American fugitive Ira Einhorn won a new
reprieve from jail Tuesday, after telling a French court
considering another U.S. extradition request that he has put his
fugitive days behind him.
	   ``I will remain here. I want to live in France and stay in
France,'' said the former long-haired New Age leader convicted in
absentia in Pennsylvania for the 1977 murder of his girlfriend.
	   The prosecution had argued that mounting U.S. pressure might
prompt Einhorn, who beat a first extradition request last December
but was re-arrested Sept. 20, to flee the country.
	   Sporting cropped white hair, a long goatee and a suntan, the
57-year-old Einhorn was escorted to pick up his belongings from a
nearby jail.
	   But the grace period may be short-lived if French courts finally
decide to extradite him; a Dec. 1 date was set for an extradition
hearing. In the meantime, Einhorn is required to check in weekly
with police.
	   Einhorn's longtime Swedish companion Anika Flodkin, who's lived
with him in a converted mill in the Bordeaux region, gasped as the
ruling granting him was read out, then ran from the courtroom.
	   ``I'm very happy. I knew it, and I'm very confident,'' she told
reporters. She called the U.S. extradition request ``a legal
attempt to kidnap my husband,'' adding that it was ``100 percent
void of human rights.''
	   While at large for 16 years, Einhorn wed Flodkin under his
alias, Eugene Mallon, a name borrowed from an Irish friend, putting
the official status of the marriage in doubt.
	   Defense lawyers said Tuesday they feared that Pennsylvania
authorities might revoke a recent law promising Einhorn a retrial
if extradited. They also fear he may be given a death sentence
there, which is contrary to French law.
	   They poured scorn on Pennsylvania's bid to extradite him.
	   ``A law has been made specifically for Einhorn, and this is
scandalous,'' said defense lawyer Dominique Delthil, referring to a
new law passed in Pennsylvania that would allow Einhorn a retrial,
as France has insisted.
	   Said defense attorney Dominique Tricaud: ``Ira must be released
because this will be evidence that France is not a banana republic,
bowing to U.S. pressure.''
	   Einhorn appeared relaxed but focused during the approximately
50-minute hearing, often smiling at his wife.
	   ``The reason I want to be released is because of what prison
does to me,'' Einhorn told the judge. ``It has ruined my life.''
	   Einhorn was sentenced in absentia to life in prison for the
murder of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux -- a crime he denies even though
police found her corpse stuffed in a trunk in his closet.
	   After 16 years on the lam, Einhorn was tracked down and arrested
at his home in June last year. But in December a French court
refused to extradite Einhorn, citing a French law that would have
required a retrial in Pennsylvania.
	   Einhorn, a prominent anti-war campaigner in the 1960s, was
courted by an international network of scientists, corporate
sponsors and wealthy benefactors drawn to his vision of a New Age.
He became a consultant for Bell Telephone of Pennsylvania and was
later a Harvard fellow.

Skinheads sentenced to jail temrs for drowning Roma
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Two skinheads were found guilty of
assault resulting in death on Tuesday and sentenced to prison for
pushing a Roma woman into a river and letting her drown, the CTK
news agency reported.
	   The 26-year-old woman was attacked by the two 24-year olds last
February on a bridge over the Elbe river in the east Bohemian town
of Vrchlabi, 120 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Prague. A
police report cited the two as telling her she needed to be washed
``because her skin was too dirty.''
	   The victim was dragged downstream by the current, and her body
was only found several days later. The two were given jail terms of
6 { and 8 { years.
	   More than 20 Roma, also known as Gypsies, have been killed in
Czech skinhead attacks in the last decade.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda flew to
Libya on Tuesday, apparently violating U.N. sanctions that ban air
travel to the North African country, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
	   Museveni told reporters on arrival that he will discuss with
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi the situation in Africa and several
other issues of common interest, the agency said.
	   Museveni landed in the northern coastal town of Sirte, the
London-headquartered British Broadcasting Corp. said, quoting
state-run Libyan television.
	   At least six other African leaders have violated the sanctions
with flights to Libya.
	   The Organization of African Unity earlier this year said it no
longer would abide by the sanctions when travel to Libya was
required for humanitarian activities or official business.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions in 1992 to try
to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270
people.

 &UR; Mrs. Clinton to tour Hurricane Georges damage in Puerto Rico &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with visit to Puerto Rico, edits to tighten,

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, accompanied
by a congressional delegation and administration officials, flew to
Puerto Rico on Tuesday to survey the damage done by Hurricane
Georges.
	   It was the first leg of a trip taking her to Chile and Uruguay
before week's end.
	   In Puerto Rico, Mrs. Clinton was touring damaged areas by
helicopter, then speaking to hundreds of people housed temporarily
at a school converted into a disaster center.
	   Georges killed four people in Puerto Rico and caused dlrs 2
billion in damage. Water and power were cut off for days for most
of the 3.8 million residents.
	   President Bill Clinton has already declared the U.S.
commonwealth disaster area, making it eligible for hundreds of
millions of dollars in federal disaster aid.
	   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who announced up to dlrs 39
million in emergency grants last week to repair damage to public
housing in Puerto Rico, was among the administration officials on
this trip. They and the congressional delegation were later going
to the Dominican Republic and Haiti, two other Caribbean islands
that suffered heavy damage from Georges.
	   The delegation of a dozen members of Congress was led by Rep.
Charles Rangel, whose New York district includes the nation's
largest Puerto Rican constituency and the largest Dominican
constituency, according to his spokesman.
	   Rangel praised the president and Mrs. Clinton for responding
swiftly to the disaster, adding, ``I also wish to thank the first
lady for taking the time to join us in personally expressing her
sympathy and concern for those who are suffering through this
nightmare.''
	   Congress was taking a brief recess for the Jewish holiday of Yom
Kippur.
	   After Puerto Rico, Mrs. Clinton was heading to Santiago, Chile,
for the Eighth Conference of Wives of Chiefs of State and
Government of the Americas. After that, she was flying to
Montevideo, Uruguay, for a Vital Voices conference, a U.S. foreign
policy initiative focusing on lifting women's political and
economic roles, expected to draw about 400 women from across the
hemisphere.

Report: Russian gets new tax chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 14th graf to RESTORE first full reference to Yeltsin. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos MOSB101-4,106,108,109-110 &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With tax revenues plunging, Russia named a new tax
chief Tuesday who faces the elusive task of trying to coax more
money out of a shrinking economy.
	   His predecessor immediately predicted that the new head of the
tax service, Georgy Boos, would fail. Boris Fyodorov, the last
great hope of market-oriented economic reformers, said the new
coalition government had no real interest in collecting taxes and
would probably collapse in a matter of months.
	   ``In the last two weeks in the government, nobody asked me a
single time how much tax we collected,'' Fyodorov said. ``Nobody
cares. Obviously if you have a license to print money ... why make
enemies, why go after private individuals, why be tough?''
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has insisted that tax collection
remains at the heart of his plans to resuscitate the economy. But
Primakov said Tuesday that tax collection in September was only
about half what the government had projected.
	   He hinted at the ultimate cost of the failure, conceding the
government probably doesn't have enough money to maintain the
social safety net.
	   And, giving further texture to the human cost of the crisis,
Primakov said food imports had declined by 83 percent in September.
	   ``This situation has undermined the available food stockpiles in
the large industrial centers,'' he said, according to ITAR-Tass. He
added that the problem was exacerbated by Russia's poor harvest
this year.
	   The government held sensitive meetings with exporters and with
foreign and domestic banks.
	   The talks with bankers on restructuring domestic debt led to no
simple resolution. Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said all
investors approved of the government's restructuring ideas, but
other participants in the meeting said the only point of agreement
was that another meeting would be held later in the week.
	   At the talks with exporters, Primakov warned that the government
plans to stiffen the rules that require them to turn in a portion
of their non-ruble earnings _ one of the ways the government plans
to maintain its foreign currency reserves.
	   Nearly three weeks into Primakov's term in office, the
government is still moving hesitantly to tackle the economic
problems that are crippling the country and that threaten to
scuttle many of the economic gains that Russia has made since the
1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The government intends to unveil a detailed economic plan by
Oct. 8, government spokesman Andrei Korotokov said Tuesday. That is
the day after Communists and labor unions plan a nationwide day of
protest.
	   The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has played a
major role in the current economic crisis. The government has been
running a large budget deficit for years and regularly lacks money
to pay millions of state workers on time.
	   Fyodorov was hailed as the best man for the job when he became
tax chief last spring. But he was dismissed by President Boris
Yeltsin on Monday and replaced by Boos, a 35-year-old member of the
parliament's budget affairs committee and the pro-government Our
Home Is Russia faction.
	   Fyodorov said he still believed Russia's tax collectors could
succeed, despite the economic collapse.
	   ``I think it's possible to collect more taxes, that there are a
lot of places where the tax man has not come,'' he said in an
interview with Dow Jones Newswires.
	   But with the economy in decline, and most bank accounts frozen,
tax collection has become increasingly difficult in recent weeks.
Primakov told his Cabinet that the government was taking urgent
measures to improve matters, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   He has already said he intends to lower the tax rate to
encourage compliance.

Regional army chiefs resume talks over Congo and Angolan crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Southern African army chiefs gathered here
Tuesday for a two-day meeting to discuss ongoing disputes in Congo
and Angola that are menacing regional stability, officials said.
	   ``Angola would welcome the participation of the regional
countries in creating conditions for long-lasting military
stability in the region,'' Brig. Manuel Joao, Angola's army
spokesman, told reporters late Monday.
	   The Southern African Development Community, or SADC, is
concerned about the faltering peace process in Angola. At a summit
two weeks ago, the SADC condemned rebel chief Jonas Savimbi for
delaying the full implementation of a 1994 peace deal.
	   The 14-nation has also tried and failed to broker a cease-fire
in Congo's civil war in three previous summits.
	   Most of Congo's nine neighbors have taken sides in the country's
nine-week conflict between President Laurent Kabila and the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition.
	   At its Sept. 15 summit, the SADC commended Angola, Zimbabwe and
Namibia for preventing the overthrow of Kabila by sending in
military reinforcements, although it also called for negotiations.
	   The SADC member nations are Angola, Botswana, Congo, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
	   All 14 nations were represented at the Luanda meeting except
Mozambique, Mauritius, Lesotho and Botswana.

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Italian champion Juventus of Turin on
Tuesday agreed to transfer its Portuguese defender Manuel Dimas to
Fenerbahce of Istanbul.
	   The transfer of the 29-year-old South African-born international

	   Terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed.
	   Dimas had joined the Italian power in November 1996.
	   Fenerbahce, which fields several international players, is in
Italy to play Parma in a first-round, second-leg match of the UEFA
Cup.

	   Other top finishers, in the same time as Kirsipuu, included
Sweden's Glenn Magnusson (eighth) and Russian Sergei Leleking
(ninth).
	   The winner completed the 175-kilometer (108.5 miles) stage in

UEFA Cup: Collymore hits three as Villa wins 3-0, advances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRAMMEN, Norway (AP) _ Three Stan Collymore goals sent Premier
League leader Aston Villa cruising into the second round of the
UEFA Cup Tuesday as a 3-0 victory earned a 6-2 aggregate triumph.
	   Having hit the headlines over a violent assault on TV
personality girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson during the summer, the tall
striker returned to the team because Paul Merson was ineligible.
	   He responded with goals in the 11th, 23rd and 64th minutes as
Villa, 3-2 ahead from the home leg, scored an easy away victory
over a team struggling to avoid relegation in the Norwegian league.
	   Villa, two goals down with 10 minutes to go in the first leg
before hitting back to win, went 4-2 ahead overall after only 11
minutes of the return.
	   Collymore collected the ball 25 meters (yards) from goal, turned
inside former Chelsea defender Erland Johnsen and fired a rising,
right-footed shot into the roof of the net.
	   In the 23rd minute, goalkeeper Glenn Arne Hansen palmed away a
cross from Ian Taylor to the unmarked Collymore who fired into a
virtually unguarded net for No. 2.
	   The third goal came 19 minutes into the second half with Julian
Joachim chased a ball from deep, shrugged off a defender and
crossed low for Collymore to slide the ball in from close range

Trial begins in case to oust Jehovah's Witnesses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A civil trial to prohibit the activities of the
Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia began Tuesday in a Moscow courtroom,
where the American religious group was accused of cult-like
activities, a news agency reported.
	   The city procurator brought suit against the Jehovah's Witnesses
under Russia's new religion law. At the hearing Tuesday, he argued
that the group violated the law for both technical reasons
involving its registration and for more substantive reasons,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   The organization was accused of proselytizing young people
without their parents' knowledge, stopping people from getting
blood transfusions in emergencies and driving several people into
mental institutions or to suicide, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The Jehovah's Witnesses have said they plan to argue that the
court lacks jurisdiction and that the case violates the Russian
Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.
	   Jehovah's Witnesses claim to be the fifth largest Christian
group in Russia, with about 10,000 members in Moscow and more than
250,000 across the country.

Opposition says Albanian premier's resignation not enough

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ After his rival Fatos Nano submitted his
resignation as prime minister, ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday
demanded new elections, but in an apparent concession urged
supporters to cooperate with a new government.
	   The ruling Socialist Party nominated its 30-year-old general
secretary, Pandeli Majko, to replace Nano, who handed in his
resignation to President Rexhep Meidani late Monday.
	   Under Albanian law, Nano remains caretaker prime minister until
Parliament approves his successor and his Cabinet. The Socialists
hold 108 of the 155 seats.
	   Nano submitted his resignation after failing to win approval for
Cabinet changes following riots two weeks ago, which erupted in
Tirana after unknown gunmen killed opposition lawmaker Azem
Hajdari.
	   Berisha blamed Nano for the killing, which triggered two days of
unrest which plunged the nation to the brink of civil war.
	   On Tuesday, Berisha's Democratic Party repeated its claim that
Nano's resignation alone is not enough to bring an end to the
political crisis. The Democrats demanded that an interim government
comprised of experts not affiliated with any party take over until
new elections could be organized.
	   But in an apparent concession, Berisha later issued a statement
calling on Albanians and public officials to trust the new
``political solutions'' that are to be drawn up by the new prime
minister.
	   ``As the former president, I encourage the Democratic Party and
its allies for a more constructive spirit and a sense of compromise
to take part in a dialogue which is necessary to create a
government with a broader base,'' he said in a statement.
	   Berisha has been under strong international pressure to avoid
pushing this impoverished former Communist nation into a repeat of
the nationwide unrest which erupted in 1997 after the collapse of
failed investment schemes cost many Albanians their life-savings.
	   Majko's nomination was seen as a significant move to phase out
political leaders associated the hardline Stalinist regime that
ruled Albania for 46 years. Both Nano and Berisha were Communist
party members.
	   But Majko was a leader of the student movement which helped
topple the Communists from power in 1990.
	   Speaking to reporters after his nomination, Majko said it was
time older politicians make room for the next generation.
	   ``I think that the best support Berisha could give to the new
government would be to open space in his own party to the
generation of young politicians,'' he said.
	   Nano became prime minister last year after his party -- made up
largely of ex-Communists -- defeated Berisha's Democrats in
parliamentary elections following the riots.

Greens' German success reflects movement's growth in Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Greens' success in German elections
is only the latest bloom of a movement flowering in much of Europe
_ now part of three countries' governments and holding a
potentially key role in Sweden.
	   After grabbing international attention in the early 1980s when
the intense and charismatic Petra Kelly led the party to prominence
in Germany, the Greens faded, winning seats in European
parliaments, but remaining marginal.
	   But in the latter half of the 1990s, the Greens joined governing
coalitions in Finland, Italy and France and now have been invited
to join Germany's Social Democrats in governing Europe's biggest
nation.
	   ``There is a fresh wind of reform in Europe. The age of
conservative and neoliberal governments in the EU has definitely
come to an end,'' proclaimed Magda Aelvoet of Belgium, president of
the Green Group in the European Parliament.
	   The Greens have used their rising power to considerable effect
on their core environmental issues. In Italy, Greens Environment
Minister has been influential in pushing through legislation
increasing the number of national parks, imposing stricter criteria
for sewage treatment and forcing manufacturers of Italy's
ubiquitous mopeds to build less-polluting models.
	   France's Enviroment Minister Dominique Voynet organized last
week's ``Day Without Cars,'' where streets were blocked to motor
vehicles in 35 cities and pushed through legislation letting only
new cars with catalytic converters drive in Paris during
high-pollution days.
	   But it is in Sweden where the party may face its first serious
test on handling issues other than the environment.
	   Because of a weak showing by the governing Social Democrats in
this month's national elections, the Greens ended up being key to
the party retaining power. The Social Democrats declined to invite
the Greens into a coalition, but must rely on their support _ and
that of the ex-Communist Left Party _ to have a majority in
parliament.
	   Many analysts have predicted the awkward assemblage will quickly
collapse because the Greens and the Left would force the Social
Democrats to abandon economic pragmatism in order to push for
funding of pet programs.
	   The first test will be with the national budget, which is to be
presented Oct. 13, and the parties have been negotiating on it for
several days. So far, the Greens have been showing a practical
streak.
	   The party is going along with the Social Democrats' schedule for
paying off the national debt _ which the Left Party wants to slow
down. And the Greens may end up helping the Social Democrats back
out of what is now widely considered a badly conceived promise to
set a maximum cost for child day-care of 700 kronor (dlrs 85) a
month.
	   That's less than many people pay now and the proposal could be
costly. But the Greens object to it on the grounds that it would be
unfair to charge the wealthy so little _ an objection that may give
the Social Democrats a graceful way to abandon the idea.
	   Tougher issues are on the horizon. The Greens, like the Left,
oppose Sweden's membership in the European Union and want a
referendum held quickly on whether Sweden should join the EU's
unified currency. Surveys have indicated most Swedes oppose
membership in the currency system and the Greens and the Left
contend that voting to stay out of it would be tantamount to
withdrawing from the EU.
	   While the Social Democrats aim to keep Sweden's purse-strings
tight as the country recovers from economic hard times, the Greens
are firm in their push for more funding for environmental programs
and plan to flex their power.
	   ``The Greens have no interest in standing with a budget that
doesn't contribute to the environment,'' top party official
Marianne Samuelsson warned this week, according to the newspaper
Dagens Nyheter.

Media: Thousands of civilians joining war in south Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 7-11 with concern about famine relief. &QL; 
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Thousands of Sudanese civilians are
headed south to join the government's war against Sudanese rebels
and Ugandan troops, the official media reported Tuesday.
	   The mobilization follows an appeal on Monday by the government
for retired army officers to help he military's defense against
expected assaults by rebel forces.
	   Since Monday's call thousands of young men also have volunteered
and are traveling to the southern province of East Equatoria where
fighting has been raging since Sept. 14, state-run television and
Omdurman Radio said.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed. It was also
not possible to verify whether the civilians had volunteered or
were being forced to fight.
	   Sudan's Islamic government is known to conscript young men to
fight the largely animist and Christian rebels, who have been
waging a military campaign since 1983 for more autonomy for the
southern districts.
	   Some 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.
	   Also Tuesday, Dr. Hussein al-Obeid, head of the Sudanese
Humanitarian Aid Commission, told the state-run Sudan News Agency
that he was concerned that renewed fighting would hurt famine
relief efforts.
	   International aid agencies have been ferrying food and other
supplies to Bahr al-Ghazal state in southwestern Sudan and to other
areas set back by a severe drought. A three-month cease-fire to
facilitate the aid program ends Oct. 15.
	   The latest fighting, el-Obeid warned, could ``put off the last
ray of hope'' that the cease-fire will be extended.
	   He said the renewed clashes also could ``result in more refugees
and produce yet another humanitarian situation.''
	   The aid agencies already have distributed some 16,400 tons of
food for an estimated 1.8 million Sudanese threatened by the
famine, according to a World Food Program report here.
	   Earlier this month, Sudan accused Uganda and Eritrea of sending
troops into Sudan to aid the rebels, a charge both countries deny.
Sudan, however, plans to complain to the United Nations and other
world bodies.
	   In comments published Tuesday, army spokesman Lt. Gen.
Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim said a fierce battle took place Monday
between government troops and ``the invaders and the traitors'' in
the Khor Angles area, about 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) south of
Khartoum.
	   Many Ugandans were killed, one tank was destroyed and another
was captured, Sirul-Khatim was reported as saying by the Al-Osboa
daily newspaper. The claim could not be independently verified.
	   Sirul-Khatim said Sudanese troops have destroyed or captured 17
Ugandan and rebel tanks since Sept. 14.
	   Meanwhile, some 7,000 government employees, who are required to
perform two years of military service, also have been asked to join
the war, said Kamal Hassan Ali, spokesman of the National Service
Coordination Committee.

British Liberal says plan similar to Dayton could solve Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Britain's Paddy Ashdown, leader of
the Liberal Democratic Party, said Tuesday that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has pledged a quick end to the government
offensive in Kosovo.
	   Speaking to reporters after a three-day tour of Kosovo province,
Ashdown said he had met with Milosevic for ``an open exchange
	   of opinions'' and that Milosevic had promised to ``personally
see to
	   it that security forces end their operation in Kosovo.''
	   Ashdown told reporters he had seen clear evidence of systematic
burning of ethnic Albanian villages in Kosovo and that the police
and army were employing a ``scorched earth policy.''
	   Ashdown said that the use of heavy arms for waging total war
against defenseless villages were
	   not the kind of response to terrorism acceptable to civilized
nations.
	   During his visit Sunday to village Suva Reka in southwestern
Kosovo, Ashdown said he had heard no exchanges of small-arms fire
but only detonations of heavy artillery, ``an excessive use of
force
	   in flagrant violation'' of the latest U.N. resolution on Kosovo.
	   The columns of refugees fleeing their burned villages was one of
	   the most tragic sights he had witnessed, Ashdown said.
	   Asdown added Yugoslav authorities have roughly two weeks to
solve the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and enter a dialogue with
the province's ethnic Albanians, based on the proposals put forth
by U.S. mediator Christopher Hill, Beta reported, without
elaboration.

	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ Italian league leader Fiorentina held onto
a 0-0 draw with Hajduk Split Tuesday to squeeze into the second
round of the UEFA Cup.
	   Two goals by Brazilian Edmundo in the first leg for Fiorentina
were enough for the Florence-based side to advance by a 2-1
aggregate.
	   The Italians were content to let Hajduk control the ball, while
defending from a zone wall set up outside shooting range of their
goal and sitting out until the final whistle.
	   However, the Croats looked closer to stealing a winning goal
with several open chances in the early stages of the match. They
were denied either by sloppy finishing or secure goalkeeping by
Francesco Toldo at the Italian net.
	   Fiorentina, which created only one scoring chance out of a
Edmundo's long distance free kick, was also lucky the referee
overlooked a hand-ball in the box in the closing minutes of the
match.

On Judaism's holiest day, soul-searching in Israel

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with start of holiday, color from synagogue, Western
Wall &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In synagogues great and small, in army tents
and border bunkers, by the ancient stones of the Western Wall,
Israelis on Tuesday ushered in the holiest day of the Jewish
calendar.
	   Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, lasts from sundown Tuesday to
sundown Wednesday. Jews the world over mark it by praying and
fasting, soul-searching and repenting, seeking God's forgiveness.
	   ``It's the time to confess your sins right out loud,'' said
Jerusalem tour guide Shmaryahi Yahav, 69. ``You try to improve your
communication with God, and with other people too.''
	   But even on a day of introspection, real-world tensions
intruded.
	   Military security was tight, the Palestinian lands were sealed
off, and little progress was seen in a round of just-finished peace
talks in the United States. In the West Bank, a car packed with
powerful explosives blew up, raising suspicions it was being
readied for a suicide attack.
	   In Israel proper, the holiday presented a rare spectacle: that
of a frenetic, frantically active country simply shutting down.
	   Streets emptied as people hurried home for a final pre-fast
meal. For 24 hours, shops and businesses are shuttered, buses and
trains stop running, and virtually no one drives.
	   There are no international or domestic flights. Seaports are
closed. Border crossings are shut. News broadcasts cease.
	   At the Western Wall in Jerusalem's walled Old City, Judaism's
holiest site, thousands of Jews gathered for prayers, swaying and
chanting before the expanse of yellow stone. As dusk fell,
prayerful shouts rose from the floodlit plaza.
	   The day marks something of a truce in ongoing skirmishes between
religious
	   and secular Israelis. Even though most Israelis describe
themselves as secular, nearly all go to synagogue on Yom Kippur,
and most also fast.
	   Synagogues are so crowded that many require seat reservations,
but by tradition, no worshipper is turned away. ''Tickets,
please?'' said an usher at Jerusalem's Grand Synagogue. ''Of course
you can stay. Just stand over here.''

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
discussed Georgia's participation in the Partnership for Peace
program during a two-day visit that began Tuesday.
	   Solana arrived Tuesday afternoon, and was greeted at the Tbilisi
airport by Georgian State Minister Vazha Lordkipanidze, Foreign
Minister Irakly Menagarishvili and Defense Minister David Tevzadze.
	   He met with President Eduard Shevardnadze who said the talks
focused on Georgian participation in the Partnership for Peace
program and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.
	   Georgia is not likely to join NATO anytime in the near future.
Interfax quoted the Georgian ambassador to NATO, Zurab Abashidze,
as saying Georgia is not ready for such a step.
	   Even if it were, ``the factor of Russia, which is very
significant and down-to-earth, would have to be taken into
account,'' he said. Russia is strenuously opposed to former Soviet
republics joining NATO.
	   Solana was scheduled to leave Georgia on Wednesday for Baku,
Azerbaijan.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) -- The new government is not yet in power,
but it already has a name. Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder calls
it the ``Berlin Republic,'' a term that represents a new era in
German political history.
	   Most basically, it refers to the government's return next year
to Berlin, the enormous eastern city that was last Germany's
capital during the horror and destruction of Hitler's Reich.
	   But the Berlin Republic means far more than that.
	   To Schroeder and his supporters, it means the Cold War is truly
over. It means Germany is once again confident in wielding power
without inspiring fear. Most of all, it means that 50 years after
the Nazis, German democracy is stable and mature.
	   Glowing with confidence after his victory Sunday over
long-serving Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Schroeder answered questions
about the Berlin Republic by hailing the ``civic courage'' that led
to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the reunification of
communist East with the West.
	   ``I believe the Germans have proved in the last 50 years that
they have built a democracy that works,'' Schroeder declared Monday
during his first post-election news conference. ``And democracy has
become part of our way of living.''
	   One symbol of that democracy is the government's move out of
Bonn, chosen as a temporary capital after World War II, which left
Berlin not only destroyed but also isolated in the heart of East
Germany and divided -- eventually by the Berlin Wall -- into
capitalist and communist halves.
	   Bonn, a small, Rhine River city so provincial that scoffers call
it a village, was a natural choice for a postwar Germany eager to
present itself as a benign, cooperative partner to the rest of
Europe. Compared to the stately, domed Reichstag in Berlin, the
1950s box-style Parliament in Bonn looks like a post office.
	   Schroeder is so keen to get to Berlin, the traditional seat of
German power, that members of his party told a newspaper Tuesday
that he hopes to start governing from the new capital in April, six
months earlier than planned.
	   Pundits coined the Berlin Republic _ echoing the Weimar Republic
of the 1920s _ after the 1991 decision to move the capital out of
Bonn. The term was shorthand for anxieties about returning
government to the seat of Hitler and the German emperors. Now,
Schroeder's positive spin on the Berlin Republic is one of many
indicators of how his government represents a new attitude toward
the past.
	   Born at the end of World War II, Schroeder, 54, comes from a
generation that has no real memory of the Third Reich and feels its
burden less personally. He and his peers, part of the 1970s leftist
movement, pushed for openness about the Nazi era when older Germans
were reluctant to talk.
	   How to acknowledge the Holocaust is a debate Schroeder's side
has been having with the outgoing government. Kohl, part of a
wartime generation, has advocated building a Holocaust memorial in
Berlin as an essential reminder of the evil of the Nazi era.
	   But Schroeder and a group of leading politicians and
intellectuals find the proposed memorial inappropriate, vulgar and
_ most important _ unnecessary. A more fitting remembrance, they
assert, are the former concentration camps as well as an open
discussion of the Holocaust.
	   Berlin carries a double historical burden, symbolizing the Third
Reich and the Cold War. By moving the capital back, Germans hope to
create a more positive legacy. One rationale for deciding to move
the government to Berlin was to make Germans in the east feel more
connected with the west.
	   That was in 1991, just one year after unification. The move
today has a significance beyond Germany. Europe's center is moving
east, with Poland Hungary and the Czech Republic on track to join
the European Union. Berlin, close to the Polish border, gives
weight to the eastward shift, putting Germany in the center of a
growing, prosperous Europe.
	   European integration _ represented by NATO and EU expansion, and
Europe's common currency _ was Kohl's big project.
	   ``What you have seen in the older generation is a great
reluctance to assert German power, particularly in the name of
Germany. It was always more in the name of Europe,'' says historian
Brian Ladd, a fellow at the American Academy in Berlin.
	   Now, Germany is firmly joined with Europe. And while Schroeder
has taken pains to reassure the world he will continue Kohl's
foreign policies, Ladd suggests Schroeder may feel less anxiety
about letting Germany stand alone as a confident power.
	   The move to Berlin and the term Berlin Republic embody the
attitudes of Schroeder and his generation, getting their first shot
at leading the nation. ``Clearly,'' Ladd says, ``there's a hope
that Berlin now means the new Germany, now means something very
different.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army pulled out of an
area of recent conflict Tuesday, in an apparent move to back up a
government pledge to end to the Kosovo offensive. But Albanians
reported new, large-scale troop deployments and fresh fighting.
	   The pullbacks claimed by the Serbs were in apparent reaction to
NATO's decision to step up plans for airstrikes after repeated
warnings to end its offensive against rebels in the southern Kosovo
province. The majority ethnic Albanian province is part of Serbia,
the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   About 150 military vehicles were seen Tuesday passing through
Caglavica, just south of the provincial capital, Pristina. Tanks
made up at least one-third of the convoy.
	   Serbian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported
three army units were pulled back into Pristina, and similar
withdrawals from recent battlegrounds south of the capital. They
did not say how many troops were withdrawn.
	   Still, beyond the convoy seen at Caglavica, it was unclear
whether a large-scale pullback, as demanded by NATO, had begun, or
if new offensives were in progress, as claimed by the ethnic
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center.
	   Since the Serbian crackdown began in February, hundreds of
people have been killed and an estimated 275,000 driven from their
homes.
	   Diplomats visiting refugees on Monday saw the bodies of 15
ethnic Albanian men, women and children who were shot in the back
of the head at a makeshift camp in a wooded section of the Drenica
region, west of Pristina. The diplomats _ members of a permanent
observer mission to Kosovo _ refused to comment on what they saw at
the massacre site before reporting backs to their governments.
	   Ethnic Albanians said the Serbs carried out the massacre Sunday.
There was no immediate Serb response.
	   Two of the bodies had been decapitated. One woman was missing
her foot. Another's stomach was cut up and her head was split in
half. The ethnic Albanians said a baby was left alive in a pool of
her dead mother's blood.
	   Both sides have been accused of massacres. Serbs have said that
at least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and killed earlier this
month near Glodjane in western Kosovo after they were ``kidnapped
by the terrorists.''
	   Most Kosovo Albanians favor independence and support the Kosovo
Liberation Army's struggle to achieve that goal. But with the
guerrillas no match for much better-armed Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army, they may have no choice but to settle for some sort
of autonomy, as outlined in a U.S.-backed plan promoted by moderate
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the KLA urged the world to act ``more
justly, swiftly and energetically, or the consequences of the
Kosovo war would be reflected in the whole of Balkans and wider.''
The rebels pledged to fight on despite a string of defeats which
have driven them from most of their former strongholds.
	   Serb claims of pullbacks followed Monday's announcement that
government forces had crushed the secessionist Kosovo Liberation
Army after seven months of fighting and that special police units
would be returned to their barracks.
	   Despite the pullback claims, the Kosovo Information Center,
which reflects the views of the moderate Kosovo Albanian
leadership, reported ``heavy'' Serb attacks Tuesday around the
towns of Stimlje and Urosevac, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south
of Pristina.
	   Later, in a separate report, the information center claimed that
200 tanks were seen heading into Kosovo from the rest of Serbia in
the region of Podujevo, north of Pristina. That claim, too, could
not be verified.
	   Diplomatic efforts continued Tuesday to move both sides to agree
on the U.S.-backed autonomy plan and end fighting in the province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met in Belgrade with Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic and later went to Kosovo, for likely
talks with Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders.

	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ A 37-year-old German woman was
found dead near a beach on the Caribbean resort island of Bequia in
the Grenadines, police said Tuesday.
	   They said the body of Neki Ruchl, 37, was found Monday in bushes
near popular Princess Margaret Beach. Investigators said she was
murdered, but did not say how she died. Her hometown was not
immediately known.
	   Investigators detained a Bequia man for questioning but have not
charged him.
	   Police said Ruchl had been living on the island for four months,
apparently taking an extended vacation.
	   Bequia is the largest of the Grenadines island chain and is
about ten miles (15 kilometers) south of St. Vincent in the
southeast Caribbean. The forested island is a popular stop for
yacht owners. Its main industry is boat building and maintenance.
	   The island became the focus of international attention in 1996,
when police charged a wealthy West Virginian couple, James and
Penny Fletcher, with killing a well-known boat taxi driver there.
The Fletchers were acquitted in August 1997.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In synagogues great and small, in army tents
and border bunkers, by the ancient stones of the Western Wall,
Israelis on Tuesday ushered in the holiest day of the Jewish
calendar.
	   Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, lasts from sundown Tuesday to
sundown Wednesday. Jews the world over mark it by praying and
fasting, soul-searching and repenting, seeking God's forgiveness.
	   ``It's the time to confess your sins right out loud,'' said
Jerusalem tour guide Shmaryahi Yahav, 69. ``You try to improve your
communication with God, and with other people too.''
	   But even on a day of introspection, real-world tensions
intruded.
	   Military security was tight, the Palestinian lands were sealed
off, and little progress was seen in a round of just-finished peace
talks in the United States. In the West Bank, a car packed with
powerful explosives blew up, raising suspicions it was being
readied for a suicide attack.
	   In Israel proper, the holiday presented a rare spectacle: that
of a frenetic, frantically active country simply shutting down.
	   Streets emptied as people hurried home for a final pre-fast
meal. For 24 hours, shops and businesses are shuttered, buses and
trains stop running, and virtually no one drives.
	   There are no international or domestic flights. Seaports are
closed. Border crossings are shut. News broadcasts cease.
	   At the Western Wall in Jerusalem's walled Old City, Judaism's
holiest site, thousands of Jews gathered for prayers, swaying and
chanting before the expanse of yellow stone. As dusk fell,
prayerful shouts rose from the floodlit plaza.
	   The day marks something of a truce in ongoing skirmishes between
religious and secular Israelis. Even though most Israelis describe
themselves as secular, nearly all go to synagogue on Yom Kippur,
and most also fast.
	   Synagogues are so crowded that many require seat reservations,
but by tradition, no worshipper is turned away. ``Tickets,
please?'' said an usher at Jerusalem's Grand Synagogue. ``Of course
you can stay. Just stand over here.''

Russia welcomes new talks between India, Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that it
welcomed plans for new talks between rival India and Pakistan.
	   The two new nuclear powers are scheduled to hold talks in the
Pakistani capital of Islamabad starting Oct. 15.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said it was
essential that ``both sides demonstrate a desire for concrete
discussion of all existing bilateral problems, including Kashmir,''
the Interfax news agency said.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, the only
Muslim-majority area in mostly Hindu India, since they won
independence from Britain in 1947. Each country holds part of the
disputed valley and lays claim to the rest.
	   ``Delhi and Islamabad can reach agreement on the whole range of
issues in their bilateral relations, which will undoubtedly help
strengthen peace and security in the region,'' Rakhmanin said.
	   ``The main task now is to prevent an arms race in the region,
defuse the military and political tension in general and move to
nonconfrontational relations in South Asia,'' he said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In synagogues great and small, in army tents
and border bunkers, by the ancient stones of the Western Wall,
Israelis on Tuesday ushered in the holiest day of the Jewish
calendar.
	   Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, lasts from sundown Tuesday to
sundown Wednesday. Jews the world over mark it by praying and
fasting, soul-searching and repenting, seeking God's forgiveness.
	   ``It's the time to confess your sins right out loud,'' said
Jerusalem tour guide Shmaryahi Yahav, 69. ``You try to improve your
communication with God, and with other people too.''
	   But even on a day of introspection, real-world tensions
intruded.
	   Military security was tight, the Palestinian lands were sealed
off, and little progress was seen in a round of just-finished peace
talks in the United States. In the West Bank, a car packed with
powerful explosives blew up, raising suspicions it was being
readied for a suicide attack.
	   In Israel proper, the holiday presented a rare spectacle: that
of a frenetic, frantically active country simply shutting down.
	   Streets emptied as people hurried home for a final pre-fast
meal. For 24 hours, shops and businesses are shuttered, buses and
trains stop running, and virtually no one drives.
	   There are no international or domestic flights. Seaports are
closed. Border crossings are shut. News broadcasts cease.
	   At the Western Wall in Jerusalem's walled Old City, Judaism's
holiest site, thousands of Jews gathered for prayers, swaying and
chanting before the expanse of yellow stone. As dusk fell,
prayerful shouts rose from the floodlit plaza.
	   The day marks something of a truce in ongoing skirmishes between
religious and secular Israelis. Even though most Israelis describe
themselves as secular, nearly all go to synagogue on Yom Kippur,
and most also fast.
	   Synagogues are so crowded that many require seat reservations,
but by tradition, no worshipper is turned away. ``Tickets,
please?'' said an usher at Jerusalem's Grand Synagogue. ``Of course
you can stay. Just stand over here.''

	    &UR; AP Photo
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria and Russia will form five joint
police teams to tackle international organized crime, the
countries' interior ministers said Tuesday.
	   The agreement was contained in a cooperation protocol signed by
Bogomil Bonev of Bulgaria and Sergei Stepashin of Russia.
	   ``This protocol envisages cooperation in countering drug
traffic, car thefts and smuggling and economic crime,'' Bonev said.
	   He and Stepashin agreed to link their police databases on stolen
cars.
	   Crime surged both in Bulgaria and Russia after the end of the
Cold War in 1989.
	   Bulgaria's government is trying to improve ties with Moscow that
grew cooler after the end of communism.

Governing party decides to drop Meciar to form a new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with word that Meciar will not be picked
by his party to form a new government, comments by officials; EDITS
throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The governing party of Premier
Vladimir Meciar has decided to nominate someone else to try to form
a new government following parliamentary elections last week, party
officials said Tuesday.
	   But the decision to drop Meciar may not be enough for the ruling
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia to remain in power because the
combined opposition has won a majority of seats in the new
parliament in the ballot held Friday and Saturday.
	   Interior Minister Gustav Krajci said Tuesday that Sergej Kozlik,
the vice chairman of Meciar's party, or someone else will be
appointed to put together a new Cabinet. Krajci said that Meciar
will have to respect the decision.
	   Kozlik said that the decision about who will be appointed to
form the new government has not been officially made.
	   ``There were internal talks that it will not be Meciar. We just
have to wait for the official decision,'' Kozlik told Radio Twist
on Tuesday, referring to an unspecified agreement inside Meciar's
party.
	   But Krajci also made clear that his party may be forced to go
into opposition.
	   ``Do you see any other solution? We will try to form a
government, but it is not probable that we will be able to form a
majority government,'' he said.
	   A final decision on who will be the governing party's candidate
for prime minister will be made at a party congress on Saturday,
other officials said.
	   Meciar's party won the parliamentary elections with 27 percent,
but did not gain a constitutional majority. The party holds only 43
seats in the parliament. The party's future coalition partner, the
Slovak National Party, gained 14 seats.
	   The combined opposition now has a constitutional majority of 93
seats, enough to enact key legislation and change the constitution
if it manages to agree on a new prime minister and government.
	   Lubomir Andrassy, the spokesman for the Democratic Left, the
second largest opposition party, said earlier Meciar's party had
the right to form the new government. But he said his party will
not enter into a coalition with Meciar.
	   ``It is up to Meciar's party whom they will appoint to form the
new government,'' said Andrassy.
	   The other three opposition parties have made clear they will not
be partners in a coalition with Meciar.

Manila city council votes to ban movies of Hollywood actress Claire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Manila's city council voted 23-3
Tuesday in favor of a resolution banning the movies of Hollywood
actress Claire Danes because of reported statements in which she
disparaged the city.
	   ``She is declared persona non grata. All her films will be
banned,'' said councilor Kim Atienza, the principal sponsor of the
resolution and a son of Manila's mayor.
	   ``We are a very hospitable people, but we cannot accept
irresponsible sweeping statements from irresponsible actresses,''
he said.
	   Danes, who appeared in the movies ``Romeo and Juliet,'' ``Little
Women,'' and ``The Rainmaker,'' was in Manila for several weeks
early this year to shoot scenes for the movie ``Brokedown Palace.''
Most of the sequences shot in Manila were done inside a dilapidated
psychiatric hospital.
	   Atienza earlier said the councilors had dismissed comments Ms.
Danes made in Vogue magazine in April describing Manila as a
``ghastly and weird city'' as ``mere irresponsible statements of
youth.''
	   But the actress went ``overboard'' in a recent interview with
Premiere magazine by saying Manila ``smelled of cockroaches, with
rats all over and that there is no sewerage system and the people
do not have anything _ no arms, no legs, no eyes,'' he said.
	   ``Definitely her statements insult us and make us lose visitors.
That is unacceptable,'' Atienza said.
	   But councilor Julio Logarta, one of the three who voted against
the resolution, said the ban was a curtailment of the freedom of
expression.
	   ``Any visitor to this country can make comments, positive or
negative,'' Logarta said. ``This resolution is in fact abridging
her rights. Most of what she said is true.''
	   Logarta also said the council has no authority to ban movies,
unlike the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board,
which is in charge of rating and approving motion pictures.
	   Ms. Danes' reported comments have also been widely debated in
newspaper columns and editorial pages, with some newspapers
castigating the actress and others saying the city council should
clean up Manila instead of criticizing the remarks.
	   Miss Danes spokeswoman, Cari Ross, said Tuesday that ``Claire's
made her statement and that's that.''
	   In her statement of Sept. 23, Miss Danes said, ``Because of the
subject matter of our film `Brokedown Palace,' the cast was exposed
to the darker and more impoverished places of Manila. My comments
in Premiere magazine only reflect those locations, not my attitude
towards the Filipino people. They were noting but warn, friendly
and supportive. ... I would never want to intentionally insult the
Philippines.''

 &UR; Serbs claim pullouts, Albanians say fighting continues
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rugova comments, 16th graf.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army pulled out of an
area of recent conflict Tuesday, in an apparent move to back up a
government pledge to end to the Kosovo offensive. But Albanians
reported new, large-scale troop deployments and fresh fighting.
	   The pullbacks claimed by the Serbs were in apparent reaction to
NATO's decision to step up plans for airstrikes after repeated
warnings to end its offensive against rebels in the southern Kosovo
province. The majority ethnic Albanian province is part of Serbia,
the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   About 150 military vehicles were seen Tuesday passing through
Caglavica, just south of the provincial capital, Pristina. Tanks
made up at least one-third of the convoy.
	   Serbian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported
three army units were pulled back into Pristina, and similar
withdrawals from recent battlegrounds south of the capital. They
did not say how many troops were withdrawn.
	   Still, beyond the convoy seen at Caglavica, it was unclear
whether a large-scale pullback, as demanded by NATO, had begun, or
if new offensives were in progress, as claimed by the ethnic
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center.
	   Since the Serbian crackdown began in February, hundreds of
people have been killed and an estimated 275,000 driven from their
homes.
	   Diplomats visiting refugees on Monday saw the bodies of 15
ethnic Albanian men, women and children who were shot in the back
of the head at a makeshift camp in a wooded section of the Drenica
region, west of Pristina. The diplomats _ members of a permanent
observer mission to Kosovo _ refused to comment on what they saw at
the massacre site before reporting backs to their governments.
	   Ethnic Albanians said the Serbs carried out the massacre Sunday.
There was no immediate Serb response.
	   Reporters at the scene, a village south of Pristina, Tuesday saw
that two of the bodies had been decapitated. One woman was missing
her foot. Another's stomach was cut up and her head was split in
half.
	   Both sides have been accused of massacres. Serbs have said that
at least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and killed earlier this
month near Glodjane in western Kosovo after they were ``kidnapped
by the terrorists.''
	   Most Kosovo Albanians favor independence and support the Kosovo
Liberation Army's struggle to achieve that goal. But with the
guerrillas no match for much better-armed Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army, they may have no choice but to settle for some sort
of autonomy, as outlined in a U.S.-backed plan promoted by moderate
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the KLA urged the world to act ``more
justly, swiftly and energetically, or the consequences of the
Kosovo war would be reflected in the whole of Balkans and wider.''
The rebels pledged to fight on despite a string of defeats which
have driven them from most of their former strongholds.
	   Serb claims of pullbacks followed Monday's announcement that
government forces had crushed the secessionist Kosovo Liberation
Army after seven months of fighting and that special police units
would be returned to their barracks.
	   Despite the pullback claims, the Kosovo Information Center,
which reflects the views of the moderate Kosovo Albanian
leadership, reported ``heavy'' Serb attacks Tuesday around the
towns of Stimlje and Urosevac, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south
of Pristina.
	   Later, in a separate report, the information center claimed that
200 tanks were seen heading into Kosovo from the rest of Serbia in
the region of Podujevo, north of Pristina. That claim, too, could
not be verified.
	   After meeting diplomats from the U.S. and other western nations
on Tuesday, Rugova called for ``urgent international intervention''
to stop the bloodshed. He said he supported dialogue with the Serbs
but only after the end of the ``brutal Serb offensive.''
	   Diplomatic efforts continued Tuesday to move both sides to agree
on the U.S.-backed autonomy plan and end fighting in the province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met in Belgrade with Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic and later went to Kosovo, for likely
talks with Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders.

	   MOROPEYE, Haiti (AP) _ The stalks of rice are covered in mud,
but the Haitian farmer, naked from the waist up, thrashes them
against a rock in a cloud of dust to dislodge the under-ripe, dirty
_ and precious _ grains.
	   ``We're trying to save what we can,'' said Jean Roberto
Jean-Baptiste, 35, working in the middle of a flooded rice paddy.
``But the harvest is almost lost.''
	   Throughout the Artibonite Valley in central Haiti _ the
breadbasket of a nation that even in good times can't feed itself _
floods unleashed by Hurricane Georges have devastated crops almost
ready for harvest.
	   Haiti is the hemisphere's poorest country, and it can ill afford
a setback like this. Many people are undernourished, per-capita
income is dlrs 250 a year and life expectancy is one of the lowest
in the world _ 57 years.
	   The discovery of more flood victims in Fond Verrettes, about 35
miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Port-au-Prince, pushed the
nation's storm death toll from 87 to 147, the government said
Tuesday. Forty were missing nationwide.
	   All told, at least 370 people were killed in Georges' rampage
through the Caribbean last week, including 210 in the neighboring
Dominican Republic.
	   In the Artibonite village of Jean-Denis, people on dusty roads
used huge cauldrons to boil musty rice to try to make it suitable
for sale. Thousands of subsistence farmers hacked away at their
crops before they could rot.
	   ``There is no more life in this country,'' said Merece
Jean-Francois, 44, a refugee from the destroyed village of Moulet.
``The rice was ready, and the water took it all away.''
	   Heavy rain in the mountains from Hurricane Georges overwhelmed a
hydroelectric dam and sent a wave of water spilling into this
eroded valley. Both the Artibonite River and hundreds of irrigation
canals dug crosswise into the fertile ground soon overran their
banks.
	   Huge stretches of the valley became a lake, leaving thousands
stranded.
	   Yvrose Agustin, 33, said she fled with her husband and six
children on Thursday night when the water rose waist-deep in her
house in the village of Lagranj.
	   ``I only had time to drag the children away,'' she said. ``We
walked for three hours and we couldn't find dry land.''
	   A rescue team from the Red Cross eventually picked the family up
and took them to a shelter in a school in nearby Saint-Marc, where
they receive one meal a day of fried flour.
	   Agustin _ whose house, she believes, was destroyed _ said the
help was only temporary.
	   ``Soon school will open again and they'll leave us on the
street,'' she said. ``I don't know where I'll go. But not to my
village _ I don't have any place to go there.''
	   Red Cross workers conceded they have no way of providing for the
thousands of refugees. In the Saint-Marc school, the wooden table
that served as a medical clinic had a bottle of Advil pain
reliever, a bottle of cough syrup, a bottle of iodine and three
oral rehydration packs.
	   Dieutane Noisy, 24, complained that her 3-year-old daughter
Fijeni had run a high fever since the hurricane.
	   ``We don't have the capacity to give her medical attention,''
Red Cross worker Teofil Maxenne explained to the frantic mother.
``We lack supplies.''
	   Georges did produce a windfall of sorts in one nearby village,
Salifoudret, when it flooded houses but deposited tons of sand on
top of the ready-for-harvest rice fields.
	   Each fall, in the rainy season, sand washes into Salifoudret and
the residents gather it to sell to construction companies for 250
gourdes, or dlrs 16, a truckload.
	   The deposits have never been as big as this year, residents
said, and dozens loaded 150-pound (68-kilogram) baskets of sand on
their heads and sorted it into 6-foot (2-meter) piles along the
riverbed so trucks could cart it away.
	   ``If it weren't for this, we wouldn't be alive,'' said France
Cherilus, 29. ``All our animals are dead, and all the trees are in
the river.''
	   Still, his enthusiasm was muted.
	   ``The sand will be finished soon, and what will we do then?'' he
asked. ``We can't eat sand.''

	   OBRIJA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ They lay scattered on the floor of a
pine forest: 15 men, women and children, or what remained of them.
Some were carved up with knives, limbs hacked off. All had been
shot in the back of the head.
	   Ethnic Albanians say the victims were slaughtered Sunday after a
Serb attack against the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting
for independence for this majority Albanian province. Most were
killed in a makeshift camp in the woods where they were hiding
after Serb troops overran their communities.
	   The killers slit the throat of a 10-year-old boy, blew out his
mother's brains, cut open the stomach of another female relative
and shot a pregnant woman in the head. Two days later, the victims
remained unburied, sprawled in the forest where they died.
	   ``Serb police executed everybody,'' said one trembling elderly
man, who identified himself only as Fazli.
	   As he spoke, the occasional crackle of rifle fire rang through
the valley about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Pristina, the
provincial capital. The thud of two mortar rounds echoed as a Serb
police armored personnel carrier escorted out about a dozen ethnic
Albanian women and children on the back of a trailer drawn by a
tractor.
	   Serb police had no comment on the killings. The day before, KLA
fighters killed seven Serb policeman in the area.
	   The bodies were seen Monday by diplomats from the United States
and other countries who are members of a permanent international
observer mission to Kosovo. They refused to discuss what they saw
before reporting to their governments.
	   But Jack Zetkulic, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy
in Belgrade, said Tuesday he and others touring refugee sites in
Kosovo were shown ``some harrowing photographs'' and a report on
the alleged massacre from the observer group.
	   An estimated 275,000 people have been driven from their houses
by the fighting.
	   Each side has accused the other of killing civilians since
President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Albanian
secessionists seven months ago. Serbs say at least 39 Serbs were
tortured, mutilated and killed near Glodjane earlier this month
after they were kidnapped by ``terrorists.''
	   The U.N. Security Council has demanded an immediate cease-fire,
and NATO has threatened airstrikes if the government ignores the
order.
	   According to friends and relatives of the victims, masked Serbs
in green and blue uniforms descended on this town, which the Serbs
call Obrinje, on the weekend, capturing a man in his 60s.
	   Wielding a knife from the man's own kitchen, the attackers
forced him to take them to where refugees were hiding. The man's
body was found at the edge of the camp. The back of his head was
blown off, his throat was slit and the butcher knife carefully
placed on his chest.
	   In the camp, the attackers shot a man and a woman, both 65 years
old, while they lay in a makeshift tent that had sheltered them
since they fled their home days earlier.
	   Their bodies were spread on the blankets, surrounded by their
blood-spattered clothing, pots and pans. The woman's right foot was
partially cut off and her mouth was gaping open.
	   According to villagers, six women tried to escape with four
children. But the attackers caught up with them in a shallow ditch.
Their bodies were lying in the ditch.
	   The attackers slit the throat of a 10-year-old boy and shot
women and children in the back of the head at point-blank range.
The body of an 18-month-old boy, whom survivors called Valmir, lay
half hidden under that of his 38-year-old mother, who received a
bullet in the back of the head.
	   Valmir's tiny right hand was raised and stiffened in a defensive
posture. His pacifier was still dangling from the dried blood on
his chin.
	   In a house leading up to the refugee camp lay the charred body
of an elderly man, burned with his house and the rest of his
belongings.
	   Two brothers, one 40 years old and the other 55, lay sprawled in
the tracks of a tank that plowed through the woods near the refugee
camp. Attackers shot both of them in the back of the head.

Russia says it's being kept out of decisions on Balkans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia complained Tuesday that it was not invited
to a recent defense ministers' meeting that agreed to establish a
southeast European peace force.
	   It called the decision an attempt to ``limit Russia's
involvement in considering military and political problems in the
Balkan region,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Four NATO countries, including the United States, and five
prospective members agreed in Skopje, Macedonia, on Saturday to
establish a new force to help keep truces and aid relief efforts.
It would not be used for military intervention.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Russia asked
to be invited to the meeting, but was rebuffed.
	   He said that some countries, in seeking NATO membership, were
``drawing new division lines in the southeast of the continent and
in Europe's single security space as a whole.''
	   ``This policy is not conducive to reducing tension in the region
or to creating an atmosphere of neighborly relations and
cooperation, and it runs counter to the world community's efforts
to assure lasting peace and stability in the Balkans,'' he said.

Socialists pick an former student leader as prime minister

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The ruling Socialists on Tuesday chose a
30-year-old former student leader who helped topple the Communists
as Albania's next prime minister.
	   Pandeli Majko, the Socialists' general secretary, was nominated
to replace Fatos Nano, who submitted his resignation on Monday.
	   The law calls for Nano to stay on as caretaker prime minister
until Parliament approves his successor and a new Cabinet. The
Socialists hold 108 of the 155 parliament seats.
	   Nano bowed out after failing to win approval for Cabinet changes
following riots in the capital two weeks ago over the slaying of
opposition lawmaker Azem Hajdari. Former President Sali Berisha
blamed Nano for the killing.
	   Majko's nomination was seen as a significant move to phase out
political leaders associated the hard-line Stalinist regime that
ruled Albania for 46 years.
	   Both Nano and Berisha were Communist party members. But Majko
was a leader of the student movement that helped oust the
Communists in 1990.
	   Majko told reporters that it was time older politicians make
room for the next generation.
	   ``I think that the best support Berisha could give to the new
government would be to open space in his own party to the
generation of young politicians,'' he said.
	   In a statement, Berisha's Democratic Party repeated that Nano's
resignation alone was not enough to end Albania's political crisis.
The Democrats demanded that an interim government comprised of
experts not affiliated with any party take over until new elections
are held.
	   But Berisha later issued a statement calling on Albanians and
public officials to trust the new ``political solutions'' that are
to be drawn up by the new prime minister.
	   ``As the former president, I encourage the Democratic Party and
its allies for a more constructive spirit and a sense of compromise
to take part in a dialogue which is necessary to create a
government with a broader base,'' Berisha said.
	   The former president has been under international pressure to
avoid pushing this impoverished former Communist nation into a
repeat of the nationwide unrest that broke out in 1997 after failed
investment schemes cost many Albanians their life savings.
	   Nano became prime minister last year after his party _ made up
largely of former Communists _ defeated Berisha's Democrats in
parliamentary elections.

<TEXT>
	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ Italian league leader Fiorentina held onto
a 0-0 draw with Hajduk Split Tuesday to squeeze into the second
round of the UEFA Cup.
	   Two goals by Brazilian Edmundo in the first leg for Fiorentina
were enough for the Florence-based side to advance by a 2-1
aggregate.
	   The Italians were content to let Hajduk control the ball, while
defending from a zone wall set up outside shooting range of their
goal and sitting out until the final whistle.
	   However, the Croats looked closer to stealing a winning goal
with several open chances in the early stages of the match. They
were denied either by sloppy finishing or secure goalkeeping by

Taylor seeks investment, promises to boost French language

	   PARIS (AP) _ Liberian President Charles Taylor tried hard to woo
French aid and investment Tuesday, promising to boost the French
language in his civil war-torn country long supported by
Washington.
	   Taylor, on his first trip to the West after he was elected last
year, also promised to sell off state-owned companies in the West
African nation.
	   So far, no trade agreements were announced on the second day of
Taylor's three-day visit.
	   ``For a long time now, Liberia has not benefited from French
investment, and French experience in dealing with Africa and
African issues,'' Taylor told a news conference. ``France's
influence in the Francophone bloc has been admirable, has been
positive.
	   ``We are now going to be putting French as a language on equal
par with English,'' he said, without elaborating. He said that in
November, he will attend France's regular summit with Francophone
African countries.
	   ``With the cultural links that are being established now between
France and Liberia, it is inevitable that French will be spoken in
Liberia as well as English,'' he said.
	   Taylor said his meeting Tuesday with French business leaders was
``very successful'' and would be followed by trade delegations to
Liberia. He said debt talks would begin soon between the French and
Liberian finance ministers.
	   ``There will be many areas of French interest in Liberia, gold
mining, diamond mining, timber, oil, natural gas, or other natural
resources that we have,'' he said.
	   ``Governments have never been good managers,'' he said. ``We
have been talking to French investors about telecommunications --
we want to privatize.'' He also mentioned energy, light, water,
ports, airports.
	   Taylor was in effect offering the French a chance to one-up the
Americans. French officials have grumbled privately, and sometimes
publicly, at U.S. efforts to expand trade ties with former French
colonies in Africa that have maintained cozy ties with Paris.
	   But Taylor's country was also in need of costly reconstruction,
and Paris had yet to announce any new aid for Liberia during the
visit.
	   Asked if he thought his visit to France would be seen by the
Americans as a snub, Taylor said he was ``looking forward to
receive an invitation'' to visit Washington.
	   Liberia's seven-year civil war ended in 1996, leaving an
estimated 200,000 people dead and 600,000 refugees. Fighting broke
out again in recent months with Taylor's rival Roosevelt Johnson,
who took refuge in the U.S. Embassy and was airlifted out of the
country last weekend.
	   Liberia, a nation founded by freed American slaves, was for
years one of the largest U.S. aid recipients. Aid fell during the
civil war, but the United States earmarked about dlrs 48 million
for Liberia last year.

Red Star beats Metz 4-3 in penalty shootout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   METZ, France (AP) _ Red Star Belgrade qualified for the second
round of the UEFA Cup Tuesday, beating Metz on penalties after the
French side had won a thrilling match 2-1 to leave the aggregate
score level at 3-3.
	   Nenad Jestrovic and Danny Boffin missed vital penalties for Metz
as Red Star won the shootout 4-3.
	   Both teams had countless goalscoring chances - and a player sent
off - during a match of countless goalscoring chances that was
interrupted by crowd violence among Red Star supporters.
	   Vinko Marinovic opened the scoring for Red Star in the 18th
minute with a 25 meter (yard) free kick that curled around the
defensive wall and ended up in the net after goalkeeper Lionel
Letizi curiously moved in the wrong direction.
	   The outlook seemed grim for Metz, which has scored one goal in
seven league games this season and was without the injured Bruno
Rodriguez, its top scorer last season.
	   But it equalized before half time when veteran defender Silvain
Kastendeuch struck a spectacular 30-meter shot.
	   In the 52nd minute, Metz's U.S. international David Regis was
sent off for a late tackle on Miodrag Pantelic, but 15 minutes
later Metz went ahead with a penalty.
	   Adilson Dos Santos tripped Franck Rizzetto, and Frederic Meyrieu
slotted in the penalty.
	   Red Star's Goran Drulic was sent off for dangerous play in the
89th minute.
	   Both sides had several good chances to win the game before the
shootout.
	   Red Star goalkeeper Dragoslav Jevric dived brilliantly to his
left to save a 10-meter Meyrieu shot, before Jovan Gojkovic fired
wide in injury time after rounding Letizi.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army pulled out of an
area of recent conflict Tuesday, in an apparent move to back up a
government pledge to end to the Kosovo offensive. But Albanians
reported new, large-scale troop deployments and fresh fighting.
	   The pullbacks claimed by the Serbs were in apparent reaction to
NATO's decision to step up plans for airstrikes after repeated
warnings to end its offensive against rebels in the southern Kosovo
province. The majority ethnic Albanian province is part of Serbia,
the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   About 150 military vehicles were seen Tuesday passing through
Caglavica, just south of the provincial capital, Pristina. Tanks
made up at least one-third of the convoy.
	   Serbian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported
three army units were pulled back into Pristina, and similar
withdrawals from recent battlegrounds south of the capital. They
did not say how many troops were withdrawn.
	   Still, beyond the convoy seen at Caglavica, it was unclear
whether a large-scale pullback, as demanded by NATO, had begun, or
if new offensives were in progress, as claimed by the ethnic
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center.
	   Since the Serbian crackdown began in February, hundreds of
people have been killed and an estimated 275,000 driven from their
homes.
	   Diplomats visiting refugees on Monday saw the bodies of 15
ethnic Albanian men, women and children who were shot in the back
of the head at a makeshift camp in a wooded section of the Drenica
region, west of Pristina. The diplomats _ members of a permanent
observer mission to Kosovo _ refused to comment on what they saw at
the massacre site before reporting backs to their governments.
	   Ethnic Albanians said the Serbs carried out the massacre Sunday.
There was no immediate Serb response.
	   Two of the bodies had been decapitated. One woman was missing
her foot. Another's stomach was cut up and her head was split in
half. The ethnic Albanians said a baby was left alive in a pool of
her dead mother's blood.
	   Both sides have been accused of massacres. Serbs have said that
at least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and killed earlier this
month near Glodjane in western Kosovo after they were ``kidnapped
by the terrorists.''
	   Most Kosovo Albanians favor independence and support the Kosovo
Liberation Army's struggle to achieve that goal. But with the
guerrillas no match for much better-armed Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army, they may have no choice but to settle for some sort
of autonomy, as outlined in a U.S.-backed plan promoted by moderate
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the KLA urged the world to act ``more
justly, swiftly and energetically, or the consequences of the
Kosovo war would be reflected in the whole of Balkans and wider.''
The rebels pledged to fight on despite a string of defeats which
have driven them from most of their former strongholds.
	   Serb claims of pullbacks followed Monday's announcement that
government forces had crushed the secessionist Kosovo Liberation
Army after seven months of fighting and that special police units
would be returned to their barracks.
	   Despite the pullback claims, the Kosovo Information Center,
which reflects the views of the moderate Kosovo Albanian
leadership, reported ``heavy'' Serb attacks Tuesday around the
towns of Stimlje and Urosevac, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south
of Pristina.
	   Later, in a separate report, the information center claimed that
200 tanks were seen heading into Kosovo from the rest of Serbia in
the region of Podujevo, north of Pristina. That claim, too, could
not be verified.
	   After meeting diplomats from the U.S. and other western nations
on Tuesday, Rugova called for ``urgent international intervention''
to stop the bloodshed. He said he supported dialogue with the Serbs
but only after the end of the ``brutal Serb offensive.''
	   Diplomatic efforts continued Tuesday to move both sides to agree
on the U.S.-backed autonomy plan and end fighting in the province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met in Belgrade with Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic and later went to Kosovo, for likely
talks with Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders.

Flamengo seeks relief from crisis against Velez in Copa Mercosur
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Troubled Flamengo is looking for
redemption at the expense of Argentina's Velez Sarsfield in
Wednesday's game for Group D of the Copa Mercosur.
	   A victory over group leader Velez would all but guarantee
Flamengo a spot in the second round and would help disperse the
crisis that is dogging Brazil's most popular team.
	   Flamengo is in second place in Group D with six points, four
behind the leading Velez. Cerro Porteno of Paraguay has four
points, and Argentina's Boca Juniors has three.
	   But Flamengo has been erratic at best all season. The team is in
21st place among the 24 clubs in the national championship and
would be demoted to the second division if the tournament ended
today.
	   New coach Evaristo Macedo debuted this month with a victory over
Cerro Porteno, and fans sighed with relief. But the team is winless
in its last three games, and anxiety again is growing.
	   Flamengo lost to Velez and Boca but has two victories against
Cerro. Velez, meanwhile, has victories against all three rivals,
along with a 2-2 draw with Cerro in Asuncion.
	   With the return of veteran all-stars Romario and Ricardo Rocha,
Flamengo will be at full strength against Velez. Paraguayan
defender Caceres also joined the team, although he is not enrolled
for this phase of the tournament.

Human rights commission criticizes Norway in free speech case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ In a rare slap to Norway, the European Human
Rights Commission on Tuesday said a small newspaper's libel
conviction for harshly criticizing seal-hunters amounted to
suppression of free speech.
	   The commission ordered the case be sent to the European Human
Rights Court.
	   ``This is the first time the commission has found a violation of
free speech in a case against Norway,'' Gro Hillestad Thune, a
Norwegian member of the commission, was quoted as telling the
Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   The north Norway newspaper Bladet Tromsoe was convicted in 1992
of libeling seal-hunters when it published a government inspector's
report on their killing methods, which included bludgeoning seal
pups.
	   The inspector accused the seal-hunters of violating rules.
	   Hunters sued the newspaper for libel and the paper was ordered
to pay 272,000 kroner (dlrs 36,200) to the hunters. Norwegian libel
law says a paper must be able to prove the truth of what it
reports. Many other countries have the more lenient standard that a
plaintiff must be able to prove a report's falsity.

Head of U.N. team to Algeria laments president's departure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The head of the U.N. team which
investigated political violence in Algeria said Tuesday that
President Liamine Zeroual's decision to step down was a setback for
efforts to end six years of killing in the North African country.
	   Mario Soares said Zeroual was inclined toward introducing
political changes in Algeria, where the hard-line military elite
forced the cancellation of 1992 elections that an Islamic party was
set to win. Since then, the military-backed government has been
struggling to quash an Islamic insurgency.
	   ``Zeroual impressed me as being committed to increasing openness
and making the (political) system more humane,'' Soares said in an
interview.
	   Zeroual, a former general elected in 1995 to a five-year term,
announced Sept. 11 that he would call early elections before March.
	   He apparently had lost the confidence of Algeria's military
strongmen.
	   Soares, a former president of Portugal, led the United Nations
panel which visited Algeria in July and August and presented its
report to Secretary-general Kofi Annan two weeks ago.
	   He rejected the claim by Amnesty International that the report
had ``glossed over'' human rights abuses by government forces while
focussing on terrorist atrocities.
	   At least 75,000 people have died in the past six years of
violence.
	   ``We listed evidence of human rights abuses by both sides,''
Soares said.
	   ``But we didn't put them on the same level: the terrorists'
slitting of children's' throats is not the same as torturing
detainees or holding people in prison without charge.''
	   Soares would not respond to allegations that the report
deliberately toned down criticism of the government so as not to
anger the Algerian government which for a long time resisted any
outside investigation into the violence.
	   However, Soares said one of the aims of the report was to ``help
efforts toward reform and greater openness.''
	   ``There is an embryo of the rule of law which is growing and
must be nurtured,'' he said.

Council condemns increased attacks on humanitarian workers,
</HEADLINE>
civilians &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With evidence from Kosovo of a massacre of
refugees as a backdrop, the Security Council on Tuesday condemned a
surge in deliberate attacks on humanitarian workers and civilians
in wars around the world and urged new measures to ensure their
safety.
	   A presidential statement being adopted particularly criticized
the targeting of U.N. personnel working in war zones as a violation
of international law.
	   ``As the number of civilian casualties rises, so too does the
number of workers who have been killed, wounded, kidnapped and
assaulted while trying to carry out their humanitarian tasks,''
Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette told the 15-nation panel
in a special meeting.
	   ``As you are no doubt aware, this year has seen more U.N.
civilians than U.N. military personnel killed in the line of
duty,'' she added.
	   Civilians have been targeted in conflicts in Afghanistan,
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province and the Congo, according to Frechette.
	   ``What is happening to civilians in today's war zones is an
abomination,'' Frechette said. ``Never before have we seen such
widespread and deliberate attacks against people who are massacred
in their homes, have their villages flattened, have their schools
and crops destroyed and are essentially treated as `the enemy.'''
	   The meeting came as evidence mounted in Kosovo of a massacre of
ethnic Albanian refugees in Obrija by Serb forces. The bodies of 15
people, including women and children, were found Tuesday, some
carved up with knives, all shot in the back of the head.
	   Frechette presented a report by Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that summarized the problem and gave a number of recommendations.
	   In his report, Annan urged that the perpetrators of such
violence be brought to justice. He also suggested more attention be
paid to the political, economic and social impact on countries
which receive large refugee populations and that U.N. and other
humanitarian personnel be adequately trained on security procedures
prior to deployment.
	   Austrian Ambassador Ernst Sucharipa, speaking on behalf of the
European Union, urged the swift creation of the new International
Criminal Court, which would have the authority to try crimes
committed against humanitarian personnel.
	   The European Union, the world's largest humanitarian donor,
hopes such practical results will ``put an end to the culture of
impunity which has left such ugly marks in the history of this
century,'' Sucharipa said.
	   The United States said it was developing ``a comprehensive
strategy'' to improve the safety of humanitarian workers. In
addition, U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh called on Annan to
appoint ``a high-level personality'' to investigate and report on
cases of violence against humanitarian workers.
	   The U.S. strategy also would include encouraging stronger
enforcement of existing criminal and humanitarian law prohibiting
such attacks and developing incentives to encourage combatants not
to engage in such attacks.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ After his rival Fatos Nano submitted his
resignation as prime minister, ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday
demanded new elections, but in an apparent concession urged
supporters to cooperate with a new government.
	   The ruling Socialist Party nominated its 30-year-old general
secretary, Pandeli Majko, to replace Nano, who handed in his
resignation to President Rexhep Meidani late Monday.
	   Under Albanian law, Nano remains caretaker prime minister until
Parliament approves his successor and his Cabinet. The Socialists
hold 108 of the 155 seats.
	   Late Tuesday, President Rexhep Mejdani asked Majko to try and
form a new government. Majko was expected to start negotiations
with other parties Wednesday on forming a coalition.
	   Nano acknowledged wanting to eliminate Berisha politically but
accused Berisha of ignoring all rules in his drive for power.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ More than 100 rebels and 112 Sri
Lankan government troops were reported killed in fresh fighting
Tuesday for control of a key road link and two northern towns,
government officials said.
	   Government soldiers resumed their thrust to capture the highway
through Tamil Tiger rebel territory Tuesday. Earlier rebels claimed
to have captured two key government-controlled towns further north
after fierce fighting over the last three days that has killed 739
combatants on both sides.
	   But the government said it still controlled the towns of
Kilinochchi and Paranthan which lie on the northernmost stretch of
a 70 -kilometer (45 mile) highway. The military has been trying to
capture the road for more than a year.
	   More than 100 rebels were killed in fresh fighting near Mankulam
Tuesday, the military said in the statement and sixty two soldiers
were also killed. Another 300 soldiers were wounded. Fifty more
soldiers were killed in fighting near Paranthan.
	   In all, the military said it killed 477 rebels and lost more
than 262 soldiers since Sunday in the heaviest fighting this year.
The fighting took place in an area 245 kilometers (150 miles) north
of Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, and some 35 kilometers (21
miles) south of Kilinochchi.
	   The military claimed other victories.
	   ``Security forces had ... captured the southern and eastern
parts of Mankulam town,'' said the military in a statement.
	   The clandestine Voice of Tigers radio, monitored by civilians in
the northern government-held town of Vavuniya, admitted losing 240
fighters near Kilinochchi and Paranthan, the two towns they claimed
to have captured.
	   Government tanks, artillery and mortars were destroyed, the
statement added.
	   There was no independent confirmation since the government has
barred journalists from visiting the battle zone. The government
imposed censorship in June on war reporting by foreign and local
reporters after fighting escalated in the north.
	   The clandestine radio said rebels were prepared to hand over the
bodies of soldiers to the International Committee of Red Cross.
	   The fighting erupted Sunday when Tamil Tiger rebels attacked
soldiers guarding Kilinochchi and Paranthan, nearly 280 kilometers
(175 miles) north of Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital.
	   Since May last year, government forces have wrested control of
two-thirds of the highway, parts of which are controlled by the
guerrillas. Complete military control would open a land route to
the Jaffna peninsula, a former rebel stronghold in the north that
the army captured two years ago.
	   The government is relying on expensive air and sea deliveries of
food and other commodities to Jaffna's half-million residents in
the absence of a road link.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
widely discriminated by the majority Sinhalese who control the
government and the military.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in the fighting since
1983.

NATO chief in Georgia for talks about Partnership for Peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Solana quotes, two sides talked about Abkhazia. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
discussed Georgia's participation in the Partnership for Peace
program during a two-day visit that began Tuesday.
	   Solana arrived Tuesday afternoon, and was greeted at the Tbilisi
airport by Georgian State Minister Vazha Lordkipanidze, Foreign
Minister Irakly Menagarishvili and Defense Minister David Tevzadze.
	   He met with President Eduard Shevardnadze who said the talks
focused on Georgian participation in the Partnership for Peace
program and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.
	   Georgia is not likely to join NATO anytime in the near future.
Interfax quoted the Georgian ambassador to NATO, Zurab Abashidze,
as saying Georgia is not ready for such a step.
	   Even if it were, ``the factor of Russia, which is very
significant and down-to-earth, would have to be taken into
account,'' he said. Russia is strenuously opposed to former Soviet
republics joining NATO.
	   Solana said he and Shevardnadze also discussed events in
Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia where fighting occurs
frequently.
	   ``Regarding the situation in Abkhazia, I would like to say that
we put our hopes on the Geneva process,'' Solana said, referring to
peace talks being held between Georgian and Abkhazian officials.
``I do hope we will have a result.''
	   Solana was scheduled to leave Georgia on Wednesday for Baku,
Azerbaijan.

Step toward trial of Panamanian ex-leader for money-laundering
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS case sent to court Sept. 11 sted Tuesday, trial
expected in 1999; ADDS background
 &UR; By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French justice officials took a step closer to
trying former Panamian dictator Manuel Noriega for
money-laundering, wrapping up their probe and sending the evidence
to a court, judicial sources said Tuesday.
	   The investigation on Sept. 11 also sent to the Paris
Correctional Court evidence against Noriega's wife Felicidad, who
allegedly bought three apartments in France with the laundered
money, judicial sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   The court is to set a date for a trial, which is not expected
before next year.
	   Noriega, serving a 40-year sentence in a U.S. prison for a drug
trafficking conviction and ineligible for parole before 2016, would
be tried in absentia, the sources said.
	   Mrs. Noriega has faced an international arrest warrant since
November 1996, but her whereabouts were not known.
	   Paris investigative Judge Patrick Fievet launched probe of
Noriega's assets in France after a U.S. invasion in December 1989
toppled the dictator.
	   Noriega, linked to Colombian drug traffickers, is accused of
laundering dlrs 25 million through his bank accounts in France at
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), which closed
its doors in 1991 due to international fraud.
	   But the former Panamanian leader would be prosecuted for only
dlrs 15 million, the amount invested in France between 1988 and
1989. The law under which he is being prosecuted went into effect
in 1988.

Rail workers Union complain of plans to cut more jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -The German rail workers union, GdED,
said Tuesday that employers want to cut 3,500 more jobs and have a
severance pay plan to do so by next March.
	   German railway personnel chief Horst Foehr denied the
allegations, saying he was aware the union was upset over a
previously announced 20,000 job cuts this year, but no additional
reductions were planned.
	   But GdED deputy chairman Norbert Hansen said he was surprised
that the employers planned more cuts, with the newly-elected
government headed by Gerhard Schroeder promising to reduce
unemployment running at nearly 11 percent.
	   ``This is a slap in the face for the future government,'' Hansen
said in a statement. ``They should push for an immediate change of
course by the railway.''
	   According to GdED, at the beginning of 1998 there were 224,000
railway employees, nearly 10 percent less that a year earlier, and
the trend is continuing as the railway tries to slim down to reduce
overhead and debt.

Yugoslav minister insists Kosovo fighting has ended
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Massacre, Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Insisting that fighting in Kosovo has
ended, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic denied Tuesday
reports of new attacks and an impending ``humanitarian
catastrophe'' in the rebellious southern Serb province.
	   ``Fighting is not continuing nor going on,'' he told a news
conference at the United Nations, repeating his government's
announcement Monday that it was withdrawing special police units
because ``terrorist activities have been neutralized.''
	   Serb security forces have carried out a seven-month crackdown
against secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army rebels, whom they call
``terrorists.'' The crackdown against ethnic Albanians has driven
an estimated 275,000 people from their homes.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants.
	   Blaming some members of the media for pushing the idea that a
``humanitarian catastrophe'' is looming in Kosovo, Jovanovic
insisted that humanitarian problems were being ``constructively
resolved'' by the government.
	   ``There is no reason to contemplate any humanitarian
catastrophe,'' he said. ``This is not true, simply because (the)
situation on the ground is quite different than (what is) being
presented in certain media.''
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic declared Monday that government
forces had crushed the KLA, but ethnic Albanian sources reported
new attacks Tuesday around the towns of Stimlje and Urosevac, about
30 kilometers (20 miles) south of the Kosovo capital of Pristina.
	   Asked whether he could be ``100 percent certain'' there was no
fighting in those areas, Jovanovic replied: ``There is no fighting
going on either in the area referred or in any other part of that
Serbian province.''
	   He said the special police units would return to their permanent
barracks ``where they will be staying for some time on alert in the
event of a revival of terrorist provocations or attacks.'' But he
gave no timetable.
	   Army units will remain in Kosovo guarding international borders,
he said.
	   While Jovanovic was adamant that fighting has stopped, he noted
that the fighting in Kosovo wasn't a conventional war involving two
organized armies. ``There has been security forces countering
terrorists and eradicating terrorists,'' he said.
	   NATO recently stepped up plans for airstrikes against Serb
forces after repeated warnings that it would attack unless violence
ends and special police units were withdrawn.
	   Jovanovic said military threats or force would never solve the
political problems in Kosovo and called for ``direct,
unconditional'' dialogue. Ethnic Albanian leaders have refused to
join talks.
	   The foreign minister also urged the international community to
condemn European countries which provide arms, money and training
for ``terrorists,'' singling out Albania.
	   Yugoslavia's seat in the United Nations was withdrawn during the
Bosnian war, so Jovanovic could not speak in the current General
Assembly debate. At the news conference, he called for the speedy
restoration of his country's U.N. privileges.

Head of U.N. team to Algeria laments president's departure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The head of the U.N. team which
investigated political violence in Algeria said Tuesday that
President Liamine Zeroual's decision to step down was a setback for
efforts to end six years of killing in the North African country.
	   Mario Soares said Zeroual was inclined toward introducing
political changes in Algeria, where the hard-line military elite
forced the cancellation of 1992 elections that an Islamic party was
set to win. Since then, the military-backed government has been
struggling to quash an Islamic insurgency.
	   ``Zeroual impressed me as being committed to increasing openness
and making the (political) system more humane,'' Soares said in an
interview.
	   Zeroual, a former general elected in 1995 to a five-year term,
announced Sept. 11 that he would call early elections before March.
He apparently had lost the confidence of Algeria's military
strongmen.
	   Soares, a former president of Portugal, led the United Nations
panel which visited Algeria in July and August and presented its
report to Secretary-general Kofi Annan two weeks ago.
	   He rejected the claim by Amnesty International that the report
had ``glossed over'' human rights abuses by government forces while
focussing on terrorist atrocities.
	   At least 75,000 people have died in the past six years of
violence.
	   ``We listed evidence of human rights abuses by both sides,''
Soares said.
	   ``But we didn't put them on the same level: the terrorists'
slitting of children's' throats is not the same as torturing
detainees or holding people in prison without charge.''
	   Soares would not respond to allegations that the report
deliberately toned down criticism of the government so as not to
anger the Algerian government which for a long time resisted any
outside investigation into the violence.
	   However, Soares said one of the aims of the report was to ``help
efforts toward reform and greater openness.''
	   ``There is an embryo of the rule of law which is growing and
must be nurtured,'' he said.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ After his rival Fatos Nano submitted his
resignation as prime minister, ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday
demanded new elections, but in an apparent concession urged
supporters to cooperate with a new government.
	   The ruling Socialist Party nominated its 30-year-old general
secretary, Pandeli Majko, to replace Nano, who handed in his
resignation to President Rexhep Meidani late Monday.
	   Under Albanian law, Nano remains caretaker prime minister until
Parliament approves his successor and his Cabinet. The Socialists
hold 108 of the 155 seats.
	   Late Tuesday, President Rexhep Mejdani asked Majko to try and
form a new government. Majko was expected to start negotiations
with other parties Wednesday on forming a coalition.
	   Nano acknowledged wanting to eliminate Berisha politically but
accused Berisha of ignoring all rules in his drive for power.

IRA suspect on run in America returns for trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland, BC-NIreland-Omagh Fund &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ An Irish Republican Army suspect faced
charges Tuesday in a Dublin anti-terrorist court _ 15 years after
he went on the run to America.
	   The policeman who arrested Thomas Moyna, 42, testified that the
County Monaghan native had returned home Sunday with hopes of
taking over his father's pub near the border with British-ruled
Northern Ireland.
	   Sgt. James Balfe said he arrested Moyna on Monday when the
fugitive walked into his local police station.
	   Moyna jumped bail and went on the run in 1983 after being
charged with possessing an illegal handgun, holding a farmer
hostage and hijacking his car for use in an IRA mission.
	   Moyna's whereabouts in the United States since then weren't
disclosed to the court.
	   After being charged, Moyna was freed on a bail of 30,000 pounds
(dlrs 45,000) _ 5,000 pounds provided by the accused, 25,000 pounds
by his father _ and ordered to report three times a week to his
local police station until his next court date Nov. 3.
	   Under terms of April's peace accord on Northern Ireland, Moyna
might not have to serve a lengthy sentence if convicted. The accord
specified that imprisoned members of the IRA should be freed by
mid-2000 in recognition of the outlawed group's 1997 cease-fire.

Tyson hearing delayed over missed deadline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with hearing delayed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson's relicensing hearing has been
delayed because he missed a deadline for submitting psychological
reports to Nevada boxing authorities.
	   The hearing had been scheduled for Saturday, but no new date has
been set.
	   The former heavyweight champion's advisers said the tests at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston took too long and doctors
were unable to get the reports together in time for the
commission's 5 p.m. Monday deadline.
	   Dr. Ronald Schouten, head of the team that examined Tyson, sent
a letter to commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem, saying the
reports would be completed Wednesday.
	   ``Unfortunately, due to the length of the evaluation process,
the scoring on the psychological and neuropsychological testing
have not been completed,'' Schouten wrote.
	   Ghanem said he was disappointed the reports were not ready. The
commission is to determine whether Tyson could regain the boxing
license stripped from him for biting Evander Holyfield's ears.
	   ``I don't know what is going on, but it is very disappointing,''
Ghanem said.
	   Tyson's testing took longer than expected, adviser Jeff Wald
said. Tyson began undergoing examination on Wednesday and it was
completed Sunday.
	   ``It takes time to write this up,'' Wald said. ``We can't
dictate to the doctors. They did an incredibly thorough job, and
out of fairness, I don't know why (being late) would be held
against us since we can't control it.''
	   The testing had appeared to be the only obstacle standing in the
way of the commission relicensing Tyson, following a hearing Sept.
19.
	   But Ghanem and commissioner James Nave now say they want to hear
about Tyson's scuffle with two men following a Maryland traffic
accident before they make a decision.

Collymore hits three in Villa triumph; Schalke ousted on penalties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated with later results &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Stan Collymore, who last hit the headlines for
assaulting his TV star girlfriend in a Paris nightclub, marked his
return to big-time soccer with a UEFA Cup hat-trick Tuesday.
	   Collymore fired all three goals as Premier League leader Aston
Villa overpowered Norway's Stromsgodset 3-0 to reach the second
round.
	   A talented but erratic striker whose off-field behavior
infuriates collegues, coaches and fans, the former Nottingham
Forest and Liverpool striker fired Villa into a 2-0 lead by the
23rd minute and added a third in the 64th as John Gregory's team
advanced on a 6-2 aggregate having looked two weeks ago that it was
on the way out.
	   The Villains trailed the Norwegian team 2-0 with only 10 minutes
to go at Villa Park but turned that game around for a 3-2 first leg
victory.
	   On a bitter-sweet night for German teams, Schalke, which won the
title two seasons ago, went out on penalties while Werder Bremen
scored two extra time goals to oust another Norwegian team, Brann.
	   Schalke tumbled 1-0 at Slavia Prague for 1-1 overall and then
lost 5-4 in the penalty shootout when home 'keeper Radek Cerny
fisted out Marco van Hoogdalem's weakly placed spot kick.
	   In Bremen, goals by Raphael Wicky and Andre Wiedener wiped out
Brann's first leg lead before Juri Maximov and Havard Flo hit two
more in four extra time minutes.
	   Christophe Dugarry and Robert Pires each scored twice as
Olympique Marseille overpowered Czech club Sigma Olomouc 4-0 for a
6-2 overall triumph.
	   Red Star Belgrade needed to win a shootout after losing 2-1 at
French club Metz, which had United States World Cup player David
Regis sent off after 52 minutes for a late tackle on Miodrag
Pantelic.
	   The two teams were tied at 3-3 but Red Star gained a 4-3
shootout win after Nenad Jestrovic and Danny Boffin missed vital
penalties for the French runner up, which has scored only one goal
in seven domestic league games this season.
	   Dynamo Moscow survived a late fightback by Latvia's Skonto to
win 3-2 in Riga and advance 5-4 overall, Fiorentina fought out a
tough 0-0 tie with Hadjuk Split in Croatia to advance 2-1 while
Bologna fell behind before scoring a 2-1 home win over Sporting
Lisbon to advance comfortably 4-1.
	   Dutch club Vitesse shared in a 3-3 tie with AEK in Athens but
was already 3-0 ahead from the first leg.

Injury-time winner completes Stuttgart comeback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ VfB Stuttgart staged an amazing
comeback Tuesday, dominating against Feyenoord, winning the game
3-0 and advancing to the second round of the UEFA Cup 4-3 on
aggregate.
	   Fredi Bobic scored the winning goal in the second minute of
injury time after a goalmouth scramble.
	   Feyenoord won impressively 3-1 at Stuttgart two weeks ago but
seemed to have forgotten the attacking flair it showed that night.
	   Bulgarian Krassimir Balakov was the Stuttgart star and struck on
35 minutes with a low shot from the edge of the Feyenoord box which
took a deflection off Bert Konterman.
	   The first half produced point-blank saves from both keepers from
clean-through forwards, with Feyenoord's Jurek Dudek frustrating
Mitko Stojkovski and Marc Ziegler denying Cruz.
	   Feyenoord abandoned attack and tried to sit back on its
aggregate lead but Kristijan Djordjevic's snap-shot made it 2-0 in
the 70th minute and heralded a frantic finale.
	   Minutes later Soldo missed a completely free header from five
yards (meters) and in the last-minute Bobic drove a closs-range
shot against the Feyenoord post.

One dead in southern Mexico flooding

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An unidentified woman died and two other
people were listed as missing Tuesday when the taxi they were
riding in was swept away by flood waters in the Chiapas state
capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez, local media reported.
	   The Pacific coast area of Chiapas was swept by flooding earlier
this month that resulted in the deaths of 185 people, but the
capital, located about 120 miles (195 kilometers) to the north, had
not previously been affected.
	   That changed late Monday, when heavy rains caused the Sabinal
river to overflow its banks in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the television
network Televisa reported.
	   Meanwhile, near Mexico City, television footage showed large
areas of the suburb of Chimalhuacan under hip-deep water, a
situation that has persisted for several days there.
	   Residents waded through the streets of the low-lying suburb in
the State of Mexico or moved about in rowboats. An estimated 1,500
people in the State of Mexico have been affected by flooding which
began over the weekend, the government news agency Notimex
reported.
	   Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas toured hillside
communities hit by mudslides Monday, but officials noted that few
residents have taken advantage of shelters set up to relocate them.
	   Residents of squatters' camps have said they won't leave, for
fear that they won't be allowed to return to their homes.

	   MONACO (AP) _ Monaco eased into the second round of the UEFA Cup
Tuesday, after a goalless draw at home to Lodz gave it a
comfortable 3-1 aggregate victory.
	   Monaco, which reached the last four of the Champions League last
season and has started this season with just one defeat in seven
league games, was rarely threatened by the Polish champion, despite
contesting the match without international stars Fabien Barthez,
Martin Djetou, Sabri Lamouchi and Franck Gava.
	   David Trezeguet and Viktor Ikpeba both came closest to scoring
for Monaco, while stand-in goalkeeper Jean-Marie Aubry was rarely
troubled by the Polish attack.

Serbs claim withdrawals, Albanians new fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Pentagon saying US has no ``credible
evidence'' of major Serb withdrawal; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BEL103,PRI102
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army pulled out of a
southern Kosovo area on Tuesday in an apparent move to back up
government claims of an end to its offensive. But Albanians
reported new, large-scale deployments and fresh fighting.
	   The pullbacks were in apparent reaction to NATO's decision to
step up plans for airstrikes after repeated warnings to Yugoslavia
to stop its onslaught in the southern Kosovo province. The majority
ethnic Albanian province is part of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   About 150 military vehicles were seen passing through Caglavica,
just south of Pristina, from a point farther to the southwest.
Tanks made up at least one-third of the convoy.
	   Serbian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said three
army units _ they did not specify how many troops _ were pulled
back into Pristina, along with similar withdrawals from recently
fought-over regions south of the capital back to the cities of
Prizren and Urosevac.
	   In Washington, however, the Pentagon said it had seen no
evidence that a large-scale pullback _ as demanded by NATO _ had
begun.
	   ``At this point, I think we've got a lot of rhetoric and not
much action,'' Pentagon spokesman Michael Doubleday told reporters
Tuesday. He noted recent statements by Serb officials that the
crackdown was over ``but that is not what we have seen on the
ground.''
	   He said it would take another day or two ``before we can make a
full assessment as to ... whether any of the statements had any
meaning at all.''
	   Since the Serbian crackdown began in February, hundreds of
people have been killed and an estimated 275,000 driven from their
homes.
	   Diplomats visiting refugees on Monday saw the bodies of 15
ethnic Albanian men, women and children who were shot to death at a
makeshift camp in the Drenica region, west of Pristina. The
diplomats _ members of a permanent observer mission to Kosovo _
refused to comment on what they saw before reporting backs to their
governments. Reporters saw the badly mutilated bodies on Tuesday.
	   Ethnic Albanians said the Serbs carried out the massacre Sunday.
There was no immediate Serb response.
	   Both sides have been accused of massacres. Serbs have said that
at least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and killed earlier this
month in western Kosovo.
	   Serb claims of pullbacks followed Monday's announcement that
government forces had crushed the secessionist Kosovo Liberation
Army after seven months of fighting and that special police units
would be returned to their barracks.
	   But the Kosovo Information Center, which reflects the views of
the moderate Kosovo Albanian leadership, reported heavy Serb
attacks Tuesday around Stimlje and Urosevac, towns 30 kilometers
(20 miles) south of Pristina.
	   Later, the information center claimed that 200 tanks were seen
heading into Kosovo from the rest of Serbia in the region of
Podujevo, north of Pristina. That claim, too, could not be
verified.
	   Most Kosovo Albanians favor independence and support the KLA's
struggle to achieve that goal. But with the guerrillas no match for
much better-armed Serbian police and the Yugoslav army, they may
have to settle for some sort of autonomy, as outlined in a
U.S.-backed plan promoted by moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the KLA urged the world to act ``more
justly, swiftly and energetically, or the consequences of the
Kosovo war would be reflected in the whole of Balkans and wider.''
The rebels pledged to fight on despite a string of defeats.

Blair urges politicians to compromise over arms deadlock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 5-6, 8-9 with Trimble, Mallon comments &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday
urged Northern Ireland leaders ``to close their ears to the
prejudices of their own parties'' and enact the Belfast peace
agreement in full.
	   Addressing the annual conference of his Labor Party, Blair
didn't explore in detail the difficulties confronting April's
accord on how Protestants and Catholics should jointly govern
Northern Ireland.
	   But in a series of meetings Wednesday, Blair expected to tackle
the key issues dividing David Trimble, the Protestant leader of the
still-unformed government; Seamus Mallon, Trimble's moderate
Catholic deputy; and Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn
Fein party.
	   Adams wants two posts for Sinn Fein in a new multi-party
administration for Northern Ireland, which is supposed to be led by
Trimble and Mallon. But Trimble is insisting that the Irish
Republican Army start disarming first as proof that its
14-month-old truce is sincere.
	   ``It is important that we have a genuine peace, not a sham,''
Trimble said during a debate on the fringes of the Labor Party
conference.
	   ``I hope and believe we will manage to overcome this problem,''
he said in reference to the confrontation over IRA disarmament. ``I
remain fundamentally optimistic about this process we are engaged
in.''
	   April's agreement among eight parties _ including Trimble's
Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein _ called for the IRA and the
province's outlawed pro-British paramilitary groups to disarm under
international supervision by mid-2000. But it set no deadline for
the process to start.
	   Appearing at the same debate, Mallon implicitly criticized both
Trimble and Adams, who was scheduled to speak at a different event
at the conference in Blackpool, an English coastal resort.
	   Mallon complained that Trimble and Adams had allowed IRA
weaponry to become ``a running sore'' in the peacemaking effort and
warned: ``Until we can draw the poison from this issue, it is going
to continue to put this agreement in instability.''
	   In his speech, Blair said the ``vast decent majority of people
in Northern Ireland'' wanted compromise but required ``people to
lead them.''
	   He said those on the side of peace included Trimble and Mallon.
To applause he added, ``And yes it takes people like Gerry Adams,
David Ervine and Gary McMichael, too.''
	   Ervine and McMichael lead parties linked with the two major
pro-British paramilitary groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force and
Ulster Defense Association, which in 1994 halted their campaign of
killing Catholics. Like the IRA, the UDA and UVF have refused to
start disarming.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ An Irish Republican Army suspect faced
charges Tuesday in a Dublin anti-terrorist court _ 15 years after
he went on the run to America.
	   The policeman who arrested Thomas Moyna, 42, testified that the
County Monaghan native had returned home Sunday with hopes of
taking over his father's pub near the border with British-ruled
Northern Ireland.
	   Sgt. James Balfe said he arrested Moyna on Monday when the
fugitive walked into his local police station.
	   Moyna jumped bail and went on the run in 1983 after being
charged with possessing an illegal handgun, holding a farmer
hostage and hijacking his car for use in an IRA mission.
	   Moyna's whereabouts in the United States since then weren't
disclosed to the court.
	   After being charged, Moyna was freed on a bail of 30,000 pounds
(dlrs 45,000) _ 5,000 pounds provided by the accused, 25,000 pounds
by his father _ and ordered to report three times a week to his
local police station until his next court date Nov. 3.
	   Under terms of April's peace accord on Northern Ireland, Moyna
might not have to serve a lengthy sentence if convicted. The accord
specified that imprisoned members of the IRA should be freed by
mid-2000 in recognition of the outlawed group's 1997 cease-fire.

	   OBRIJA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ They lay scattered on the floor of a
pine forest: 15 men, women and children, or what remained of them.
Some were carved up with knives, limbs hacked off. All had been
shot in the back of the head.
	   Ethnic Albanians say the victims were slaughtered Sunday after a
Serb attack against the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting
for independence for this majority Albanian province. Most were
killed in a makeshift camp in the woods where they were hiding
after Serb troops overran their communities.
	   The killers slit the throat of a 10-year-old boy, blew out his
mother's brains, cut open the stomach of another female relative
and shot a pregnant woman in the head. Two days later, the victims
remained unburied, sprawled in the forest where they died.
	   ``Serb police executed everybody,'' said one trembling elderly
man, who identified himself only as Fazli.
	   As he spoke, the occasional crackle of rifle fire rang through
the valley about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Pristina, the
provincial capital. The thud of two mortar rounds echoed as a Serb
police armored personnel carrier escorted out about a dozen ethnic
Albanian women and children on the back of a trailer drawn by a
tractor.
	   Serb police had no comment on the killings, and there was no
mention of them in Serb media. The day before, KLA fighters killed
seven Serb policeman in the area.
	   The bodies were seen Monday by diplomats from the United States
and other countries who are members of a permanent international
observer mission to Kosovo. They refused to discuss what they saw
before reporting to their governments.
	   But Jack Zetkulic, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy
in Belgrade, said Tuesday he and others touring refugee sites in
Kosovo were shown ``some harrowing photographs'' and a report on
the alleged massacre from the observer group.
	   An estimated 275,000 people have been driven from their houses
by the fighting.
	   Each side has accused the other of killing civilians since
President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Albanian
secessionists seven months ago. Serbs say at least 39 Serbs were
tortured, mutilated and killed near Glodjane earlier this month
after they were kidnapped by ``terrorists.''
	   The U.N. Security Council has demanded an immediate cease-fire,
and NATO has threatened airstrikes if the government ignores the
order.
	   According to friends and relatives of the victims, masked Serbs
in green and blue uniforms descended on this town, which the Serbs
call Obrinje, on the weekend, capturing a man in his 60s.
	   Wielding a knife from the man's own kitchen, the attackers
forced him to take them to where refugees were hiding. The man's
body was found at the edge of the camp. The back of his head was
blown off, his throat was slit and the butcher knife carefully
placed on his chest.
	   In the camp, the attackers shot a man and a woman, both 65 years
old, while they lay in a makeshift tent that had sheltered them
since they fled their home days earlier.
	   Their bodies were spread on the blankets, surrounded by their
blood-spattered clothing, pots and pans. The woman's right foot was
partially cut off and her mouth was gaping open.
	   According to villagers, six women tried to escape with four
children. But the attackers caught up with them in a shallow ditch.
Their bodies were lying in the ditch.
	   The attackers slit the throat of a 10-year-old boy and shot
women and children in the back of the head at point-blank range.
The body of an 18-month-old boy, whom survivors called Valmir, lay
half-hidden under that of his 38-year-old mother, who received a
bullet in the back of the head.
	   Valmir's minute right hand was raised and stiffened in a
defensive posture. His pacifier was still dangling from the dried
blood on his chin.
	   In a house leading to the refugee camp lay the charred body of
an elderly man, burned with his house and the rest of his
belongings.
	   Two brothers, one 40 years old and the other 55, lay sprawled in
the tracks of a tank that plowed through the woods near the refugee
camp. Attackers shot both of them in the back of the head.

Sudan pushes for mission to investigate U.S. bombing site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States has no reason to oppose
a fact-finding mission to a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant it bombed
last month if it is certain that deadly chemical agents were being
produced there, Sudan's foreign minister said on Tuesday.
	   Mustafa Osman Ismail also said the United States must compensate
Sudan for cost of the plant he said used to produce more than 50
percent of his country's medicines.
	   ``We wonder why the Americans are opposing the sending of a
fact-finding mission if they are so sure of their own findings,''
Ismail said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly.
	   The United States has said a U.N. investigation is unnecessary
because U.S. intelligence showed the El Shifa plant produced
chemical weapons. U.S. officials have cited a soil sample taken
from the grounds of the complex that they say contained Empta, a
precursor chemical for the deadly nerve agent VX.
	   The United States also says the plant had ties to Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi dissident accused of masterminding the bombing of
two U.S. embassies in Africa last month.
	   The Security Council held preliminary discussions Monday on an
Arab-sponsored draft resolution demanding a U.N. investigation into
U.S. claims that the El Shifa plant was making chemical weapons.
	   Since the Aug. 20 attack, U.S. officials have been briefing
Security Council members about the evidence they say they had to
justify the bombing.
	   ``The soil is there. The remnants and rubble of the factory are
there. The fact-finding mission can easily collect samples from the
soil,'' Ismail said.
	   He said it was the duty of the Security Council to dispatch a
team to investigate the truth.
	   ``We want back our factory, which we built with our toil and
sweat, and which cost us millions of dollars,'' Ismail said. ``We
need the medicines, of which the people were deprived as a result
of the American attack.''
	   Sudan requested an investigation into the U.S. claims
immediately after the attack, but the council shelved the matter
after initial discussions.
	   Arab ambassadors launched the resolution earlier this month
after the Arab League condemned the bombing as an ``act of
aggression against Sudan, a dangerous violation of its sovereignty
and territory, and a violation of international law.''

	   ROME (AP) _ Young Italian striker Marco Del Vecchio headed in a
second-half game winner for AS Roma against Silkeborg to lift the
Roman team into the second round of the UEFA Cup on a 3-0
aggregate.
	   The 1-0 home victory at Rome's Olympic stadium Tuesday night
added to Roma's 2-0 win on the road in the first round first leg of
the European competition.
	   Del Vecchio, who had scored two goals in a league match last
Saturday, tallied the only goal of the second leg in the 53rd
minute.
	   The forward dived to head in from 9 meters (yards) a perfect
pass from teammate Francesco Totti.
	   Roma, which fielded several reserve players as its qualification
appeared certain following the first leg victory, struggled and
produced a few scoring chances against the lower-ranked Danish
team.
	   Silkeborg players strongly protested the referee decision to
annul a goal by Henrik Pedersen in the first half.

UNHCR chief term extended for two years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly agreed Tuesday to
extend the term of the top U.N. refugee official for another two
years, a vote of confidence for Sadako Ogata in the face of
allegations her agency is losing millions of dollars because of
mismanagement.
	   The 71-year-old Japanese native has headed the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees since 1991. Her position will be extended
by two years _ until Dec. 31, 2000.
	   In a statement, Ogata said she will continue to do her best ``to
protect and assist the world's most vulnerable people.''
	   The London-based Financial Times in July accused the UNHCR of
incompetent management, dubious accounting and possibly fraud. It
said an independent audit showed the problems were costing the
refugee agency millions of dollars.
	   The UNHCR has a dlrs 1 billion annual budget.
	   Ogata emerged relatively unscathed from the mismanagement
allegations, but said she didn't want to be considered for another
five-year term. She agreed to a shorter term, which was backed by
the U.N. chief.
	   At the start of the General Assembly meeting, Deputy Japanese
Ambassador Yukio Takasu noted Ogata's leadership and ``remarkable
contribution that UNHCR has been making in assistance and
protection all over the world and in pursuance of durable solutions
for the refugee issue.''
	   Gideon Kayinamura, ambassador of Rwanda, said he added
``Africa's voice in appreciation of Ogata'' who has played a
tremendous role in alleviating the suffering of refugees in Africa,
especially in the Great Lakes region.
	   Ion Botnaru, ambassador of Moldolva, commended Ogata ``for her
dedication and commitment to defend and promote the fundamental

UEFA Cup: Liverpool wins 5-0, advances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Fired by three goals in three minutes,
Liverpool overpowered Kosice 5-0 Tuesday to advance to the second
round of the UEFA Cup on a 8-0 aggregate.
	   Jamie Redknapp and Robbie Fowler each netted twice and the other
goal came from Paul Ince as Liverpool outplayed its Slovak opponent
at Anfield.
	   Already cruising from the first leg 3-0 victory, Liverpool
wasted a chance to add another goal when Fowler's weakly-hit 16th
minute penalty was saved by goalkeeper Ladislav Molnar.
	   But Redknapp netted the first goal of the night in the 23rd with
a 25-meter (yard) shot from a neatly-worked free kick.
	   The Kosice defence cracked again early in the second half and
Liverpool took full advantage with three goals in three minutes.
	   Fowler failed to turn home Redknapp's left-wing cross but Ince,
two minutes after he had been shown the yellow card for a late
tackle, slid home the second goal.
	   A minute later Fowler made no mistake with a header from Stig
Inge Bjornebye's leftwing cross and then Redknapp fired the fourth
from 25 meters.
	   Kosice suffered a further blow when defender Marek Spilar was
shown the red card for pulling bck Michael Owen to stop the England
striker chasing a through ball.
	   Liverpool was strolling into the second round when Fowler added
his second goal of the match.

Beinlich shot lifts Leverkusen past Udinese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) _ Stefan Beinlich's perfectly placed
77th minute shot Tuesday lifted Bayer Leverkusen past Udinese
Calcio 1-0 and into the second round of the UEFA Cup.
	   In the fast-paced second leg match, Leverkusen advanced 2-1 on
aggregrate against Udinese, the second-place Serie A team, in one
of the best matchups of the competition's first round.
	   Udinese, which has tough luck with the draw, fell to Ajax
Amsterdam last season in the first round and this time came up
short against the tough-nosed German club, a Champions League
quarterfinalist last season.
	   Beinlich blasted a straight-ahead shot just inches inside the
left post after the team's big Dutch striker, Erik Meijer, dropped
a header off a long downfield pass at his feet.
	   But Udinese, desperately seeking a goal after a 1-1 home draw in
the opening leg, had a last chance by Brazilian striker Amaroso in
the 79th minute.
	   Amaroso, who has five goals in three Serie A matches, outraced
the Leverkusen defenders down the left side, but his sharply angled
roller missed right by inches.
	   Leverkusen, which sent scouts to Udinese eight times, kept
Amaroso contained and defused the free kicks of Johan Walem, who
had scored the equalizer that way in the opening leg.
	   Leverkusen's players, fighting for every ball, were slapped with
numerous yellow cards as they kept Udinese without an away win in
the team's UEFA Cup history.

minute Tuesday, giving Atletico Madrid a 1-0 victory against Obilic
Belgrade in a UEFA Cup first-round second-leg match Tuesday.
	   Madrid advanced 3-0 on aggregate.
	   After Kiko scored for Atletico on a free kick from the left his
goal spurred the Spaniards into attacking for most of the second
half.
	   In the first half, both teams were tentative and testing each
other, with Obilic missing two clear shots.
	   Dragan Sarac hit the Spanish goal post in the 31st minute and
Sasa Kovacevic failed to score when facing goalie Francisko Molina
alone from seven meters in the 42nd minute.
	   Reserve keeper Pedro Jaro replaced Molina inside the net for
Atletico after he was red-carded for fouling Nenad Grozdic outside
the penalty zone in the 57th minute.
	   Some 10,000 fans watched the match at Belgrade's Partizan
stadium.

Saudi Arabia not optimistic about peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Mideast peace process is on a
``dead-end road,'' Saudi Arabia's deputy foreign minister said on
Tuesday, putting the blame on Israel.
	   Nizar Madani, told the U.N. General Assembly that the
international community and the United States must salvage the
peace process by forcing Israel to live up to its obligations to
the Arabs.
	   He accused Israel of continuing to build settlements on Arab
land, and refusing to live up to the principle of returning
occupied Arab territory in exchange for peace.
	   ``Such practices have landed the peace process on a dead-end
road,'' Madani said. ``The behavior of the Israeli government does
not make us optimistic about the possibility of achieving peace.''
	   He said that if Israel was serious about peace, it must stop
building Jewish settlements in and around Jerusalem, and agree to
restart negotiations with Syria and Lebanon.
	   Madani, whose government hosted the U.S.-led coalition that
drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait eight years ago, also said that
Iraq must be made to live up to all Security Council resolutions
calling for it to give its weapons of mass destruction.
	   He said that the Iraqi government alone was to blame for the
suffering of its people because it refused to live up to
obligations that would help lift U.N. sanctions imposed after
Baghdad's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Madani noted the recent improvement of Saudi relations with
Iran, and said that Gulf Arab nations looked forward to even better
ties once Iran resolves a dispute over three Gulf islands with the
United Arab Emirates.
	   Nizar said his government deplored ``efforts to make Afghanistan
a haven for sheltering and training of terrorists, which can only
bring further calamities to the Afghani people.''
	   Earlier this month Saudi Arabia, one of the few countries that
supports the Taliban, downgraded ties with the hard-line militia
that rules nearly all of Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban said that was apparently because they were harboring
Osama bin Laden. The Saudi dissident is wanted by American
authorities on suspicion of directing attacks on U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania last month. The blasts killed 259 people and
wounded thousands.

Red Sox batter Indians 11-3 in playoff opener
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED with Yankees-Rangers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Mo Vaughn homered twice and tied a recond with
seven RBIs as Boston ended a 13-game postseason skid, beating
Cleveland 11-3 Tuesday in their American League playoff opener.
	   Nomar Garciaparra hit a three-run shot and Pedro Martinez
pitched seven innings as Boston ended a slide that began on Oct.
25, 1986, when Mookie Wilson's grounder to first rolled through
Bill Buckner's legs at Shea Stadium.
	   That forced a World Series Game 7 the Red Sox lost to the New
York Mets, and Boston _ which hasn't won the Series since 1918 _
was swept by Oakland in 1988 and '90, and then Cleveland in 1995.
	   This year's Red Sox insist that the past is just that, and
they're not cursed by Babe Ruth's ghost or any other demons. And
with Boston's trio of stars doing most of the damage, the Indians
and 45,815 at Jacobs Field may believe them.
	   Vaughn _ fittingly a first baseman _ ended his own streak of
playoff failure in the first inning with a three-run homer off
Jaret Wright, sending Cleveland on to its worst loss in 55
postseason games. Vaughn had gone 0-for-14 with seven strikeouts in
the 1995 Indians sweep.
	   After Garciaparra's three-run homer pushed the lead to 6-0 in
the fifth, Vaughn connected for a two-run shot in the sixth off
Doug Jones, becoming the first Boston player to hit two homers in a
postseason game since Rico Petrocelli in the 1967 World Series.
	   Vaughn then delivered a two-run double in the eighth off Jim
Poole to set a career-high for RBIs and tie Edgar Martinez's record
for RBIs in a postseason game.
	   Kenny Lofton hit a two-run homer and Jim Thome had a solo shot
for the Indians, who with Wright taking the mound were hoping to
recapture some of the magic that carried them to Game 7 of the
World Series last year.

Stuttgart in stunning comeback; Collymore hits three in Villa
</HEADLINE>
triumph; Schalke ousted on penalties &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later results &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ VfB Stuttgart made one of the greatest comebacks
in UEFA Cup history Tuesday, scoring a 3-0 victory over Feyenoord
in Rotterdam to overturn the Dutch club's 3-1 first leg lead.
	   German international striker Fredi Bobic scored the winning goal
in the second minute of injury time after a goalmouth scramble to
put his team into the second round.
	   The dramatic ending came after strikes by Bulgarian star
Krassimir Balakov and Kristijan Djordjevic had wiped out the
two-goal advantage Feyenoord had earned in Stuttgart.
	   On a bitter-sweet night for German teams, Schalke, which won the
title two seasons ago, went out on penalties, Werder Bremen scored
two extra time goals to oust another Norwegian team, Brann, and
Bayer Leverkusen downed one of the tough Italian clubs, Udinese,
1-0.
	   Schalke tumbled 1-0 at Slavia Prague for 1-1 overall and then
lost 5-4 in the penalty shootout when home 'keeper Radek Cerny
fisted out Marco van Hoogdalem's weakly placed spot kick.
	   In Bremen, goals by Raphael Wicky and Andre Wiedener wiped out
Brann's first leg lead before Juri Maximov and Havard Flo hit two
more in four extra time minutes.
	   Stefan Beinlich fired Bayer Levekusen's game-clinching goal
after 77 minutes against Udinese in one of the best matchups of the
first round. The two teams had tied 1-1 in Italy.
	   Stan Collymore, who last hit the headlines for assaulting his TV
star girlfriend in a Paris nightclub, marked his return to big-time
soccer with a UEFA Cup hat-trick.
	   Collymore fired all three goals as Premier League leader Aston
Villa overpowered Norway's Stromsgodset 3-0 to reach the second
round.
	   A talented but erratic striker whose off-field behavior
infuriates collegues, coaches and fans, the former Nottingham
Forest and Liverpool striker fired Villa into a 2-0 lead by the
23rd minute and added a third in the 64th as John Gregory's team
advanced on a 6-2 aggregate having looked two weeks ago that it was
on the way out.
	   The Villains trailed the Norwegian team 2-0 with only 10 minutes
to go at Villa Park but turned that game around for a 3-2 first leg
victory.
	   Jamie Redknapp and Robbie Fowler both scored twice as Liverpool,
already 3-0 up from the away leg, crushed Slovakia's Kosice 5-0 at
Anfield for an 8-0 overall triumph. Paul Ince added the other.
	   French midfielder Alain Boghossian netted the clincher for Parma
as the Italian club overturned 1-0 Fenerbahce's first leg advantage
to win 3-1 on the night and 3-2 overall.
	   The Turkish team had hit back from two goals down to reply
through Elvir Balic. That away goal could have proved crucial until
Alain Boghossian hit a third for Parma with 18 minutes to go.
	   Red Star Belgrade needed to win a shootout after losing 2-1 at
French club Metz, which had United States World Cup player David
Regis sent off after 52 minutes for a late tackle on Miodrag
Pantelic.
	   The two teams were tied at 3-3 but Red Star gained a 4-3
shootout win after Nenad Jestrovic and Danny Boffin missed vital
penalties for the French runner up, which has scored only one goal
in seven domestic league games this season.
	   Monaco, which gained the semifinal of the Champions Cup last
season, eased into the second round of the UEFA Cup with a 0-0 tie
with Poland's Lodz having already won the first leg 3-1.
	   Dynamo Moscow survived a late fightback by Latvia's Skonto to
win 3-2 in Riga and advance 5-4 overall, Fiorentina fought out a
tough 0-0 tie with Hadjuk Split in Croatia to advance 2-1 while
Bologna fell behind before scoring a 2-1 home win over Sporting
Lisbon to advance comfortably 4-1.
	   Dutch club Vitesse shared in a 3-3 tie with AEK in Athens but
was already 3-0 ahead from the first leg.
	   Christophe Dugarry and Robert Pires each scored twice as
Olympique Marseille overpowered Czech club Sigma Olomouc 4-0 for a
6-2 overall triumph.

Britain retains top ranking for foreign exchange trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALLY JACOBSEN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Britain remains the world's premier center for
foreign exchange trading, retaining a strong lead over the United
States, Japan, Singapore and Germany.
	   With volume averaging dlrs 637 billion a day, foreign exchange
trading in Britain easily surpasses the dlrs 351 billion of the
United States, according to a series of surveys released Tuesday by
global central banks.
	   Japan ranks third, with daily volume of dlrs 149 billion,
followed closely by Singapore at dlrs 139 billion. Germany
estimated trading is more than dlrs 100 billion.
	   The surveys by 44 countries will almost certainly show overall
trading in foreign currencies has soared since the dlrs 1.26
trillion tallied in the last global accounting in 1995. The final
1998 count is expected to be released late next month by the Bank
for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.
	   With the rapid growth of world financial markets, foreign
exchange trading has surged. In 1989, the global daily average was
dlrs 620 billion. It grew to dlrs 880 billion three years later.
Part of this year's increase may be due to the larger number of
countries surveyed. Twenty-six were included in the 1992 and 1995
rankings.
	   In its tally, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that
foreign exchange transactions in the United States shot up 43
percent this year, from dlrs 244 billion in 1995. The annual growth
rate was 13 percent, the same as in 1995.
	   ``The overall trends in the foreign exchange market are steady
growth compared to three years ago,'' said John Kambhu, assistant
vice president of the New York Fed, which acts as the agent for
U.S. monetary authorities in carrying out currency trades in the
open market.
	   The dollar was the most widely traded currency in the United
States, with dlrs 315 billion transactions a day in the greenback.
The German currency, the mark, was second at dlrs 122 billion, with
the Japanese yen at dlrs 86 billion.
	   Trading in the British pound averaged dlrs 36 billion a day, and
the Swiss franc, dlrs 31 billion. European Union currencies,
excluding the pound, the mark and the French franc, accounted for
dlrs 41 billion worth of trading.
	   Trading in currencies of smaller European Union nations and
developing countries expanded at a faster clip than the overall
market. Kambhu suggested the increase reflected the nations growing
importance in the world economy.
	   The survey also found the type of transactions in the foreign
exchange market has changed, with more complicated instruments for
hedging risks gaining popularity.
	   Trading in the foreign exchange swap market doubled to dlrs 166
billion a day in the 1998 survey, accounting for 47 percent of the
total. Foreign exchange swaps involve a commitment to exchange two
currencies at a certain rate on a date in the future. Spot
transactions _ the single purchase or sale of a currency for
immediate delivery _ accounted for 42 percent of the total, down
from 55 percent of the total in 1995.
	   The survey also found a sharp increase in trading in foreign
exchange and interest rate derivatives, again instruments used by
investors, businesses and others to try to cushion their risks in
volatile financial markets. The value of a derivative is derived
from an underlying asset, such as a currency, stock or commodity.
	   It said transactions in those instruments jumped 75 percent to
dlrs 91 billion a day in 1998, from dlrs 52 billion three years
ago.
	   Trading was heaviest, averaging dlrs 32 billion a day, in
foreign exchange options, which give holders the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell currencies within a certain time at a
certain price. Interest rate swaps, currency-trading agreements
related to interest rates, amounted to dlrs 31 billion.
	   The survey also found that electronic brokerage, involving
automatically matching orders for foreign exchange trading, grew
threefold to dlrs 47 billion a day in 1998. Electronic trading is
mostly in the spot market.
	   The foreign exchange survey in the United States was conducted
in April of 93 dealers, including banks, and nine brokers.

 &UR; Mrs. Clinton tours Hurricane Georges damage in Puerto Rico &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Mrs. Clinton's visit to temporary
shelter &QL; 
 &UR; By CAROLYN SKORNECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUQUILLO, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton flew by
helicopter Tuesday through the ravines and over the mountains of
Puerto Rico to survey the damage wrought by Hurricane Georges.
	   ``I saw the destroyed houses, I saw the destroyed crops, I saw
the effects of the mudslides and the rivers'' overflowing the
bounds, Mrs. Clinton said. ``I saw how damaging the hurricane was
because it went across the entire island.''
	   The first lady, accompanied by a congressional delegation and
administration officials, flew to Puerto Rico on the first leg of a
trip taking her to Chile and Uruguay.
	   Georges killed four people in Puerto Rico and caused dlrs 2
billion in damage. Water and power were cut off for days for most
of the 3.8 million residents. More than 17,000 people left homeless
by the storm were being housed in 232 shelters.
	   In the town of Luquillo on the northeastern coast, Mrs. Clinton
visited a school turned into a temporary shelter and announced
steps the federal government was taking to help Puerto Rico, a U.S.
commonwealth.
	   Starting Tuesday, for instance, the government will be shipping
200,000 to 300,000 gallons of water to the island daily. Mrs.
Clinton also announced Puerto Rico will be reimbursed 75 percent of
the cost of rebuilding the island's infrastructure, including
roads, water filtration systems and municipal facilities.
	   And the Labor Department will be offering up to dlrs 30 million
for temporary jobs in rebuilding the island.
	   Gov. Pedro Rosello thanked Mrs. Clinton for the administration's
quick response. ``We have not had from any president more help than
from President Clinton,'' he said.
	   Clinton has already declared Puerto Rico a disaster area, making
it eligible for hundreds of millions of dollars in federal disaster
aid.
	   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who announced up to dlrs 39
million in emergency grants last week to repair damage to public
housing in Puerto Rico, was among the administration officials on
this trip. They and the congressional delegation were later going
to the Dominican Republic and Haiti, two other Caribbean nations
badly damaged by Georges.
	   After Puerto Rico, Mrs. Clinton was heading to Santiago, Chile,
for the Eighth Conference of Wives of Chiefs of State and
Government of the Americas. After that, she was flying to
Montevideo, Uruguay, for a Vital Voices conference, a U.S. foreign
policy initiative focusing on lifting women's political and
economic roles, expected to draw about 400 women from across the
hemisphere.

	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ A hat trick from Ivan Perez helped Real
Betis of Spain trounce Danish club Vejle 5-0 in the first round
second leg of the UEFA Cup _ a stylish way to dismiss the threat of
a humiliating exit from the competition.
	   Perez scored his first goal with just two minutes gone and his
second 20 minutes later.
	   After the break it was Nigerian international Finidi George''s
turn to take the score to 3-0 in the 71st minute. Two minutes later
Jose Galvez added another.
	   Just for good measure Perez scored his third goal sealing the
final 5-0 score just before the final whistle blew.
	   Betis had gone into the match suffering under the pressure of a
1-0 defeat from the first leg against the humble Danish club.
	   Team morale was also straining from a dismal start to its
national league season in which Betis has yet to win a match.

	   VIENNA, Austria _ Lassina Diabate's long-distance goal with
three minutes to play Tuesday helped Girondins Bordeaux beat Rapid
Vienna 2-1 to advance into the second round of the UEFA Cup.
	   Bordeaux, the French first division leader, advanced 3-2 on
aggregrate after drawing 1-1 in the first leg at home.
	   Diabete, a defender, surprised the Austrians with his late score
in a match that seemed to be headed into extra periods. Both teams
failed to convert numerous chances in a lively second half.
	   Bordeaux took a 1-0 lead on Herve Alicarte's 28th free kick that
was deflected past the Austrian defenders by his teammate, Ali
Benarbia.
	   Although the French club dominated the match, Vienna struck back
in the 42nd minute for the equalizer when Rene Wagner volleyed the
ball in on a cross by Arnold Wetl.
	   An estimated 25,000 spectators watched the match.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army pulled out of an
area of recent conflict Tuesday, in an apparent move to back up a
government pledge to end to the Kosovo offensive. But Albanians
reported new, large-scale troop deployments and fresh fighting.
	   The pullbacks claimed by the Serbs were in apparent reaction to
NATO's decision to step up plans for airstrikes after repeated
warnings to end its offensive against rebels in the southern Kosovo
province. The majority ethnic Albanian province is part of Serbia,
the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   About 150 military vehicles were seen Tuesday passing through
Caglavica, just south of the provincial capital, Pristina. Tanks
made up at least one-third of the convoy.
	   Serbian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported
three army units were pulled back into Pristina, and similar
withdrawals from recent battlegrounds south of the capital. They
did not say how many troops were withdrawn.
	   In Washington, however, the Pentagon said it had seen no
evidence that a large-scale pullback _ as demanded by NATO _ had
begun.
	   ``At this point, I think we've got a lot of rhetoric and not
much action,'' said Pentagon spokesman Michael Doubleday. He noted
recent statements by Serb officials that the crackdown was over
``but that is not what we have seen on the ground.''
	   He said it would take another day or two ``before we can make a
full assessment as to ... whether any of the statements had any
meaning at all.''

Astronomers detect massive burst of energy from new type of star
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Billion billion in 1st and 9th grafs are correct &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A burst of radiation from a distant star
smashed into the Earth's upper atmosphere last month with enough
energy to power civilization for a billion billion years,
astronomers say.
	   The immense wave of energy, the most powerful ever recorded from
beyond the sun, caused at least two satellites to shut down
briefly, but it reached the Earth's surface at a strength equal
only to a typical, single dental X-ray.
	   ``We've been monitoring things like this for 30 years and we've
never seen anything like this before,'' Kevin Hurley, a research
physicist at the University of California, Berkeley, said Tuesday
at a NASA news conference.
	   The burst of gamma and X-ray radiation struck the Earth over the
Pacific Ocean at night on Aug. 27 and was so powerful that it
temporarily ionized the upper atmosphere just as the sun does in
the daytime, said Hurley.
	   Seven scientific satellites, five in orbit of the Earth, one
approaching an asteroid far beyond, and one near the orbit of
Jupiter, all detected the massive eruption. Hurley said the burst
was so intense that two of the satellites were forced to shut down
to protect their electronics.
	   However, the energy was largely absorbed by the upper atmosphere
and only a minuscule amount of radiation reached the Earth's
surface. It posed no hazard to life, Hurley said.
	   The eruption came from a neutron star, called SGR1900+14, in the
constellation Aquila some 20,000 light years away. A neutron star
is the collapsed core left after a massive star explodes. A light
year is about 6 trillion miles (9.5 trillion kilometers).
	   Astronomers said it is extremely rare for such a distant stellar
explosion to have any effect on Earth, attesting to the immensity
of the energy release.
	   They estimated that the energy, if captured and put to use,
could power all of the Earth's energy needs for a billion billion
years _ that is one billion periods of one billion years.
	   ``In this five-minute-long flash we saw as much energy as there
will be coming from the sun for the next 300 years,'' said Hurley.
``If we could harness this energy we would have enough power to
power every city, every village, every light bulb until the end of
the universe and far beyond.''
	   The source star already was being studied because it is one of
four known members of a class of stellar objects called ``soft
gamma ray repeaters.'' These are neutron stars that put out steady
flashes of gamma rays.
	   But the extreme energy burst last month also suggests the object
is a magnetar, a weird type of star first suggested by
astrophysicists Robert Duncan of the University of Texas, Austin,
and Christopher Thompson of the University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill.
	   The dramatic proof of the star's existence, said Cornell
University astronomer Jim Cordes, ``is a triumph for theoretical
astrophysics.''
	   Duncan said at the news conference that magnetars are rapidly
spinning neutron stars that have created a magnetic field far
greater than any other known.
	   He said the magnetic field around the star is so powerful that
from more than 100,000 miles (160,000 kilometers) away ``it could
erase the magnetic strip on your credit card and suck the keys out
of your pocket.''
	   Duncan said the energy burst probably occurred when the magnetic
field ripped apart the one-mile (1.6-kilometer) thick metal crust
of the star, releasing an immense eruption of X-rays and gamma
rays. This radiation is not optically visible, but it can be
detected by instruments on satellites.
	   Magnetars are extremely dense objects, containing one and a half
times the mass of the sun in an area just 12 miles (20 kilometers)
across, he said.
	   ``A tablespoon of material from this star would weigh as much as
an aircraft carrier,'' said Duncan.
	   Approaching a magnetars would not be healthy, the astronomer
noted.
	   X-rays erupting from the star would kill from a distance. As one
got closer, there would be lethal levels of electrons and
anti-electrons, in addition to immense heat.
	   It is not, said Duncan, ``a good place to go.''

Another legal tangle for Don King
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Heavyweight contender Hasim Rahman and promoter
Cedric Kushner are together again, while promoter Don King appears
to be out dlrs 100,000 and much more if Kushner gets his way.
	   Kushner announced Tuesday he is suing King for damages in excess
of dlrs 12 million in a suit that charges King induced Rahman to
pull out of a Sept. 26 bout against David Tua.
	   The fight was to have been televised by HBO as a preliminary to
Lennox Lewis' WBC heavyweight title victory over Zejlko Mavrovic.
	   The suit was filed Monday in federal court.
	   Kushner contends he has an exclusive contract with Rahman. He
said he found out Rahman signed with King when Rahman pulled out of
the Tua match.
	   ``The question is whether or not King paid him dlrs 100,000 to
break his contract and not fight Tua,'' said Richard Edlin,
attorney for Cedric Kushner Promotions.
	   Rahman said King gave him the money.
	   Haleem Ali, Rahman's uncle, said he talked with King on Monday
and was told, ``If Rahman messes with him he could fix it so he
wouldn't be able to fight (for a title).''
	   ``He said he controlled the ranking,'' Rahman said.
	   Of his return to Kushner, Rahman, ranked No. 3 by the IBF, said:
``I feel as if a load is off my shoulders and I'm ready to fight. I
know I made a mistake and I'm trying to correct it and go on with
my career.''
	   In July, King was acquitted of insurance fraud charges. He had
been accused of cheating Lloyd's of London of dlrs 350,000 in
training expenses for a canceled 1991 bout.

Campos returns to Mexico; Logan happy with league's progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Flamboyant Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos
returned to UNAM Pumas in his native country on Tuesday, leaving
Chicago with Dusty Hudock of the second-division Seattle Sounders
as the Fire's reserve keeper entering the Major League Soccer
Playoffs.
	   MLS deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati, speaking during a
conference call along with commissioner Doug Logan, made the
announcement saying the situation was unique and that Chicago
expected Campos to return to the Fire next spring.
	   ``It was a situation where Jorge wasn't playing every game; he
was not the first choice goalkeeper,'' Gulati said.
	   Campos' contract is owned by MLS with a clause that allows him
to return to play in Mexico when the U.S. league is not in season.
Because of his lengthy absence at the beginning of the season due
to World Cup commitments, Zach Thornton assumed the starter's job
and finished with a league-leading 1.17 goals against average in 25
games.
	   ``Pumas requested that (Campos) return early because they had
one injury and one lengthy suspension,'' Gulati said. ``After
talking with Jorge and the Fire, we decided to allow him to leave
early.''
	   Gulati said the league has a unique relationship with the
Mexican league and that a gesture of good will could result in an
accommodation to MLS later.
	   The decision sparked the Fire to call up Hudock, a reserve for
the Colorado Rapids in 1996 and played the last two seasons with
the Sounders.
	   It was one of a number of issues discussed by Logan and Gulati.
	   With the league's third regular season just completed on Sunday,
Logan noted the league's drop in average attendance from 16,416
last year to 14,312 this season, but pointed to an increase in
total fans to 2,747,897, due overwhelmingly to the two expansion
franchises in Miami and Chicago.
	   ``We think this is very healthy, that in our third year of
existence some would argue that we're fifth, sixth, seventh in the
world in attendance,'' Logan said. ``We think we're fifth behind
the leagues of England, Italy, Germany and Spain, which have been
in existence for significantly longer periods of time.''
	   Logan admitted problem areas such as Tampa Bay, where a deal to
play in the recently opened Raymond James Stadium has not been
reached. MLS officials are looking for a portion of concessions and
parking, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the gridiron National
Football League reportedly get the first dlrs 2 million from
non-Buccaneer events.
	   The Mutiny were 10th in the 12-team league in attendance with an
average of 10,312 fans per game and a possible move of the team has
been considered.
	   Rochester, New York, whose Raging Rhinos franchise drew 11,498
in the second-division A-League has been mentioned as the most
likely new home if a lease cannot be negotiated.
	   Logan said expansion is not expected before the 2000 season with
Philadelphia, Houston, Rochester, and second teams in Southern
California and New York ``in the mix.''

Chad troops join Kabila's war, other countries to follow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Soldiers from Chad have joined forces
from at least three other African states aiding President Laurent
Kabila in his nearly two-month long war against rebel insurgents,
Congo's Information Minister said Tuesday.
	   And troops from other countries will soon follow, Didier Mumengi
said.
	   Mumengi told The Associated Press that Chadian troops had
recently joined their ``brothers'' fighting rebels bidding to oust
Kabila from power in Africa's third largest country.
	   Although he did give details, other unconfirmed reports said
1,000 Chadian soldiers had been dispatched.
	   They join forces from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia which were
recruited by Kabila within weeks after the rebel war began in early
August. Sudan has denied allegations of intervening on Kabila's
behalf.
	   Uganda and Rwanda, which helped Kabila's own rise to power in a
rebel war last year, have refuted government accusations that they
are masterminding the latest uprising. Yet Uganda maintains troops
in rebel-held areas of eastern Congo under earlier border
agreements penned with Kabila's government and Rwanda has
repeatedly threatened to enter the fray to protect its own
security.
	   Burundi has also been accused of aiding the insurgents.
	   Mumengi said Chad was the first of a number of West and Central
African countries which had agreed at a summit in Gabon's capital
of Libreville last week to create an ``inter-African force to
maintain peace'' within Congo.
	   ``Chad has contributed to the cause according to the resolutions
made in Libreville,'' Mumengi said.
	   The summit was held without the rebels or their supposed allies.
Other participants besides the hosts Gabon were: Equatorial Guinea,
Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo and Angola.
	   The rebels, a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters and other
opponents of Kabila, have accused the president of corruption and
ethnic warmongering.
	   Zimbabwean soldiers killed at least 20 rebels recently in mop-up
operations on Congo's southern border with Angola, Zimbabwean
Contingency Operations commander Lt. Col. Moyo reportedly told
Zimbabwe's state radio Tuesday.
	   No Zimbabweans were killed in the operation, Moyo said.
	   The rebels have largely been driven out of western Congo, where
they had made remarkable gains in advancing to the edge of the
capital of Kinshasa soon after the revolt began. A swath of
territory in the east, bordering Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi,
remains in rebel hands.

Rodal's coach investigated for sexual misconduct
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KRISTIAN KAHRS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ After 800-meter runner Vebjorn Rodal fired
his coach Kjell Arve Husby Monday, police started an investigation
against Husby for sexual misconduct Tuesday.
	   Husby has allegedly sexually harassed young female track
athletes.
	   ``On basis of a report from the sheriff of Oppdal (300 miles
north of Oslo), we have found reason to start an investigation
against Husby,'' police commissioner in Trondelag police district
Per Morten Schjetne told TV station TV2.
	   After a long time of rumors, Husby is happy an investigation has
started.
	   ``Excellent. This is the best way to get all facts on the table,
and we can get rid of all the rumors and speculations,'' Husby's
lawyer Morten Kjensli told news agency NTB.
	   Now Husby says he wants to sue Rodal. ``A ten year friendship
and cooperation ended on the mobile phone. At the moment I'm heavy,
shocked and beaten. I'm out of power, and I'm totally exhausted,''
Husby told news paper Verdens Gang Tuesday.
	   Ten members of the local track club, Oppdal quit in protest
against Husby's behavior, and since Saturday, Husby has had no
positions in Oppdal Track Club.
	   Eight of these athletes - six women and two men - have written a
letter to the club with strong criticism of Husby. They accused him
of unacceptable behavior against young athletes.
	   Board member Morten Boe took the accusations seriously. ``We
have chosen to take the athletes seriously, and we have released
Husby from all positions in Oppdal Track Club. Still, the decision
was not taken on basis of rumors,'' he told Verdens Gang.
	   Husby has followed Rodal to many successes on the field: Second
in the European Athletics Championship in 1994, third in the World
Championship in 1995 and gold in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.
	   ``We have had no problems in our relationship, but the new
information has made it problematic. This is a tough day, but
hopefully also the end of a difficult time,'' said Rodal who
informed Husby personally Monday.
	   Still, Rodal still considers Husby a friend.
	   ``What we said is between me and him. He has been a creative and
skilled coach to me, also on the interpersonal level,'' Rodal said,
but he would not comment on a possible new cooperation between them
in the future.
	   Husby himself did not comment, but his lawyer, Morten Kjensli,
said that Husby was very disappointed that Rodal did not wait a
couple of days to get the complete picture.
	   Husby will give his version of the story Wednesday.

Kenya urges stronger fight against terrorism, children in war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Kenya's foreign minister condemned the
recent U.S. embassy bombings in his country and neighboring
Tanzania and reiterated calls Tuesday for international cooperation
to end terrorism.
	   ``The bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam brought mayhem and
terror of an untold magnitude to two countries, which hitherto
considered themselves secure and far removed from threats and
dangers posed by acts of terrorism,'' Bonaya Adhi Godana told the
U.N. General Assembly.
	   On Aug. 7, two bombs exploded almost simultaneously in the U.S.
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. A total
of 259 people were killed, 248 of them in Nairobi.
	   ``Terrorist acts are by design ruthlessly indiscriminate and the
bomb blast in Nairobi which occurred at one of the busiest
locations in terms of human traffic and commercial activities was
no exception,'' Godana said.
	   ``These two incidents not only make it abundantly clear that
nobody is safe and unaffected by these heinous acts, but also
exemplifies the expanding reach and growing menace of the
perpetrators of terrorist acts,'' he said.
	   In his speech, Godana also urged other countries to respect
international laws that forbid the use of children as soldiers or
gunrunners in conflicts.
	   ``This is matter of particular interest to Africa, where there
are horrifying accounts of atrocities to which children are
subjected or in which they participate,'' he said.

Gauze, zebra stripes, citrus colors: London's new fashion tips
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with newcomer Groves' fashion show
 &UR; With AP Photos
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wisps of muslin, gauze and parachute silk. Zebra
stripes, fuchsia and searing citrus. Gray. Sequins. Cashmere
cardigans, crochet, clogs. Long skirts, square necklines,
asymmetric cuts.
	   Fashion followers, take note: These are the hot features for the
spring and summer of 1999, according to the designers who staged
shows during London Fashion Week, which ended Tuesday.
	   ``It's all about a certain woman, and that woman is brave and
adventurous and ... very beautiful, very sexy,'' enthused Vivienne
Westwood, the eccentric doyenne of British fashion, whose Red Label
designs included flirty ruched skirts in fuchsia and plum tartan,
and wide purple camouflage trousers, enlivened with orchids and
feathers.
	   Hilary Alexander, fashion editor of The Daily Telegraph,
characterized the overall look as ``slouch chic; sophisticated
simplicity in a riot of color.''
	   ``Skirts may be long and full, but they float around the calves
or ankles,'' she wrote. ``T-shirts and tunics are tweaked and
tucked at the neck, bust or waist to ripple round the curves; coats
and jackets are cut open at the seams to fly out over the dress
beneath.''
	   More than 50 designers held catwalk shows _ the most ever _ and
another 140 exhibited shoes, bags and other fashion accessories at
the Natural History Museum, home of London Fashion Week.
	   The hottest tickets were for Westwood; Alexander McQueen, now at
Givenchy; Hussein Chalayan, and a raft of bright young things,
including Matthew Williamson, Anthony Symonds and Andrew Groves,
who once sent a cocoon-shaped dress down the catwalk infested with
live flies.
	   Celebrities like ``Posh Spice'' Victoria Adams and Simply Red
singer Mick Hucknall came by to see top models, including Jodie
Kidd, Honor Fraser and Helena Christensen, lured out of retirement
for Williamson's show.
	   Elizabeth Jagger, the 14-year-old daughter of Rolling Stone Mick
Jagger and American model Jerry Hall, closed Westwood's show in a
flowing fuchsia dress with a giant orchid in her hair as she
pretended to play an accordion. Earlier, she strutted in a tailored
tartan outfit, teamed with ripped tights and platform boots.
	   Keeping with the avant garde, Groves paraded a sheath dress of
razor blades at the event's closing show Tuesday night. Titled
Cocaine Nights, his collection was inspired by the John Woo
thriller Face/Off, about an FBI agent who loses his identity to a
criminal. It was turned into a hit movie starring John Travolta and
Nicholas Cage.
	   The first models burst onto the ramp wearing flesh-colored masks
over their eyes and mouths; gauze, webbing and more conventional
materials were twisted into open jackets, tabard dresses were held
together with rope belts.

Confederation Cup to be played in Mexico City, Guadalajara
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's two biggest cities will play host to
the upcoming Confederations Cup, the soccer's world governing body
FIFA announced Tuesday.
	   The eight-nation competition will be held in Mexico City's
Azteca Stadium and Guadalajara's Jalisco stadium January 8-20.
	   Guadalajara was chosen over other cities such as Monterrey and
Queretaro because Jalisco Stadium seats 70,000 _ compared to
Monterrey's 55,000-seater _ a spokesman for the Mexican Soccer
Federation said. Azteca holds 114,000 people.
	   National teams competing at the tournament include the United
States, Mexico, Bolivia, Brazil, France, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, as
well as the winner of the Oceania Nations Cup, still being played
in Australia.
	   FIFA President Joseph Blatter will arrive in Mexico on Saturday
to supervise Sunday's tournament draw.
	   Earlier this month, the heads of several soccer associations
said they were unhappy with FIFA's decision to hold the tournament
in January _ when leagues in the southern hemisphere are in full
swing and those in Europe are off.
	   With clubs required to release players for their national teams,
many squads are left without their stars for league competition.
	   Two weeks ago, Australian soccer coach Raul Blanco urged
European teams not to field second-string sides at next year's
Confederations Cup despite it being scheduled in the northern
hemisphere's off-season.
	   Blanco said it's possible that European nations may not send
full-strength teams to Mexico if the tournament is held in January.

Canada picks German veteran as new national soccer coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Holger Osieck, a longtime coach who helped
Germany win the 1990 World Cup as an assistant, is the new coach of
the Canadian men's soccer team.
	   Osieck, 50, was appointed Tuesday to the positions of national
team head coach and technical director. He replaces Bob Lenarduzzi,
who resigned in November in the wake of Canada's failure to qualify
for the World Cup finals in France.
	   ``I firmly believe that we have made the very best choice,''
said Jim Fleming, president of the Canadian Soccer Association.
``He was our first choice and I'm excited about our future
possibilities with Mr. Osieck at the helm.''
	   Fleming received close to 100 applications from around the world
for the top soccer coaching job in Canada.
	   He settled on Osieck, who was an assistant to Franz Beckenbauer
at the 1990 World Cup in Italy.
	   Osieck was a defender as a player and briefly played for the
Vancouver Whitecaps in 1977. While in Canada that year, he also
served as an assistant coach of Canada's World Cup team.
	   He has been a full-time coach since 1979, spending the last
eight years coaching at the club level in France, Germany, Turkey
and Japan.
	   Osieck will spend the next two or three months in Europe
scouting Canadian players and is due to move to Canada by the end
of the year.

Iraq sounds positive note in meeting with nonaligned council
</HEADLINE>
members &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout to UPDATE with Tuesday's meeting. TRIMS
outdated material. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A day after defiantly telling reporters
that Iraq would not back down from its decision to stop cooperating
with U.N. arms inspectors, Iraq's deputy prime minister sounded a
more conciliatory note in a meeting Tuesday with Security Council
members, diplomats said.
	   Tariq Aziz met with the nonaligned caucus of the 15-member
council, which includes Bahrain, Gambia, Gabon and Kenya, among
others.
	   During the meeting, Aziz indicated a willingness to find a
solution to the impasse, sparked Aug. 5 when Iraq announced it was
halting cooperation with weapons inspectors. The decision has
halted searches because U.N. weapons experts must be accompanied by
Iraqi escorts.
	   Aziz indicated nothing was closed for negotiation, diplomats
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The tone contrasted sharply with Aziz's statements to reporters
and television crews on Monday after his first meeting on the
impasse with Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   He told journalists that Iraq would make no concessions. But
U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was
less defiant in his meeting with Annan, who stressed that Iraq must
rescind its Aug. 5 decision if it wants to have a ``comprehensive
review'' of sanctions and Baghdad's compliance with resolutions.
	   Such a review could force the council to recognize Iraq's
progress over seven years to dismantle its proscribed weapons
programs and could increase pressure for some easing of sanctions.
	   Inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, must
certify Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles and chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programs before the council will
lift sanctions that were imposed after Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait in 1990.

Taliban are Pakistani mercenaries, says Afghan official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The nominal Afghan government, which has a
seat at the United Nations but has lost control of the country to
the hard-line Taliban militia, accused Pakistan on Tuesday of
turning Afghanistan into a center for drugs and terrorism.
	   ``Let us make it clear once again here that the Taliban are
Pakistani mercenaries,'' said Abdullah, addressing the U.N. General
Assembly in his capacity as the deputy foreign minister of his
deposed government. Like many Afghans, he goes by one name.
	   Abdullah, whose own government was once backed by Pakistan, said
that the Taliban was the creation of the Pakistani military
intelligence service, ISI.
	   ``Three major concerns _ namely terrorism, drugs and violation
of human rights _ are originating from the Taliban-held areas of
Afghanistan, yet instigated from across the border'' in Pakistan,
Abdullah said.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the force behind the Taliban,
which ousted the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani from
Kabul in September 1996.
	   It now controls nearly all of Afghanistan and rules according to
its own strict interpretation of Islam, banning girls from school
and women from work.
	   ``The alarming situation in Afghanistan requires a definitive
action by the Security Council, and it is time that the presence of
28,000 armed Pakistanis in Afghanistan must be dealt with,''
Abdullah said.
	   Pakistan denies supporting the Taliban, or having forces in
Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ VfB Stuttgart made one of the greatest comebacks
in UEFA Cup history Tuesday, scoring a 3-0 victory over Feyenoord
in Rotterdam to overturn the Dutch club's 3-1 first leg lead.
	   German international striker Fredi Bobic scored the winning goal
in the second minute of injury time after a goalmouth scramble to
put his team into the second round.
	   The dramatic ending came after strikes by Bulgarian star
Krassimir Balakov and Kristijan Djordjevic had wiped out the
two-goal advantage Feyenoord had earned in Stuttgart.
	   ``Stuttgart played excellently,'' admitted Rotterdam coach Leo
Beenhakker. ``In the away match, we had our best season
performance, today our worst. We tried to forget the 3-1 in
Stuttgart _ obviously we didn't succeed.''
	   On a bitter-sweet night for German teams, Schalke, which won the
title two seasons ago, went out on penalties, Werder Bremen scored
two extra time goals to oust another Norwegian team, Brann, and
Bayer Leverkusen downed one of the tough Italian clubs, Udinese,
1-0.
	   Schalke tumbled 1-0 at Slavia Prague for 1-1 overall and then
lost 5-4 in the penalty shootout when home 'keeper Radek Cerny
fisted out Marco van Hoogdalem's weakly placed spot kick.
	   In Bremen, goals by Raphael Wicky and Andre Wiedener wiped out
Brann's first leg lead before Juri Maximov and Havard Flo hit two
more in four extra time minutes.
	   Stefan Beinlich fired Bayer Levekusen's game-clinching goal
after 77 minutes against Udinese in one of the best matchups of the
first round. The two teams had tied 1-1 in Italy.
	   Stan Collymore, who last hit the headlines for assaulting his TV
star girlfriend in a Paris nightclub, marked his return to big-time
soccer with a UEFA Cup hat-trick.
	   Collymore fired all three goals as Premier League leader Aston
Villa overpowered Norway's Stromsgodset 3-0 to reach the second
round.
	   A talented but erratic striker whose off-field behavior
infuriates collegues, coaches and fans, the former Nottingham
Forest and Liverpool striker fired Villa into a 2-0 lead by the
23rd minute and added a third in the 64th as John Gregory's team
advanced on a 6-2 aggregate having looked two weeks ago that it was
on the way out.
	   The Villains trailed the Norwegian team 2-0 with only 10 minutes
to go at Villa Park but turned that game around for a 3-2 first leg
victory.
	   Jamie Redknapp and Robbie Fowler both scored twice as Liverpool,
already 3-0 up from the away leg, crushed Slovakia's Kosice 5-0 at
Anfield for an 8-0 overall triumph. Paul Ince added the other.
	   Leeds tumbled 1-0 at Portugal's Maritimo to lose its first leg
advantage but triumphed 4-1 in a penalty shootout. Blackburn held
Lyon to a 2-2 tie in France but went out having lost the home leg
1-0.
	   French midfielder Alain Boghossian netted the clincher for Parma
as the Italian club overturned 1-0 Fenerbahce's first leg advantage
to win 3-1 on the night and 3-2 overall.
	   The Turkish team had hit back from two goals down to reply
through Elvir Balic. That away goal could have proved crucial until
Alain Boghossian hit a third for Parma with 18 minutes to go.
	   Red Star Belgrade needed to win a shootout after losing 2-1 at
French club Metz, which had United States World Cup player David
Regis sent off after 52 minutes for a late tackle on Miodrag
Pantelic.
	   The two teams were tied at 3-3 but Red Star gained a 4-3
shootout win after Nenad Jestrovic and Danny Boffin missed vital
penalties for the French runner up, which has scored only one goal
in seven domestic league games this season.
	   Monaco, which gained the semifinal of the Champions Cup last
season, eased into the second round of the UEFA Cup with a 0-0 tie
with Poland's Lodz having already won the first leg 3-1.
	   Dynamo Moscow survived a late fightback by Latvia's Skonto to
win 3-2 in Riga and advance 5-4 overall, Fiorentina fought out a
tough 0-0 tie with Hadjuk Split in Croatia to advance 2-1 while
Bologna fell behind before scoring a 2-1 home win over Sporting
Lisbon to advance comfortably 4-1.
	   Dutch club Vitesse shared in a 3-3 tie with AEK in Athens but
was already 3-0 ahead from the first leg.
	   Christophe Dugarry and Robert Pires each scored twice as
Olympique Marseille overpowered Czech club Sigma Olomouc 4-0 for a
6-2 overall triumph.
	   Bulgarian star Luboslav Penev scored three of Celta Viga's goals
in a 7-0 crushing of Romania's Arges as the Spanish club went
through 8-0 overall.
	   And Ivan Perez hit three for Real Betis in a 5-0 trouncing of
Danish club Vejle which had led 1-0 from the first leg. Nigerian
star Finidi George scored another of the Betis goals.
	   Valencia was another Spanish club to make it to the second round
after a 3-0 victory over Steaua Bucharest. Three second half goals
made it 7-3 overall for Valencia.

Sao Paulo, Cruzeiro meet in Mercosur Cup's tightest race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Playoff races don't get much closer
than this.
	   Leader Cruzeiro and last-place Sao Paulo are dead even in the
standings as they prepare to do battle Wednesday in a game for
Group A of the Mercosur Cup.
	   Both have six points, with two wins and two losses. So do
Argentina's San Lorenzo, in second place, and Chile's Colo Colo, in
third. All that separates them is goal difference.
	   Yet Cruzeiro is on an upward swing, following an uneven start
this season in the tournament and in the Brazilian national
championship.
	   Led by all-star forwards Muller and Fabio Junior, Cruzeiro has
climbed to 11th place in the Brazilian first-division race. Against
Mercosur rivals, the team has a win and a loss against Sao Lorenzo,
a big 5-1 victory over Sao Paulo and a loss to Colo Colo.
	   Sao Paulo, meanwhile, is struggling. After a brilliant campaign
to win the grueling Sao Paulo state crown, the team lost its leader
and playmaker Rai with a broken leg.
	   Since then, the team has looked listless and confused, slipping
to 12th place in the Brazilian championship. After last Saturday's
0-0 tie with Flamengo, Sao Paulo fired coach Nelsinho and replaced
him with former all-star forward Mario Sergio.
	   In the Mercosur Cup, Sao Paulo also is 1-1 against San Lorenzo,
with a win over Colo Colo and a loss to Cruzeiro.
	   Sao Paulo welcomes a return to the friendly confines of Morumbi
stadium. The home field has been a blessing so far in Group A _ in
eight games, the home team has won every time.
	   However, Sao Paulo will be missing injured midfielder Souza and
also Rogerio Pinheiro and Edmilson, who were suspended.

Padres edge Astros 2-1 in opener
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ In a brilliant performance that would be expected
more from Randy Johnson, San Diego's Kevin Brown struck out 16 and
allowed just two hits in eight innings Tuesday, leading the Padres
to a 2-1 victory over the Houston Astros in the opener of the
best-of-5 National League division series.
	   Brown's strikeouts were the most ever in division series play
and just one short of the Bob Gibson's postseason-record 17 in 1968
World Series.
	   Brown's previous high was 11, which he did three times in his
final 11 regular-season starts.
	   Johnson had been practically untouchable at home, going 5-0 _
the first four wins were shutouts _ since the Astros acquired him
from the Seattle Mariners on July 31.
	   Trevor Hoffman, who tied the NL record this season with 53
saves, allowed the unearned run on two hits in the ninth.
	   Bill Spiers led off with a double, and two outs later, Moises
Alou hit an infield single that third baseman Ken Caminiti stopped,
but threw well wide of first to allow the run to score.
	   San Diego's offense had struggled all September, but had nine
hits in eight innings off the powerful left-hander to give Brown
his first victory in five starts. And with the NL Central champion
Astros flailing at Brown's hard, moving pitches, the Padres won a
postseason game for the first time since 1984.
	   Greg Vaughn, who hit his 50th homer in his final regular-season
at-bat Sunday night, homered leading off the eighth and Jim Leyritz
hit a sacrifice fly in the sixth inning to score Tony Gwynn, the
only player left from San Diego's 1984 World Series team.
	   Brown, 18-7 during the regular season, beat Atlanta's Greg
Maddux and Tom Glavine in last year's NL championship series while
with Florida, and now has added Johnson to his list.

Earthquake rattles Belgrade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An earthquake shook Belgrade and
other parts of Yugoslavia early Wednesday, shutting off electricity
temporarily, rattling buildings and sending frightened residents
into the streets.
	   There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries and first
reports said damage was slight.
	   Officials said the quake, which struck about 12:15 a.m. (2215
Tuesday GMT) was centered near Cacak about 85 kilometers (53 miles)
south of Belgrade.
	   It measured 8 on the Mercalli Scale at the center and 5 in
Belgrade, officials said.
	   Callers to Belgrade radio stations asked whether NATO had
attacked. The Alliance has threatened possible military action
unless the government halts its crackdown of ethnic Albanian
separatists in the southern province of Kosovo.

Furyk's shot is the winner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUCKER'S TOWN, Bermuda (AP) _ Jim Furyk knocked a 3-iron 10 feet
(3 meters) from the hole in a sudden-death closest to the pin
three-way playoff, lifting his team to victory in the dlrs 1.8
million Gillette Tour Challenge Championship Tuesday.
	   After using a 5-wood during his round and rolling the ball to
the back of the green, Furyk switched clubs before the playoff at
the par-3, 203-yard (185-meter) 17th hole at the Mid Ocean Club.
	   ``Earlier I was caught up between 3-iron and 5-wood,'' said
Furyk, who is winless this year on the PGA Tour. ``I figured this
time I would go in with a hard 3-iron and I liked it right after it
left the club.''
	   After checking with Tour officials, Furyk went into the locker
room and took out his old 3-iron to replace the new 3-iron he had
been carrying.
	   ``I knew exactly how it would fly,'' Furyk said of why he got
his old club. ``I wasn't sure what the new 3-iron would do.''
	   Furyk, Lee Trevino and Michelle McGann finished at 11-under 60
on the hilly, oceanfront layout.
	   The winning team split the dlrs 450,000 first-place prize in the
unusual one-day event that teams one player from the PGA and Senior
PGA Tours and one from the LPGA playing a best-ball format.
	   Payne Stewart was next closest on the playoff, putting his shot
to about 13 feet (4 meters) of the hole.
	   Stewart, Jay Sigel and Annika Sorenstam tied with Robert Gamez,
Gil Morgan and Chris Johnson for second. Each team split dlrs
262,500.
	   Clutch birdie putts by McGann and Johnson at the par-4 18th
forced the playoff.
	   Johnson rolled in her fourth birdie of the round with a 7-footer
(2 meters).
	   ``We all knew that we needed to make birdie and I figured that I
would just make a good run at it,'' said Johnson, who also had
birdies at the third, fourth and fifth holes.
	   McGann's fifth birdie of the round was a tricky 18-20 footer
(5.5-6 meters) across the sloping 18th green.
	   ``I had a good roll on it and it went right in the center,''
McGann said.
	   In his first competition in more than a month, John Daly teamed
with Walter Morgan and Laura Davies for a 9-under 62.
	   Daly had birdies at the par-5 second and the par-4 14th. His
most prodigious shot came at the 18th where he boomed a drive 383
yards (350 meters) straight down the fairway, but had to settle for
par.
	   ``It was fun,'' said Daly, who last played a PGA Tour sanctioned
event at the Greater Vancouver Open the final week of August,
failing to make the cut. ``We played solid and consistent.''
	   Defending champions Nick Price, Jim Colbert and Kelly Robbins
also combined for a 62.

Retirement may be surest path to golf hall

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ The results are back from the World Golf
Hall of Fame's international ballot: nobody made it.
	   None of the 19 players received the required 75 percent of the
vote. The closest was Bernhard Langer, who came up 24 votes shorts.
	   At age 41, Langer still has time to add to his credentials _ 51
victories, including two Masters; a member of nine straight Ryder
Cup teams; at least one victory on the European tour for 16
consecutive years.
	   Then again, maybe the best thing Langer could do is stop playing
all together, which is not to suggest he's washed up.
	   Golf is unlike most other sports in that its stars can compete
well past their prime.
	   Jack Nicklaus won the Masters at 46 and nearly pulled off the
unimaginable at Augusta in April at 58. Raymond Floyd won the U.S.
Open at age 43 and is the only player to win a PGA Tour and Senior
Tour event in the same year.
	   And unlike other sports shrines, players do not have to wait
five years after their last competitive putt before they become
eligible for the Golf Hall of Fame. It is the only hall in America
that elects active players.
	   Nick Faldo, 41, was inducted into the Hall of Fame on the
international ballot in May, having won six majors and more Ryder
Cup matches than anyone. Tom Watson was inducted 10 years ago at
age 38, when he already had won eight majors and 29 tour events. He
since has won twice more on tour.
	   But for players like Langer on the international ballot, and a
host of others on the PGA Tour ballot, the question becomes whether
a voter is more inclined to focus on their careers, or what they
have done lately.
	   It could be that active players are held to a higher standard
than if they walked away on top or close to it.
	   ``The psychology for voting is interesting,'' said Ruffin
Beckwith, the executive director of World Golf Foundation, which
oversees the Hall of Fame.
	   ``Is it hard to vote for somebody who's still active? Is it hard
to vote into the Hall of Fame someone who can still win a major?''
	   The answer probably will become clearer in two weeks when the
PGA Tour ballots are counted. Among those on the list are Greg
Norman, Nick Price and Mark O'Meara.
	   O'Meara was on the ballot for the first time last year and got 5
percent of the vote, not surprising for a career grinder with 14
tour victories. A year later, he has won as many majors as Johnny
Miller, who was inducted in May.
	   Price was the best player in the world from 1992 to 1994, when
he won 11 times on tour including two PGA Championships and a
British Open. He failed to win on tour the next two years, and only
recently has shown signs of getting back toward the top. He had 15
PGA Tour wins last year when he got 25 percent of the vote.
	   Norman is the most interesting name on the ballot.
	   He is the career money earner on the PGA Tour, with 18 victories
in 14 full seasons and 56 other wins around the world. Along with
two British Opens, he has finished runner-up eight times in the
majors and is the only player to lose all four majors in a playoff.
	   Then again, some could argue he is merely an underachiever with
as many majors as Andy North.
	   Norman finished second in the voting last year with 63 percent.
Only Lloyd Mangrum at 64 percent had more votes on a ballot in
which no one was elected.
	   ``If people thought Norman's career was over, maybe it would
have been different,'' Beckwith said.
	   Three other names on the ballot are also worth noting _ Lanny
Wadkins, Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite. Wadkins and Kite are both 48
and have strikingly similar records besides being the last two U.S.
Ryder Cup captains.
	   Wadkins won 21 times on tour including the 1977 PGA, but he
hasn't won since 1992. He got 12 percent of the vote last year.
	   Kite has won 19 times including the 1992 U.S. Open, although he
has won dlrs 4 million more than Wadkins in his career. Kite, who
hasn't won since 1993, received 54 percent of votes last year.
	   Crenshaw, the next Ryder Cup captain, is 46 and has 19 tour
victories. Both his majors came at the Masters, and he hasn't won
since his emotional victory at Augusta in 1995. He finished third
in voting last year at 57 percent.
	   Whether any of these players can make up ground is yet to be
seen. If not, Seve Ballesteros will have the induction ceremony in
March all to himself.

Faldo's new guru is the king of swing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Chip Koehlke doesn't wear a Panama hat
or wraparound shades or speak with a distinctive British accent. He
hasn't written a book or produced instructional videotapes. He
doesn't have a stable of champions with names like Ernie Els, Nick
Price and Se Ri Pak.
	   Koehlke never set out to be a famous swing coach for one of the
world's most accomplished players.
	   In fact, the first time he met Nick Faldo was to interview for
the job as director of instruction at Faldo's new golf school run
by Marriott International.
	   During the past 18 months, Koehlke would visit with the
three-time Masters and British Open champion when Faldo was home in
Orlando, Fla., make small talk about his game and share photos of
Ben Hogan, the legend who brought them together.
	   But something happened last month when Faldo was in the throes
of his worst slump since David Leadbetter rebuilt his swing in
1985.
	   Faldo, on his way to Switzerland with hopes of gaining some
confidence and some European Ryder Cup points, stopped by the
school and asked Koehlke to take a quick look at his swing.
	   One hour turned into two. One canceled flight led to another.
	   Four days later, Faldo was on his way to Europe with a new
swing, and Leadbetter was on his way out.
	   It was a peculiar end to one of golf's most heralded
relationships _ Faldo notified Leadbetter of the split in a letter
_ and the start of an unlikely one.
	   Koehlke, 34, said he has worked with a few PGA and LPGA players,
``no one you would know.'' Still, he wasn't the least bit shy about
speaking his mind when Faldo sought his help.
	   ``He told me that in some cases, I would have to do just the
opposite to what I've done for years if I wanted to improve,''
Faldo said. ``Everything made sense.''
	   In a roundabout way, so does their relationship.
	   Koehlke and Faldo had worked together for about two years,
developing the curriculum for the instruction programs at the Faldo
Golf Institute. During that time, ``it just wasn't my
responsibility to help his golf game,'' Koehlke said.
	   The Faldo-Leadbetter split may have as much to do with business
as with golf technique _ the Faldo Institute by Marriott competes
directly with Leadbetter's school in Orlando.
	   In a way, Faldo felt like a Coke salesman sneaking a sip of
Pepsi.
	   ``He's a disciple of my methods, read my books and teaches my
methods,'' Faldo said of Koehlke. ``Why shouldn't I be doing what I
tell everybody else is the best way?''
	   The results were not immediate. Faldo missed the cut in
Switzerland, the first time he had done that on the European tour
in four years. He has been at par or better his last eight rounds,
including a final-round 65 at the Lancome Trophy that got him a tie
for sixth.
	   ``He worked two or three hours daily on the entire game in
Paris,'' Koehlke said. ``We left no stone unturned.''
	   While it has been said that Faldo's putting has put pressure on
the rest of the game, Koehlke believes otherwise. He says a
breakdown in Faldo's swing has crept into his short game and
putting.
	   ``When the swing goes bad, you don't have confidence in the rest
of your game,'' he said.
	   Faldo and Koehlke also share a bond in their admiration for
Hogan. Faldo once asked Hogan how to win a U.S. Open. ``Shoot the
lowest score,'' Hogan told him.
	   Koehlke, who graduated from Ferris State in Michigan, one of the
few schools with a golf management program, had a short stint as a
teaching pro at Trophy Country Club in Roanoke, Texas, the only
course Hogan designed.
	   ``That's where we've had a bit of camaraderie,'' Koehlke said.
``We shared a lot of pictures of Hogan that we've both discovered
over the years, and we talked a lot about the Hogan myths.''
	   And while Faldo's philosophy about golf swings isn't a
carbon-copy of Hogan's famous book, ``Five Lessons,'' it's not that
far off. For that matter, neither is Koehlke's.
	   ``My belief has always been that there's only one golf swing,
and that's dictated by the equipment you hold in your hand,''
Koehlke said. ``It's designed to be swung a certain way. When I had
the opportunity to interview with Nick, we knew we were on the same
page.''
	   That Koehlke even got the interview is a small wonder. He
tinkered on mini-tours during the winter, never having the ambition
to make a living as a player. Koehlke taught at three clubs before
becoming a consultant for Marriott when it set out to develop a
resort hotel with a golf school backed by Faldo's name and
teachings.
	   ``In the process of consulting, they asked me if I would be
interested in coming on as director of instruction,'' Koelhke said.
	   The Faldo Golf Institute opened in March 1997, compete with a
nine-hole teaching course, a 27-hole putting course, 200 hitting
stations placed in various directions to accommodate the wind.
Sessions range from one week to one lesson.
	   Or, in Faldo's case, they can last four days.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks pulled back Tuesday as the Federal
Reserve chose to move gradually in fighting the global economic
crisis with lower interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average,
which was up 15 points as Fed officials concluded their latest
strategy meeting, dropped 28.32 points _ or by 0.3 percent _ at
8,080.52. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Federal Reserve policy-makers Tuesday cut
short-term interest rates by a quarter-percentage point, the first
reduction in nearly three years, in hope of cushioning the U.S.
economy from global financial turmoil. The central bank's monetary
policy panel voted to move the benchmark federal funds rate, which
banks charge each other on overnight loans, to 5.25 percent from
5.5 percent. The Fed left its discount rate, which it charges on
its own loans to banks, unchanged at 5 percent. Many traders had
been hoping for a half-point rather than quarter-point rate
reduction. Monday, in anticipation of lower rates, the Dow rose 80
points on top of last week's 133-point gain. (US-FED-INTEREST
RATES)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In its biggest monthly drop since January,
consumer confidence fell for a third-straight month in September
amid rising fears that global economic and political turmoil will
soon slow the U.S. economy. The Conference Board reported Tuesday
that its index of consumer confidence fell 7.1 points to 126 in
September from a revised 133.1 in August. The index is down 12.2
points from its 29-year high in June. September's decline, which
was larger than analysts had expected, brings the index to its
lowest level since October 1997. (US-CONSUMER CONFIDENCE)
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The union leader picked to head the Labor Ministry
in Germany's new Social Democratic government sought to dampen
expectations of a quick fix Tuesday to high unemployment, the key
issue in the election campaign. Walter Riester, a top metalworkers
leader designated by chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder as labor
minister, said unemployment could rise in the next few months. He
blamed outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government for pouring
money into temporary, make-work measures before the election to
nudge the jobless rate down. When those contracts run out, ``a new
increase in unemployment is to be expected,'' he told German
television. (GERMANY-JOBS)
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ United Bank of Switzerland's top
management has promised its employees that internal inquiries of
the bank's large losses will produce answers by Friday. Chairman
Mathis Cabiallavetta and Chief Executive Marcel Ospel, in an
internal memo dated Monday, said they want ``absolute clarity
quickly about the decision-making processes and those responsible''
relating to the losses, which the bank revealed last week. They
said it was understandable that after the announcement, staff were
``ill at ease and have many questions.'' UBS disclosed losses of
some 2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 1.4 billion) that would lead the
bank to post a third-quarter after tax loss of up to 1 billion
Swiss francs (dlrs 720 million). (SWITZERLAND-UBS)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Royal Philips Electronics NV said
Tuesday it will build a new dlrs 1.2 billion chip production site
in a joint venture with Singapore with Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. and EDB Investments. Philips revealed in January
plans to build the new site with a partner in Asia, but did not
specify who that partner would be. In a news release, Philips said
the new site will be set up through a joint venture at Singapore's
Pasir Ris Wafer Fabrication Park. Construction will start early
next year and the facility will open in the second half of 2000,
Philips said. (NETHERLANDS-PHILIPS)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Levi Strauss Europe on Tuesday
announced plans to close four factories in France and Belgium with
the possible loss of 1,560 jobs. The company, a unit of U.S.
clothing manufacturer Levi Strauss and Co., said it was forced to
restructure because of falling demand for denim jeans. Levi said
the drop in demand was due to a decline in the European youth
population, a shift away from denim products and increased
competition from smaller ``own label'' brands. Company officials
said the French and Belgian plants were singled out because of high
labor costs and overcapacity. (EUROPE-LEVI STRAUSS)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accepted
Israel's formula for turning over more land on the West Bank
Tuesday and voiced hope that an agreement could be concluded at a
White House summit in mid-October. ``Peace is a Palestinian need,
Israeli need, Arab need, international need,'' Arafat said. With
momentum toward an accord growing, President Bill Clinton and
Arafat were looking ahead to a time when the United States may be
able to ``engage formally'' with the Palestinians, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said after the two leaders held hour-long
talks. McCurry said the two leaders ``talked at some length about
the arrangements that will exist when the United States can engage
formally with the Palestinian Authority.'' That, he said, may
involve establishing a joint committee that ``could actually,
formally work on, in effect, bilateral relations.'' (US-MIDEAST)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army pulled out of an
area of recent conflict Tuesday, in an apparent move to back up a
government pledge to end to the Kosovo offensive. But Albanians
reported new, large-scale troop deployments and fresh fighting. The
pullbacks claimed by the Serbs were in apparent reaction to NATO's
decision to step up plans for airstrikes after repeated warnings to
end its offensive against rebels in the southern Kosovo province.
The majority ethnic Albanian province is part of Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic. About 150 military vehicles were seen
Tuesday passing through Caglavica, just south of the provincial
capital, Pristina. Tanks made up at least one-third of the convoy.
Serbian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported three
army units were pulled back into Pristina, and similar withdrawals
from recent battlegrounds south of the capital. They did not say
how many troops were withdrawn. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With tax revenues plunging, Russia named a new tax
chief Tuesday who faces the elusive task of trying to coax more
money out of a shrinking economy. His predecessor immediately
predicted that the new head of the tax service, Georgy Boos, would
fail. Boris Fyodorov, the last great hope of market-oriented
economic reformers, said the new coalition government had no real
interest in collecting taxes and would probably collapse in a
matter of months. ``In the last two weeks in the government, nobody
asked me a single time how much tax we collected,'' Fyodorov said.
``Nobody cares. Obviously if you have a license to print money ...
why make enemies, why go after private individuals, why be tough?''
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has insisted that tax collection
remains at the heart of his plans to resuscitate the economy. But
Primakov said Tuesday that tax collection in September was only
about half what the government had projected. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ After his rival Fatos Nano submitted his
resignation as prime minister, ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday
demanded new elections, but in an apparent concession urged
supporters to cooperate with a new government. The ruling Socialist
Party nominated its 30-year-old general secretary, Pandeli Majko,
to replace Nano, who handed in his resignation to President Rexhep
Meidani late Monday. Under Albanian law, Nano remains caretaker
prime minister until Parliament approves his successor and his
Cabinet. The Socialists hold 108 of the 155 seats. Late Tuesday,
President Rexhep Mejdani asked Majko to try and form a new
government. Majko was expected to start negotiations with other
parties Wednesday on forming a coalition. (ALBANIA)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Libya outlined its problems Tuesday with a
deal to try two Libyan suspects in the Pan Am bombing, criticizing
the decision to hold the trial at a Dutch airbase used by Americans
and questioning why Tripoli must provide witnesses for the
prosecution. In a speech at the General Assembly's annual debate,
Libyan U.N. Ambassador Abuzed Dorda lashed out at a Security
Council resolution that laid out the possibility that the suspects
might still appear for trial in the United States or Britain. ``If
this is the case, it can only mean institutional piracy condoned by
the Security Council resolution,'' he said. Tripoli has accepted
the proposed trial before a Scottish court in the Netherlands, he
said, ``but will not accept the setting of any conditions in
relation to the implementation of that proposal.'' (UN-LIBYA)

<TEXT>
	   NEWARK, New Jersey (AP) _ A fledgling record company says Bruce
Springsteen is trying to block the release of some songs he sang
back when the Boss was just a rock 'n' roll working stiff.
	   Pony Express Records of Bloomfield claimed in a federal suit
that it bought rights to several Springsteen songs recorded before
his 1970s stardom. The title of its compact disc is ``Before the
Fame.''
	   But distributors are afraid to put the music on the shelves
because Springsteen has ``used his stature and position as a famous
recording artist'' to spread word that the recordings are bootlegs,
Pony Express said.
	   A Springsteen representative refused to comment.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ALLENTOWN, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Political discourse has taken a
back seat to sex, Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel says.
	   ``Once upon a time we talked about politics in public and sex in
private. Now it's the opposite,'' the author and Holocaust survivor
said Monday in accepting an honorary degree at Cedar Crest College.
	   ``Who would have thought that this democracy would produce a
situation in which the national discourse would go down to
pornography?''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Princess Diana's memorial fund lost an effort
to bar the Franklin Mint from selling unauthorized memorabilia with
her name and likeness.
	   U.S. District Judge Richard A. Paez denied the request Monday
for a preliminary injunction pending a trial. No trial date has
been set.
	   Lawyers for Diana's estate and memorial fund called the Franklin
Mint ``vultures feeding on the dead.''
	   Among the items marketed so far by the Franklin Mint: Diana
plates, dolls, rings and a pendant.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II welcomed Spain's king and
queen to the Vatican on Tuesday as they returned for the first time
since attending the pope's installation in 1978.
	   Both men took rueful stock of the passing of the years.
	   John Paul greeted a grayer, plumper King Juan Carlos I this time
around.
	   ``We were 20 years younger,'' the 78-year-old pontiff said.
	   Despite his words, John Paul was smiling and seemed hardy,
walking without a cane.
	   Queen Sofia attended in white, exempted from the restrictions
that etiquette dictates for commoners regarding suitable colors for
private audiences with the pope.
	   Juan Carlos _ born in Rome during his family's wartime exile _
is on a five-day state visit to Italy.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MIDDELBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ A small oil painting by abstract
pioneer Piet Mondrian has been stolen from a Dutch museum, a
spokesman said Monday.
	   The painting titled ``The Tree'' was snatched from the Zeeuws
Museum in this southwestern Dutch city sometime between Thursday
night and Saturday morning, said museum director Ineke Spaander.
	   The museum bought ``The Tree'' in 1994 for 260,000 guilders
(dlrs 130,000), said Spaander.
	   She declined to give details surrounding the theft, but said
police have launched an investigation.
	   The 27-by-38-centimeter (11-by-15-inch) painting was created by
the Dutch master between 1908 and 1909. It was neither signed nor
dated.
	   The painting shows a black apple tree against a dark blue
background. The oil-on-paper was attached to cloth.

Murders down in Caracas, but police wielding heavy hand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY306 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANA CAROLINA GRIFFIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ When the murder rate soared early in
the decade, Caracas residents who could afford it bunkered down,
shielding themselves behind steel bars and high walls topped with
broken glass.
	   They spent millions of dollars on security patrols, guard dogs
and bulletproof windows.
	   The police also took action, staging mass roundups and
detentions and setting up roadblocks to frisk motorists.
	   Now the murder rate is down dramatically, and many parts of the
city are safer.
	   Yet the people of Caracas aren't claiming victory. Some
districts remain exceedingly dangerous, and the cost of fewer
murders by civilians appears to be more killings and other abuses
by police.
	   Police officers ``combat the situation of poverty with
indiscriminate repression,'' said Tarek William Saab, a human
rights lawyer.
	   Government agents throughout Venezuela killed 151 people over
the past year, the highest figure during President Rafael Caldera's
four years in office, according to the private group Venezuelan
Program of Education and Action in Human Rights. In Caracas, the
number of killings by police rose from 40 in 1995 to 46 in 1997.
	   Government officials admit police officers sometimes commit
human rights abuses, but say the numbers are exaggerated. They also
stress the decrease in crime.
	   The city has seen a 37 percent drop in murders in recent years _
from 3,989 in 1994 to 2,515 in 1997, according to the Judicial
Technical Police.
	   The plunge has brought a noticeable change from the atmosphere
that gave Caracas such a bad reputation it was called one of Latin
America's most violent cities in a recent study by the Pan-American
Health Organization.
	   In the past year or so, night life has picked up in upscale
neighborhoods. Movie theaters have reinstated midnight showings and
Las Mercedes, the city's main district for restaurants and night
clubs, is alive until dawn.
	   Nonetheless, downtown Caracas and the hillside shantytowns
surrounding the capital remain very dangerous, especially after
dark. Most Caracas residents still don't feel safe returning to
nighttime activities that were common a decade ago, such as meeting
in public squares and in the streets.
	   The decrease in homicides ``does not mean that crime has gone
down,'' said Roberto Briceno, a sociologist at the Central
University of Venezuela.
	   The sound of gunshots is still common in the slums. Dozens of
adults and children die each year from stray bullets in shootouts
between rival gangs or clashes between criminals and police.
	   Caracas' crime has been fueled by rapid urbanization, high
unemployment and an abundance of guns. An inefficient and corrupt
judicial system often fails to punish criminals.
	   Crime and poverty feed off each other in Caracas. The drop in
world oil prices wreaked havoc on Venezuela's oil-based economy,
and social programs have been cut, leaving the poor to fend for
themselves.
	   Meanwhile, government abuses have risen, human rights groups
contend. Young people complain of a police force that detains
people without explanation, without respecting rights.
	   ``Violence also comes from the police. There are decent people
out there who the police beat ruthlessly,'' said Milange Arberlay,
a 16-year-old who recounted recently seeing a policeman strike a
young man before arresting him and then insult a woman who went to
his defense.
	   While Caracas is less murderous, much of the violence seems to
have been transplanted to nearby cities, where swift population
growth is overwhelming local governments' capacity to provide
services.
	   Official statistics on murder rates are scarce and incomplete,
but a study by Briceno, the sociologist, found big increases in
outlying cities.
	   In Valencia, for instance, the number of homicides per 100,000
inhabitants rose from 21 in 1994 to 28.6 in 1996, the study said.
In Maracay, the rate jumped from 15.7 to 21.2 in the same period.
	   Some experts contend that one reason for Caracas' falling murder
rate is that people have learned to coexist with levels of violence
unthinkable a few decades ago, when most Venezuelans lived in the
countryside before an oil boom brought them to the cities.
	   ``People have learned to protect themselves, not to be in
dangerous places,'' said sociologist Antonio Cova.

Japan's industrial output falls in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Production at recession-plagued Japan's factories
and mines slipped 0.6 percent in August from July, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said Wednesday.
	   The decline was smaller than forecast by economists surveyed by
Dow Jones Newswires, who projected on average that industrial
production would shrink by 0.8 percent compared with the prior
month. The figures were adjusted for seasonal factors.
	   It was the second straight month of decline following July's 0.8
percent fall. In June, output rose 1.7 percent, which had been the
first gain in four months.
	   Industrial shipments were also down, slipping 0.9 in August,
while inventories dropped 0.5 percent, MITI said.
	   Japan is suffering its worst recession in decades amid a
stubborn slump in consumer demand and growing worries about the
health of the country's debt-ridden banks.

Earthquake rattles Belgrade

minor damage in downtown Belgrade &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An earthquake shook Belgrade and
other parts of Yugoslavia early Wednesday, shutting off electricity
temporarily, rattling buildings and sending frightened residents
into the streets.
	   There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries and first
reports said damage was slight. Some older buildings in the center
of Belgrade received minor damage, local radios said.
	   Officials said the quake, which struck about 12:15 a.m. (2215
Tuesday GMT) was centered near Cacak about 85 kilometers (53 miles)
south of Belgrade.
	   It measured 8 on the Mercalli Scale at the center and 5 in
Belgrade, officials said. In Montenegro, the seismological
institute gave a preliminary measurement of 5.4 on the Richter
Scale.
	   Callers to Belgrade radio stations asked whether NATO had
attacked. The Alliance has threatened possible military action
unless the government halts its crackdown of ethnic Albanian
separatists in the southern province of Kosovo.

Old German Cabinet to meet on offer for NATO air strikes in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's outgoing Cabinet has an important
piece of unfinished businesss: Whether to confirm an offer for 14
fighter planes to participate in NATO airstrikes in Kosovo.
	   The cabinet's decision could fall as early as Wednesday. Or it
could take no action and defer.
	   The decision would then fall to the new government being formed
by Social Democratic Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder after his
election victory Sunday.
	   The Social Democrats and their likely coalition partner, the
Greens, have said they want a U.N. mandate for NATO strikes against
Serbia before allowing the planes to be deployed, which requires a
decision by parliament.
	   However, they left unclear how explicit the UN mandate must be.
	   NATO has formerly queried member states about whether and how
they would support possible air strikes against Serb positions in
Kosovo.
	   Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million population are ethnic
Albanians, who seek independence and are being suppressed by
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and about 275,000 have fled
their homes since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces
began cracking down on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in February.
	   Even if NATO members commit to the air strikes, a NATO
ratification of the plan is needed before they can take place.
	   Whether the old Cabinet and old parliament decides on Germany's
participation depends on how quickly NATO decides. At the earliest
the new parliament may be constituted by Oct. 20. If NATO's
decision comes before then, the old parliament could call a special
session to vote on participation.
	   However, Social Democratic foreign policy expert, Guenter
Verheugen, said he didn't expect any quick decisions on NATO air
strikes in the next few weeks, because the political, legal and
military situation wasn't right for it.
	   Still, a German decision even under a new Social Democratic-led
Cabinet would be no different than that of the old government,
Verheugen said, underlining Schroeder's promise that foreign policy
will remain stable.
	   Even within the old Cabinet there were differences on whether a
U.N. mandate would be needed for NATO air strikes. While outgoing
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel insisted it was, Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe has said he could foresee a NATO decision sufficing in
a humanitarian emergency.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Thinking that her husband was giving her the
silent treatment, a woman in Veracruz, Mexico apparently didn't
notice that her husband _ who was lying on the couple's bed _ had
died eight days previously, local media reported Tuesday.
	   The woman, Margarita Sanchez Alvarez, told Veracruz state police
that she thought her husband hadn't spoken to her because he was
mad at her, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   The man, 83-year-old Cayetano Sanchez Luna, is believed to have
died of alcohol poisoning early last week at the couple's home in
the village of Tavictepan, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east of
Mexico City.
	   His body was found on a bed his wife shared, covered up to the
neck with a sheet and beginning to decompose. Sanchez Alvarez was
referred to mental health specialists.

	   HAVANA (AP) _ President Fidel Castro said that Hurricane Georges
helped Cuba overcome its worst drought in four decades, but also
caused serious damage to developing crops.
	   In a speech excerpted in the Communist Party newspaper Granma on
Tuesday, Castro announced a plan to provide extra food rations to
1.6 million people in regions struck by drought, then hurricane
winds and rain.
	   More than 40,000 homes were damaged by the hurricane, 2,100 of
which were destroyed, he said. The government planned to provide
mattresses and other household goods to people whose homes were
damaged.
	   Earlier reports said Georges killed five people in Cuba last
week.
	   Castro said that until December, people who live in the eastern
two-thirds of Cuba will receive an extra kilogram (2.2 pounds) of
grains every month. Cubans are subject to food rations administered
by the government.
	   He said Cuba had sent a 13-member medical team to Dominican
Republic, which was hit hard by Georges, and appealed to other
countries to help Caribbean nations stricken by the hurricane.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A gunman shot dead three young men in a
northern Mexico town in what police said could be a revenge
killing, local media reported Tuesday.
	   The trio dropped off merchandise Monday at a store in Escuinapa,
about 475 miles (765 kilometers) northwest of Mexico City, and were
shot at point blank range when they returned to their pickup truck.
	   Merchandise and money were not taken, leading local police to
discard robbery as a motive, government news agency Notimex
reported. The assailant escaped in a waiting vehicle.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's Senate and Interior Secretariat said
they agreed with proposals to allow the Senate, not the president,
to nominate leaders of the government's human right commission.
	   The move would give the National Human Rights Commission, which
is a quasi-independent oversight agency, more autonomy, local media
reported Tuesday.
	   Under the changes, the Senate would choose the commission's
president by a two-thirds vote from among a group of nominees
proposed by the Senate or lower house.
	   At present, the president presents a single nominee for the
post, subject to Senate approval.
	   The proposals would still have to be formally presented to
congress and approved by President Ernesto Zedillo.
	   ___
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Former members of paramilitary
`civilian patrols' _ which helped Salvador's army during the civil
war _ pledged protests and hunger strikes Tuesday to demand more
compensation for their services.
	   On Monday, the administration of President Armando Calderon Sol
offered to pay some patrol members dlrs 4 per month in pensions.
	   The figure is far short of the group's demands of dlrs 2,000 in
a lump sum and land grant for services of 30,000 people rendered in
the 12 year war.
	   Twenty people were injured Sept. 23 after ex-patrol members
clashed with police in four towns.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A major political party says it won't
dump a former Miss Universe as its presidential candidate, despite
her plummeting support in opinion polls.
	   ``Our candidate has been, is and will continue to be Irene
Saez,'' former President Luis Herrera Campins told reporters
Tuesday after Saez presented her proposed economic program.
	   Last week, two leading senators from the Social Christian COPEI
party said it should throw its support to former state Gov.
Henrique Salas Romer, who is number two in opinion polls for the
Dec. 6 race.
	   The senators said Salas Romer is the only candidate capable of
defeating former coup leader Hugo Chavez, who holds at least a
10-point lead in most opinion polls.
	   Saez, 36, a former local mayor, was the leading candidate for
most of last year but has seen her support dwindle to single digits
in some polls. Critics say her sugary statements and vague platform
have turned off voters.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Gunmen shot and killed a state police
commander Tuesday in a northern Mexican region notoriously plagued
by drug trafficking.
	   Jose Arturo Camacho Aguilar, 44, was shot several times as he
left his home in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, the
government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Police were investigating the attack, the report said.
	   Camacho was a commander of the State Judicial Police in Sinaloa,
a Pacific Coast state which is a major corridor for traffickers
shipping contraband north to the United States.

Serbs claim pullouts, Albanians say fighting continues

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO preparing possible
airstrikes to end Kosovo's violence, the Yugoslav army is pulling
out hardware from a recent conflict area _ a move meant to
underline a government pledge to end the offensive against ethnic
Albanian militants.
	   But the Albanians say the fighting is continuing and that the
Serb-Yugoslav alliance fighting the Kosovo Liberation Army is
actually putting more weapons and men into the fray in Kosovo, an
ethnic Albanian majority province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   About 150 military vehicles were seen Tuesday passing through
Caglavica, just south of the provincial capital, Pristina. Tanks
made up at least one-third of the convoy.
	   Serbian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported
three army units were pulled back into Pristina, and similar
withdrawals from recent battlegrounds south of the capital. They
did not say how many troops were withdrawn.
	   Still, beyond the convoy seen at Caglavica, it was unclear
whether a large-scale pullback, as demanded by NATO, had begun, or
if new offensives were in progress, as claimed by the ethnic
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center.
	   Since the Serbian crackdown began in February, hundreds of
people have been killed and an estimated 275,000 driven from their
homes.
	   Ethnic Albanian reports of a massacre of civilians by Serb
forces fueled tensions, as diplomats met with the two sides in an
attempt to find common ground.
	   Diplomats visiting refugees on Monday saw the bodies of 15
ethnic Albanian men, women and children who were shot in the back
of the head and mutilated at a makeshift camp in a wooded section
of the Drenica region, west of Pristina.
	   The diplomats _ members of a permanent observer mission to
Kosovo _ refused to comment on what they saw at the massacre site
before reporting backs to their governments. Reporters on Tuesday
also saw the bodies _ said by ethnic Albanians to have been
massacred by Serbs on Sunday
	   Both sides have been accused of massacres. Serbs have said that
at least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and killed earlier this
month near Glodjane in western Kosovo after they were ``kidnapped
by the terrorists.''
	   Serbia, under world pressure, has agreed in principle to restore
some of the autonomy it stripped from Kosovo in 1989, but rules out
demands by the Kosovo Liberation Army for independence.
	   World powers also oppose independence because it can be achieved
only through more bloodshed. They support moderate Kosovo Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova and hope he and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic can agree on a U.S.-backed plan for the restoration of
some autonomy.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the KLA urged the world to act ``more
justly, swiftly and energetically, or the consequences of the
Kosovo war would be reflected in the whole of Balkans and wider.''
The rebels pledged to fight on despite a string of defeats which
have driven them from most of their former strongholds.
	   Despite the pullback claims, the Kosovo Information Center,
which reflects the views of the moderate Kosovo Albanian
leadership, reported ``heavy'' Serb attacks Tuesday around the
towns of Stimlje and Urosevac, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south
of Pristina.
	   Later, in a separate report, the information center claimed that
200 tanks were seen heading into Kosovo from the rest of Serbia in
the region of Podujevo, north of Pristina. That claim, too, could
not be verified.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's prime-minister designate,
taking over after his predecessor resigned following weeks of
protests, now faces the difficult task of building a coalition
government.
	   The ruling Socialist Party nominated its 30-year-old general
secretary, Pandeli Majko, to replace Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
Late Tuesday, President Rexhep Mejdani asked Majko to try and form
a new government. Majko was expected to start negotiations with
other parties Wednesday on forming a coalition.
	   Nano submitted his resignation as prime minister on Monday, and
his bitter rival, ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday demanded new
elections. At the same time Berisha urged supporters to cooperate
with a new government in his most moderate comments in weeks.
	   Under Albanian law, Nano remains caretaker prime minister until
Parliament approves his successor and his Cabinet. The Socialists
hold 108 of the 155 seats.
	   Nano acknowledged wanting to eliminate Berisha politically but
accused Berisha of ignoring all rules in his drive for power.
	   Nano submitted his resignation after failing to win approval for
Cabinet changes following riots two weeks ago, which erupted in
Tirana after unknown gunmen killed opposition lawmaker Azem
Hajdari.
	   Berisha blamed Nano for the killing, which triggered two days of
unrest which plunged the nation to the brink of civil war.
	   Majko's nomination was seen as a significant move to phase out
political leaders associated the hardline Stalinist regime that
ruled Albania for 46 years. Both Nano and Berisha were Communist
party members.
	   But Majko was a leader of the student movement which helped
topple the Communists from power in 1990.
	   Speaking to reporters after his nomination, Majko said it was
time older politicians make room for the next generation.
	   ``I think that the best support Berisha could give to the new
government would be to open space in his own party to the
generation of young politicians,'' he said.
	   On Tuesday, Berisha's Democratic Party repeated its claim that
Nano's resignation alone is not enough to bring an end to the
political crisis. The Democrats demanded that an interim government
comprised of experts not affiliated with any party take over until
new elections could be organized.
	   But in an apparent concession, Berisha later issued a statement
calling on Albanians and public officials to trust the new
``political solutions'' that are to be drawn up by the new prime
minister.
	   Berisha has been under strong international pressure to avoid
pushing this impoverished former Communist nation into a repeat of
the nationwide unrest which erupted in 1997 after the collapse of
failed investment schemes cost many Albanians their life-savings.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prayerful chants echoed off the yellow-pink
stones of the Western wall and the candlelit walls of countless
synagogues Wednesday when Israel marked Judaism's holiest day.
	   Jews the world over mark Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, by
praying and fasting, soul-searching and repenting, seeking God's
forgiveness. The holiday began at sundown Tuesday and lasts until
sundown Wednesday.
	   ``It's the time to confess your sins right out loud,'' said
Jerusalem tour guide Shmaryahi Yahav, 69. ``You try to improve your
communication with God, and with other people too.''
	   But even on a day of introspection, real-world tensions
intruded.
	   Military security was tight, the Palestinian lands were sealed
off, and little genuine progress was seen in just-finished peace
talks in the United States. In the West Bank, a car packed with
powerful explosives blew up Tuesday, raising suspicions it was
being readied for a suicide attack.
	   In Israel proper, the holiday presented a rare spectacle: that
of a frantic and frenetic country simply shutting down.
	   Streets emptied as people hurried home for a final pre-fast
meal. For 24 hours, shops and businesses are shuttered, buses and
trains stop running, and virtually no one drives.
	   There are no international or domestic flights. Seaports are
closed. Border crossings are shut. News broadcasts cease.
	   At the Western Wall in Jerusalem's walled Old City, Judaism's
holiest site, tens of thousands of Jews gathered for prayers,
swaying and chanting before the expanse of yellow stone. Prayers
continued late into the floodlit night.
	   The day marks something of a truce in ongoing skirmishes between
religious and secular Israelis. Even though most Israelis describe
themselves as secular, nearly all go to synagogue on Yom Kippur,
and most also fast.
	   Synagogues are so crowded that many require seat reservations,
but by tradition, no worshipper is turned away.
	   Israel's entire army observes a holiday fast, and military
messes served up a heavy, hearty meal just beforehand. Large
military installations have synagogue buildings, but remote
outposts set up makeshift ones in tents and bunkers.
	   The army insists religious observances don't compromise
preparedness _ a pledge that carries a special meaning this year,
the 25th anniversary of the Yom Kippur war.
	   Israel was caught badly off guard when Arab neighbors attacked
on Oct. 6, 1973, when the holy day fell that year. Almost 2,700
Israeli soldiers were slain in the 2 1/2-week conflict, shattering
the country's self-confidence about its military prowess.
	   As it normally does during Jewish holidays, Israel imposed a
blanket closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, refusing entry to
all Palestinians. Soldiers manned roadblocks and police checked
cars going into the Old City.
	   As a prelude to Yom Kippur, Jews are supposed to try to make
amends to fellow humans before they do with God. It's an old ritual
with modern touches like using e-mail to apologize for snapping at
a colleague or letting down a friend.
	   Yedideya Saidin, who runs a Jerusalem jewelry shop, looked up
from work over a fine silver chain to talk about cutthroat
competition in his trade.
	   ``You know how it is in business, sometimes you do things you
wish you hadn't,'' he said ruefully. ``So when this time of year
comes, we all just have to forgive each other.''
	   Sometimes, though, atonement is more of a formality.
	   On an Israeli TV talk-and-politics show aired Sunday, Jewish
settler leader Ahron Domb delivered an angry tirade against Yasser
Arafat. Then, in almost the same breath, he turned to Arafat's aide
Ahmed Tibi and asked pardon for any slights in the past year.
	   Tibi, a Palestinian who holds Israeli citizenship and is
familiar with the Yom Kippur custom, nodded. Then he gave Domb a
big grin.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An earthquake shook Belgrade and
other parts of Yugoslavia early Wednesday, shutting off electricity
temporarily, rattling buildings and sending frightened residents
into the streets.
	   There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries. Some older
buildings in the center of Belgrade received minor damage, local
radios said.
	   Officials said the quake, which struck about 12:15 a.m. (2215
Tuesday GMT) was centered near Cacak about 85 kilometers (55 miles)
south of Belgrade.
	   Its preliminary magnitude was 8 on the Mercalli Scale at the
center and 5 in Belgrade, officials said. In Montenegro, the
seismological institute gave a preliminary measurement of 5.4 on

Earthquake rattles Belgrade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An earthquake shook Belgrade and
other parts of Yugoslavia early Wednesday, shutting off electricity
temporarily, rattling buildings and sending frightened residents
into the streets.
	   There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries. Some older
buildings in the center of Belgrade received minor damage, local
radios said.
	   Officials said the quake, which struck about 12:15 a.m. (2215
Tuesday GMT) was centered near Cacak about 85 kilometers (55 miles)
south of Belgrade.
	   Its preliminary magnitude was 8 on the Mercalli Scale at the
center and 5 in Belgrade, officials said. In Montenegro, the
seismological institute gave a preliminary measurement of 5.4 on
the Richter Scale.
	   Callers to Belgrade radio stations asked whether NATO had
attacked. The Alliance has threatened possible military action
unless the government halts its crackdown of ethnic Albanian
separatists in the southern province of Kosovo.

Blair seeks at Labor conference to break impasse of IRA arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Lede expected after 1200 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair, attending
his Labor Party's annual conference, has taken new steps to break
the impasse over IRA weapons which is holding up the formation of
Northern Ireland's new assembly.
	   Blair scheduled meetings Wednesday in this north England town
with the leaders of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party and the two main
Protestant parties after urging them ``to close their ears to the
prejudices of their own parties'' and enact the Belfast peace
agreement in full.
	   But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, passing through security
cordons which surround the annual gathering of the governing Labor
Party, struck a defiant note, saying the main issue was not arms
but Britain's continuing control of the Protestnat-dominated
province.
	   ``The aim of democratic Irish opinion, democratic opinion in
Britain and internationally, must be to seek a change in British
policy from one of upholding the union to one of ending the
union,'' Adams told a fringe meeting outside the conference Tuesday
night.
	   ``This is the main challenge facing Mr. Blair and the rest of
us. It is about doing the right thing by Ireland and the people of
our island,'' he added.
	   David Trimble, head of the Protestant Ulster Unionist party and
leader of the still-unformed government, and Seamus Mallon,
Trimble's moderate Catholic deputy, were both to address the
conference Wednesday.
	   The key dispute is over the start of the Irish Republican Army
surrendering weapons as proof of the sincerity of its 14-month-old
truce.
	   Adams wants two posts for Sinn Fein in a new multi-party
administration for Northern Ireland. But Trimble is insisting the
IRA start disarming first.
	   April's agreement called for the IRA and the province's outlawed
pro-British paramilitary groups to disarm under international
supervision by mid-2000, but set no deadline for the process to
start.
	   With Trimble and Mallon seated alongside each other, and Adams
in a separate part of the hall, Blair in his keynote address
Tuesday said the ``vast decent majority of people in Northern
Ireland'' wanted compromise but required ``people to lead them.''
	   Mallon, of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, at a separate
meeting warned that the ``running sore'' must not be allowed to
wreck the peace process.
	   ``Until we can draw the poison from this issue, it is going to
continue to put this agreement in destability,'' he said.
	   Mallon has criticized both Trimble and Adams, saying that the
argument over IRA weaponry was ``being used as a smokescreen to
cover up an unwillingness on either or both sides to actually
assume the responsibilities that this agreement places upon all
political parties.''
	   Trimble and Adams are due to meet again face-to-face after they
return to the Northern Ireland capital, Belfast, from Blackpool.

Dominican government says flooding in farm town was inevitable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Dominican officials
said Tuesday that deadly hurricane flooding in the western town of
San Juan de la Maguana could not have been avoided.
	   The government also disputed local reports that workers at the
nearby Sabaneta Dam opened floodgates to relieve pressure on the
dam when Hurricane Georges struck Sept. 22, sending water into the
town.
	   The dam has no floodgates, and water that reached San Juan de la
Maguana escaped through emergency sluices that cannot be controlled
by reservoir workers, the government said in a prepared statement.
	   It also said that some residents died after leaving storm
shelters and returning to their homes along the San Juan River to
try to protect their belongings.
	   The Red Cross said at least 76 people died in San Juan de la
Maguana, a town of about 20,000 people 75 miles (120 kilometers)
west of Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital. Washed-out bridges
and roads kept relief workers from reaching the town until Monday.
	   The government said Tuesday that disaster officials began
meeting three days before the hurricane arrived to plan the
evacuation of about 12,000 people in flood-prone areas near the
town.
	   Workers used 52 buses and trucks for the evacuation, and the
local truck drivers' association donated the use of another 25.
Authorities ``in several cases encountered harsh opposition'' while
trying to move people from shantytowns on the riverbank, the
statement said.
	   ``Some people, most of them heads of families, refused to
abandon their homes in the hope they could save their belongings,''
it said.

Hamster's feigned death on TV provokes record complaints
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ TV audiences watching a Levi's jeans commercial
saw cute little Kevin the hamster spin merrily on his wheel.
Suddenly he dropped dead on the floor of his cage.
	   As if that weren't enough, Kevin's lifeless form was poked with
a pencil as it lay on a bed of sawdust.
	   More than 500 viewers were so upset they got up off their sofas
to complain to the television regulatory authority last month. It
was the largest number ever to register annoyance with the
Independent Television Commission, which published its monthly
report on Wednesday.
	   The commission logged 309 calls from adult viewers saying they
had been upset by the advertisement. A further 163 complaints were
received from parents saying their children had been upset because
their own pet hamsters had died recently.
	   Nearly 50 people protested about possible cruelty to animals
either in filming, or by children being encouraged to prod pets
with pencils.
	   ``This is the most complained-about advert since the ITC was set
up in 1991,'' said spokeswoman Suzanne Prance.
	   Bartle Bogle Hegarty, the advertisement agency responsible,
argued that the intention was not to upset or shock viewers, but to
be humorous. Their furry star was brought out to prove he was still
alive.
	   The commission said it was satisfied there had been no cruelty
and it did not believe the commercial was likely to encourage
mistreatment of pets.
	   But it said the commercial could upset children, and ruled it
should not appear before 9 p.m.
	   But the ad is no longer running.
	   Kevin's agent and owner, Trevor Smith, was quoted by The Evening
Standard as saying acting offers were flooding in for the
9-month-old rodent, but ``he is fussy.''
	   The point of the Levi's commercial was as obscure to Smith as to
other viewers.
	   ``I didn't get it,'' he was quoted as saying.''The idea of
having a dead hamster at the end of the advert was a second choice.
They wanted to show a bored hamster lying on its side but I
explained that this was impossible because they are never still.''
	   Ms. Prance said distress over Kevin's plight outstripped the
previous record holder, which received more than 400 complaints.
	   ``This was an Ikea advert which viewers thought implied that you
could get rid of an employee to enable you to buy furniture from
Ikea,'' Ms. Prance said.

Libya questions U.S.-British proposal for Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous with U.S., British response &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Libya used its General Assembly speech to
outline its problems with a proposal to try two Libyan suspects in
the 1988 Pan Am bombing _ and got a sharp rebuke by the United
States and Britain for doing so.
	   Both countries accused Libya of stalling on the proposal and
demanding clarifications where none were necessary. ``Instead of
clear acceptance, however, Libya has responded with more conditions
and sharp rhetoric,'' U.S. deputy ambassador Peter Burleigh said
Tuesday night.
	   He urged Libya give its qualified and unconditional acceptance
of the proposal _ and pressed Libya's friends to urge Tripoli do
the same.
	   Libyan Ambassador Abuzed Dorda criticized the U.S.-British
proposal in comments to world leaders gathered for the assembly's
annual debate.
	   He balked at the decision to hold the trial at a Dutch air base
used by Americans and questioned why Tripoli must provide witnesses
for the prosecution.
	   Libya accepts the proposed trial before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands, Dorda said. But the government has questions that must
be answered before it will turn over the two intelligence agents
accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight, which exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   Libya has refused to hand over the men for years, saying they
wouldn't get a fair trial in the United States or Britain.
	   The Security Council has threatened Libya with more sanctions if
it doesn't turn the men over promptly. As an incentive, council
members agreed last month to suspend sanctions that bar air travel
to and from Libya once the two arrive in the Netherlands.
	   Dorda said agreements must be reached on which witnesses will be
called, where the suspects would be jailed if convicted, and how
they would be transported safely to and from the Netherlands.
	   If convicted, the men should be jailed in Libya or the
Netherlands, not Britain, Dorda said.
	   He said Libya wants guarantees that the two suspects, Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, won't be extradited
to the United States or Britain, and that their legal and religious
rights would be respected.
	   He questioned why a military base in the Netherlands used by
Americans was selected as the venue. ``That's the only place
left?'' he asked in an exasperated speech.
	   Dorda also questioned why Libya was being asked to provide
evidence and witnesses for a trial, when the United States and
Britain are making the accusations.
	   ``They have the responsibility to provide the evidence and the
witnesses for the prosecution,'' Dorda said.
	   After his fiery address, Dorda concluded by pledging Libya's
desire to resolve the case.
	   ``We would like to confirm our seriousness and our desire and
our willingness to close the file of this case and other files as
well, and open a new chapter in our relations with the countries
concerned based on mutual respect and noninterference in internal
affairs,'' Dorda said.

Body confirmed as that of Japanese tourist Kayo Matsuzawa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Police on Wednesday used dental
records to confirm that a decayed body found in a downtown building
eight days ago was that of missing Japanese tourist Kayo Matsuzawa.
	   The 29-year-old Matsuzawa had not been seen since she arrived in
Auckland from Christchurch on Sept. 11 for some sightseeing.
	   The positive identification came after a forensic dentist
checked two sets of dental records sent from Japan.
	   Det. Senior Sgt. Kevin Baker said next-of-kin had been informed
and police were in close contact with the women's family.
	   Matsuzawa, who came from Yamagata in northern Japan, arrived in
New Zealand late last year for an extended holiday and was based in
Christchurch.
	   She checked into a downtown backpackers' hostel on her arrival
in Auckland, paying a deposit for a room, where she put her
belongings.
	   A naked, decaying body was found last week in a locked closet in
a building only a few hundred meters (yards) from Queen Street
Backpackers hostel.
	   A Japanese tour guide in Christchurch, Stuart Henwood, said he
was concerned that many Japanese still came to New Zealand
`thinking it is so safe they can wander off and do whatever they
like,''
	   The director of the Nippon New Zealand Friendship Association,
Robin de Clive-Lowe, said the Japanese government would probably
issue a warning to tourists visiting New Zealand. The death would
impact on inbound tourism.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prayerful chants echoed off the yellow-pink
stones of the Western wall and the candlelit walls of countless
synagogues Wednesday when Israel marked Judaism's holiest day.
	   Jews the world over mark Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, by
praying and fasting, soul-searching and repenting, seeking God's
forgiveness. The holiday began at sundown Tuesday and lasts until
sundown Wednesday.
	   ``It's the time to confess your sins right out loud,'' said
Jerusalem tour guide Shmaryahi Yahav, 69. ``You try to improve your
communication with God, and with other people too.''
	   But even on a day of introspection, real-world tensions
intruded.
	   Military security was tight, the Palestinian lands were sealed
off, and in the West Bank, a car packed with powerful explosives
blew up Tuesday, raising suspicions it was being readied for a
suicide attack.
	   There was some glimmer of hope for the Mideast peace process,
however. On Tuesday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in New York
accepted Israel's formula for turning over more land on the West
Bank and voiced hope that an agreement could be concluded at a
White House summit in mid-October.
	   In Israel proper, the holiday presented a rare spectacle: that
of a frantic and frenetic country simply shutting down.
	   Streets emptied as people hurried home for a final pre-fast
meal. For 24 hours, shops and businesses are shuttered, buses and
trains stop running, and virtually no one drives.
	   There are no international or domestic flights. Seaports are
closed. Border crossings are shut. News broadcasts cease.
	   At the Western Wall in Jerusalem's walled Old City, Judaism's
holiest site, tens of thousands of Jews gathered for prayers,
swaying and chanting before the expanse of yellow stone. Prayers
continued late into the floodlit night.
	   The day marks something of a truce in ongoing skirmishes between
religious and secular Israelis. Even though most Israelis describe
themselves as secular, nearly all go to synagogue on Yom Kippur,
and most also fast.
	   Synagogues are so crowded that many require seat reservations,
but by tradition, no worshipper is turned away.
	   Israel's entire army observes a holiday fast, and military
messes served up a heavy, hearty meal just beforehand. Large
military installations have synagogue buildings, but remote
outposts set up makeshift ones in tents and bunkers.
	   The army insists religious observances don't compromise
preparedness _ a pledge that carries a special meaning this year,
the 25th anniversary of the Yom Kippur war.
	   Israel was caught badly off guard when Arab neighbors attacked
on Oct. 6, 1973, when the holy day fell that year. Almost 2,700
Israeli soldiers were slain in the 2 1/2-week conflict, shattering
the country's self-confidence about its military prowess.
	   As it normally does during Jewish holidays, Israel imposed a
blanket closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, refusing entry to
all Palestinians. Soldiers manned roadblocks and police checked
cars going into the Old City.
	   As a prelude to Yom Kippur, Jews are supposed to try to make
amends to fellow humans before they do with God. It's an old ritual
with modern touches like using e-mail to apologize for snapping at
a colleague or letting down a friend.
	   Yedideya Saidin, who runs a Jerusalem jewelry shop, looked up
from work over a fine silver chain to talk about cutthroat
competition in his trade.
	   ``You know how it is in business, sometimes you do things you
wish you hadn't,'' he said ruefully. ``So when this time of year
comes, we all just have to forgive each other.''
	   Sometimes, though, atonement is more of a formality.
	   On an Israeli TV talk-and-politics show aired Sunday, Jewish
settler leader Ahron Domb delivered an angry tirade against Arafat.
Then, in almost the same breath, he turned to Arafat's aide Ahmed
Tibi and asked pardon for any slights in the past year.
	   Tibi, a Palestinian who holds Israeli citizenship and is
familiar with the Yom Kippur custom, nodded. Then he gave Domb a
big grin.

Japan's industrial output falls in August

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Production at recession-plagued Japan's factories
and mines slipped 0.6 percent in August from July, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said Wednesday.
	   The decline was smaller than forecast by economists surveyed by
Dow Jones Newswires, who projected on average that industrial
production would shrink by 0.8 percent. The figures were adjusted
for seasonal factors.
	   It was the second straight month of decline following July's 0.8
percent fall. In June, output rose 1.7 percent, which had been the
first gain in four months.
	   Industrial shipments were also down, slipping 0.9 in August,
while inventories dropped 0.5 percent, MITI said.
	   The ministry forecast output would rise 3.0 percent in September
from August, although it said production would fall 1.0 percent in
October.
	   Japan is suffering its worst recession in decades amid a
stubborn slump in consumer demand and growing worries about the
health of the country's debt-ridden banks.
	   In a sign of continued weak consumer sentiment, MITI also
announced that sales at Japan's major department stores and
supermarkets fell 5.1 percent in August from the same month a year
ago to 1.768 trillion yen (dlrs 13.2 billion).
	   The figure, adjusted for changes in the number of stores, marked
the fourth consecutive month of year-on-year falls.

Australian leader ``greatly concerned'' about events in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Reports that Malaysia's former deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim had been beaten while in a police
lockup raised further concerns that the government was embracing
authoritarian rule, Australian Prime Minister John Howard said
Wednesday.
	   Anwar told a court on Tuesday that he was beaten while being
held in a police lockup after his arrest nine days ago.
	   Howard said in an interview with Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio that he hoped the allegations that Anwar had been beaten in
custody were not true.
	   ``But if they are true, they are a matter of immense and deep
concern to Malaysia's many friends in the region, including many
people in Australia who hold that country in very high regard, who
value our relationship with the Malaysian people,'' Howard said.
	   ``I am concerned that there is a greater embrace of
authoritarian rule in that country.
	   ``I am concerned at the prospect, the sight, the specter of the
apparatus of the state being used to settle political scores,''
Howard said.
	   Howard made similar comments last week, prompting a stinging
rebuke from Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, who said
the Australian prime minister was ``wrong, absolutely'' and should
``check the real facts'' before making accusations.
	   This was followed by a formal protest to Australia's high
commissioner in Kuala Lumpur.

Food rationing considered; industry shutdowns spread to other
</HEADLINE>
states &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ As the effects of Victoria state's
shutdown of its natural gas system spread Wednesday, stores
considered rationing bread and milk, and factories in other states
began closing down.
	   ``I think it's worse than the state of Victoria,'' state Premier
Jeff Kennett said. ``It is going to cost Australia ... in the order
of hundreds of millions of dollars a day.''
	   The crisis began with a huge fire at Esso's Longford gas plant
on Friday that killed two men and injured eight.
	   The plant supplied more than 80 percent of the natural gas for
Australia's second-most populous state, and some 1.4 million
households and 100,000 businesses may be without natural gas for at
least two weeks.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food.
	   Some industry sectors have speculated the aftermath of the fires
could stretch into six months, even if gas is restored within a
couple of weeks.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions, which took two days to extinguish.
	   At least 100,000 workers in Victoria have been laid off as the
Ford and Toyota auto factories, glass and brick-making plants,
bakeries, dairies and many other industries shut down.
	   The Franklins supermarket chain, with 48 stores in Victoria,
alerted store managers that in the event of serious shortages they
might ration food, especially bread and milk.
	   Rationing has not been seen in Victoria since World War II.
	   Coles Supermarkets, the biggest supermarket chain in Victoria
with 99 stores, said it would ``not allow people to buy what we
regard as commercial quantities of basic items,'' said state
manager Malcolm Daviess.
	   The industrial crisis spread interstate, with other factories
that rely on business with Victoria having to lay off workers.
	   _In South Australia, two of Australia's largest automotive
companies, Holden and Mitsubishi, announced they were preparing for
several days of lost production because of a lack of parts from
Victoria.
	   Holden is to shut down Wednesday night, sending home its 4,500
workers until at least Tuesday.
	   Mitsubishi expected to remain open until Thursday, but the
operation of the plant was in doubt next week.
	   _Victoria state's auto industry is losing 10 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.9 million) a day in exports.
	   _In New South Wales, 600 workers at BTR Automotives have been
laid off as parts from Victoria ran out.
	   Lawyers and unions clamored to launch legal action against Esso
and gas distributor VENCorp for damages to business and consumers
while economists warned the disaster's effect on Australia's growth
rate depended on its duration.
	   ``With speculation that it might be up to six months, if it's
that sort of period then it's going to have a big impact in terms
of industrial output and people being stood down,'' said Matthew
Drennan, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell.
	   The Australian Industry Group estimates the crisis could cost
100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) each day it
goes on.
	   ``If the disruption of the gas supply persists for more than a
week, then the impact on September quarter's gross domestic product
(GDP) could be of the order of 0.1 of a percentage point, perhaps a
third of the increase in GDP that forecasters had been expecting
for the September quarter,'' ANZ Bank chief economist Saul Eslake
said.
	   ``Of course it now seems that this disruption may last for at
least two weeks, with some effects lingering beyond that, so
there'll be an impact on the December quarter figures as well.
	   Victorian residents, facing fines of 500 Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 290), were forced to turn off their gas meters Saturday
after the state's supply authority, VENCorp., ordered the shutdown
of the state's system.

May unlikely to front Pakistani hearing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian cricketer Tim May,
who accused Pakistan's Salmi Malik of trying to bribe him, said he
was unlikely to appear before a Pakistani hearing on the issue.
	   Pakistan authorities are investigating bribery and match-fixing
allegations against senior players.
	   Investigating judge, Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum, has
reportedly issued a request to May, Shane Warne, Mark Waugh and
captain Mark Taylor to discuss the allegations. May, Warne and
Waugh accused Malik of trying to pay them to play poorly on
Australia's 1994 tour of Pakistan.
	   Malik has denied the allegations and a previous inquiry found no
evidence against him.
	   ``I am to request you that if convenient and so desired, Mark
Taylor, Shane Warne, Tim May and Mark Waugh, or any other A said May. ``There's a particular concern, I'm no longer a
cricketer and I have a wife who is going to have a baby and I have
other commitments.''
	   May, now the head of the Australian Cricketers' Association,
said he would meet with ACB officials to find out what was
happening.
	   Australian Cricket Board chief executive Malcolm Speed said the
players may be available in the future, but not during the
scheduled sitting this Saturday, which is three days in to the
first test at Rawalpindi. The hearing is to be held about 300
kilometers away in Lahore.
	   ``They've had four years to do this and to say to them, look, to
break into the test match and get on a plane and travel quite a
long way to go to a hearing, that's just inappropriate,'' Speed
told Australian radio. ``We're there to play cricket, we'll be
concentrating on the cricket.''
	   He said there was no indication that the hearing could be held
at time where it did not interfere with the tour.
	   ``No, there hasn't been. We're concerned that this whole thing
has become a distraction for both sides,'' Speed said. ``It's
obviously going to be a distraction for the Pakistan team. We want
our players to concentrate on the cricket and not on this bribery
investigation.''
	   Both Taylor and Waugh are willing to appear but only with
official approval by the ACB. Warne is not on tour because of a
shoulder injury.

Dollar lower, Tokyo stocks rebound moderately in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged lower against the yen early
Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut its short-term interest
rates by a quarter-percentage point. Japanese stock prices rose
moderately.
	   The dollar bought 134.28 yen in early trading, down 0.14 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
134.45 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 80.43 points,
or 0.58 percent, to 13,901.86 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed down 87.94 points, or
0.63 percent.
	   Fed policy-makers, meeting in Washington, lowered the benchmark
federal funds rate to 5.25 percent from 5.50 percent. The move had
been widely expected after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had hinted
recently that a cut was likely.
	   Many analysts and investors had agreed that an interest rate cut
would cushion the U.S. economy from global economic turmoil and
also help revive slumping economies around the world.
	   But as traders absorbed the Fed action, it was seen as largely
insufficient, eventually sending U.S. stocks _ and then the dollar
_ lower.
	   ``The 0.25 percentage-point cut left more room for further
easing in the future,'' said Hidenobu Yanagisawa, deputy general
manager at Fuji Bank.
	   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average, which was up
15 points as Fed officials concluded their meeting, dropped 28.32
points _ or 0.3 percent _ to close at 8,080.52.
	   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange moved higher as some
institutional investors bid up stocks on Wednesday, the last day of
Japan's fiscal first half, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 9.49 points, or 0.89 percent, to 1,072.39. The
TOPIX closed down 0.62 points, or 0.06 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.785 percent from Tuesday's finish of 0.805 percent,
driving its price up to 109.15 yen from 108.96 yen.

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Crash investigators want to bring in
more heavy equipment to recover wreckage from Swissair Flight 111
before the beginning of the North Atlantic winter storm season.
	   Investigators are worried that currents stirred by surface
storms will scatter human remains and debris on the bottom of the
ocean, making recovery more difficult.
	   ``In November, it's not fit for man or beast out on the ocean,
and we've got to contend with that,'' Jim Harris, a spokesman for
Canada's Transportation Safety Board, said Monday.
	   Investigators have set an Oct. 31 deadline to recover all the
wreckage. So far, 10 percent or less of the 200-foot-long
(60-meter-long) MD-11 has been brought ashore since it crashed on
Sept. 2, killing all 229 people on board. The flight was flying
from New York to Geneva.
	   As of Tuesday, 42 of the crash victims had been identified.
Investigators used dental records and fingerprints to make the most
recent identifications.
	   Meanwhile, hundreds of roses, carnations and other flowers were
tossed into the sea above the wreckage site Tuesday and a priest
with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police led a ceremony to honor
those killed.
	   The flowers were left by mourners at the base of the lighthouse
in Peggy's Cove in the days following the crash.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's two biggest cities will play host to
the upcoming Confederations Cup, the soccer's world governing body
FIFA announced Tuesday.
	   The eight-nation competition will be held in Mexico City's
Azteca Stadium and Guadalajara's Jalisco stadium January 8-20.
	   Guadalajara was chosen over other cities such as Monterrey and
Queretaro because Jalisco Stadium seats 70,000 _ compared to
Monterrey's 55,000-seater _ a spokesman for the Mexican Soccer
Federation said. Azteca holds 114,000 people.
	   National teams competing at the tournament include the United
States, Mexico, Bolivia, Brazil, France, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, as
well as the winner of the Oceania Nations Cup, still being played
in Australia.
	   FIFA President Joseph Blatter will arrive in Mexico on Saturday
to supervise Sunday's tournament draw.
	   Earlier this month, the heads of several soccer associations
said they were unhappy with FIFA's decision to hold the tournament
in January _ when European leagues are in full swing and those in
the southern hemisphere are off.
	   With clubs required to release players for their national teams,
many squads are left without their stars for league competition.
	   Two weeks ago, Australian soccer coach Raul Blanco urged
European teams not to field second-string sides at next year's
Confederations Cup despite it being scheduled in the northern
hemisphere's off-season.
	   Blanco said it's possible that European nations may not send
full-strength teams to Mexico if the tournament is held in January.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's new sports hero named
Ronaldo is from a poor background like his soccer star namesake.
	   But Ronaldo da Costa, 28, new marathon world record holder,
tasted the high life Tuesday by flying home in a helicopter.
	   Since clocking 2 hours, 6 minutes, 5 seconds in the Berlin
marathon nine days ago, Costa had wanted to return in style.
	   So a helicopter took him about 80 miles (130 kilometers) from
Rio airport to Descoberto, his hometown in the central-eastern
state of Minas Gerais.
	   There, his arrival stopped the tiny agricultural town in its
tracks, with all 5,000 residents turning out to cheer him.
	   More riches now lie ahead for Costa who recently considered
giving up athletics because he wasn't earning from it.
	   Nike, sponsors of soccer's Ronaldo, are reportedly interested in
putting money behind him.

Islanders to return to Coliseum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINEOLA, New York (AP) _ The New York Islanders were ordered on
Tuesday to play their home games in Nassau Coliseum after a judge
ruled the arena was safe to play in.
	   State Supreme Court Judge Burton Joseph granted Nassau County's
request for a preliminary injunction preventing the team from
playing home games at any location other than the Coliseum.
	   The team moved out of the arena earlier this month and filed a
dlrs 10 million federal lawsuit against SMG _ formerly the
Spectacor Management Group _ claiming the arena was a danger to
fans and players. That suit has not been resolved.
	   The Coliseum is owned by Nassau County and leased to SMG _ a
Philadelphia-based management company.
	   Tuesday's ruling came after an independent engineering
inspection of the 26-year-old arena, paid for by the National
Hockey League, deemed the building safe.
	   The Islanders had claimed the arena was falling apart, citing an
engineering report showing the hoist system for the scoreboard was
unsafe, there was crumbling exterior concrete and an inadequate
fire safety system.
	   Those problems have been repaired or will be fixed soon, the
team said.
	   Even though they were ordered to return to the Coliseum, the
Islanders declared the judge's order a victory.
	   ``This ruling reflects the simple fact that for the first time
in years, the doors to this building were pried open to safety
inspectors, abuses were found and they're being remedied so that
fans and players can come here in safety,'' said David Seldin,
president of New York Sports Ventures, which owns the team.
	   The Islanders hope to build a new arena within the next three

Oil officials: China searching for oil in southern Iraq
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ China's National Petroleum Corp. has begun
surveying its concession in southern Iraq for oil, Iraqi Oil
Ministry officials has disclosed.
	   It was unclear if the activity violates U.N. sanctions, which
ban most trade and financial dealings with Baghdad.
	   On Tuesday, the Iraqi officials said the state-owned Chinese
company had begun work under an agreement it signed with Baghdad in
June 1997 for development of the Al-Ahdab field.
	   China is one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council and has long opposed the continuation of U.N. sanctions on
Iraq.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil, ban air travel and bar most financial
transactions.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions will not be
lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq on Aug. 5 announced it no longer would cooperate with the
inspectors, and the Security Council has suspended its regular
review of the sanctions to try to force Baghdad to change its mind.
	   CNPC has rights to the Al-Ahdab field, expected to yield a
billion barrels of oil, in Kut province, which is 170 kilometers
(105 miles) south of Baghdad.
	   A Baghdad magazine, Nabed al-Shabab, reported Tuesday that joint
Chinese-Iraqi teams of engineers were conducting surveys at
Al-Ahdab.
	   The magazine quoted Karim Ahmad, a senior Iraqi oil official, as
saying ``exploration has been going on for about two months.''
	   The Oil Ministry officials, speaking on the customary condition
of anonymity, confirmed reports in the state-run press this week
that China and Iraq have set up a joint company to drill at
Al-Ahdab.
	   They said the Chinese company was working through an Iraqi firm,
the General Company for Oil Explorations, which has been digging
exploratory wells.
	   The officials said the Chinese contractor already has supplied a
detailed plan for development of Al-Ahdab and that the Iraqi side
has accepted it.
	   China also is obligated by the dlrs 1 billion pact to gather the
geological and seismic information needed to start production.
	   Iraq has the world's second largest reserves of oil after Saudi
Arabia.
	   Russia, another permanent member of the Security Council, also
has signed an oil development deal with Iraq.
	   On Tuesday, the Middle East Economic Survey, published in
Cyprus, said that work by a Russian consortium led by Lukoil ``is
inching ahead'' in its concession of West Qurna, which is 200
kilometers (120 miles) south of Kut.
	   MEES said the consortium was ``encountering not only
sanctions-induced problems but also financial difficulties as a
result of Russia's economic crisis.''
	   It said Lukoil ``has been able to carry out a very limited
amount of work on the ground in Iraq'' in the deal, which was
structured so it would not violate U.N. sanctions by delaying
actual development work.
	   Russia's dlrs 3.5 billion contract was signed in March 1997 and
calls for the development of up to 8 billion barrels of proven
reserves over a 23-year period.
	   Plans call for production of 100,000 barrels a day of crude by
March 2000.

 &UR; Hurricane victims storm relief trucks in Dominican Republic &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Has not moved 08 &QL; 
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ At a relief operation
for hurricane victims in a dirt-poor barrio, charity met up with
Charles Darwin.
	   Throngs of starving Dominicans _ some of them refugees, all of
them desperate _ on Tuesday swarmed a convoy of dump trucks loaded
with water jugs, cooking oil, and bags of pillows and clothing.
Edgy police and relief workers swatted them with sticks.
	   In the melee, the aid went to those who could jump the highest,
shoulder the heaviest burdens and bear the most punishment.
	   It was survival of the fittest _ and it underscored the mounting
desperation brewing throughout the hurricane-ravaged Dominican
Republic as tens of thousands of residents enter their second week
deprived of life's most basic essentials.
	   ``This makes me ashamed,'' said neighborhood organizer Rosa
Cabrera, who had hoped to collect provisions for nearby refugee
shelters. ``There are people (here) who aren't even refugees.
They're just the most able ones, and now they're going to eat all
the food.''
	   Donated by thousands of Dominican immigrants living in New York
City and New Jersey, the provisions were being delivered to one of
the capital city's most impoverished and hard-hit areas.
	   Flood waters swallowed up hundreds, perhaps thousands of flimsy
homes along a river bank in the Sabana Perdida shantytown after
Hurricane Georges crashed into the island nation on September 22.
	   The storm, which killed at least 200 in the Dominican Republic
and over 300 in the whole Carribean, drove 7,000 residents into a
half dozen squalid shelters in Santo Domingo.
	   Dominican-born businessman Fernando Mateo, a self-made
millionaire who grew up in New York and organized the relief
shipments, said his idea was to take the aid straight to the
people.
	   In the past, he said, disaster relief and government assistance
to the poor had been stolen by corrupt officials or manipulated for
political gain.
	   ``This is not a time for politics,'' he said. ``This is a time
to get the food to the people who need it.''
	   In Sabana Perdida on Tuesday, what began as a well-intentioned
and orderly relief effort descended into chaos.
	   Hundreds of residents streamed past a chain-link fence at a
refugee compound where the aid trucks were parked.
	   A call to form single-file lines outside the 10-foot (3-meter)
barrier was ignored, as hungry people squeezed through narrow
cracks or scrambled over the fence top, indifferent to the barbed
wire digging into their bare or sandaled feet.
	   Unable to restore order, volunteers manning the trucks began to
hurl boxes, bottles and bags down at those able to stand tallest in
all the pushing and shoving.
	   Lydia Manzego's family came away with two bags of clothes and
two boxes of food _ including rice, orange juice, spaghetti, and
cans of tomato sauce and evaporated milk.
	   Her teenage Daughther Yahai, one of six children, leaped the
fence.
	   Many others came away emptyhanded.
	   ``I threw myself in there, but I couldn't get my hands on
anything,'' said a sullen looking Felix Jimenez, a 34-year-old
father whose home was carried off by the raging river. ``We have
nothing to eat.''

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Police on Wednesday used dental
records to confirm that a decayed body found in a downtown building
eight days ago was that of missing Japanese tourist Kayo Matsuzawa.
	   The 29-year-old Matsuzawa had not been seen since she arrived in
Auckland from Christchurch on Sept. 11 for some sightseeing.
	   The positive identification came after a forensic dentist
checked two sets of dental records sent from Japan.
	   Det. Senior Sgt. Kevin Baker said next-of-kin had been informed
and police were in close contact with the women's family.
	   Matsuzawa, who came from Yamagata in northern Japan, arrived in
New Zealand late last year for an extended holiday and was based in
Christchurch.
	   She checked into a downtown backpackers' hostel on her arrival
in Auckland, paying a deposit for a room, where she put her
belongings.
	   A naked, decaying body was found last week in a locked closet in
a building only a few hundred meters (yards) from Queen Street
Backpackers hostel.
	   A Japanese tour guide in Christchurch, Stuart Henwood, said he
was concerned that many Japanese still came to New Zealand
`thinking it is so safe they can wander off and do whatever they
like.''
	   The director of the Nippon New Zealand Friendship Association,
Robin de Clive-Lowe, said the Japanese government would probably
issue a warning to tourists visiting New Zealand, and said the
death would impact on inbound tourism.

Industry shutdowns spread as Australian gas shortage worsens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Safeway is largest state supermarket chain, and
is limiting bread purchases. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Stores in the state of Victoria
began rationing bread while factories in other states began closing
down Wednesday as the effects of a major natural gas system
shutdown spread.
	   ``I think it's worse than the state of Victoria,'' state Premier
Jeff Kennett said. ``It is going to cost Australia ... in the order
of hundreds of millions of dollars a day.''
	   The crisis began with a huge fire at Esso's Longford gas plant
in Victoria state on Friday that killed two men and injured eight.
	   The plant supplied more than 80 percent of the natural gas for
Australia's second-most populous state, and some 1.4 million
households and 100,000 businesses may be without natural gas for at
least two weeks.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food.
	   Some industry sectors have speculated the aftermath of the fires
could last up to six months, even if gas is restored within a
couple of weeks.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions, which took two days to extinguish.
	   At least 100,000 workers in Victoria have been laid off as the
Ford and Toyota auto factories, glass and brick-making plants,
bakeries, dairies and many other industries shut down.
	   The Franklins supermarket chain, with 48 stores in Victoria,
alerted store managers that in the event of serious shortages they
might ration food, especially bread and milk.
	   Rationing has not been seen in Victoria since World War II.
	   Coles Supermarkets, with 99 stores, said it would ``not allow
people to buy what we regard as commercial quantities of basic
items,'' said state manager Malcolm Daviess.
	   Safeways, the state's biggest supermarket chain with 138 stores,
is also limiting bread purchases by its customers.
	   ``We are attempting to restrict them to two or three loaves per
person so that those stores have sufficient bread supplies for
people coming in later in the day,'' Safeways state finance manager
Tony Parle said.
	   The industrial crisis spread interstate, with other factories
that rely on business with Victoria having to lay off workers.
	   In South Australia, two of Australia's largest automotive
companies, Holden and Mitsubishi, announced they were preparing for
several days of lost production because of a lack of parts from
Victoria.
	   Holden is to shut down Wednesday night, sending home its 4,500
workers until at least Tuesday.
	   Mitsubishi expected to remain open until Thursday, but the
operation of the plant for next week was in doubt.
	   Victoria state's auto industry is losing 10 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.9 million) a day in exports. In New South
Wales, 600 workers at BTR Automotives have been laid off as parts
from Victoria ran out.
	   Lawyers and unions clamored to launch legal action against Esso
and gas distributor VENCorp for damages to business and consumers
while economists warned the disaster's effect on Australia's growth
rate depended on its duration.
	   ``With speculation that it might be up to six months, if it's
that sort of period then it's going to have a big impact in terms
of industrial output and people being stood down,'' said Matthew
Drennan, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell.
	   The Australian Industry Group estimates the crisis could cost
100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) each day it
goes on.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

 &UR; Border town practically washed away in hurricane flood waters &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Flood waters unleashed by Hurricane
Georges washed away much of a low-lying border town, killing at
least 85 people with many more feared dead, U.N. civilian police
revealed.
	   Tuesday's discovery of the devastated town of Fonds Verrettes
raised the deadly toll taken by Georges in Haiti, the Western
Hemisphere's poorest nation.
	   Rains began falling in the town, built on a dry river bed some
50 miles (80 kms) east of the capital, when George was pounding
neighboring Dominican Republic Sept. 22.
	   Rising waters sliced through the streets that night, demolishing
100 houses and damaging 200 more, said U.N. civilian police
instructor Hubert Ouellete, 51.
	   ``A lot of people were asleep in their homes, covered by
darkness. The water built up fast and strong, even moving rocks,''
he said after returning from the devastated town Tuesday.
	   The day of the flooding was a market day. Many merchants from
nearby regions, unable to return home because of the rains, had
bedded down along the streets.
	   The official nationwide death toll, including the 85 confirmed
dead in Fonds Verrettes, was 147 Tuesday, with at least 40 missing.
	   In Fonds Verrettes, the La Croix Catholic church and Nazareen
Baptist Church were totally destroyed, as well as the town clinic,
said Ouellette, who is in Haiti to help train and monitor Haiti's
fledgling national police force.
	   In some places the mighty flood cut a 35-feet-deep (12-meter)
trench in the river bed, undermining the foundation of buildings,
he said.
	   For decades, poor peasants have been cutting down pine trees to
make charcoal and supplement their meager income. Because the
highlands surrounding Fonds Verrettes have no forest cover to
absorb torrential rains, all the water came crashing into the town.

Italian authorities request extradition of wanted man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Italian authorities on Wednesday
requested the extradition of a man on kidnapping charges who was
arrested at Sydney airport last month.
	   Giovanni Farina, 48, is wanted by Italian police for the
kidnapping of an Italian businessman in June last year, Sydney
Central Local Court was told Wednesday.
	   Already in custody over passport, currency and assault charges,
Farina was arrested Wednesday morning on a provisional extradition
warrant.
	   A statement given to the court said Farina faced up to 30 years
in prison if found guilty of the kidnapping and five billion lira
(U.S. dlrs 3 million) ransom demand.
	   Magistrate Derek Price remanded Farina in custody until Nov. 11.
	   Farina made no application for bail and entered no plea.
	   The man identified as Farina maintains he is 39-year-old
businessman Luigi Valiante.
	   He was arrested Aug. 15 after customs officials discovered a
large amount of undeclared cash in his bags. Under Australian law,
it is illegal to import a large amount of currency without
declaring it.
	   Farina is accused of masterminding the kidnappings of wealthy
business people whose ears were chopped off when ransom money was
not paid in time.
	   In one attack, Giuseppe Soffiantini's ears were cut off and sent
to a television station before his family paid the ransom.

Tyson hearing delayed over missed deadline
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson will have to wait a little longer to
find out if he will be allowed to return to the ring.
	   Tyson was supposed to go before Nevada boxing authorities
Saturday for a final determination on his license. But the hearing
was postponed Tuesday because of delays in getting reports on a
battery of psychological tests performed on the former heavyweight
champion.
	   A date for the new hearing probably won't be determined until
Thursday, said Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada
Athletic Commission.
	   ``It's a matter of our doctors being able to read the reports
and then getting all the commissioners together at one time,''
Ratner said. ``I'll eventually come up with a date.''
	   Tyson's doctors were to have the reports given to the commission
by 5 p.m. Monday. But shortly after that time, the commission got a
fax saying the reports were not completed and likely wouldn't be
ready until Wednesday.
	   Commissioner James Nave said that didn't give the commission
enough time to go over the five days of tests performed on Tyson at
Massachusetts General Hospital. The tests began Sept. 23.
	   ``We want enough time to do our homework,'' Nave said.
	   The delay in the commission hearing could threaten plans by
Tyson's advisers for the former champion to fight a comeback bout
before the end of the year. Though Tyson has been training lightly,
it would probably take more than two months to train properly for
and promote the fight.
	   Dr. Ronald Schouten, head of the team that examined Tyson, sent
a letter to commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem, saying the
reports would be completed Wednesday.
	   ``Unfortunately, due to the length of the evaluation process,
the scoring on the psychological and neuropsychological testing
have not been completed,'' Schouten wrote.
	   Ghanem said he was disappointed the reports were not ready. The
commission is to determine whether Tyson could regain the boxing
license that was stripped from him for biting Evander Holyfield's
ears.
	   ``I don't know what is going on, but it is very disappointing,''
Ghanem said.
	   Tyson adviser Jeff Wald said he has not seen the results of the
tests but believes they will clear Tyson to box again.
	   ``I assume if they found him unfit to box they would have told
us,'' Wald said.
	   Tyson underwent a six-hour hearing Sept. 19 before the
commission, which was unhappy with the limited scope of
psychological testimony presented on behalf of the former
heavyweight champion and ordered that independent tests be
conducted.
	   The testing had appeared to be the only obstacle standing in the
way of the commission relicensing Tyson, following the first
hearing.
	   But Ghanem and Nave now say they want to hear about Tyson's
scuffle with two men following a Maryland traffic accident before
they make a decision.
	   Wald said he hoped the Maryland situation would also be
addressed to the commission's satisfaction.

Amnesty International, U.S. slam Malaysia over police brutality
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Amnesty International has called
for a probe into allegations of police brutality against detained
opposition activists, including ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim. The U.S. State Department also slammed Malaysia for
mistreating political prisoners.
	   ``Anwar's treatment at the hands of the police shows the
government's blatant disregard for basic human rights,'' said a
statement from the London-based human rights group, issued late
Tuesday.
	   Making his first appearance in court Tuesday, Anwar said that
after his arrest on Sept. 20 he was led handcuffed and blindfolded
to a police lockup where he was greeted with a punch that knocked
him unconscious.
	   Anwar also said said his left eye was so swollen that he could
not use it for two days after the beating. The eye was still
bruised when he appeared in court.
	   ``We are deeply concerned as well by reports of police brutality
during the incarceration of Anwar,'' said a statement, also late
Tuesday, by deputy spokesman James Foley.
	   Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth called in Malaysia's
acting ambassador to Washington to convey U.S. concerns, Foley
said.
	   Malaysian police said they would investigate.
	   On Wednesday, several hundred riot police surrounded a
courthouse in a Kuala Lumpur suburb where Anwar was driven to be
charged on one count of performing an illegal sex act.
	   On Tuesday, he was charged formally on five counts of corruption
during his tenure as deputy prime minister and finance minister and
on four counts of illegal sex. Homosexual acts are illegal in
Islamic Malaysia.
	   Anwar pleaded innocent to all nine charges on Tuesday. A trial
is likely to commence soon in the High Court.
	   Since he was fired on Sept. 2, Mahathir has cracked down on
political critics. Apart from Anwar, 17 others have been arrested
under the harsh Internal Security Act which allows for indefinite
imprisonment without trial.
	   Anwar was arrested after he led a huge rally that demanded
Mahathir's resignation. Kuala Lumpur has been convulsed with
regular pro-Anwar protests since his arrest.
	   To block a potential protest near the courthouse, police also
stationed a water cannon and prevented people from gathering in
groups.
	   While the government has tried to keep public attention focused
on the allegations of homosexuality against Anwar, escalating
political protests and Tuesday's exposure of police brutality have
taken centerstage.
	   ``I was hit very hard on the left part of my neck and slapped
left and right until blood flowed down my nose,'' Anwar told the
court.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, followed her husband back to the
federal police headquarters, where an eye doctor determined that
his retina wasn't permanently damaged.
	   ``When I first saw him, I was shocked and stunned,'' said
Azizah, an eye specialist herself who gave up her practice years
ago to take care of their six children. ``After all he's been
through, his spirit is very strong and I'm proud of that.''

Yankees beat Rangers 2-0, Red Sox batter Indians 11-3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yankees-Rangers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Wells delivered a perfect postseason start
for the New York Yankees.
	   Playing their most important game in nearly six months, the
Yankees looked every bit like the winningest team in AL history,
beating the Texas Rangers 2-0 Tuesday night in Game 1 of their
division series.
	   Wells pitched eight strong innings as the Yankees, who won their
final seven games to finish with 114 victories, picked up exactly
where they left off.
	   Wells, whose perfect game in May highlighted New York's dream
year, improved to 5-0 in postseason action with the Yankees,
Baltimore, Cincinnati and Toronto.
	   The left-hander gave up five hits and struck out nine. He kept
Juan Gonzalez from hitting a ball out of the infield and escaped
his only real jam by fanning Mike Simms to end the seventh with
runners on first and second.
	   Mariano Rivera pitched a perfect ninth for a save as the Yankees
won one month to the day they clinched a playoff spot in August.
	   Todd Stottlemyre nearly matched Wells, allowing just six hits
and striking out eight for a complete game in front of his father,
Mel, New York's pitching coach.
	   The Stottlemyre family affair surely created some anxious
moments. The wives of both Mel and Todd sat in the Yankees' family
section, and did not hesitate to cheer when a New York runner was
thrown out at the plate in the first inning.
	   When Todd won at Yankee Stadium last month _ his fifth straight
victory at the ballpark where he grew up as a kid _ his mother left
her usual seat to sit with the Rangers' wives.
	   ``I just wanted to be in this section this time,'' Jean
Stottlemyre said.
	   The only controversial move made by Yankees manager Joe Torre
paid off handsomely. Chad Curtis, whose defense earned him the
start in left field ahead of fan favorites Darryl Strawberry and
Shane Spencer, doubled to set up a two-run second inning.
	   With the crowd of 57,362 cheering, Scott Brosius hit an RBI
single and then the Yankees tricked Texas, with Brosius getting
caught in a rundown on a steal attempt while Curtis sneaked home.
	   Andy Pettitte (16-11), who struggled down the stretch, will
start Game 2 Wednesday night against Texas' Rick Helling (20-7) in
the best-of-5 series.
	   While the Yankees began the playoffs with the second-best record
in baseball history, Texas' 88 victories were the fewest among this
year's postseason teams.
	   The Rangers' only previous playoff experience came in 1996, when
they got knocked out in the first round by New York despite leading
in all four games and getting five home runs from Gonzalez.
	   Wells shut down the AL's top-hitting team, permitting just one
runner past first base until the seventh. His lone walk came to
Mark McLemore leading off the game and Texas did not get a hit
until Rusty Greer singled off shortstop Derek Jeter's glove with
one out in the fourth.
	   Recently, Torre said the team's most important games this season
came in the first week after a 1-4 start. No surprise, it was Wells
who beat the Mariners in the opener of that series.
	   The Yankees lost a chance to jump on Stottlemyre right at the
start. He hit Chuck Knoblauch in the shoulder with his second pitch
and one out later, Paul O'Neill doubled into the left-field corner.
	   But overly aggressive third-base coach Willie Randolph sent
Knoblauch _ even with AL batting champion Bernie Williams on deck _
and the relay from Rusty Greer to shortstop Royce Clayton to Gold
Glove catcher Ivan Rodriguez nailed him.
	   A one-out walk to Jorge Posada and a double by Curtis put the
Yankees in position again in the second, and Brosius grounded an
RBI single to right.
	   With runners at the corners, Brosius took off for second as
Knoblauch struck out. When Rodriguez threw down, Brosius stopped
and got in a rundown while Curtis scored without a throw.
 &UR; Boston beats Cleveland 11-3
	   In Cleveland, Mo Vaughn homered twice and tied a recond with
seven RBIs as Boston ended a 13-game postseason skid, beating
Cleveland 11-3 Tuesday in their American League playoff opener.
	   Nomar Garciaparra hit a three-run shot and Pedro Martinez
pitched seven innings as Boston ended a slide that began on Oct.
25, 1986, when Mookie Wilson's grounder to first rolled through
Bill Buckner's legs at Shea Stadium.
	   That forced a World Series Game 7 the Red Sox lost to the New
York Mets, and Boston _ which hasn't won the Series since 1918 _
was swept by Oakland in 1988 and '90, and then Cleveland in 1995.
	   This year's Red Sox insist that the past is just that, and
they're not cursed by Babe Ruth's ghost or any other demons. And
with Boston's trio of stars doing most of the damage, the Indians
and 45,815 at Jacobs Field may believe them.
	   Vaughn _ fittingly a first baseman _ ended his own streak of
playoff failure in the first inning with a three-run homer off
Jaret Wright, sending Cleveland on to its worst loss in 55
postseason games. Vaughn had gone 0-for-14 with seven strikeouts in
the 1995 Indians sweep.
	   After Garciaparra's three-run homer pushed the lead to 6-0 in
the fifth, Vaughn connected for a two-run shot in the sixth off
Doug Jones, becoming the first Boston player to hit two homers in a
postseason game since Rico Petrocelli in the 1967 World Series.
	   Vaughn then delivered a two-run double in the eighth off Jim
Poole to set a career-high for RBIs and tie Edgar Martinez's record
for RBIs in a postseason game.
	   Kenny Lofton hit a two-run homer and Jim Thome had a solo shot
for the Indians, who with Wright taking the mound were hoping to
recapture some of the magic that carried them to Game 7 of the
World Series last year.

Japanese capital may experience financial crisis, governor warns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The governor of Tokyo warned Wednesday the city
faces a ``financial crisis'' because of declining tax revenues, the
latest local government to fall victim to Japan's stubborn economic
slowdown.
	   Gov. Yukio Aoshima said a decline in money from corporate income
taxes may force the capital this year to post its first budget
deficit since 1980.
	   ``It's become clear that tax revenues will contract
significantly,'' Aoshima said in a speech to city employees.
	   According to a text of the speech released to the press, Aoshima
blamed rising corporate bankruptcies and declining profits.
	   ``A financial crisis is foreseeable,'' he said.
	   Tokyo becomes the third prefectural-level government _ Japan's
equivalent of a state _ to slip into the red this year.
	   Last month, suburban Kanagawa prefecture followed the city of
Osaka when it declared a ``financial state of emergency'' because
of a similar drop in tax revenues.
	   The spreading malaise among local governments could throw a
wrench into the central government's plans to stimulate the economy
out of its longest recession since records were first kept in 1955.
	   Although must of the 17 trillion yen (dlrs 126 billion) that
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi wants to spend on public works to kick
start growth will come from federal coffers, some would also come
from local governments, who might be reluctant to comply, warn
analysts.
	   Aoshima said he is considering several unspecified reforms to
balance the budget of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which also
has jurisdiction over several rural towns and a string of islands
near the capital.
	   Aoshima refused to say how big a shortfall the city foresees
from its original projection of 4.6 trillion yen (dlrs 34 billion)
in tax revenues for this year. But the Nihon Keizai newspaper
estimated the gap may be as large as 400 billion yen (dlrs 3
billion).
	   That could force the city to cut jobs and scale back public
projects to get its books back in balance, the paper said.
	   Aoshima is also considering cutting salaries and benefits of
higher ranking city officials, said the paper, Japan's top business
daily.

Industry shutdowns spread as Australian gas shortage worsens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Safeway is largest state supermarket chain in
11th graf; ADDS that Safeway is limiting bread purchases.

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Stores in the state of Victoria
began rationing bread, while factories in other states closed down
Wednesday as the effects of a major natural gas system shutdown
spread.
	   ``I think it's worse than the state of Victoria,'' state Premier
Jeff Kennett said. ``It is going to cost Australia ... in the order
of hundreds of millions of dollars a day.''
	   The crisis began with a huge fire at Esso's Longford gas plant
in Victoria state on Friday that killed two men and injured eight.
	   The plant supplied more than 80 percent of the natural gas for
Australia's second-most populous state, and some 1.4 million
households and 100,000 businesses may be without natural gas for at
least two weeks.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food.
	   Some industry sectors have speculated the aftermath of the fires
could last up to six months, even if gas is restored within a
couple of weeks.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions, which took two days to extinguish.
	   At least 100,000 workers in Victoria have been laid off as the
Ford and Toyota auto factories, glass and brick-making plants,
bakeries, dairies and many other industries shut down.
	   The Franklins supermarket chain, with 48 stores in Victoria,
alerted store managers that in the event of serious shortages they
might ration food, especially bread and milk.
	   Rationing has not been seen in Victoria since World War II.
	   Safeways, the state's biggest supermarket chain with 138 stores,
is limiting bread purchases by its customers.
	   ``We are attempting to restrict them to two or three loaves per
person so that those stores have sufficient bread supplies for
people coming in later in the day,'' Safeways state finance manager
Tony Parle said.
	   The industrial crisis spread interstate, with other factories
that rely on business with Victoria having to lay off workers.
	   In South Australia, two of Australia's largest automotive
companies, Holden and Mitsubishi, announced they were preparing for
several days of lost production because of a lack of parts from
Victoria.
	   Holden is to shut down Wednesday night, sending home its 4,500
workers until at least Tuesday.
	   Mitsubishi expected to remain open until Thursday, but the
operation of the plant for next week was in doubt.
	   Victoria state's auto industry is losing 10 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.9 million) a day in exports. In New South
Wales, 600 workers at BTR Automotives have been laid off as parts
from Victoria ran out.
	   Lawyers and unions clamored to launch legal action against Esso
and gas distributor VENCorp for damages to business and consumers
while economists warned the disaster's effect on Australia's growth
rate depended on its duration.
	   ``With speculation that it might be up to six months, if it's
that sort of period then it's going to have a big impact in terms
of industrial output and people being stood down,'' said Matthew
Drennan, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell.
	   The Australian Industry Group estimates the crisis could cost
100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) each day it
goes on.

Cambodian king to leave troubled country
</HEADLINE>

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk plans to leave
his troubled Cambodia next week for medical treatment in Beijing,
sources at the Royal Palace said Wednesday.
	   Sihanouk's mediating efforts helped end violent clashes on the
streets of Phnom Penh this month over the results of July's
national election and bring the country's bitterly divided
political factions to the bargaining table.
	   The 75-year-old monarch suffers from a variety of illnesses and
periodically visits doctors in China for treatment. He was
diagnosed with colon cancer in 1993, but it has since gone into
remission.
	   Sihanouk plans to fly to Beijing on Oct. 5 from the northwestern
town of Siem Reap, where he has stayed since returning to Cambodia
in April, a source inside the palace said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The king's chief protocol officer confirmed that Sihanouk would
leave the country soon but would not say exactly when.
	   ``We are planning but we are not sure yet about the date,''
palace official Kek Sysoda said.
	   Sihanouk's departures are often seen as an expression of his
displeasure at the political situation in Cambodia, which has
frequently been wracked by violence.
	   The king's son Prince Norodom Ranariddh was ousted from his post
of co-prime minister last year by his counterpart, Hun Sen, in a
bloody coup d'etat.
	   The king has returned to Cambodia twice since the coup but has
mostly kept his distance from politics, staying at his residence in
Siem Reap rather than at the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh.
	   This trip to China comes, however, after Sihanouk hosted
discussions between Cambodia's sparring political parties that
eased post-election tensions and led to the convening of parliament
on Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won a majority in
the July 26 election, claiming 64 of the 122 seats in parliament
but not the two-thirds needed to form a government.
	   Opposition parties led by Ranariddh and former Finance Minister
Sam Rainsy, the winners of 58 seats, have claimed that Hun Sen's
victory was achieved through fraud and intimidation.
	   The two parties have resisted forming a coalition government
with its rival until the allegations are thoroughly investigated.
	   The three parties began a series of negotiations Tuesday meant
to select leadership positions in parliament and form a new
government
