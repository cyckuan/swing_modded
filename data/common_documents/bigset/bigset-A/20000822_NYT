COWBOYS NOT WORRIED ABOUT 0-4 PRESEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith once
had a television commercial built around the theme, ``the real work
begins in the preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement is about as obsolete around the Cowboys' Valley
Ranch training complex these days as Smith's defunct shoe deal with
Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   To the Cowboys, 0-4 in the preseason this year and 1-13 in
preseason games since 1998, only the regular season matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's that critical,'' Cowboys quarterback Troy
Aikman said. ``There is not a big carryover once you go into the
regular season with regards to what your record was in the
preseason. The last time we had a winning record in the preseason
was in 1989, and we went 1-15 (in the regular season). We've had
losing records (in the preseason) and won Super Bowls.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cowboys coach Dave Campo, ``What we've done in the
preseason means absolutely nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning in the preseason may not be important, but playing well
is.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys' starters on both sides of the ball have yet to
produce a performance they can be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   Their play bottomed out in the game against the Broncos on
Saturday night, when Cowboys starters were dominated 24-6 in the
first half of an eventual 36-23 setback.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys failed to convert in the red zone and had trouble
stopping both the run and the pass, and after the game players
questioned their preparation and the coaches questioned the
players' focus.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make you assume that the Cowboys would point to
the preseason finale against the St. Louis Rams on Thursday to make
amends and build confidence.
</P>
<P>
   You would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, who said he overreacted after the Broncos game, said
Monday that the starters will make only a brief appearance against
the Rams. He said they are gearing up for the regular-season opener
against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two weeks we are going to zero in on the players who
will win for us,'' Campo said. ``And we want to get our legs back.
The next two weeks we are going to back off the hitting and make
sure we are not going too long in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   That begs the question: How can the Cowboys be confident that
they will be ready for the opener?
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their middling play, the Cowboys have been unable
to develop cohesion on offense because of injuries and a retirement
threat. Smith (strained calf) and tight end David LaFleur (strained
groin) have not played in the preseason and will miss the Rams
game. Fullback Robert Thomas (sprained knee) will miss his second
consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Tackle Erik Williams, who missed four weeks of training camp
while contemplating retirement, will play for the first time
against the Rams. Solomon Page, who had replaced Williams at
tackle, will play guard, meaning that the Cowboys' starting
offensive line will play together for the first time, albeit
briefly.
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of questions at cornerback, where embattled
rookie Kareem Larrimore is starting in place of the departed Kevin
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, who claims no team has continuity in the preseason,
believes the Cowboys will be ready because ``I know these guys. I
know what they are made of. If we are healthy, we are going to be
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Campo said the Cowboys' first-team units have shown
enough, despite the absences, to foster confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that if you looked at our first units and you took
a poll around the league, they'd say we're going to have a pretty
good football team. That's what I'm looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Campo be looking through rose-colored glasses? He
acknowledges as much, but adds that ``the film doesn't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the problems the Cowboys had with discipline and
technique against the Broncos (read: Larrimore) will be corrected
before the Philadelphia game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the heat of the battle, players tend to revert back to bad
technique,'' Campo said. ``That's our job to make sure they do
things right. We will be more disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said Larrimore's struggles have an upside because it will
help him understand ``that we know a little more about this than he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said Larrimore's play will be improved by a better pass
rush, which he feels the Cowboys will get with a healthy Leon Lett
in the lineup. nn

KICK RETURNER HALL AMONG COWBOYS CUTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Darran Hall left his heart _ and his future with
the Dallas Cowboys _ in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who fumbled the first two kickoffs and bobbled a punt in
the Broncos' 36-23 victory Saturday, was one of 13 players released
by the Cowboys on Monday. The Cowboys' roster now stands at 73
players. They must make two moves by 3 p.m. Tuesday to reach their
maximum of 71, which includes roster exemptions for NFL Europe
players Chris Akins, Stephen Fisher, Duane Hawthorne, Michael Lies,
Ryan Neufeld and Jeff Ogden.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have given us a lot of their time and effort out
there on the field. It's a tough situation,'' Cowboys vice
president Stephen Jones said. ``There are a lot of things that go
into cuts. You're always trying to develop players, so it's always
tough. A guy like Darran Hall is a philosophical decision. Do you
cut a player because his skill is big plays but at the same time he
can make big plays that can hurt you? Those are tough decisions
that you have to go through, but we're very comfortable with where
we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The misfortune of those put on the waiver wire could be good
news for others.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie free agent Micah Knorr will be the team's opening-day
punter after Barry Cantrell was released. Knorr has averaged 41.8
yards on 16 punts.
</P>
<P>
   First-year safety Jason Kaiser was released, which could open a
spot for Chris Akins to make the roster on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Third-year linebacker Brandon Tolbert, who tore his left
anterior cruciate ligament against the Broncos, will be placed on
injured reserve once he clears waivers. Tolbert was trying to
return after tearing his right anterior cruciate ligament during
the Cowboys' 1999 training camp. ELLIS FEELING GOOD
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Greg Ellis' road to recovery continued in Denver
when he saw his first game action since fracturing his left tibia
and fibula in a Dec. 12 game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Ellis
said Monday that his leg ``feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with the progress that he made,'' Cowboys
coach Dave Campo said. ``He played actually a little bit more than
I thought he was going to play. He wanted to play more. He felt
very good. He said he started thinking about the leg a little bit
early, but after the first three or four plays, he was his old
self. He's not where he needs to be football-shape-wise. Obviously,
the practice and playing a little bit in this next ballgame will
give him an opportunity to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who had 59 tackles, 7.5 sacks and 17 quarterback
pressures last season, said he will not rush his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't play as much as I did last year, I don't think,
especially in the early part of the season,'' he said. ``I'll play
a whole lot this year, I think, but probably not as much as last
year.'' SAFETY FIRST
</P>
<P>
   Third-year safety Izell Reese spent eight months rehabilitating
from surgery to repair a herniated disk in his neck only to strain
a calf muscle the first week of training camp. Saturday night
against the Broncos, he saw his first game action since Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having that calf injury kind of offset it, and I
didn't really think about my neck surgery or anything,'' Reese
said. ``I was able to stick my head in there a couple of times and
didn't have any problems. I feel confident about it, and I feel
healthy, so that's a good thing.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the Cowboys' moves Tuesday could be placing cornerback
Kevin Smith on the reserved/retired list. Smith, a nine-year
veteran, left the team two weeks ago to contemplate retirement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rookie cornerbacks Dwayne Goodrich (strained left hamstring)
and Mario Edwards (strained hamstring) are doubtful for Thursday
against the St. Louis Rams, Dave Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Right tackle Erik Williams, who reported to training camp last
week, will make his preseason debut against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys are no closer to signing former New York Giants
cornerback Phillipi Sparks than they were two weeks ago when Sparks
told them he would stay retired rather than return for the $440,000
minimum.

REDSKINS' ARRINGTON IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO L.T.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. _ LaVar Arrington is not Lawrence Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   LaVar Arrington never will be Lawrence Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor played in 10 Pro Bowls. Arrington has played in three NFL
exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was the NFL Defensive Player of the Year three times.
Arrington has his name on the Chuck Bednarik and the Dick Butkus
college awards.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor made 132.5 sacks, which ranks sixth in NFL history.
Arrington has zero, which ranks nowhere in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor played in a 3-4 defense. Arrington plays in a 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was the greatest linebacker to ever play the game.
Arrington is the greatest linebacker never to play a down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm not trying to be better than Lawrence Taylor,'' said
Arrington, the second choice in the draft behind Penn State
teammate Courtney Brown, who went to the Cleveland Browns.
``Everybody makes it out that LaVar is the next Lawrence Taylor. I
never said I wanted to be Lawrence Taylor. It was something that
was written and people ran with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the same token, there's nothing wrong with patterning
yourself after a guy like Lawrence Taylor. I gladly accept the
challenge, but there was a great 56 before Lawrence Taylor, and
people don't really talk about Hollywood (Henderson), but Hollywood
was the first defensive guy at linebacker wearing 56 that changed
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say I'm going to.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, though, bought into the Taylor comparison rook, line
and sacker. On draft day in New York, Arrington grabbed center
stage by selecting Taylor's No. 56.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Arrington looked a lot like Taylor. Today, only the
number is the same.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with reproductions: They never are quite as
good as the original.
</P>
<P>
   Being LaVar Arrington will have to be good enough, and, so far,
it hasn't been.
</P>
<P>
   While No. 3 choice Chris Samuels has stepped right in at left
tackle, Arrington has been a preseason disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington missed a week of the Redskins' off-season minicamp
following the birth of his first child. He then sat out the first
six days of training camp in a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally signed a six-year, $50 million contract that
included a $10.75 million signing bonus, he reported to camp out of
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed up late,'' said Redskins Radio Network analyst Sam
Huff, who was a Redskins linebacker from 1964-67 and in '69 and
entered the Hall of Fame in 1982. ``He held out for more money.
He's behind. He's struggling. It's his own fault. It's hard to feel
sorry for him. He's rich, but he's not really playing the type of
football he expected to play. This is a different league. This is
not Penn State. You're not a star here. You might be a rich guy,
but you're not the star. You have to earn your stripes here, just
like he did at Penn State. He earned his way. He earned the right
to be drafted where he was drafted. Now he has to prove they were
right, and that's tough, especially when you hold out.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington forced a fumble, recovered a fumble and had three
tackles in the Redskins' 24-0 victory against the Cleveland Browns
on Saturday night. But that was the Browns. This is the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   When Washington opens the season Sept. 3 against the Carolina
Panthers, Arrington is expected to be a role player. An expensive
role player.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any solace for Arrington, it is a history lesson
from Bruce Smith. The Redskins defensive end, whose 171 sacks ranks
second in NFL history, was benched in his rookie season and still
went on to win AFC rookie defensive player of the year honors in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that (future) Hall of Famers are subject to it (the
learning curve). I appreciate that,'' Arrington said. ``I just have
to maintain being a professional. I can only go out and do what I
do on the field and hope that that's good enough for the people
that love and care about me. As long as it's good with them, then
I'm at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, it hasn't been good enough to get Arrington in
the starting lineup. And it certainly isn't good enough for him to
be mentioned in the same sentence with Taylor. nn

COLUMN: NEGOTIATING SEXUAL POLITICS ON `SURVIVOR'
</HEADLINE>
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sean Kennif, the neurologist from Long Island, N.Y., was voted
off the ``Survivor'' island last week, to the satisfaction of many
viewers, especially women. He had seemed the prototypically
clueless, unreliable guy.
</P>
<P>
   Blind to the intricate social dynamics on the island, he had
ignored the growing evidence _ and the pleas of his more observant
female friends _ that a secret alliance had formed against them.
Instead of joining with the women in a counteralliance, he doomed
them all by persisting with his own alphabetical system of voting.
It was easy to see why he deserved to go.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery was why he and other guys managed to stay on so
long. ``Survivor'' seemed a rare female-friendly game show.
Although men had an advantage in the physical contests requiring
strength and speed, the overall format of the competition appeared
well suited to women's subtle social skills at networking and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the women are not ahead going into Wednesday night's grand
finale. The program, which began with eight of each sex, now has
two men and two women remaining, and the women may be in a more
precarious position because they've been arguing with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Men excel at simple, quick, competitive tasks, which is why they
have done so well on shows like ``Jeopardy'' and ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire.'' Their testosterone helps them focus. Women are
better at seeing the whole complex picture. They notice social
nuances and cultivate personal relationships, creating what
anthropologists call lateral networks instead of status
hierarchies. They're experts at cooperating, but they can also be
quietly ruthless.
</P>
<P>
   While boys are punching each other on the playground, girls are
learning to emotionally devastate victims who don't even know what
hit them. Females prefer indirect aggression, which Dr. Anne
Campbell described last year in an article in Behavioral and Brain
Sciences journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indirect aggression by its nature seeks to conceal the
identity of the attacker and should therefore be less appealing to
boys,'' wrote Campbell, a psychologist at Durham University in
England. While boys need to demonstrate their status by publicly
vanquishing rivals, girls prefer to use ``acts of shunning,
stigmatizing and gossiping,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls are more likely to exclude newcomers than are boys, to
destroy their adversary's property or tell tales on them, and to
use tactics of ostracizing and manipulating public opinion,''
Campbell wrote, summarizing others' studies. Girls are also more
likely to become ``friendly with someone else as revenge,'' she
noted, and in the adult workplace women have been found more likely
to spread false rumors or stop speaking to an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   These stealthy skills seem perfect for ``Survivor,'' and the
women on the island have done lots of networking and plotting. But
the mastermind has been a man, Richard Hatch, a gay corporate
consultant who persuaded a homophobic retired Navy Seal to join him
and two women in an alliance that gradually voted all the others
off the island. And now this odd couple of guys might profit
further from female dissension.
</P>
<P>
   How have the men survived? Why have the women fought? I
consulted an expert on testosterone, Dr. James McBride Dabbs, a
social psychologist at Georgia State University and, with his wife,
Mary, the author of a new book, ``Heroes, Rogues and Lovers:
Testosterone and Behavior'' (McGraw-Hill). He watched last week's
episode and was intrigued at the alliance between the gay man and
the homophobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the kind of coalition that women typically form,'' he
said. ``It's more the ruthless utilitarian coalition men form to do
a job, which might might be catching an animal or taking over a
company or winning a war or developing a new product. It's not
personal. It won't last once the job is over. Testosterone helps
men focus on the immediate task and neglect the social background
and the personal relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's short-term thinking could be their undoing if the
women's memory for personal betrayal comes into play Wednesday
night. Or maybe a man will win because ``Survivor,'' while more
elaborate than ``Millionaire'' or ``Jeopardy,'' is still just a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are more interested in complex, lasting relationships
based on affection rather than getting a one-time task done,''
Dabbs said. ``That's essential to the broader task of human living,
even if it doesn't win a million dollars one night on television.''

IN JOCK KINGDOM, SAVING FACE TAKES THREE EASY STEPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In today's jock kingdom, it's a shrink's paradise. No matter how
twisted, troubled or dense the player might be, help is always
available of the cerebral kind, provided by kindly team owners who
are attempting to head off the dreaded late-night phone call.
</P>
<P>
   But as you know, repeated image disasters with players still
happen. The best of counseling and information can save some but
not all. At times, a good bail bondsman and defense lawyer are as
valuable in sports as any hitting coach who taught Gabe Kapler the
leg kick.
</P>
<P>
   What is obviously missing in the jock kingdom, however, is the
``disaster specialist.'' On the executive level of the NFL,
baseball, the NBA, the NHL, etc., it's been all about overwhelming
our jock friends with preemptive-type information. Don't do this,
don't do that, and if you ever even consider doing this or doing
that, then call this number immediately. Which is fine, except what
happens after they are charged with still having done this or that,
despite all the warnings?
</P>
<P>
   Beating a rap in the court of law might prove to be impossible,
but in the long run, even the greatest of jocks, should he screw
up, will have to answer to the court of public opinion. It is much
more powerful and damning than the legal end, but also much more
forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   This message is too late for Michael Irvin, who has now blown
two careers. And also too late for the likes of Pete Rose and Leon
Lett, not to mention Roy Tarpley. What these guys needed was a
``disaster coach.'' For a minimal fee, I would have served as such,
with a money-back guarantee that each would win in the
all-important court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   All other jocks, however, should immediately listen up. You
never know when this info might come in very handy. Remember one
thing: The fans are always eager to forgive you, provided, of
course, they think you can still help the team win. Third-string
running backs should not expect much success, but for that star
jock in trouble, here's the simple three-step plan to return to
grace:
</P>
<P>
   (1) Immediately call a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   (2) Start your statement in serious tones, but then begin to
break down, emotionally. Cry real tears. This is very important.
Cry freely. Throw in a few sobs.
</P>
<P>
   (3) Deny everything, and threaten to sue. Or, maybe even better,
confess to everything, then apologize for that drug problem,
drinking problem, gambling problem, etc., that was caused by an
abusive upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you, this stuff never fails. Your fans will still be
your fans, and even new fans will climb aboard your bandwagon. In
fact, this week there was yet another success story involving the
foolproof three-step plan. Denver Broncos linebacker Bill
Romanowski, come on down, give us your testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans were awesome, incredible,'' said the Bronco known as
``Romo,'' after an exhibition game against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some of us Mile High Stadium press-box visitors
Saturday night, drowsy with anticipation of another NFL exhibition
encounter to sit through, were snapped out of a slumber by the
mighty howl from 69,000-plus throats during pregame introductions.
Had John Elway shown up, announcing he had unretired? No, it was
just Romo's name being called on the P.A. system.
</P>
<P>
   It had been such a bad week for the veteran headhunter who is
considered one of the NFL's dirtiest players, although it's the
same in any city; dirty only applies if he's playing for the other
team.
</P>
<P>
   But a bad summer for Romanowski got worse last week. If the
federal indictment for illegally obtaining diet pills didn't taint
Romo as a speed freak, along comes an unnamed former teammate being
quoted in ``Sports Illustrated'' as saying Romanowski used racial
statements. Something about this being a white guy who ``speeded''
for a supposed edge on the field against the black guys, except
Romo wasn't quoted as saying ``black guys.'' Granted, that's
cold-blooded for a publication to print such a thing without giving
the speaker's name, but ...
</P>
<P>
   Romo was caught in a firestorm. So how did he handle it? The
wise way, of course. He called a news conference, he cried, he
denied everything, and then threatened to sue ``SI''. After all
that, Denver welcomed him Saturday night like the season's first
snowfall on the ski slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Given this latest case, I thought of Michael, and him always
being too proud or too cool to ``work'' the court of public
opinion. And nobody could have pulled it off better than Irvin,
because Irvin is smart that way. Very smart when it comes to media
dealings. He might even have saved the Fox gig with just three easy
little steps. But no ...
</P>
<P>
   Michael will always have that
full-length-fur-coat-in-the-courtroom mentality, except now look
where that coolness got him. Go to Pete Rose _ if he had confessed
to the obvious on gambling 10 years ago, and done so under the
three-step procedure, Pete would long ago have Charlie Hustled his

WOODS' INCREDIBLE YEAR LEAVING RECORDS, OPPONENTS SHATTERED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The final digits remain uncalculated in summarizing Tiger Woods'
historic 2000 season on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers that will stick with golf fans are in the
history books because the major championships are complete. And the
figures that scream loudest, in the wake of Woods' playoff victory
in the PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky.,
are these:
</P>
<P>
   3: Consecutive victories at major championships, matching Fort
Worth legend Ben Hogan for the most majors won in any season by a
professional golfer.
</P>
<P>
   6: Consecutive victories at PGA Tour events, a streak that ended
in February and included victories in his last four starts of the
1999 season. It marked the longest winning streak at tour events
since Hogan won six in a row in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   12: Strokes under par at the U.S. Open, the lowest score in
relation to par in tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   15: Consecutive rounds of par or better at major championships
after posting a 75 in the opening round of the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   18: Strokes under par at the PGA Championship, matching Bob May
for the lowest score in relation to par in tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   19: Strokes under par at the British Open, the lowest score in
relation to par in tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   (23: Combined strokes by which Woods won the U.S. Open and
British Open in consecutive starts at major championships.
</P>
<P>
   24: Woods' age when he completed the career grand slam, making
him the youngest player to do so.
</P>
<P>
   53: Combined strokes under par in major championships this year,
including a 49-under total during his victories.
</P>
<P>
   68.4: Scoring average at this year's major championships,
including a mark of 67.7 in his final 14 rounds, when Woods posted
the lowest weekend scores at the Masters, then won the final three
majors of the season.
</P>
<P>
   How good is that?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, 50, deems it the best year any professional golfer
has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way he's played these golf courses during the major
championships, you'd have to say that,'' said Watson, an eight-time
major champion. ``He has raised the bar higher than anybody has
ever raised it, as far as putting distance between himself and the
rest of the field. You are seeing a phenomenon that the game may
never, ever see again.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' dominant run through the final three majors of the season
already has triggered chatter about a possible Grand Slam next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo, a six-time major champion, identified Woods as the
only player on tour capable of winning a slam. He said he would not
be surprised if the world's top-ranked golfer gave it a strong run
in 2001. Dan Jenkins, renowned author and golf writer from Fort
Worth, said he expects Woods to complete a slam at some point in
his career, unless he gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But that is in the future. The lingering question, at this
point, is how many more milestones Woods can cram into the
remaining weeks of the 2000 season. Some notable numbers worth
tracking between now and Nov. 12, the final day of the official
earnings season, include:
</P>
<P>
   7: Victories this season, with ample opportunities remaining to
eclipse last year's mark of eight.
</P>
<P>
   22: Career victories, putting Woods in position to become the
youngest player to average a victory for every year he has been
alive if he can win twice more this year.
</P>
<P>
   67.86: Season scoring average, a pace that would better the mark
set by Byron Nelson in 1945 (68.33), the year he won 11 consecutive
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   75.1: Percentage of greens hit in regulation, tops among tour
players.
</P>
<P>
   $6,692,821: Dollars in earnings, breaking the season record
Woods set in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too old to get shocked by too many things,'' said Mark
Brooks, 39, a Fort Worth resident who won the 1996 PGA. ``Death and
taxes will shock you. Great golf, as a rule, won't do it. But what
he's done is nothing short of phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, 43, said he shakes his head every time he scans
Woods' statistics from the past three majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played like that once in my life,'' Price said, referring to
his six-stroke victory at the 1994 PGA. ``He plays like that in
every major. It's astounding. I feel sorry for the young guys.
Basically, I've had my day. Whatever I win from here on in is a
bonus. But the young guys are taking a pounding from this guy.
They'll have to play almost perfect golf to win a major as long as
Tiger's in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, Woods ranks high in all phases of the game and is
regarded as the tour's ultimate power player. Yet Brooks said fans
might not truly appreciate Woods' power, because he ranks second in
driving distance (294.6 average), five yards behind John Daly
(299.9).
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand the advantage he truly has because he
doesn't hit driver on all the holes that are measured. And he
doesn't max out his swing,'' Brooks said. ``When he really cuts
loose, he's hitting it 50 yards past most people, not 20. That's a
huge bonus. Other guys don't have that extra gear to call on when
they need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson listed other attributes as well, offering a synopsis of
why Woods is atop the golfing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has better flexibility than anybody. You hear that from the
trainers,'' Watson said. ``He works out harder than anybody, hits
the ball farther than anybody, putts better than anybody, chips
better than anybody. He wants to be the best player who has ever
lived. I think that pretty well explains it.'' nn

 WOULD YOU LOOK AT WHO'S GOT THE JUICE _ THE POWER COMPANIES  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Call it revenge of the nerds.
</P>
<P>
   Big, boring electric and gas utilities _ once given up for dead
_ are this year's hottest stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to falling interest rates and rolling power outages, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's utilities index, which includes companies such as
PG&AMP;E and Enron, is up 35 percent, year to date.
</P>
<P>
   And the worst performing sector?
</P>
<P>
   Telecom service providers. The S&AMP;P communications services
index, which tracks long-distance, local and cellular carriers, is
down 26 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This has created an unusual situation for utility mutual funds,
which invest in two types of stocks _ this year's winners and this
year's losers.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, utility funds invested almost exclusively in
dividend-paying electric utilities. They were designed for the
proverbial widows and orphans _ people who needed a stable income
and no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   But as the telecommunications industry was deregulated, many
utility funds began buying not just Baby Bells but also
fast-growing, unregulated long-distance and wireless carriers and
even cell-phonemakers such as Nokia and Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   One utility-fund manager justified an investment in AOL by
defining a utility as anything you use daily and pay for monthly.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, that strategy paid off, and telecom-heavy
utility funds beat power-hungry ones hands down.
</P>
<P>
   But that started to change in March of this year.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nasdaq crashed, investors started looking for stocks
that looked safe and undervalued. Staring them in the face were
electric utilities, which were laughably cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electric companies are still viewed as bond equivalents,''
says John Kohli, manager of the Franklin Utilities fund.
``Historically, the dividend yield (annual dividend divided by
share price) on a utility stock has been 80 to 90 percent of the
yield on 10-year Treasury bonds.'' But in early March, utilities
were yielding 6.5 percent _ or 103 percent of the 6.4 percent
Treasury-bond rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a greater yield buying electric utility stocks than
10-year Treasuries,'' Kohli says. ``That had never occurred in 30
years of looking at electric utilities.''
</P>
<P>
   So investors began buying utility stocks. That drove share
prices up and yields _ which move in the opposite direction _ down.
Today, utility yields are back to normal _ about 85 percent of the
Treasury rate.
</P>
<P>
   But utility stocks still look inexpensive by some measures.
``Traditionally, the group has grown 2 to 3 percent a year, but
analysts now expect earnings growth of 7 percent over the next five
years,'' Kohli says. The companies in the S&AMP;P 500 are expected to
grow a shade faster, at 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But utility stocks are trading at 12.5 times earnings, while the
S&AMP;P 500 is trading at 26 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   With the S&AMP;P 500, ``you're paying more than twice as much for 1
percent greater earnings growth,'' says Kohli.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of this year, electric utilities earned
21.4 percent more on average than they did in the first half of
last year. Earnings for the S&AMP;P 500 companies were up only 17.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the utilities' earnings have come from power generation
_ or more specifically, from a lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, as energy deregulation created a lot of
uncertainty, utility companies were reluctant to build new power
plants because they weren't sure how they'd pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, strong economic growth pushed demand to record
levels. Today, there is barely enough power to meet demand, and the
result has been temporary power outages and soaring energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for consumers, but good news for utility
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Given the speed at which new power plants are built in this
country, the supply/demand imbalance is not going to change
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer for Wells Capital
Management, thinks there's another, more traditional reason to buy
utility stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities have always been interest-rate sensitive _ when
interest rates go down _ utility stocks go up, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Once the markets concluded that the Federal Reserve was finished
raising interest rates, at least until after the presidential
elections, investors decided it was safe to buy utility stocks
again.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen sees interest rates going even lower, which means
utilities could go even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from an intense period of inflation fear to a
soft-landing euphoria. Eventually we'll move right through the
euphoria and people will start to say, ``Oops, we've overdone it.
We're heading into a recession,'' he says. ``Utilities are good
soft-landing and `oops-recession' stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean all utilities will do well. As deregulation
unfolds, there will be winners and losers, just as there were in
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some utilities are scrambling to get into e-commerce
and other promising, but unproven businesses. Some are using their
pipelines into the home to sell new products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're going to follow the industry closely, buying
through a mutual fund is probably the best route. But it's
important to know what flavor utility fund you're buying.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Craib-Cox, who follows utility funds for Morningstar,
says power-oriented funds are still a better bargain, but
telecom-oriented utility funds, despite their recent woes, offer
greater long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   Among funds that concentrate on electric utilities, he likes
no-load Vanguard Utilities Income. ``They have good managers, a
good record and below-average risk,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Among telecom-oriented funds, he likes MFS Fund Utilities, which
has ``a great track record'' but charges a commission. Despite its
54 percent weighting in telecom services, it's up 8.45 percent year
to date.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if all you want is telecom, there are many pure
telecom funds to choose from.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Speaking in somber tones and at times struggling for
words, Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev, offered a
defense Monday night of the military's failure to rescue the crew
of the stricken nuclear submarine Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally televised interview, he told Russians that the
armed forces of the once-powerful Soviet Union had been ``robbed
and stripped'' in the last decade and were operating on half the
budget they required.
</P>
<P>
   After divers finally gained entry to the wreck of the nuclear
submarine Kursk Monday and declared it flooded and its 118-member
crew dead, the 68-year-old Sergeyev said he did not rule out the
possibility that the military might have made mistakes in the
rescue attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that ``no fundamental mistakes'' had been made,
and argued that foreign assistance might not have helped to save
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk went down in 350 feet of water after unexplained but
powerful explosions sundered its hull during military exercises in
the Barents Sea on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials are investigating whether the Kursk was
involved in a collision with an unidentified vessel, or perhaps
struck a World War II mine, or was scuttled by some internal
defect.
</P>
<P>
   In a day marked by expressions of remorse, confession and
resolution to solve the mysteries of the sinking of one of Russia's
most advanced warships, the commander of the Northern Fleet, Adm.
Vyacheslav Popov, went on television to ask forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the best submarine crew in the Northern Fleet,'' he
said, adding, with eyes cast downward: ``Forgive the children.
Forgive your sons. And forgive me for not bringing back your
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev's remarks were less contrite, and seemed in part an
attempt to quell the political storm that the incident has wreaked
on the government of President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have been criticized for their failure to make a
more timely request for Western assistance _ and for withholding or
perhaps distorting information about the circumstances of the
sinking and the condition of the sailors trapped in the submarine's
nine compartments.
</P>
<P>
   And with fresh assertions that a foreign submarine was possibly
involved in a collision with the Kursk, Russian officials betrayed
some of the frustration and mistrust that were the hallmark of the
Cold War, even as an extraordinary collaboration among British,
Norwegian and Russian sailors unfolded in the Arctic sea famous as
a secret venue for rival fleets.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev said that on Aug. 13, more than a day after the
explosions, a second submerged object, probably a submarine, was
detected lying near the Kursk. He also said Russian lookouts on two
ships had observed a signal buoy, not of Russian origin, of the
type Western fleets use to send emergency messages by satellite to
their command bases.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who remained on vacation at a Black Sea resort during
most of the frantic rescue operation, did not appear in public
Monday. But the Sergeyev announced in the television interview that
all submarines of the Kursk's class would stay in port until it was
determined what caused the explosions that sent the ship crashing
into the seabed during missile- and torpedo-firing maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not impossible that some mistakes were made,'' the
Sergeyev said, ``but it seems to me now that in the heat of the
action, no fundamental mistakes were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he added, ``we have to rise above emotions, and
coldly and scrupulously investigate all the decisions that were
made and how they were carried out,'' however ``serious the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ``the whole reason'' why Russia lacked lacked
deep-sea-diving and rescue equipment in the Northern Fleet was the
dire state of funding.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kramer, a Russian specialist at the Davis Center for
Russian Studies at Harvard University, agreed with this assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The navy is really in decrepit shape,'' he said. ``A lot of
the best people have been leaving because they don't get paid. Only
a tiny percentage of the navy is at sea at any one time.'' He added
that most ships were ``in repairs or left in port to rust.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian sailors are paid $50 to $90 per month, and last winter,
schools in naval towns reported 40-degree temperatures in
classrooms because of chronic power interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the rescue operation Monday followed a day of
fruitless attempts to open the rear escape hatch on the Kursk. On
Monday morning, a plan to pull the hatch off by force using a crane
was deferred as Norwegian divers descended again and succeeded.
They first opened the outer hatch to the escape chamber, which was
flooded and held no signs of life. They then opened the inner hatch
to the ninth compartment and found it flooded also. The body of a
Russian sailor was reported to be just inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found that the whole submarine is full of water,'' a
Norwegian military spokesman, John Epsen Lien, said in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia requested that Norway help recover the bodies, but the
owners of the diving vessel, Stolt Offshore, said it might be too
dangerous for their men to enter the ship. Russian navy officials
said they would try to negotiate a contract to carry out the
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall cooperate with the Norwegians as before,'' said Vice
Adm. Mikhail Motsak, chief of staff of the northern fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism that Russian officials waited too long
to seek Western assistance, Sergeyev said that as soon as it became
apparent last Wednesday that the Russian Navy desperately needed
help to open an escape hatch, he personally made the ``political
decision,'' on the recommendation of Navy Commander Adm. Vladimir
Kuroyedov, to ask for help and then informed Putin, who concurred.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev also said Russian military and civilian leaders
strongly suspected that the Kursk had collided with another
submarine, which suffered severe damage but eventually managed to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   He said a submerged shape was detected lying near the Kursk
about the time that Russian vessels were identifying its shattered
hull, on the evening of Aug. 13 _ more than 30 hours after Western
sensors detected the two explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Russian lookouts observed the Western signal buoy, but attempts
to retrieve it failed in high seas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His comments confirmed a report Friday from a Russian television
correspondent, Arkady Mamontov, who said that military officials
told him that the mystery buoy was green and white. Russian
emergency buoys, he said, were red and white.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of how the information was being treated at the
time, Mamontov said he feared that he might be sent ashore from his
exclusive post on board the cruiser Peter the Great for divulging
the buoy sightings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that lookouts spotted the signal buoy, Sergeyev
said, arriving Russian warships detected and ``directly observed
the object itself on the bottom of the ocean that was of equal
height of our submarine. This is a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev then ordered the navy to send a ``hydrographic vessel
with more powerful equipment'' to search for the mystery ship near
the Kursk, ``but this object was not found.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared from his remarks that in the early stages of the
rescue operation, Russian Navy officials were not only organizing
the attempted rescue of the Kursk crew, but also seeking a foreign
submarine that they suspected in the collision.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Interfax news agency quoted an unidentified military
official in Moscow Monday as saying that an object resembling ``the
barrier of a foreign submarine tower'' had been discovered lying on
the seabed less than 1,000 feet from the Kursk. The official said
it was ``premature to draw any conclusions before studying the
object,'' which ``may have been lying on the bed of the Barents Sea
for a long time.'' But the statement offered another confirmation
that the Russian military is actively scouring the seabed for
evidence that might shed light on its collision theory.
</P>
<P>
   The American and British governments have denied that any of
their submarines or surface vessels were involved in a collision
with the Russian vessel. But it was also apparent that both
governments were withholding information under their own
long-standing refusal to comment on submarine spying operations
directed at the Russian fleet.
</P>
<P>
   When Russian officials at NATO headquarters inquired whether
``even one ship was there where the accident took place, they told
us no, there were no NATO ships there,'' the official said, adding
that Russian officials had reported back that they overheard
``conversation that if this incident had happened,'' NATO officials
``would never acknowledge it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Kokoshin, national security adviser to former President
Boris Yeltsin, said in an interview Monday that ``there were many
cases'' in the past decade ``when our submarines in the region and
foreign subs were coming too close to each other and we raised
complaints several times to the Americans and some other Western
countries, even to the point of proposing that there should be some
rules established for this kind of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Kokoshin, now a member of parliament who has joined those
calling for a parliamentary investigation into the sinking, said
Russia owed a great debt to Norway and Britain for their help in
the rescue attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that even if the investigation proved that the
Kursk was not involved in a collision, a new international
agreement on submarine ``rules of conduct'' should be negotiated.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Russians are not, as the old movie would have it,
coming.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, many have gone.
</P>
<P>
   Some have just slammed the door on America _ the country where,
as one of put it, his Russian friends have become ``slaves to the
dollar'' _ and have gone back home, to Moscow, to St. Petersburg,
and even to Kiev, Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   And by voicing just what they feel, they have left in their wake
a small but impassioned debate about how Russians really view
America.
</P>
<P>
   It was a furor that journalists at The Russian Bazaar, a weekly
newspaper based in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, scarcely expected when
they published an article last month titled ``Why They Are
Leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   In the story, Valentin Labunsky, a 49-year-old journalist from
Kiev who has been in America four years, wrote at great length
about the complaints of three departing immigrants: a 24-year-old
female student, a 30-year-old male journalist and a 50-year-old
former school headmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, the three, who had been in America from one to
four years, bemoaned the obsession with materialism, the emptiness
of conversation, the ugliness and what the student deemed ``the
utter treelessness'' of their part of Brooklyn, and the
functionality and inelegance of what she branded ``the American
uniform, jeans and sneakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they lamented the lack of what Russians call
``dukhovnost,'' the spiritual dimension of life.
</P>
<P>
   The headmaster from St. Petersburg, his wife, _ a translator of
German literature in Russia, but retrained here as a bank teller _
and their son, who became a computer programmer, depicted a
four-year struggle to establish themselves in New York City. When,
finally, they had a half-way decent apartment, good jobs, a car,
had paid off their debts and even had some money to spare, he said,
``we suddenly found a terrible emptiness inside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There, in St. Petersburg, we lived poorly, but to the full,''
said the headmaster, Ilya, who like other Russians in the article
would give only his first name. (Labunsky said all three feared
that giving their full names could lead to trouble with the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, in part because they have
green cards entitling them to live here.)
</P>

   Suddenly deprived of their full spiritual life, ``We really

that accepted us as its own. But neither I, nor my family, could
accept the values of this world, all their serials, their humor,
their TV. And not because it's worse than ours. It just isn't
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the criticisms voiced in the two-page article were new.
But they were apparently striking for many of the 1 million Russian
speakers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and for others
across the country. Nothing prepared Labunsky or his boss, Natasha
Nakhankova, for the avalanche of reaction from readers. Their
paper, which prints just more than 10,000 copies a week and, they
say, has a readership of 40,000, received a flood of phone calls
and 237 long, handwritten letters in one week, some from as far
away as California. They printed pages of the most articulate
letters, along with forceful rebuttals to the three departees in a
series hastily written by Labunsky titled ``Why We Are Staying.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the letters, especially those written by emigres who
went through the horrors of leaving the Soviet Union in the 1970s
and 1980s, were passionate paeans to America. As Nakhankova, 44,
concluded in an editorial, ``the discussion has shown how dear
America is to most of us, what patriots we have become today, we,
who so recently thought that the very word patriotism was something
dreamed up by Communist propagandists.''
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of gratitude for the assistance given to many
emigres and the chance to build a good life was the stuff of a
White House speechwriter's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered among the letters, however, was isolated support for
those who decided to go back. A woman who signed herself simply
Vita said the stories of the departing immigrants had made her weep
because ``everything they say is the purest truth.''
</P>
<P>
   After six years in America, she stated, she would not return to
Russia, but her estrangement even now from America was plain.
Voicing sentiments that are common enough among arrivals from the
former Soviet Union _ though not, generally, among their children,
educated here _ she complained bitterly about the bad treatment
caseworkers give former Soviet nationals asking for welfare, about
the loud music of her neighbors and the continual worries about
making ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration, she concluded, ``is like moving a flower that
should live in black earth to sandy soil. It is still alive, but
with each day it withers, and finally it stops blooming, and all
that remains is a coarse stem.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 380,000 immigrants have come from the former Soviet
Union since it began collapsing 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no figures on the number of people who have
returned, nobody imagines that there is a mass movement back to the
former Soviet Union. For one thing, the struggling countries formed
from the breakup of the Soviet Union are all poor, often affording
little in the way of jobs or wages.
</P>
<P>
   Some Moscow residents, however, do report that several friends
who had left for Western Europe and for Israel have been trickling
back to live and work back home. Young and educated Russians find
that they can parlay their Western experience and their new
languages into good jobs in Moscow, either in the expanding field
of marketing and advertising, or in representing foreign
businesses.

   This kind of movement is an acknowledgment of how things have
changed since the Cold War. The immigrants who arrived then had
been forced to burn their bridges, sell off apartments, renounce
citizenship and arrive in their new homelands with little in their
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, however, the collapse of Communism has made
travel freer. And, if they can get past tightening visa
requirements in all Western countries, Russians, Ukrainians and
others from the former Soviet world are increasingly dipping their
toes into America, just to see what it is like.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri is a 23-year-old lawyer from Kiev who also refused to
give his full name. He said in an interview that he had been in the
United States, off and on, for four years, liked it well enough and
determinedly avoided discussing whether he missed Kiev.
(``Nostalgia,'' he said briskly, ``is a hard thing to think
about.'') In his view, the three who returned home are ``losers''
who lack his toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dmitri, too, hangs out mostly with other young Russians
because, he said, the kind of educated Americans he would like to
socialize with ``look down on us'' and would never welcome the
likes of Russians struggling to find work and pay rent on a small
studio in unfashionable parts of Brooklyn into their social
circles.
</P>
<P>
   As for staying here, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of lost in the world,'' Dmitri said. ``I have been
born in the Soviet Union. Since my homeland collapsed, I've been
looking for my place in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with Maxim, the 30-year-old journalist interviewed
by Labunsky before he returned to Moscow in June, is stark. Reached
by telephone at his Moscow apartment, Maxim could not have sounded
more at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I calmed down a lot, being back here,'' he said. ``Here, I
really feel as if I am in my place, where I belong. One reason is
that I realized I have to be really in the center of Russian
culture _ and not on its edges.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxim, who is back in his old job at a Moscow newspaper, said
the education of his 7-year-old son also played a big part in the
decision to move back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school we can get him into here will give him a much
better education than the public school in Brooklyn, which was the
only realistic scenario there,'' Maxim said. ``Maybe, if we could
have afforded private school in America, that would have been
different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My son will always be able to go to America _ it won't be
closed off to him,'' Maxim added. ``Russia is getting more
Americanized, and anyway America is a more universal culture than
ours. It will be accessible. If we stayed in America, he would be
completely American, and not know our culture, which is more
Eastern, and harder to get to know. I write poems _ I want him to
be able to read them.''

 RUSSIAN IMMIGRANTS, AFTER RECONSIDERING LIFE IN AMERICA, CHOOSE TO
RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story is also moving in `a' category.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Russians are not, as the old movie would have it,
coming.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, many have gone.
</P>
<P>
   Some have just slammed the door on America _ the country where,
as one of put it, his Russian friends have become ``slaves to the
dollar'' _ and have gone back home, to Moscow, to St. Petersburg,
and even to Kiev, Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   And by voicing just what they feel, they have left in their wake
a small but impassioned debate about how Russians really view
America.
</P>
<P>
   It was a furor that journalists at The Russian Bazaar, a weekly
newspaper based in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, scarcely expected when
they published an article last month titled ``Why They Are
Leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   In the story, Valentin Labunsky, a 49-year-old journalist from
Kiev who has been in America four years, wrote at great length
about the complaints of three departing immigrants: a 24-year-old
female student, a 30-year-old male journalist and a 50-year-old
former school headmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, the three, who had been in America from one to
four years, bemoaned the obsession with materialism, the emptiness
of conversation, the ugliness and what the student deemed ``the
utter treelessness'' of their part of Brooklyn, and the
functionality and inelegance of what she branded ``the American
uniform, jeans and sneakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they lamented the lack of what Russians call
``dukhovnost,'' the spiritual dimension of life.
</P>
<P>
   The headmaster from St. Petersburg, his wife, _ a translator of
German literature in Russia, but retrained here as a bank teller _
and their son, who became a computer programmer, depicted a
four-year struggle to establish themselves in New York City. When,
finally, they had a half-way decent apartment, good jobs, a car,
had paid off their debts and even had some money to spare, he said,
``we suddenly found a terrible emptiness inside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There, in St. Petersburg, we lived poorly, but to the full,''
said the headmaster, Ilya, who like other Russians in the article
would give only his first name. (Labunsky said all three feared
that giving their full names could lead to trouble with the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, in part because they have
green cards entitling them to live here.)
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly deprived of their full spiritual life, ``We really
realized that human beings do not live by bread alone,'' the
headmaster said. ``When we were struggling here to survive, we
didn't think about this. But when we had finally staggered to our
feet, we started to look for America's dukhovnost. And we just
couldn't find it. I don't want to heap dirt on America, a country
that accepted us as its own. But neither I, nor my family, could
accept the values of this world, all their serials, their humor,
their TV. And not because it's worse than ours. It just isn't
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the criticisms voiced in the two-page article were new.
But they were apparently striking for many of the 1 million Russian
speakers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and for others
across the country. Nothing prepared Labunsky or his boss, Natasha
Nakhankova, for the avalanche of reaction from readers. Their

PHONE WORK TENSIONS EASE AS STRIKE ENDS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With VERIZON-STRIKE, VERIZON-IMPACT) By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Doucette's head was spinning as he reported to work Monday
for the first time in two weeks. Like tens of thousands of other
Verizon Communications employees, Doucette had gone on strike at
the country's largest local telephone company. Now, as he returned
to his job as a customer assistance representative in Braintree,
Mass., he weighed the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   First, the walkout had gotten him a nice pay raise and more
benefits. Even stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But it had also brought a host of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Doucette said he was expecting a flood of calls from customers
seeking repairs and services. And there were the workplace
relationships that had to be mended. Like other union workers,
Doucette had walked the picket lines and joined in calling managers
``scabs,'' jeering them as they strode into the building to fill in
on the grunt jobs. Union jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the managers was crying when she was coming out, and I
knew why,'' he said. ``She had been a rep for years and years. You
can't avoid it and you can't let it stop you from doing what you
need to do. But boy, emotionally, there is a lot of pain there. I'm
so glad that part of it is over.''
</P>
<P>
   For union workers, their managers and many Verizon customers,
Monday was a time for trying to bridge the chasms that emerged
during the emotional 15-day walkout. In those two weeks, managers
were taunted, repair vans were assaulted and two union workers were
nearly electrocuted in Long Island while trying to cut a power line
they had mistaken for a telephone cable.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, two unions representing 86,000 workers in 12
states along the Eastern seaboard reached a contract agreement with
Verizon that would cover about two-thirds of the strikers. Local
unions representing the rest, who work from New Jersey to Virginia,
were still trying to negotiate a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those workers showed up Monday outside a half-dozen or
so Verizon offices in New York, forming picket lines and forcing
other union workers to make a decision about whether to cross those
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more than 80 percent of the strikers in New York and New
England returned to their jobs, said John Bonomo, a Verizon
spokesman. Under the settlement agreement, union workers did not
have to report to their workplaces for another three days if they
had extenuating circumstances. Of those who did show up, some
talked of managers buying them lunch, while others said they were
greeted with cold silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, after a strike, and in this situation in particular
where management was working long hours, both sides are relieved,''
said Richard Hurd, a professor of labor studies at Cornell
University. ``There's the potential to go back to work with
feelings of good will. The only situation where there may be
difficulty is if there were places where strikers were particularly
vociferous in their attacks on managers.''
</P>
<P>
   One such site was a repair-van garage on King Street in lower
Manhattan. In the opening days of the strike, a group of union
workers surrounded a manager in the street and taunted him about
his troubled marriage. The police later charged four of the workers
with harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of tension'' on returning to work, said Rob
Anderson, who spent five hours in jail last week after being
arrested for the jeering. ``Managers didn't say much of anything.
It was like, go to work, go to work. They gave us our toolbags.
They didn't give us information on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Some managers at the garage said they had a right to harbor
bitter feelings. One manager, who declined to give his name, said
he had been pelted in the back of his head with an egg while out
making a repair.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, the company's backlog of repair orders had risen to
78,000 since the strike began on Aug. 6. It was unclear how many
orders were put in before the strike and how many were due to
vandalism during the walkout, Bonomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Belfiore, a Manhattan resident, said she had been waiting
since the strike began to get her telephone repaired. She said
telephone service was crucial because her son, Michael, has
cerebral palsy and often injures himself. ``The telephone is
vital,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For workers and managers, the return to the workplace provided
ample opportunities for occasionally tense encounters. In several
offices, union members worked alongside managers who had filled in
for strikers during the walkout. In many cases, supervisors had
asked those managers to stay on Monday in case union workers did
not show up or refused to cross some of the remaining picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unusual to see managers reporting to your desk, and you
sitting in the same cubicle with them,'' said Stephen Montgomery,
who works in a bill-collecting office in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shapiro, who usually managed computer programmers in
White Plains, N.Y., watched Monday morning as union workers began
straggling back into the customer assistance call center in nearby
Valhalla. The workers looked over the gray cubicles they had
vacated for two weeks. Then they saw the strangers. Shapiro, who
had been filling in as an operator, was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He half-expected a resentful glance or even a shouting match.
But the workers just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local management here seems like they're assimilating
everybody into the workflow without making an issue of anything,''
Shapiro said. ``And that's the way I guess it needs to be for the
business to function as efficiently as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some union workers in New York, assimilation did not
come so easily. They still had to grapple with the moral
implications of crossing picket lines. About 20 members of
mid-Atlantic local unions, which were still negotiating for a
contract, showed up Monday morning at a Verizon office tower on
Pearl Street near the Brooklyn Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Thompson, who tested data lines for the company, said he
walked into the building after a union steward told him to report
to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to do,'' he said. ``My heart told me not to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   At mid-afternoon, a manager was standing in the plaza trying to
persuade some union workers to go into the building. One
technician, John Giarrita, said he did not want to return to work
because managers were filling in for some union jobs in his
workplace. ``The management and craft, we don't work together,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the manager, who asked not to be named, offered a deal: If
five technicians went up with him, he would cut loose 15 of the
pinch-hitting managers. Giarrita mulled over this with some of his
co-workers. The five men glanced around the plaza, then followed
the manager through the glass doors.

COLOMBIAN IS CHARGED IN U.S. IN WIDE SHIPMENT OF COCAINE
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Colombian man, accused of heading an international
drug cartel that prosecutors alleged shipped thousands of pounds of
cocaine to the United States and Europe, faced criminal charges in
U.S. District Court here Monday, three days after his extradition
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Alberto Orlandez-Gamboa, who prosecutors have said is
the head of the Caracol drug cartel, has been charged with
conspiring to transport the cocaine and with conspiring to launder
tens of millions of dollars in profits from drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said he was the third drug suspect extradited from
Colombia since that country amended its constitution in December
1997 to allow extradition to the United States. Mary Jo White, the
U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said
Orlandez-Gamboa was the first person accused of heading a drug
organization to be extradited from Colombia in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   White said the United States was seeking the extradition of 80
other suspects from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Extradition to the United States has been controversial in
Colombia, and the action involving Orlandez-Gamboa required
approval from the highest levels of Colombia's government. The
United States formally requested extradition in August 1999, after
Orlandez-Gamboa was indicted by a federal grand jury here.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, 2000, the Colombian Supreme Court issued an order
approving the extradition, and the next day the president of
Colombia, Andres Pastrana, and his Cabinet signed a resolution
providing for the action. Orlandez-Gamboa was flown from Bogota to
Miami on a Drug Enforcement Administration jet on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno issued a statement Monday commending
the Colombian government and saying the action ``sends a strong
message to drug dealers that there are no safe havens.''
</P>
<P>
   In court Monday, Mark F. Mendelsohn, an assistant U.S. attorney,
said newspaper ads had recently appeared in Cali, Colombia,
threatening violence against Colombia's supreme court and senior
political officials if Orlandez-Gamboa was sent to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Orlandez-Gamboa headed the Caracol
drug cartel from Barranquilla, Colombia, directing his subordinates
to carry out bribery and violence including kidnappings and
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges him with crimes dating to 1992; although
he was arrested and jailed in Colombia in June 1998, prosecutors
charged he continued to run the cartel from prison. While in
prison, prosecutors said, Orlandez-Gamboa directed the delivery of
$1.5 million from the United States to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Orlandez-Gamboa also used Caracol, which means
snail in Spanish, as a personal nickname.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that the Caracol organization imported
cocaine to a variety of places in the United States, and
prosecutors said the drugs went to New York, Miami, Philadelphia
and Puerto Rico. They said the organization used cargo ships, speed
boats and aircraft to move the cocaine and smuggled it in shipments
of cement, in sealed cans and inside ceramic tiles.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing before a federal magistrate Monday,
Orlandez-Gamboa was ordered held without bail. If convicted on all
charges, he faces life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Martin Schmukler, said Orlandez-Gamboa intended to
plead not guilty to the charges against him. ``I don't think the
charges can be substantiated at all,'' Schmukler said. ``At the
very time they were committed, he was already in custody.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmukler said that, under the extradition agreement,
Orlandez-Gamboa could be charged only with acts that occurred after
the Colombian constitution was changed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the court appearance, White said the
extradition agreement would not hurt the prosecution of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Schmukler said his client had nothing to do with any
advertisements that appeared in Colombian newspapers regarding the
extradition. He said that there had been an entrenched resistance
to extradition for many years, and that similar ads had run after
other cases.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Orlandez-Gamboa ran an automotive business in
Colombia and scoffed at prosecutors' charges that his client ran an
international narcotics cartel from a prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jail is not a place to conduct illegal activities,'' he said.

U.S. WOMEN'S OLYMPIC BASKETBALL COACH LIVING HER DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Sitting at her breakfast table with the sun rising on a
hot Florida morning, Louisiana Tech assistant coach Nell Fortner
announced her master plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the Olympic coach,'' Fortner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, OK,'' was the most polite way coaching colleague Tennessee
assistant Mickie DeMoss could respond.
</P>
<P>
   What else could she say?
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't even a head coach yet,'' DeMoss said demurely.
</P>
<P>
   Fortner reflected for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she said, ``then that's what I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I about choked on my eggs,'' DeMoss admits of their 1992
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Fortner and her U.S. women's basketball team
are completing their final preparations for the 2000 Olympic Summer
Games next month in Sydney, Australia. Fortner returns to Texas,
where she played in college from 1978-82, for two exhibitions _
Tuesday night in San Antonio and Wednesday night in Dallas. They
are the first of nine exhibitions for the U.S. team before a Sept.
16 Olympics opener against South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's game at Reunion Arena will mark Fortner's 100th
since she was appointed Team USA's coach in 1997. Her record is
84-14.
</P>
<P>
   In eight years, the former Texas player and Stephen F. Austin
assistant has gone from obscure Louisiana Tech assistant, to Purdue
head coach, to head coach of the WNBA's Indiana Fever to her
lifelong dream of coaching the Olympic team. With that dream comes
the weight of the-U.S.-will-win-the-gold-in-a-walk expectations,
heightened by an undefeated performance by the 1996 team, while
dealing with an entire new set of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even believe this,'' Fortner, 41, said, her eyes
widening. ``I still see friends from Texas and they run into me and
it's like, `Can you believe I'm the Olympic coach?' I always
believed I could be ... my goal was to be the 2008 Olympic coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The native of Jackson, Miss., who later moved to New Braunfels
and starred at Texas from 1978-82 in basketball and volleyball, was
considered a bright mind after Purdue hired her in 1997. She had
spent three years as an assistant at Stephen F. Austin and five at
Louisiana Tech, but it was her work with the '96 Olympic team that
moved her into the upper echelon of coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nell is totally different than (1996 Olympic coach Tara
VanDerveer),'' Olympic guard Dawn Staley said. ``Not to say that
Tara was negative, but Tara was really strict and methodical and
structured, and Nell takes advantage of the talent she has. Nell is
more modern in that she can handle the difference with all of the
distractions. Tara is pretty much cut and paste. Nell can pretty
much survive with any situation that you throw at her.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortner watched VanDerveer do it in '96 when the U.S. team went
52-0 on a pre-Olympic exhibition tour and then was undefeated in
the Olympics for the gold medal. As an assistant on that staff,
Fortner was responsible for scouting, weight training and working
with perimeter players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to sit in the stands at the Olympics and I remember
thinking, `I want to be down there'' on the bench, Fortner said.
</P>
<P>
   She's sitting there now because she relates well to just about
anything. Whether it's her easy going demeanor, soft Southern
accent or disarming smile, her success is directly correlated to
the manner in which she deals with people.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps that some of her closest coaching colleagues _
Tennessee's Pat Summitt, Texas' Jody Conradt, Louisiana Tech's Leon
Barmore and VanDerveer _ are the most respected coaches in the
profession today.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this profession you have a lot of quick studies and Nell is
one of them,'' said DeMoss, a member of the Lady Vols' staff for 15
seasons. ``They move up the ladder quickly, because in our
profession it's hard to find someone who has the total package.
Someone who knows the game, how to teach it and relates to players.
She does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortner doesn't have much choice.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the WNBA and an influx of the professional
woman's basketball player, exposure and better foreign players, the
game has arguably changed more in the past four years than in the
previous 40. With those changes, so has the face of U.S. basketball
evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Fortner has fewer practices, more outside interests and a roster
that won't come completely together until the middle of next week
after the WNBA Finals. Her team went 29-2 in exhibitions last
winter and spring before the players _ all the Olympians except
Teresa Edwards and Katrina McClain play in the WNBA _ joined their
pro teams.
</P>
<P>
   But while everything else changes, the expectations remain the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media perceives the WNBA is the NBA. It's not,'' women's
basketball analyst Ann Meyers said. ``With the WNBA and the
exposure they look at the talent out there and think, `How can they
not win?' It's, `This is their time. USA is the best. And you
better come through.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There is hope that the 2000 team will have a similar impact on
the women's game and gender as the '96 team. But then, there was no
professional league, little media coverage and even less outside
interest other than the quadrennial Olympic celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see it being like '96,'' Fortner said. ``People will
care about it, but it's just different when it's in your home
country. After Sydney, I think what you will see is players
becoming better, faster.''
</P>
<P>
   That's tomorrow, and tomorrow can wait. Today is what Fortner
has to build on what she set out to do eight years ago at a
breakfast table on a college recruiting trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm at the breakfast table now what do I say?'' Fortner
wondered before smiling with quick nod of the head. ``I want to win
a gold medal.'' nn

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: IN CHILE, BALANCE TIPS TOWARD THE VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until the last few weeks, testimony about the horrors committed
by the Chilean military after Gen. Augusto Pinochet's coup in 1973
has virtually all come from one side, the victims'. The military
refused to cooperate with Chile's truth commission and provided
very little information for the families of those who disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The man who walked around Santiago's National Stadium with a
television reporter recently represented something new for
Chileans. Roberto Saldias was a soldier in 1973. He talked about
the executions he witnessed in the stadium. He named one
perpetrator and promised to identify others in court.
</P>
<P>
   The television appearance of Saldias is one more sign of Chile's
transformation. After nearly a year of discussion between military
leaders and some human rights advocates, the armed forces pledged
to help find the bodies of victims if those with information could
remain anonymous. And earlier this month, the Supreme Court
stripped Pinochet of his legislative immunity, providing the first
real chance that he could stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   The change in Chile is in part due to the passage of time, which
has brought a new generation of judges into office. But the
catalyst for their new assertiveness was the arrest of Pinochet in
Britain on a Spanish warrant in 1998. That arrest caused
reverberations elsewhere and led to the detention of Chad's former
dictator in Senegal, although the courts later released him.
</P>
<P>
   Other arrests of tyrannical leaders could follow. But for now,
Pinochet's capture has left a deeper footprint in Chile, where it
has changed the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   New democratic or reformist governments that lack power over the
old guard can do little to reckon with the past. This was true of
Chile until recently, and of most of Latin America's former
military dictatorships. Typically, the generals retain their guns
and can at any moment point them at civilian heads. It is also the
case in most nations of the former Soviet Union, where top
Communist officials retain positions of influence and can block any
moves to bring the old regime's criminals to account.
</P>
<P>
   Very few countries have given victims acknowledgment of their
suffering or families information about lost loved ones. Those that
have done so possessed the power to threaten the collaborators or
murderers with exposure or trials if they did not talk.
</P>
<P>
   Germany opened the files of the secret police, or Stasi, to its
victims. It had not anticipated that as a result, many ex-informers
would contact their victims to sit down and talk. Their motive is
damage control _ they know they will be caught. But it has produced
a healthy outpouring of discussion about why people collaborated
and allowed many Stasi victims to hear personal confessions from
their spies.
</P>
<P>
   Another country that has given some psychological healing to
victims is South Africa. The unique feature of its truth commission
_ those who confess to crimes can get amnesty from prosecution _
has broadened South Africa's reckoning with the past. Instead of
trials in only a few high-profile cases, which is all the country
could very likely afford, dozens of victims got to hear confessions
and relatives of the murdered learned what happened to their loved
ones.
</P>
<P>
   This could happen only because the government of Nelson Mandela
could credibly threaten the old apartheid killers with real jail
time if they did not talk. If Pinochet's successors in Chile had
tried this, the military would simply have laughed.
</P>
<P>
   That changed with Pinochet's arrest. His detention tipped the
balance of power in Chile and unleashed desires for justice that
people had buried for a quarter-century. It also allowed Chile to
press for testimony, offering the same deal as South Africa's truth
commission. The military men who signed agreements in Chile to
provide information on the 1,200 people still missing did so
because for the first time, they run a real risk of prosecution for
the forced disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   If Pinochet is tried in Chile, it will be under a new
interpretation of a general amnesty he decreed in 1978 _ mainly
benefiting his own forces. The courts now say that if the body in a
case has not been found, the case is ongoing and can be prosecuted.
If a body is found, the case becomes a murder _ and therefore
covered by amnesty. So soldiers can escape trial for disappearances
by producing the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The world community could help achieve similar accountings in
other countries if the International Criminal Court were up and
running. Established two years ago in a treaty signed by 120
nations _ the United States not among them _ the court will try
those accused of genocide and other heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It offers the hope of international justice for those too
powerful to be tried at home. But it would also provide an outside
threat of justice that could strengthen a nation's own ability to
try its criminals. The International Criminal Court could help
solve a central problem of dealing with the past _ that nations
most in need of trials are least likely to be able to hold them.

AS TIMBER PRICES RISE, SO DO THEFTS OF TREES
</HEADLINE>
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ State officials, environmentalists and
others renewed their calls on Monday for heavier penalties and
other measures to stop timber theft, during a hearing held by state
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   For those without moral qualms, tree theft has to be one of the
last remaining bargains in New York state: Chop down a tree worth
hundreds, even thousands, of dollars and _ if caught _ pay a paltry
$10 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1909, that has been the minimum penalty for each tree
taken illegally from pristine state forests in the Adirondacks and
the Catskills, even though law enforcement officials can ask for up
to three times the estimated value of those trees. But in many
cases, these officials say, tree rustlers escape without paying
anything at all because it is difficult to catch them and the $10
penalty poses little, if any, deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't speed on state roads because they don't
want to get hit with a heavy fine,'' said Judith Enck, an adviser
for state Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, whose office
prosecutes a half-dozen cases of timber theft a year from public
and private lands. ``This is the equivalent of getting hit with a 7
cents fine if you're caught speeding.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Democratic-led Assembly has passed several
bills that included stiffer penalties for stealing timber from
protected state forest land, but the Republican-led Senate and the
timber industry have opposed those bills because of other
provisions in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a problem with the increase,'' said Thomas
Bergin, a spokesman for Sen. Ronald B. Stafford, a Republican from
Plattsburgh who has introduced a bill that would increase the
penalty to $350 per tree. ``If it was simply a matter of dealing
with timber theft, we'd have a bill today. Unfortunately, the
Assembly attaches other items to it that are, at best, only
peripherally related.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one knows for sure how often trees are filched from
public land, state officials and environmentalists say that it has
become a growing problem as the market value for hardwoods like
black cherry and chestnut has risen to $1,000 or more per tree. Dan
Farrell, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental
Conservation, estimated that trees are illegally taken each year
from about 100 acres of the 4 million acres of state-owned forest
land.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have warned that the damage to forests and
wildlife habitats in the Adirondacks and Catskills goes far beyond
money. ``In the course of stealing 5 or 10 trees, they've damaged
30 trees,'' said John F. Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack
Council, an advocacy and protection group. ``Yet, with 5 or 10
trees, you barely have a $100 fine. It's like spitting on the
sidewalk.''

 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A little over a year ago, De Beers, the mining colossus
straddling the world's diamond trade, confronted double jeopardy.
Human rights groups were accusing it of buying illicit diamonds
from African rebels and rulers who used the proceeds to help pay
for their wars. The essential mystique of its product, nurtured
over decades of artful image-building and brawny cartel management,
seemed threatened by association with these so-called blood
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, De Beers, a South African-based multinational
corporation, faced an even bigger challenge: The company's huge
accumulation of raw gems, used to help control the supply and keep
world diamond prices high, had become a costly albatross. De Beers'
shrinking share of the diamond market was making it harder to
support prices by sopping up gems itself.
</P>
<P>
   Then, De Beers hit upon a way to use the controversy over blood
diamonds to address its commercial problems. It recast and began
promoting itself as the squeaky-clean crusader for guarantees
across the industry that ``conflict diamonds,'' as they are also
called, be kept out of the world of luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
   Far from damaging the company, the controversy over diamonds of
questionable origin helped De Beers draw a line between the
legitimate trade, which the company still dominates, and the
unlawful traffic in diamonds among African rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Edward Jay Epstein, author of a 1982 book about De
Beers, ``The Rise and Fall of Diamonds,'' explained, by supporting
various U.N. embargoes on illicit diamond sales in Angola and
Sierra Leone, the company has effectively enlisted the United
Nations as a policeman to do the job that dictators and mercenaries
once did in keeping more desperate competitors from dumping cheaper
stones onto the market. ``Another brilliant coup, in my opinion,''
Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   As it seeks to improve its image, De Beers is focused on turning
itself into what it calls the ``supplier of choice'' _ a branded,
high-value diamond trader looking to marketing to replace its old
monopoly status and to maintain its leadership of the global market
for uncut diamonds worth $7 billion to $8 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The death over the weekend of the company's patriarch, Harry F.
Oppenheimer, is hardly expected to alter that strategy. The
chairmanship was passed two years ago to his son Nicholas F.
Oppenheimer _ known in South Africa as Nicky. And, family and
continuity are important at De Beers.
</P>
<P>
   With the company's shift in business strategy, using the moral
high ground for a dollars-and-cents strategy, De Beers, by its own
account, may well be starting to turn a corner. Buoyed in part by a
millennial buying spree, its rough diamond sales reached a record
$5.2 billion last year and $3.4 billion in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in sales, De Beers announced last week, allowed it to
reduce its stockpile to $2.7 billion as of the middle of the year
from a $4.8 billion inventory in 1998. And the influx of cash from
sales and corporate restructuring spurred a $1 billion buying spree
aimed at mining interests in South Africa and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, this whole issue of conflict diamonds and the way
they have handled it has fallen in their favor,'' said Bobby Craig,
an industry analyst for Merrill Lynch, who is based in South
Africa. ``They have been able to distance themselves in a very
short period.''
</P>
<P>
   De Beers executives have certainly acknowledged the pragmatism
behind their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the moral imperative and also the fear of what might
happen to the diamond industry,'' Nicky Oppenheimer, the chairman,
said in an interview published last month in the Rapaport Diamond
Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the volume of conflict diamonds which are
less than 4 percent of the world production compared to the 96
percent plus that come from good areas, it is obviously in all our
interests to drive this 4 percent away. Why should any of us put
our business at risk for peanuts like this? That's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Gary M. Ralfe, the managing director, said: ``De Beers as
a company could not afford to even indirectly come anywhere near
diamonds which can be termed conflict diamonds. Like Caesar's wife,
we have to be above reproach.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to this picture.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of commercial, rather than ethical, reasons, the
De Beers stake in many parts of the African diamond trade had been
shrinking even before the United Nations and advocacy groups like
the London-based Global Witness succeeded in pushing conflict
diamonds into the public arena in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, investors were clamoring for more nimble,
more profitable and more accountable corporate behavior from a
company that in South Africa's apartheid era had been a
particularly secretive bastion of the white-run economy.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock price sagged as the company's growth lagged that of
other purveyors of luxury goods, like LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton and the Gucci Group.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that, the De Beers share of the world diamond market
was falling as new rivals, notably in Australia, marketed their own
stones. In the early 1980s, De Beers controlled roughly 85 percent
of both production and global sales of rough diamonds. Today, the
company says, its mines in southern Africa account for around 40
percent of production; marketing deals with Russia and Canada bring
its share of sales to around two-thirds of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The end of apartheid in its South African home base had also
forced the company into a long and complicated unraveling of its
ties with its sister mining conglomerate, the London-based Anglo
American Corp. Each company still holds more than 30 percent of the
other's stock.
</P>
<P>
   By the time conflict diamonds were becoming a worrisome issue
for De Beers, the company had already hired management consultants
from the Boston-based Bain &AMP; Co. to chart a new way of doing
business.
</P>
<P>
   What De Beers wanted to do, Oppenheimer said recently, was ``to
move from being custodian of the market, which was never a very
satisfactory position, to being the leader of the industry'' with
its own product.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There was another, long-range motive: a more open and
competitive image would help the company convince U.S. regulators,
who have accused De Beers of fixing the prices of industrial
diamonds, that it no longer runs afoul of antitrust laws. Until it
does, De Beers cannot set up operations in the United States to
exploit fully its brand name in the world's biggest retail market
for polished stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short to medium term,'' Craig of Merrill Lynch said,
``the chance of them entering the retail market in any meaningful
way will be very dependent on whether they can resolve the
antitrust problem in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Some results of this ferment are evident. In the last few
months, De Beers has been actively seeking to regain ground among
the world's producers with hostile bids for diamond mines in
Australia and Canada, even as it is girding for a fight in Russia
to renew its marketing contract there. All these moves are intended
to bolster its position as the industry leader.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers has also sought to transform the marketplace itself.
</P>
<P>
   The company's power lies in an arcane system of selling
exclusively to 125 ``sightholders'' _ diamond merchants from the
world's leading diamond-cutting centers who gather 10 times a year
in London to buy stones from De Beers' exclusive sales unit, long
called the Central Selling Organization and now renamed the Diamond
Trading Co. as part of the company's rebranding exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The sightholders are a crucial link in the chain of brokers,
cutters and wholesalers that eventually produces the engagement
rings and other glittery jewelry of the world's fragmented $56
billion diamond retail trade, around half of which takes place in
American jewelry stores.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than regulate the price, the company hopes to use its
influence to force a revolution in the supply chain, obliging its
sightholders to espouse a new marketing ethic that would make their
continued access to De Beers gems dependent on their ability to
market and advertise diamonds as luxury goods. De Beers even
introduced a new logo, the ``forevermark,'' to differentiate
diamonds from its Diamond Trading Co. from other stones.
</P>
<P>
   As managers and consultants wrestled with the company's
make-over, the drum beat from critics assailing its oft-denied ties
to Angolan rebels was growing louder.
</P>
<P>
   ``De Beers came under a huge amount of pressure,'' said Charmian
Gooch, a diamond industry expert at Global Witness, the group that
led the charge against De Beers. ``They have only moved because
they have been hit on the head repeatedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers, said Stephen Lussier, De Beers' director of consumer
marketing, were focusing on ``the pedestrian performance of the
diamond industry against the competition'' in the broader luxury
goods market in the last half of the 1990s. The concern, he said,
was that ``we weren't generating the demand for the world's
production; the process was built around creating more demand to
reduce the stockpile.''
</P>
<P>
   What soon became apparent, though, was that the conflict diamond
issue was not going to go away and needed, somehow, to be
dovetailed into the new corporate identity. ``As the process went
on,'' Lussier said, the issue of conflict diamonds ``fitted into
the code of practice'' already under way ``along with other things
we felt we needed to have in a modern, 21st-century industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Introduced last month, the code offers a guarantee that conflict
diamonds will not be sold by De Beers or its associates.
</P>
<P>
   Some company executives boast privately that De Beers
leap-frogged ahead of its critics by embracing even stronger
measures than its adversaries had been demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Since last October, De Beers has suspended all buying of
diamonds outside of its own proprietary stones and its contractual
purchases. In March, it announced plans to certify all diamonds
sold to its sightholders as nonconflict stones. Since then it has
urged a variety of measures, including the creation of a chain of
warranties reaching throughout the business as rough stones are
sold to wholesalers, cut, polished and eventually appear in stores.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps most significantly, it has told its 125
sightholders that they will lose their access to De Beers stones if
they deal in blood diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the De Beers executives now acknowledge, the company
was reluctant to respond to its critics. ``We felt we were the
wrong target,'' said Bill Lear, director of corporate affairs.
Since then, he said, ``we have come to realize that our leadership
position means we must drive the illegitimate diamonds out of the
legitimate sector.''

FARRIS WINS A&AMP;M'S QUARTERBACK BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 A&AMP;M-QUARTERBACK-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M's Mark Farris, a 25-year-old sophomore and former
professional baseball player, will start at quarterback when the
Aggies open the season Sept. 2 at Notre Dame, coach R.C. Slocum
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Farris emerged as the coaching staff's choice after a lengthy,
tightly contested competition that included sophomore Vance Smith
and redshirt freshman Colby Freeman. The three quarterbacks entered
two-a-day practices with their roles undefined after spring drills
failed to produce a clear-cut starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked Mark because of his overall performance in spring
training and summer camp,'' Slocum said. ``We felt like right now,
with all the things we like to do with our offense, he gives us the
best chance at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were rotating three quarterbacks, and it's just really hard
trying to get all three of them equal (repetitions). It made it
hard to get any kind of continuity on offense, and I didn't want to
wait until game week and have the distraction going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris completed only 6 of 16 passes for 53 yards in limited
action as a reserve during the 1999 season, but his maturity played
a significant role in Slocum's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Farris spent five years in the Pittsburgh Pirates' organization
after being selected in the first round of the 1994 June amateur
draft.Farris learned how to cope with adversity trying to move up
the Pirates' chain. He got as high as Double-A Carolina of the
Southern League.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't learn to accept failure, but you learn to deal with
it,'' said Farris, who hit .273 in 111 games for Carolina two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum described the competition as ``very close'' and indicated
that Smith and Freeman will split time working with the second-team
offense during practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is still the same,'' Farris said. ``I do the very best
I can on the field and let the coaches decide who starts and who
gets to play. I have to keep working hard and doing my best. We've
had great competition since the spring, and we will continue to
compete. That competition has helped each of us improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the decision should help ``get the air cleared,''
Slocum said, ``so when we go Notre Dame, there's no distractions at
all about who's going to walk out there as the quarterback.'' nn

 REPORT SPELLS OUT QUACKENBUSH MISDEEDS  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Former Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush and
his top aides deliberately manipulated the Insurance Department's
enforcement activities to benefit his own political fortunes, a
report released Monday concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The final report of the Assembly Insurance Committee _ which
held hearings earlier this year that ultimately led to
Quackenbush's resignation _ says the former commissioner ignored
his responsibilities to victims of the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
Lawmakers alleged that he allowed insurance companies to make
contributions to nonprofit foundations that he founded rather than
pay larger fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Quackenbush and his senior aides used that money to
benefit the commissioner and his associates, not the public,'' the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the committee echoed the findings as the report was
unanimously adopted Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became increasingly clear in the hearings that
(Quackenbush) had abused his public trust,'' said Assemblyman Jack
Scott, D-Altadena, chairman of the committee. ``He had twisted the
powers of his own office so it served his own political interests,
instead of the public that elected him. And so, instead of
protecting consumers, he used his authority to further his own
political ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the committee concurred with that conclusion,
although several spent many hours Sunday night arguing for removal
of language they found too partisan. Quackenbush is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The report also makes several suggestions for possible
legislation to prevent similar abuses from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush resigned June 28 to avoid almost certain impeachment
by the Legislature. Gov. Gray Davis has named former state appeals
court Justice Harry Low to serve the remaining two years of
Quackenbush's term.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that Quackenbush coerced insurance
companies into paying $12 million to two nonprofit foundations he
created, a move that allowed them to avoid millions of dollars in
potential fines for their handling of claims connected with the
Northridge earthquake. Those payments then were used to pay for
television commercials, polls and other outreach that aided
Quackenbush's political career.
</P>
<P>
   Three people are singled out in the report for creating and
implementing the foundation scheme: former Department of Insurance
chief counsel William Palmer; the department's former deputy
commissioner, George Grays; and Joe Shumate, a political consultant
who has run Quackenbush's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer and Grays resigned from the department. Grays has been
named by the state attorney general's office as being the focus of
a criminal investigation and having a central role in running the
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Shumate's role was not detailed until the committee's report was
issued Monday. It says Shumate helped run the foundations,
personally benefited from money paid to his company by the
foundations, and helped those tainted by the scandal to devise
counterattacks and damage control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we were able to spend time reviewing all the facts, it
became clear to many of us that Mr. Shumate had a very central role
in designing and implementing the `perpetual campaign,' '' said
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The ``perpetual campaign'' was the process of using department
enforcement actions to help pay for Quackenbush's political
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Shumate could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's report does not take postions on some of the key
questions raised by the Quackenbush scandal, including whether the
state commissioner should be appointed instead of elected.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the key changes recommended by the committee are that:
</P>
<P>
   -- State law should regulate any spending of enforcement
settlement funds on consumer education and outreach that feature
the commissioner or any other elected official.
</P>
<P>
   -- All money obtained through settlements of enforcement actions
should be deposited in the state general fund, or otherwise be
subject to fiscal oversight or control by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   -- Details of final settlements between the department and
insurance companies should be available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Some committee members warned against trying to pass many of
these recommendations before the Legislature adjourns at the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having these bills rushed through as a knee-jerk
reaction,'' said Assemblyman Dave Cox, R-Fair Oaks. ``The consumers
will be better served if we would consult with the incoming
commissioner and take time to make good laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But several of the ideas in the report, as well as other
suggested reforms, already are in bills moving through the
legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   A bill by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco,
would extend the statute of limitations on Northridge earthquake
claims for one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about restoring the opportunity taken away from some
of the people who were victims, that the former insurance
commissioner took away to help his own fortunes. He took that away
forever,'' Keeley said during Assembly floor debate on the bill
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed the Assembly and now moves back to the Senate.

STATE'S HIGH COURT UPHOLDS SLUGGER BARRY BONDS'
PRENUPTIAL  AGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a decision that could affect thousands of
prenuptial contracts, the California Supreme Court Monday upheld
Giants slugger Barry Bonds' agreement with his former spouse in
which she gave up her right to half the fortune he would earn
during their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sun Bonds did not have a lawyer, the court said she
understood the consequences of signing the premarital agreement the
day before the wedding, voluntarily giving up all her rights to
community property.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling in Bonds' favor, the court appeared to suggest that
requiring each side to have a lawyer would open up a flood of
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a majority of dissolution cases in California at least one
of the two parties apparently is not represented by counsel,''
wrote Chief Justice Ronald George in the court's decision. Having a
lawyer is ``merely one factor among several'' that a court should
consider in deciding whether the agreement was voluntarily signed,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices reversed a state appeals court ruling that required
each spouse-to-be to have independent lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is one of the first in the nation to interpret a
national law adopted by 28 states _ including California _ that
sets out the basic requirements for premarital agreements. One of
the most controversial issues in interpreting these pacts has been
whether each side must have a lawyer to make the agreement valid.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a shutout for Bonds in his six-year divorce
battle. All seven justices ruled in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds was ``ecstatic'' when he heard the news, said his lawyer
Robert Nachshin. ``I`m glad it's 99 percent over,'' said the
outfielder, who must return to the state court of appeal to decide
other issues pertaining to the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate ruling, the court upheld a Malibu couple's
premarital agreement in which each side waived all rights to
spousal support. The wife later changed her mind and upon divorce
sued her ex-husband for support. In that case, both parties were
well-educated, wealthy and had been married before. And each had
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonds case presented far different facts.
</P>
<P>
   The couple met in Montreal in August 1987 when Bonds was a
promising young outfielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates making
$106,000 a year and Sun Bonds was studying to be a beautician. They
were both 23.
</P>
<P>
   After a whirlwind, three-month romance, they became engaged and
set a wedding date for the following February.
</P>
<P>
   On their way to the Phoenix airport, where they were catching a
plane for a Las Vegas wedding the next day, they made a stop at the
office of Bonds' lawyer. Sun Bonds signed a premarital agreement
that she had seen for the first time only a few hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the couple divorced in 1994, Bonds was making $8
million a year with the Giants. Sun Bonds asked for support for
both herself and their young son and daughter. But a San Mateo
judge upheld the agreement, ruling that Sun Bonds voluntarily
signed it. The judge awarded Sun Bonds child support as well as
$10,000 in monthly spousal support, which ended in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds has since remarried and last year signed a $22.9-million
contract with the Giants for two years, plus an option year.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, a state Court of Appeal in San Francisco struck
down the agreement because Sun Bonds did not have a lawyer when she
signed the agreement. In cases where each side does not have an
attorney, courts must ``closely scrutinize'' the circumstances
surrounding the contract, the court said in its 2-to-1 decision.
</P>
<P>
   The court noted that Bonds had two lawyers and a financial
adviser with him when he signed the agreement, while Sun Bonds was
accompanied by only a Swedish friend with no legal background.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said it would be ``unfair'' to hold Sun Bonds, a
Swedish cosmetology student with limited proficiency in English, to
what they said was a sloppily drafted agreement. The court was also
troubled by the last-minute signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But in reversing that decision, the state Supreme Court agreed
with the trial judge's interpretation of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't threatened when she signed the agreement and, in
fact, appeared happy, calm and confident, the high court said. A
lawyer for Bonds discussed the agreement with her at least a week
before she signed it, and even suggested she might want to get her
own lawyer. But she refused, the court said, agreeing with Bonds to
keep their property and earnings separate.
</P>
<P>
   The court also noted that the wedding was a small, impromptu
affair that could easily have been postponed if Sun Bonds wanted to
have a lawyer look over the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also didn't buy the suggestion that Sun Bonds was
naive and vulnerable when she signed over her rights to community
property. Sun Bonds was ``intrepid rather than a person whose will
is easily overborne,'' George said. He noted that she had emigrated
from her homeland when she was barely 20, gotten a job, made
friends and could speak two foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   In interpreting the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, which
California adopted in 1985, the court noted that the drafters
specifically rejected the requirement that each party have a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Although they didn't make it a requirement, the justices
acknowledged it is always a wise precaution to have a lawyer. ``The
best assurance of enforceability is independent representation for
both parties,'' wrote George.
</P>
<P>
   Nachshin, Bonds' trial lawyer from Los Angeles, said he and
Bonds felt ``totally vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the agreement has been upheld, the lawyer said he felt
confident they would prevail in the lower courts in interpreting
other provisions of the contract. The trial court ``found Sun Bonds
to be a totally noncredible witness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sherman, the Berkeley lawyer who argued the appeal for
Bonds, said it is no coincidence that the high court upheld both
the Bonds agreement as well as that in the Malibu case. ``Both
decisions reflect more of a willingness to uphold premarital
agreements,'' he said, ``and only set them aside in exceptional
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Paige Leslie Wickland, the San Francisco lawyer who represented
Sun Bonds, said she was disappointed that the high court gave
little guidance to the lower courts in interpreting these
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a loss to imagine what facts they would find that would
constitute an invalid agreement,'' she said.

 SFO GETS THE DISINCENTIVE PLAN  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Man, am I stupid.
</P>
<P>
   I would think that the most massive San Francisco construction
project since the Two Bridges should be constructed by construction
people in whom the city has faith and trust.
</P>
<P>
   The SFO expansion job _ I would think that you just don't want
it done half-fanny.
</P>
<P>
   I guess that kind of thinking is very naive.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's paper was a story about how a construction company
that has been indicted on charges of defrauding the city's
minority-contracting program is still a major player in the SFO
terminal project.
</P>
<P>
   The city didn't fire Scott-Norman Mechanical Inc., &LR;  because city
officials fear putting the entire airport project behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   However! Once Scott-Norman's portion of the project is finished,
the city is going to sue the contractor for its profits.
</P>
<P>
   So the city is saying, ``Please do your best work on this
crucial project for which we're paying you $89.1 million (!!), then
we're going to sue your pants off.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm so stupid that I would think this is not the ideal way to
insure quality work. Where's the company's motivation to do a
bang-up job? Wouldn't there be the temptation to phone it in?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately we're only talking about the plumbing,
air-conditioning and fire protection systems at the new
international terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Here is this stupid guy's wish: That the project will look and
perform a lot better than it smells.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN 2000: In Al Gore's stump speech (and in Al's case, is
``stump speech'' redundant?), he says proudly, ``I stand before you
as my own man!''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure, but I think this means that Al Gore has made a
significant financial contribution to the Al Gore campaign and
therefore he now exerts a great amount of political influence over
himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice that Al is now his own man, but most of us guys felt
that way the day we got our driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S SAD, almost, the grief some of the dot-commers are starting
to feel as a result of the backlash to their sometimes-heavy-handed
invasion of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle is enriching to the community's vocabulary. The
Wall Street Journal ran a story last Friday, ``San Franciscans
Start to Rue the Dot-com Influx.''
</P>
<P>
   In the story, one dot-commer lamented, ``They call us
dot-commies and dot-communists, even e-holes.''
</P>
<P>
   JOE BAGADONUTS overheard this exchange in a coffee shop
somewhere in North Beach:
</P>
<P>
   Yupster: ``How did your date with the receptionist go?''
</P>
<P>
   Hipster: ``Stellar. I took her to a pre-Burning Man party and
then back to my place.''
</P>
<P>
   Y: ``Did you get lucky?''
</P>
<P>
   H: ``Dude. This IPO was so hot that when we finished, the
neighbors lit up and smoked.''
</P>
<P>
   SOME WISE guy out there, name unknown, refers to that
in-the-spotlight SUV as the Ford Exploder. Cute.
</P>
<P>
   And Fred Wickham poses the legal /philosophical/constitutional
question, ``Is it wrong to yell `Firestone!' in a crowded Ford
Explorer?''
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF faulty tires, Phoenix wonders why consumers don't
have the right to information about how goods are made, especially
goods that can be fatal if they are not expertly assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shouldn't we know if products were produced by scab labor?''
Phoenix asks, referring to Firestone tires made during a plant
strike. ``What good is the union label if it's sewn on by a scab?''
</P>
<P>
   HONK IF you are a man of dubious reputation and character who
spent the night at Xiana's house just before she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects would have been easier for the cops to track if the
mom had only kept a guest book signed by the random overnighters.
</P>
<P>
   SHUT DOWN the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   That's going to be the rallying cry of the rest of baseball once
somebody puts together the evidence that makes it clear the Giants
have an unfair home-park advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: At Saturday's game against the Braves, a stirring
Giants' come-from-behind win, a key hit was a routine fly ball hit
by J.T. Snow that Braves' left fielder B.J. Surhoff lost in the sun
and wind.
</P>
<P>
   There are mysterious wind swirls out in left field that nobody
in the world understands except Barry Bonds. And maybe Barry has
cooler shades than the other guys who play out there.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the first-base ump on Saturday failed to notice
Ellis Burks running out of his legal lane to first base, causing a
key Braves' screwup. The ump wasn't available to explain, but it is
believed that he said of Burks, ``I lost him in the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, left-field bleacher fans turn Giants' outs into homers by
reaching over the wall and snatching the ball before the opposing
left fielder can grab it.
</P>
<P>
   And somehow, the Giants constructed a right-field homer wall
that, with one exception, nobody else in the big leagues but Barry
Bonds can clear.
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you, the rest of baseball is going to demand that
the Giants play their home games at Candlestick until the visitors
are guaranteed a level playing field.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: We recently hired an individual who
graduated from a big-name school, and he just completed his first
project. I cannot believe that he does not know how to write. His
work is filled with errors in grammar and structure, and the
content is thin at best. I can give a new employee some guidance,
but he requires more than I can provide. What do you suggest? H.T.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Just because a person graduated from a big-name
university does not automatically mean he or she is ready for the
big time. In fact, job performance and career success are based
more on the individual than the alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you should meet with your employee and walk
through his report, page by page. Give him clear and specific
feedback on the problems, along with suggestions on how to do a
better job in the future.
</P>
<P>
   You may also need to scale back the difficulty level on his next
assignment and consider providing him with more feedback and
guidance along the way. With this approach, he can make corrections
as needed, and the final draft will not hit you as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   If you apply this approach and the quality is still lacking, he
should be given specific feedback regarding some additional steps
to upgrade his skills in this area. The next move will be up to him
_ and ultimately up to you.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it may also be worthwhile to review your hiring
and screening standards and procedures. Big-name schools are
impressive, but your primary focus should be on people who are
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I hired a new assistant, and now I feel she is trying to
undermine me and get my boss upset with me. She is very clever and
smooth, and she has totally won my boss. I don't want to meet with
her and sound paranoid, but I fear something is going on here. What
should I do? T.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Managers are often advised to hire strong employees to build
a solid department and to increase their own chances of being
promoted. The idea is that if a department has ``bench strength,''
the manager can be promoted and someone within the department will
be ready to step into the vacant position.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some managers fear hiring strong people
because such new hires can make the manager look bad and even lead
to dismissal of the manager. It sounds like you had no fear of
hiring a strong individual, and now you are picking up some cues
she may be strong in the wrong areas.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, all you have is a feeling. You have no hard
facts, no evidence, no real data. Perhaps she is subverting you,
but perhaps she is not. The best approach is to be far more
observant of what is going on in your department. If you see any
acts of sabotage, subterfuge, or insubordination by this new
employee, go immediately to her and then, if necessary, to your
manager.
</P>
<P>
   If this new employee has dreams of becoming a long-term
employee, this approach should wake her up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had a report stored in the documents file in my computer,
and my manager asked to see a copy of it. When I tried to access
it, I couldn't find it. I went into a complete state of panic. It
turned out that a couple of co-workers had moved the report as a
joke. I blew up at them and they said I have no sense of humor. I
got the report to my manager, but I am still upset. Do I have a
right to be? N.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: When it comes to lacking a sense of humor, your co-workers
are at the top of the list. Their practical joke was neither
practical nor a joke. They must have forgotten one of the key
elements of humor _ it is supposed to be funny.
</P>
<P>
   Their action is better described as a dirty trick. It is
mean-spirited, malicious, and hurtful.
</P>
<P>
   You certainly have a right to be upset, but frankly it is not
worth the effort. In fact, if you continue stewing over these
co-workers, all you are doing is letting their pathetic joke
continue.
</P>
<P>
   You expressed your disapproval to them and indicated this type
of nonsense has to stop. In addition, if you did not discuss the
incident with management, you should think about doing so now _ and
definitely do so if there is a repeat performance. Management is
not amused by employees who secretly enter a co-worker's computer
and start moving files around as some sort of joke. In fact,
employees who do this may find they are the ones who will get moved
around.

CLINTON SIDESTEPS RACE THAT HAS STIRRED TENSIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes middle initial of Larry B. Seabrook in 5th graf)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Steering clear of a political struggle that has
stirred ethnic tensions in New York's Democratic Party, Hillary
Rodham Clinton declined Monday to offer her backing for Rep. Eliot
Engel, a five-term Bronx Democrat who is facing a September primary
challenge orchestrated by black and Hispanic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not getting involved in that campaign,'' Clinton said at
a news conference in Yonkers, as Engel stood, stiff and
expressionless, at her side. ``This is a local situation. I'm not
going to have anything to say about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I count both of them as friends, and I'm not going to become,
you know, involved one way or another,'' said Clinton, the
Democratic candidate for senator.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement was in keeping with a general policy of her
campaign not to take sides in any primaries, even ones that involve
incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   This congressional contest has drawn unusual attention since
Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic leader, who is also a senior
Hispanic leader in New York, announced that he was withdrawing his
support for Engel, who is Jewish, and endorsing Larry B. Seabrook,
a state senator who is black.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Engel's supporters and some Jewish newspapers have
assailed Ramirez's decision as a stark attempt to increase the
power of black and Hispanic leaders. Ramirez disputed that Monday,
saying his decision was based on what he described as Engel's
lackluster performance in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Engel, who appeared with Clinton at two campaign stops in lower
Westchester on Monday, said he was not surprised by Clinton's
statement, though he made no effort to hide his disappointment.
``I'm told that she's not endorsing any race in a contested
primary,'' he said. ``If it was solely my race, I would be more
upset about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Engel said that Clinton's decision to sit out this struggle
was likely to complicate her already unsteady position with some
Jewish voters. ``She has a lot of convincing to do in the Jewish
community, and frankly, I think the fact that she's staying neutral
isn't helping her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton discussed Engel's primary challenge on a day in which
she campaigned through Yonkers, before coming here Monday evening
to be the host of a fund-raiser on behalf of the Westchester
Coalition for Legal Abortion. At both stops in Yonkers, she
reprised her attacks her on opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, for his
support of Republican positions backing large tax cuts and against
strict regulation of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent Sunday night at her home in Chappaqua with
President Clinton and, for the first time, she said, with their
dog, Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   She expressed particular delight Monday morning at being at
Sunnyside Manor, a community center for the elderly by the Hudson
River in Yonkers. ``What a well-named, place: Sunnyside!'' she
enthused. ``Look at all these faces; it makes me feel so sunny!''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attempts to avoid a discussion about Engel's campaign,
one of the more complicated ethnic situations on New York's
political landscape this year, suggests the experience the first
lady has gained since she came to New York more than a year ago,
when she found herself ensnared in a number of only-in-New-York
ethnic political disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has appeared at public events with Seabrook and Engel,
in a concerted attempt, her aides said, to appear to be evenhanded.
Several Democrats said that Clinton would be particularly well
advised not to take sides between Ramirez, the powerful Bronx
leader and one of the most influential Hispanics in New York, and
Engel.
</P>
<P>
   And Ramirez applauded Clinton's decision to stay out of the
race, and said his own abandonment of Engel, whom he had supported
before, reflected his conclusion that he was an ``absentee
congressman'' who had lost interest in the concerns of Bronx
residents. He chastised Engel for even complaining about the turn
of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliot Engel ought to stop that nonsense,'' he said. ``Take a
chill pill. Relax. It's just a primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's decision was not without risks. Engel's case
has raised concern among a number of Jewish leaders, some of whom
have already been less than full-throated in their support of
Clinton's campaign. For his part, Engel placed the blame not on
Clinton but on Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept that is the position that she's taken,'' Engel said.
``Let's face it: Robert Ramirez has browbeaten the world and
threatened the world and this is the kind of boss-laded politics he
runs in the Bronx. Everyone is afraid of him.''  &QL;

TERM-LIMIT ADVOCATE TO FILE SUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The last time a Los Angeles County supervisor was
voted out of office, Christopher Skinnell was toddling around home
in Glendale north of Los Angeles, making trouble for his day-care
provider mom.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 23-year-old resident of La Crescenta, 12 miles north of
downtown L.A., is making trouble for what he calls ``the five
little kings,'' championing a ballot initiative that would limit
the five supervisors to two terms of four years each.
</P>
<P>
   Skinnell turned in 300,000 petition signatures for the ballot
initiative this spring, which only required about 197,000 valid
signatures. But County Clerk Conny McCormack initially ruled that
approximately 101,000 of the signatures were invalid mostly because
they were determined to be duplicates, illegible or signers were
not on voter registration rolls.
</P>
<P>
   After Skinnell's volunteers found 1,120 valid signatures
incorrectly disqualified, McCormack acknowledged last week there
are enough valid signatures to place the measure on the ballot. But
her reversal came a week after the deadline for placing measures on
the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Skinnell said he will file a lawsuit Tuesday to reverse the
county registrar's initial ruling and force his initiative on this
fall's ballot. The printing deadline for the November election is
Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met people who think that things are not right in Los
Angeles County,'' Skinnell said. To make them right, ``usually,
what you do is you run for that office, but in the supervisorial
seats, it's practically impossible to defeat the incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last last time that an incumbent was defeated was in 1980,
when Ronald Regan was elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Skinnell is raising the possibility that the
disqualification process might have been tainted to benefit the
supervisors, who hired Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk McCormack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any sort of smoking gun that misconduct occurred,
but it smells bad to me with that much error,'' Skinnell said,
adding that of the disqualified signatures that his six helpers
reviewed, 20 percent of them turned out to be valid. What you're
talking about was 20,000 signatures misclassified. We went in
expecting to find maybe 1 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky and McCormack vehemently denied
any attempt to thwart the initiative's certification.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no effort to bottle it up,'' Yaroslavsky said, adding
that he would not contest Skinnell's lawsuit to recertify the
initiative, and that ``one way of the other, it'll be on the
ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor, who opposes term limits, also characterized
Skinnell as a front man for former supervisor and term-limits
advocate Pete Schabarum, who retired in 1991 after serving 19 years
on the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a grass-roots effort,'' Yaroslavsky said. ``I
think this is Pete's parting shot at the county and at Gloria
Molina,'' who initiated a voting-rights lawsuit that created a
Latino-dominated district and made Schabarum's re-election
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Schabarum could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Skinnell acknowledges that Schabarum's term-limits advocacy
group was the source of $250,000 used to finance the initiative
effort, but adds that he approached Schabarum for help, not the
other way around.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a musician and a day-care provider, Skinnell has made
big-time politics his life at an early age, doing demographic and
other research for congressional and state legislative candidates
whom he declined to name.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to get dragged into this,'' Skinnell
explained.
</P>
<P>
   He got his start in politics after he graduated in 1995 from
Crescenta Valley High School. As a freshman government major at
Claremont McKenna College, he began working at the Rose Institute
of State and Local Government as a research assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 1999 Claremont graduate is a research associate at the
conservative institute and is diligent about noting that his
term-limits crusade is in no way affiliated with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Math Club in high school, Skinnell seems to have
an affinity for numbers. He looks at numbers of voters in a
candidates' district, how they break down into demographic and
political categories. He looks at the same sorts of numbers when
helping with redistricting for an irrigation district in Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   One number he likes to cite is 2 million _ the number of
constituents that county supervisors represent. That's considerably
more than term-limited state senators or Los Angeles City Council
members represent. It's even larger than the constituencies of most
mayors in the state, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Using the advantages of incumbency, of currying favor with
corporations and unions through awarding billions of dollars worth
of contracts and of the campaign financing such favor can easily
drum up, ``you can build your own little fiefdom, and the other
supervisors won't generally interfere,'' Skinnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky and other supervisors oppose term limits, saying
those imposed on the state Legislature in 1990 have led to a game
of political ``musical chairs'' that has left lobbyists and
bureaucrats as the only long-term establishment.
</P>
<P>
   County supervisors are some of the few politicians in L.A.
County without term limits. Many city leaders, including Los
Angeles' City Council and mayor, serve under term limits, as does
the governor, state Assembly members and state senators.
</P>
<P>
   But while the president of the United States is limited to two,
four-year terms, U.S. representatives and U.S. senators do not face
term limits.

TEXAS TECH'S RICKY WILLIAMS HEALTHY AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 TECH-WILLIAMS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ricky Williams took the handoff midway through the third
quarter of the season opener last September in Arizona State's Sun
Devil Stadium, he was a Heisman Trophy candidate on everyone's
preseason All-American list.
</P>
<P>
   Scant seconds later, after tearing a ligament in his left knee,
the Texas Tech running back was destined to become a name on a
surgery schedule and a fixture on the rehabilitation list posted
daily outside the Texas Tech training room.
</P>
<P>
   End of season. Dream interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part of my life was hard for me,'' Williams said. ``You
come out a Heisman Trophy candidate and an All-American, and for
that to be shot down and you suddenly have to start all over ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he feels not so much like a senior trying to
regain the form that made him one of college football's top
players, but more like the freshman who emerged in 1997 from a pack
of candidates vying to replace Byron Hanspard. He gained 894 yards
that year to set a Tech season rushing record for freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel a little like I'm an incoming freshman,''
Williams said. ``I've got to prove that my knee is OK and I can
still get out there and run like I did before. But at this point, I
feel pretty good being in pads and back out there with the team. My
knee is doing good, and most of my confidence in it is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really gotten hit in practice yet, but things are
feeling pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll get hit starting Saturday, when Tech opens its season at
home against New Mexico. Williams, who enters the season with a
2,476 yards rushing in two full seasons, will wear a protective
knee brace into October. Periodically during August, he has taken a
practice off when he experiences soreness. Though he has a hint,
Tech coach Mike Leach can only anticipate what a healthy Williams _
teamed with sophomore scooter Shaud Williams _ could mean to his
pass-happy offense this season.
</P>
<P>
   Shaud Williams averaged 5.9 yards a carry and scored seven
touchdowns last year while gaining a team-leading 658 yards. An
H-back in Leach's offense, he frequently will be on the field at
the same time as Ricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are incredible threats running and catching the ball,''
Leach said. ``We've taken care of Ricky in training camp, but he's
looked good. I had two guys in separate classes at Valdosta State
(1992-96) who both gained over 1,000 yards in this offense, but
I've never had two guys like this at the same time. We're going to
try and get them both the ball as many ways as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kliff Kingsbury relishes the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ricky looks really good,'' Kingsbury said. ``He's
going to be ready to go Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having both he and Shaud out there I think is really going to
make it tough on the defense. We spread them out and start hitting
passes and then hit them with two of the best running backs in the
country? It's kind of like, `What do you do?' from their
standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   To Ricky Williams' credit, the crushing injury didn't bring him
down mentally. Red Raiders fans will recall the animated Williams
hobbling up and down the Raiders' sideline last season, urging the
team on and offering individual encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky was a motivator for us at all our games and even at
practice,'' Shaud said. ``He helped me out a great deal after he
got hurt, telling me little things that would take longer for me to
pick up and learn on my own. But that's the kind of guy Ricky is.
He was not going to let something like the injury keep him away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams said that he continued to take his role as team
captain seriously after he was injured, and that helped his mental
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't perform physically, but I was still captain and
that role called for leadership,'' Williams said. ``Playing that
role is what kept my confidence up. It let my teammates know that I
was still there, and it gave me a feeling that people still
depended on me. And my teammates helped me through rehab, letting
me know that I was still `The Man' and they were depending on me,
that they felt they could still win a lot of games with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Tech coach Spike Dykes said Williams' post-injury
enthusiasm was exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an amazing young man,'' Dykes said. ``He's the most
unselfish, team-oriented guy I've ever been around. A lot of people
in his situation would have lost interest, or be down, or be
negative. He never did any of that. He took (the situation) _ even
though it hurt him badly because he loves to play the game _ and
handled it in the best light I believe I ever saw a guy do.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a senior, asked that Tech not apply for a medical
redshirt so that he can go out with the class he came in with. Once
concerned that there was little role for him in Leach's
pass-oriented attack, he approaches Saturday's first game with
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The running backs are going to get the ball in a lot of
ways,'' Williams said. ``I'm enjoying getting out there and
catching the ball. I feel good about lining up one on one with a
linebacker and he having to cover me in the open field. I feel like
that's going to be one of my strong points.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as his knee holds up, that likely won't be the only one.

McCARNEY, IOWA STATE READY TO MAKE BIG NOISE IN BIG 12 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a coach with a 13-42 career record who is soon to be working
for a new set of bosses, Iowa State coach Dan McCarney acts
downright serene.
</P>
<P>
   McCarney has been the Cyclones' coach since 1995 and over the
past five years has tried to bring Iowa State's program to the
respectable level. School president Martin Jischke, who left for
Purdue in June, and athletic director Gene Smith, who recently took
a similar job at Arizona State, were McCarney believers who had
been patient with the Cyclones' zephyr-like progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel any more pressure,` McCarney said about
performing for new employers. ``I've been asked that a number of
times. I know the program has improved a lot. Anyone close to it
knows that, too. We're a much better program, which is why I think
we're on the threshold of doing some great things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this coaching staff and this football team. I've never
felt as good about anything in my life. We've tried to build this
program the right way. We haven't taken shortcuts. We haven't made
excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's 4-7 record was Iowa State's best under McCarney and
17 starters are returning, plus a senior class of 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do what we can do, he won't have a problem,'' said
fifth-year senior center Ben Bruns. ``And I foresee that happening.
We will have a very successful year. It is a critical time, but
we're all ready for that and we accept it and it doesn't feel like
pressure to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Smith left for Arizona State, the feeling in Ames was
that McCarney needed a winning season to save his job. Last season,
the Cyclones showed signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Their 3-0 start was the school's best since 1981. Iowa State
posted a shutout victory at Nevada-Las Vegas, the first road
shutout since 1978. The Cyclones won at Missouri, ending a 28-game
losing streak in conference road games. But with a chance to record
the first winning season since 1986 and possibly make a bowl game
for the first time since 1978, the Cyclones lost seven of their
last eight. Four of those losses were by less than a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so close,'' McCarney said. ``There were four or five
games that we should've won. We're not that far away. It's a matter
of the guys making a few more plays.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarney believes that Iowa State finally has Big 12
Conference-type players at nearly every position and enough depth
to compete. In particular, the Cyclones have improved defensively.
In McCarney's first season, Iowa State allowed an average of 458
yards and 37 points a game. Last season, opponents averaged 351
yards and 24 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, the way things have changed since my freshman
year to now, it's not even the same sport,'' senior quarterback
Sage Rosenfels said. ``I'm not ripping on the guys who played in
those early years, but we're so much faster and so much more
physical on defense now. We have a lot more depth and a lot of
quality players.''
</P>
<P>
   A few plays here, a few more points there and perhaps Iowa State
will find a way to win six or more games. The Cyclones haven't been
to a bowl game since 1978, a statistic McCarney says is
``sickening.'' Winning would cure that illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the team we have coming back, and with the things we're
going to try to accomplish, the things that Dan McCarney has said
are coming true,'' Iowa State senior defensive end Reggie Hayward
said. ``It has just taken time, but right now, it's a great time to
be a Cyclone.'' nn

   Elarton wins 14th as Astros nip Cubs
</P>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Without actually saying so, the Astros and Chicago Cubs paid
homage to baseball movies Monday night at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Even the expected Cub-friendly gathering at Enron Field had to
give two thumbs up to the Astros after a 5-4 victory that just
reaffirmed how much better they have played over the last five
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Unheralded Joe Slusarski bailed closer Octavio Dotel out of a
no-out, bases-loaded jam in the ninth inning as the Astros escaped
potential disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is not a guy who normally pitches in the late innings, but
he was the freshest guy we had and the least likely to walk
someone,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``And obviously, in
that situation, we couldn't afford to walk anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won for the ninth time in 13 games and are 11-6 in
their last 17 to go four games over .500 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a team perceived to be so bad played so well, the
Cleveland Indians were on their way to winning a pennant on the big
screen in Major League.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs fans, and there were plenty of them, didn't leave the
premises totally disappointed. They got a chance to see Sammy Sosa
hit one of the most awe-inspiring home runs of his career. In a
scene straight out of The Natural, Sosa launched a towering shot
into the left-field lights _ more than 100 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   ``That landed just south of Dallas,'' Astros first baseman Jeff
Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Dierker: ``(Pitching coach) Burt (Hooton) and I both
agreed that we threw a lot of pitches that were hit for home runs,
but not quite as long as that one. That was pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton held the Cubs to three runs in eight innings to
extend his personal winning streak to five games. Elarton (14-4)
has a 3.11 ERA over his last five six starts and owns a sparkling
career winning percentage of .714 (25-10).
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bogar led the Astros with two hits, and Richard Hidalgo
drove in three of the five runs. Bogar also started a crucial
double play in the ninth inning, much to the delight of Slusarski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to keep the ball on the ground and hoping
that we'd come up with a good play behind me, and we did,'' said
Slusarski, who entered the game after Dotel walked the bases loaded
on just 13 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I didn't have to be perfect, but I had to get three
outs. Scott deserved that win; he pitched his rear off.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, who got a swollen finger on his right hand _ the result
of a chopper up the middle in the fifth inning _ didn't have his
best stuff, but it was enough to beat the Cubs, who lost for the
sixth consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are games when you go out there, and you just cruise,
and you don't have to think, which makes it a lot easier,'' Elarton
said. ``But games like this take a lot more effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The first three innings belonged to the pitchers. Cubs starter
Kevin Tapani (8-10) faced the minimum number of hitters, while
Elarton danced around potential trouble to keep the visitors off
the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   That trend ceased in the fourth when Chicago's Damon Buford led
off with a double and scored on Willie Greene's two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros answered with three runs in the bottom of the inning.
Julio Lugo hit a leadoff double and scored on Bogar's single
through the right side, and Hidalgo's two-run blast over the
center-field wall gave the Astros a one-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's 457-foot missile into the lights high above the railroad
tracks in left field tied the score in the fifth and seemed to
mesmerize the crowd of 34,248. It tied Montreal's Andy Tracy for
the longest home run at Enron Field and was Sosa's
major-league-leading 43rd on the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that ball went a foot, it went 550 feet,'' said Astros left
fielder Lance Berkman, who wasn't buying the announced distance.
``There are a only a handful of guys who can hit a ball 550 feet,
and he's one of them. I can guarantee you that ball was approaching
that distance. It wasn't even on its way down.''
</P>
<P>
   The length of Sosa's homer arguably was not as impressive as the
height. According to estimates by Enron Field engineer Rob Harris,
Sosa's homer made contact with the lights 120 to 125 feet above the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually don't watch them,'' Elarton said. ``But when that
one came off the bat, I turned around; I wanted to see it. That's
the most impressive home run I've ever seen. It was a pleasure to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros loaded the bases with none out in the sixth and
reclaimed the lead on Hidalgo's sacrifice fly. At first glance, it
didn't appear the ball would be deep enough to score Lugo from
third base, but left fielder Rondell White made a poor throw, and
Lugo took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou followed with an RBI single, a run that proved
critical when the Cubs got one back in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   After coaxing Eric Young to hit into a double play for only the
ninth time in 483 at-bats _ as a run scored _ Slusarski got a fly
out from Mark Grace to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slu did a great job,'' Bogar said. ``If you had asked me how
we were going to get out of that (jam) without giving up the lead,
I wouldn't have too many options for you.''

   Bagwell only cares about numbers adding up to wins
</P>
<P>
   By JAYNE CUSTRED
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Somewhere, in some small corner of Jeff Bagwell's
heart, there has to be a warm, fuzzy feeling for the kind of
baseball he's been playing since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the satisfaction is there, however deeply buried, for the
elite company Bagwell is now keeping thanks to his fifth
consecutive season of 30 home runs, 100 runs and 100 RBIs. Maybe at
home, in quiet moments, he allows himself to retrieve and savor his
personal accomplishments as of late.
</P>
<P>
   But not publicly, and not for long. In the confines of Enron
Field, there's only one thing that consumes Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know how bad of a season we've had,'' he said. ``That's
really all I can focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask about his becoming the first Astro ever to hit 300 or more
home runs, and he doesn't want to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Mention joining legends like Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Hank Aaron
and Willie Mays with his fifth straight season of 30 homers, 100
runs and 100 RBIs _ making Bagwell only the eighth player in
history to accomplish the feat _ and he admits he knows but doesn't
care.
</P>
<P>
   Comment on his nine home runs in the last 11 games, and there's
no doubt Bagwell cares even less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very overrated stat,'' Bagwell said. ``My job is to
drive in runs and score runs. If I get a two-run homer or a two-run
single, it's fine by me. Run production is what I'm after, not home
runs. Wins and losses are the only stat that I really care about.''
</P>
<P>
   And that stat, unfortunately, is the hardest one for Bagwell to
live with these days. Although the Astros bested the Cubs 5-4
Monday evening, the club still owns the worst record in the majors
at 51-74.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not an individual sport,'' Bagwell said. ``I mean it
is, in some ways. There are individual statistics. But I've been
playing for 10 years, and the only thing I've really wanted in each
of those years is for us to get in the playoffs. With a year like
this one, those personal things just don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the bright spots few and far between for the Astros
this season, dismissing Bagwell's accomplishments leaves precious
little to cheer about. And since the team returned from the
All-Star break on July 13, Bagwell has certainly provided his share
of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell has hit 15 home runs since the break, and perhaps even
more impressive, has 39 RBIs. When the midseason break began,
Bagwell was hitting .294. He's upped his average to .313 since
then. On Sunday, he slugged the 301st homer of his career, and he
had an 18-game hitting streak snapped Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's swinging the bat real well now,'' manager Larry Dierker
said. ``It's always the same with him. When he's swinging well, he
hits it hard all over the place. But no one can explain streaks
like that. Streaks and slumps are inevitable. The great ones just
have longer streaks than they do slumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell is the first to admit he struggled a bit in May and
June. As with a majority of his teammates, things were slow at the
plate for Bagwell. But just as his success now doesn't faze him,
neither did his problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't analyze streaks, bad or good, especially in
baseball,'' Bagwell said. ``There's too many things involved.
You've got to get pitches to hit; then you've got to put the ball
in play with eight players out there. A lot is luck. You've still
got to be lucky. You can't miss the good pitches when you get them.
And you can't worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get a hit, I get a hit. It's too hard of a game as it is
to worry about it. I try for four good ones a night, and if I do,
then it was a good game. There's just a lot you can't control, so
you do the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bagwell, that's usually enough. His 38 homers are
third-best in the National League, and he sits at fifth in the NL
with 103 RBIs. Bagwell is second with 113 runs and third in total
bases with 287.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bagwell's sixth overall season with 100 RBIs or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing with Bagwell,'' Dierker said. ``When he's not
hitting well, he still gets walks and makes the plays and does all
kinds of things to help our team. Anyone in any career has ups and
downs, when you struggle to get the job done. But the really good
ones keep on plugging away when they're struggling and manage to
get the job done anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bagwell is one of those guys.''

KNICKS' DEAL TO TRADE EWING TO SEATTLE FALLS THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to rewrite with additional reporting. Expands by 900 words;
story is now 2 takes.)   
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Ewing, the stoic 7-foot center who for 15
years tried to be the player to bring a championship to the New
York Knicks, was on the brink of being traded Monday night before a
four-team, 13-player deal hit a significant obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, a 38-year-old veteran, was the centerpiece of the
blockbuster deal that would have sent him to the Seattle
SuperSonics, said a National Basketball Association official on the
condition of anonymity. But a division within the Detroit Pistons,
who were set to acquire seven marginal players, caused the team to
call off the trade Monday night; four of the players had contracts
that the team did not want to assume.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ewing's going to Seattle, the proposed trade
would have had the Knicks acquiring forward Vin Baker from the
SuperSonics and forward Glen Rice and center Travis Knight from the
Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers would have received Chris Dudley from the Knicks and
Christian Laettner from the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons would have
added a number of role players from the three teams, including
Vernon Maxwell, Lazaro Borrell, Greg Foster, Vladimir Stepania,
John Celestand, Tyronn Lue and David Wingate.
</P>
<P>
   So the deal has been delayed for at least a day. But it seems
unlikely that Ewing will return to the Knicks next season after the
team seemed to have let him go Monday, even preparing for a
conference call to announce the trade. And Seattle remains
interested in obtaining the 12-time All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons executives, said one person with knowledge of the
negotiations, were strongly debating whether to take on the seven
players. One way to revive the deal may involve Detroit's asking
the three other teams to sweeten the deal with higher-quality
players and more money. The Pistons were willing to receive No. 1
draft picks from the Lakers and the Knicks in addition to an
unspecified amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the trade broke Monday afternoon, Pistons executives
said the team's offices were besieged with negative calls, and they
acknowledged that public opinion might have given them doubts.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the All-Star Grant Hill to Orlando earlier this
month, Detroit was trying to find a creative way to make itself
competitive over the next several years. The best way for the
Pistons to achieve that goal is to acquire players with one year
left on their contracts in order to free salary-cap room to bid for
free agents like Chris Webber and Dikembe Mutombo next summer.
</P>
<P>
   In a summer of monster multiteam deals that involved some of the
game's most prominent players, the proposed trade would have been
the biggest in league history. Last week's four-team, nine-player
swap, which involved Golden State, Utah, Dallas and Boston, marked
the first time four teams agreed to trade players in one package.
With salary complications, that deal took nearly a week to
complete. Prolonging the process was that the three players first
had to sign with their previous teams. One player originally
included in the trade, Utah's Scott Padgett, was eventually taken
out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   So while Ewing was still a Knick Monday night, the prospects of
his remaining in New York are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to win it here,'' Herb Williams, a former Knick,
said Monday night at Madison Square Garden, where he was attending
the Liberty's WNBA playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dominating post players in the NBA's modern era,
Ewing was taken by the Knicks with the No. 1 selection in the 1985
college draft. They won the pick that season by winning the NBA's
first draft lottery; it was a day that sent long-suffering fans
cheering into the streets of Manhattan with the knowledge that the
Knicks would select the scowling, shot-blocking menace from
Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing would lead the Knicks into the playoffs 13 straight years.
With him, the Knicks advanced to the Eastern Conference finals
three times. In 1994, they came within a game of winning the
franchise's first title since 1973 before losing to the Houston
Rockets in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Holder of most major club records, Ewing ended last season as
the 14th-leading scorer in league history. He is fourth in blocked
shots and he played in his 1,000th game last season. Ewing is one
of seven players in NBA annals to spend 15 years with the same
team.
</P>
<P>
   If his longevity was impressive, though, his durability was
wearing thin. In the last three seasons, he missed 88
regular-season games because of injury. From a dislocated right
wrist to a partial tear in his left Achilles' tendon, his
production was severely limited by his health. He could not play in
the 1999 championship series against the San Antonio Spurs, a
series the Knicks lost in five games. He began last season on the
injury list.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ewing came back and silenced his critics for most of the
regular season. He started 62 games, and he dutifully took on a
reduced role in an offense suddenly powered by Allan Houston and
Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   But as the playoffs came, the old question began to re-emerge
outside and inside the locker room: Were the Knicks better off
without their franchise center, the plodding, aging 7-footer whose
post-up, half-court style came to be viewed as a blight to the
Knicks' new high-octane outfit? He would miss two games in the
playoffs because of his Achilles' problem.
</P>
<P>
   In complete games without Ewing against the Indiana Pacers in
the past two postseasons, the Knicks went 5-1. Sprewell tried to
play down the controversy during the Indiana series in June,
saying, ``If we win the championship, Patrick has to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But privately, he, Larry Johnson and others were convinced Ewing
was slowing the offense down.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, John Starks, a former Knick, said: ``You never
know what it took for him to go in the locker room night in and
night out, to take the blame when he didn't win. He's been taking
the blame his whole career. Now there's no more finger-pointing
with Patrick Ewing gone.''

<P>
   George W. Bush speaks of a Jesus who changed his heart. He calls
Jesus his favorite political philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore makes decisions by asking ``What would Jesus do?'' - a
phrase from the WWJD? bracelets made popular by Christian teens.
</P>
<P>
   The two major presidential candidates are campaigning with Jesus
on their lips more often and more publicly than candidates in
previous elections. Even though America is more religiously
diverse, Christian overtones are more pervasive and more sustained
among the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a campaign where some pretty amazing things have
been said - at Salvation Army events, at NAACP events, in a
national debate. I think we can say with virtual certainty that it
will come up again. That will be different,'' said longtime
political analyst Kerby Anderson, president of Probe, a
conservative Christian think tank in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is driven by polls that show a more public faith
plays well with voters who believe in God themselves and who are
concerned with the morality and personal life of the next
president, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin E. Marty, historian, theologian and expert on American
religion, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the American people believe somehow in some
sort of God, and over 80 percent check in on a biblical God. If you
add Islam, clearly four out of five Americans would line up with
God,'' said Marty.
</P>
<P>
   He directed the Public Religion Project at the University of
Chicago and is author of (beginitalic)Politics, Religion and the
Common Good.(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, it's an incomprehensible notion that religion would
have any bearing on politics,'' Marty said. ``They would never
subject their leaders to religious tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe is much more secular than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American presidents and presidential candidates historically
have kept their personal beliefs closer to their hearts and rarely
discussed them openly, Marty said. Such talk was considered
impolite in public and limited to a sort of American civil religion
of ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion became a serious campaign issue for the first time in
1960 when some Americans had concerns the Roman Catholic beliefs of
John F. Kennedy would mean the pope would run the White House.
Kennedy, who believed a president's religious views should be
private, was forced to talk about religion, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1976, Jimmy Carter brought up that he was a born-again
Christian, a familiar phrase among evangelicals and Southerners to
describe a conversion experience, but not as familiar outside those
circles. Later, Carter only used more general God talk, and faith
only rarely and indirectly came up in presidential talk. But
Americans are in a different place today, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of Americans define themselves as evangelical, or
born-again, Christians. That number has grown in the past 30 years,
said Michael Lindsay, Gallup Organization consultant for theology,
religion and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup defines an evangelical as a person meeting three
criteria: Believes the Bible is the actual word of God; experienced
a personal conversion; and seeks to lead non-Christians to
conversion. The Religious Right is a subgroup of evangelicals that
is more political and represents about 10 percent of evangelicals,
according to Gallup.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, 46percent would identify themselves as
evangelical. It's 53percent for Republicans and 40 percent for
Independents. The identification goes beyond conservative
Republicans and crosses denominational lines.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates pay attention to these numbers, Lindsay said, and
after Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, Americans are more
interested in how the personal beliefs of a candidate would affect
his actions in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans see morality and religion tied together,''
Lindsay said. ``For example, 84 percent in this country say Jesus
Christ is God or the son of God. That's remarkable. If you compare
it with Great Britain, about 46percent believe in the divinity of
Christ. Hence, when someone says they have a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ, that does make a difference for a sizable number
of people. They are using the language of evangelicals.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when Bush said Jesus Christ was his favorite political
philosopher, a lot of Americans nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have kids wearing WWJD? armbands,''
Anderson said. ``They're not Christian Right, but they go to
church, are concerned about the direction of the country, and they
are a little more ambivalent about where society is going. Does
faith set well with them? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is Southern Baptist and is active at a church in Arlington,
Va. He grew up in a culture where such talk comes naturally. Bush
grew up Episcopalian and is now Methodist. He had a conversion
experience at a Billy Graham crusade.
</P>
<P>
   For those people who are not in the Jesus camp, these public
professions bring mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Jesus,'' says Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the
Washington, D.C.-based Council on American-Islamic Relations. ``We
would hope that a leader would have a firm moral base and that most
often means a spiritual base as well. We're not particularly
disturbed that someone would express their faith openly.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Paikowsky, executive vice president of the Jewish Federation
of Greater Phoenix, worries about the next step: How political
philosophies tied to Jesus will determine how the country is run.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is thrilled that Gore has picked an Orthodox Jew as a
running mate, Paikowsky said he believes personal religious beliefs
should be kept out of public conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good from many standpoints,'' he said of Joe Lieberman,
Gore's running mate, ``but it doesn't change my general point of
view that I hope candidates continue to be disciplined with regard
to introducing their faith into the electoral campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   People want to know that candidates have thought deeply about
faith issues, and they have the right to know how religious beliefs
will direct actions, said the Rev. Dr. C.Welton Gaddy, executive
director of the Interfaith Alliance. The national organization
represents 100,000 Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, Jews and 50
other faith traditions, and promotes the role of religion in public
life.
</P>
<P>
   But people also can be suspicious about the sincerity of such
statements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you only use religious language when it is politically
profitable?'' he asked. ``If that is the case, are you being
religious or are you being political?''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing private religion into the public world has high risks
and could be in bad taste, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more ample use of religion plays its part, they better
handle it with care,'' he said. ``They better know the risks, and
they better know they will be accused of hypocrisy, and they better
search their hearts. Religion is so easy to exploit. {hellip}
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, if you want to be president of all the people, you
have to watch things. I think we've had enough of the testifying.
Now, we have to see what they do with policies.''

 NEW YORK: Ewing gone.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Knicks, without the injured Ewing, won two straight
playoff games against the Pacers this year, coach Jeff Van Gundy
bristled at questions that Ewing's return might tinker with his
team's on-court chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the foolish remain foolish,'' Van Gundy said. ``I'm not
even trying to educate them.''
</P>
<P>
   But even after sacrificing points and shots, Ewing could not
escape the fickleness of the Garden crowd. When the Knicks were
struggling and he was missing, he became the subject of derisive
remarks and innumerable groans from the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over, Patrick!'' one particularly fed-up fan yelled after
the Knicks were eliminated by the Pacers in Ewing's final game.
``Take the $18 million and retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing is scheduled to make $14 million this season, the last
installment of a four-year, $68 million contract signed in 1997.
Even though his skills and stature as one of the game's elite
centers declined, he spoke often of wanting to play beyond the
coming season.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks balked when it came to talk of a contract extension
beyond this season, a development that forced Ewing and David Falk,
his agent, to consider other options.
</P>
<P>
   After giving Scott Layden, the general manager, a list of eight
teams he would not protest being traded to, Ewing waited for the
Knicks to make their move.
</P>
<P>
   ``To not win here, it probably hurts him even more because he
gave so much to win a title, and unfortunately we didn't get it
done,'' Starks said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months ago, the trade seemed highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for us to get back to the finals, Patrick has to be
part of this team,'' Layden declared in June, the day after the
Knicks were eliminated from the playoffs, when asked if Ewing would
be moved.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Checketts, the Madison Square Garden president, often said
he wanted Ewing to retire as a Knick.
</P>
<P>
   But Ewing's insistence on being compensated beyond this season _
coupled with his growing disenchantment with New York fans and news
media _ made their decision to shop him more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Ewing era would create even more questions for
the franchise's future. Baker, a member of the U.S. Olympic team,
who is coming off two subpar seasons, would fill the club's need at
power forward. After four straight All-Star seasons, Baker has
battled weight and confidence problems. He admitted last season to
being counseled by the players union for depression, though no
condition was ever diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   But with no bona fide center to guard players like Alonzo
Mourning of Miami and the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal, the Knicks
without Ewing would be at a distinct disadvantage in the middle.
With the addition of Rice, a scoring small forward, the possibility
of further moves would be likely. Sprewell, a natural shooting
guard, was the team's starting small forward last season. If he
were to move back to that position to accommodate Rice, then
Houston would be the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   Houston can opt out of his current deal next year. While Van
Gundy is one of Houston's biggest supporters, the Knicks may think
of moving him before he becomes a free agent in order to cure the
imbalance in their lineup. In the meantime, the proposed trade
would give the Knicks more offensive flexibility than ever before.
The Sonics, meanwhile, would get out from under Baker's
constraining contract, which has $77 million and seven years
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the acquisition of Rice would be as part
of a sign-and-trade deal with the Lakers, but Los Angeles, the
defending NBA champion, would rid itself of a player who had
trouble coexisting in an offense dominated by O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   They would also acquire Laettner and Dudley to give O'Neal the
post players he needs to help defend players like San Antonio's Tim
Duncan and David Robinson, and Portland's Rasheed Wallace and
probably Shawn Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   But few players and coaches in the NBA were envisioning what
their teams might look like next season. Most of the conversation
around the league centered on the Knicks parting ways with their
franchise center, the oft-maligned, aging veteran who never
delivered the championship to New York he so desperately wanted _
and thus never earned the adoration of the fans he so desperately
coveted. ``That's sad,'' O'Neal said when informed of the trade
before it fell through. ``You always thought Patrick Ewing would
retire in New York.''

<P>
   George W. Bush speaks of a Jesus who changed his heart. He calls
Jesus his favorite political philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore makes decisions by asking ``What would Jesus do?'' - a
phrase from the WWJD? bracelets made popular by Christian teens.
</P>
<P>
   The two major presidential candidates are campaigning with Jesus
on their lips more often and more publicly than candidates in
previous elections. Even though America is more religiously
diverse, Christian overtones are more pervasive and more sustained
among the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a campaign where some pretty amazing things have
been said - at Salvation Army events, at NAACP events, in a
national debate. I think we can say with virtual certainty that it
will come up again. That will be different,'' said longtime
political analyst Kerby Anderson, president of Probe, a
conservative Christian think tank in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is driven by polls that show a more public faith
plays well with voters who believe in God themselves and who are
concerned with the morality and personal life of the next
president, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin E. Marty, historian, theologian and expert on American
religion, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the American people believe somehow in some
sort of God, and over 80 percent check in on a biblical God. If you
add Islam, clearly four out of five Americans would line up with
God,'' said Marty.
</P>
<P>
   He directed the Public Religion Project at the University of
Chicago and is author of (beginitalic)Politics, Religion and the
Common Good.(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, it's an incomprehensible notion that religion would
have any bearing on politics,'' Marty said. ``They would never
subject their leaders to religious tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe is much more secular than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American presidents and presidential candidates historically
have kept their personal beliefs closer to their hearts and rarely
discussed them openly, Marty said. Such talk was considered
impolite in public and limited to a sort of American civil religion
of ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion became a serious campaign issue for the first time in
1960 when some Americans had concerns the Roman Catholic beliefs of
John F. Kennedy would mean the pope would run the White House.
Kennedy, who believed a president's religious views should be
private, was forced to talk about religion, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1976, Jimmy Carter brought up that he was a born-again
Christian, a familiar phrase among evangelicals and Southerners to
describe a conversion experience, but not as familiar outside those
circles. Later, Carter only used more general God talk, and faith
only rarely and indirectly came up in presidential talk. But
Americans are in a different place today, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of Americans define themselves as evangelical, or
born-again, Christians. That number has grown in the past 30 years,
said Michael Lindsay, Gallup Organization consultant for theology,
religion and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup defines an evangelical as a person meeting three
criteria: Believes the Bible is the actual word of God; experienced
a personal conversion; and seeks to lead non-Christians to
conversion. The Religious Right is a subgroup of evangelicals that
is more political and represents about 10 percent of evangelicals,
according to Gallup.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, 46percent would identify themselves as
evangelical. It's 53percent for Republicans and 40 percent for
Independents. The identification goes beyond conservative
Republicans and crosses denominational lines.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates pay attention to these numbers, Lindsay said, and
after Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, Americans are more
interested in how the personal beliefs of a candidate would affect
his actions in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans see morality and religion tied together,''
Lindsay said. ``For example, 84 percent in this country say Jesus
Christ is God or the son of God. That's remarkable. If you compare
it with Great Britain, about 46percent believe in the divinity of
Christ. Hence, when someone says they have a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ, that does make a difference for a sizable number
of people. They are using the language of evangelicals.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when Bush said Jesus Christ was his favorite political
philosopher, a lot of Americans nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have kids wearing WWJD? armbands,''
Anderson said. ``They're not Christian Right, but they go to
church, are concerned about the direction of the country, and they
are a little more ambivalent about where society is going. Does
faith set well with them? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is Southern Baptist and is active at a church in Arlington,
Va. He grew up in a culture where such talk comes naturally. Bush
grew up Episcopalian and is now Methodist. He had a conversion
experience at a Billy Graham crusade.
</P>
<P>
   For those people who are not in the Jesus camp, these public
professions bring mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Jesus,'' says Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the
Washington, D.C.-based Council on American-Islamic Relations. ``We
would hope that a leader would have a firm moral base and that most
often means a spiritual base as well. We're not particularly
disturbed that someone would express their faith openly.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Paikowsky, executive vice president of the Jewish Federation
of Greater Phoenix, worries about the next step: How political
philosophies tied to Jesus will determine how the country is run.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is thrilled that Gore has picked an Orthodox Jew as a
running mate, Paikowsky said he believes personal religious beliefs
should be kept out of public conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good from many standpoints,'' he said of Joe Lieberman,
Gore's running mate, ``but it doesn't change my general point of
view that I hope candidates continue to be disciplined with regard
to introducing their faith into the electoral campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   People want to know that candidates have thought deeply about
faith issues, and they have the right to know how religious beliefs
will direct actions, said the Rev. Dr. C.Welton Gaddy, executive
director of the Interfaith Alliance. The national organization
represents 100,000 Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, Jews and 50
other faith traditions, and promotes the role of religion in public
life.
</P>
<P>
   But people also can be suspicious about the sincerity of such
statements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you only use religious language when it is politically
profitable?'' he asked. ``If that is the case, are you being
religious or are you being political?''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing private religion into the public world has high risks
and could be in bad taste, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more ample use of religion plays its part, they better
handle it with care,'' he said. ``They better know the risks, and
they better know they will be accused of hypocrisy, and they better
search their hearts. Religion is so easy to exploit. {hellip}
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, if you want to be president of all the people, you
have to watch things. I think we've had enough of the testifying.
Now, we have to see what they do with policies.''

   George W. Bush speaks of a Jesus who changed his heart. He calls
Jesus his favorite political philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore makes decisions by asking ``What would Jesus do?'' - a
phrase from the WWJD? bracelets made popular by Christian teens.
</P>
<P>
   The two major presidential candidates are campaigning with Jesus
on their lips more often and more publicly than candidates in
previous elections. Even though America is more religiously
diverse, Christian overtones are more pervasive and more sustained
among the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a campaign where some pretty amazing things have
been said - at Salvation Army events, at NAACP events, in a
national debate. I think we can say with virtual certainty that it
will come up again. That will be different,'' said longtime
political analyst Kerby Anderson, president of Probe, a
conservative Christian think tank in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is driven by polls that show a more public faith
plays well with voters who believe in God themselves and who are
concerned with the morality and personal life of the next
president, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin E. Marty, historian, theologian and expert on American
religion, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the American people believe somehow in some
sort of God, and over 80 percent check in on a biblical God. If you
add Islam, clearly four out of five Americans would line up with
God,'' said Marty.
</P>
<P>
   He directed the Public Religion Project at the University of
Chicago and is author of (beginitalic)Politics, Religion and the
Common Good.(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, it's an incomprehensible notion that religion would
have any bearing on politics,'' Marty said. ``They would never
subject their leaders to religious tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe is much more secular than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American presidents and presidential candidates historically
have kept their personal beliefs closer to their hearts and rarely
discussed them openly, Marty said. Such talk was considered
impolite in public and limited to a sort of American civil religion
of ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion became a serious campaign issue for the first time in
1960 when some Americans had concerns the Roman Catholic beliefs of
John F. Kennedy would mean the pope would run the White House.
Kennedy, who believed a president's religious views should be
private, was forced to talk about religion, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1976, Jimmy Carter brought up that he was a born-again
Christian, a familiar phrase among evangelicals and Southerners to
describe a conversion experience, but not as familiar outside those
circles. Later, Carter only used more general God talk, and faith
only rarely and indirectly came up in presidential talk. But
Americans are in a different place today, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of Americans define themselves as evangelical, or
born-again, Christians. That number has grown in the past 30 years,
said Michael Lindsay, Gallup Organization consultant for theology,
religion and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup defines an evangelical as a person meeting three
criteria: Believes the Bible is the actual word of God; experienced
a personal conversion; and seeks to lead non-Christians to
conversion. The Religious Right is a subgroup of evangelicals that
is more political and represents about 10 percent of evangelicals,
according to Gallup.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, 46percent would identify themselves as
evangelical. It's 53percent for Republicans and 40 percent for
Independents. The identification goes beyond conservative
Republicans and crosses denominational lines.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates pay attention to these numbers, Lindsay said, and
after Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, Americans are more
interested in how the personal beliefs of a candidate would affect
his actions in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans see morality and religion tied together,''
Lindsay said. ``For example, 84 percent in this country say Jesus
Christ is God or the son of God. That's remarkable. If you compare
it with Great Britain, about 46percent believe in the divinity of
Christ. Hence, when someone says they have a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ, that does make a difference for a sizable number
of people. They are using the language of evangelicals.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when Bush said Jesus Christ was his favorite political
philosopher, a lot of Americans nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have kids wearing WWJD? armbands,''
Anderson said. ``They're not Christian Right, but they go to
church, are concerned about the direction of the country, and they
are a little more ambivalent about where society is going. Does
faith set well with them? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is Southern Baptist and is active at a church in Arlington,
Va. He grew up in a culture where such talk comes naturally. Bush
grew up Episcopalian and is now Methodist. He had a conversion
experience at a Billy Graham crusade.
</P>
<P>
   For those people who are not in the Jesus camp, these public
professions bring mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Jesus,'' says Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the
Washington, D.C.-based Council on American-Islamic Relations. ``We
would hope that a leader would have a firm moral base and that most
often means a spiritual base as well. We're not particularly
disturbed that someone would express their faith openly.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Paikowsky, executive vice president of the Jewish Federation
of Greater Phoenix, worries about the next step: How political
philosophies tied to Jesus will determine how the country is run.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is thrilled that Gore has picked an Orthodox Jew as a
running mate, Paikowsky said he believes personal religious beliefs
should be kept out of public conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good from many standpoints,'' he said of Joe Lieberman,
Gore's running mate, ``but it doesn't change my general point of
view that I hope candidates continue to be disciplined with regard
to introducing their faith into the electoral campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   People want to know that candidates have thought deeply about
faith issues, and they have the right to know how religious beliefs
will direct actions, said the Rev. Dr. C.Welton Gaddy, executive
director of the Interfaith Alliance. The national organization
represents 100,000 Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, Jews and 50
other faith traditions, and promotes the role of religion in public
life.
</P>
<P>
   But people also can be suspicious about the sincerity of such
statements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you only use religious language when it is politically
profitable?'' he asked. ``If that is the case, are you being
religious or are you being political?''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing private religion into the public world has high risks
and could be in bad taste, Marty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more ample use of religion plays its part, they better
handle it with care,'' he said. ``They better know the risks, and
they better know they will be accused of hypocrisy, and they better
search their hearts. Religion is so easy to exploit. {hellip}
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, if you want to be president of all the people, you
have to watch things. I think we've had enough of the testifying.
Now, we have to see what they do with policies.''

   Jesus and the presidency
</P>
<P>
   Until John F. Kennedy was elected president, the country was
pretty much run by Protestants, some of whom were religious
privately but not publicly. It was considered poor taste for
candidates to discuss their private religious beliefs openly but
these same candidates, once elected president, supported the
``American civil religion'' and sprinkled speeches with such
phrases as ``God bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry S. cq stylebook cj Truman (1945-53, Democrat) - A Baptist
who hated public displays of piety. His personal letters to his
wife show he was religiously informed, biblical and godly.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-61, Republican) - Had not attended
church as an adult, but as the president, he joined the National
Presbyterian Church and was baptized. He authorized ``In God We
Trust'' on all money (the motto had been in use on some coins since
1908) and the addition of ``under God'' to the Pledge of
Allegiance. Also played golf on the National Day of Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy (1961-63, Democrat) - His Roman Catholic beliefs
stirred concerns he would show more allegiance to the pope than the
Constitution. His opponent, Richard M. Nixon, said Kennedy's
Catholicism wasn't a problem, and religion would only be an issue
if an agnostic or atheist ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon B. Johnson (1963-69, Democrat) - Affiliated with the
Disciples of Christ; attended church at home and at the National
City Christian Church in Washington, D.C., although he sometimes
attended an Episcopalian church with his wife. He liked to quote
Scripture. cq stylebook cj
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Nixon (1969-74, Republican) - He was raised in a
Quaker church but not much of his religious upbringing showed in
his adult life. In his speeches, he talked about America's faith in
its children, its weapons and in other things rather than about
America's faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald R. Ford (1974-77, Republican) - A churchgoing
Episcopalian who was selected by Congress to replace the resigning
Nixon because of his integrity and character. As a child, the rule
in his house was ``Tell the truth, work hard and come to dinner on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter (1977-81, Democrat) - A Baptist, he was the first
who talked about his faith openly as a candidate and said he was
``born again,'' a code phrase in evangelical circles for describing
a conversion experience. After that, he used more generalized God
language in public. His beliefs influenced his foreign policy
decisions, and he taught Baptist Sunday school while in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan (1981-89, Republican) - He grew up in a Disciples
of Christ church in Illinois and was a member of Hollywood
Presbyterian Church as an adult. He was most aligned with
evangelicals politically but did not certify his religious
experiences with their language. He was respectful and reverent of
religion. He attended church the least of all presidents, saying it
was too much trouble for the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush (1989-93, Republican) - Brought up in an East Coast
Episcopal parish where the mainline Protestant culture nurtured
faith, but parishioners didn't talk too publicly about personal
beliefs. During his terms as vice president and as president, he
was a vestryman at St. Ann's Episcopal Church in Kennebunkport,
Maine. He is active at his Episcopal Church in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton (1993 to present, Democrat) - A Southern Baptist
who knows the Bible well and can readily quote Scripture. He
attends a Methodist church in Washington, D.C. He has received the
most support and the most criticism from religious leaders. He used
the occasion of a September 1998 interfaith prayer breakfast at the
White House to apologize to the country for the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, but he has not talked much about the details of his
personal faith.

<P>
   ``THE HEAD GAME''
</P>
<P>
   By Roger Kahn
</P>
<P>
   (Harcourt, $25)
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing chess at 90 miles an hour, and that's not
boring at all,'' Kahn said when former pitcher Clem Labine asked
him if he was tired of watching baseball. Indeed, this book, due
out in early September, is just another excuse to talk about the
game, and that's OK by us. Kahn's hook is what Labine called ``the
head game: the pitcher thinking, the catcher thinking, the batter,
the anticipating and all the rest.'' There's lots of history as
Kahn talks about the intricacies of pitching and the ``armed men''
who have made their mark. When he once asked Pete Rose to name the
greatest pitcher he'd faced, Rose named three: Sandy Koufax, Bob
Gibson and Juan Marichal. Kahn ties them at second, behind Christy
Mathewson. ``Forget 1910,'' he says. ``Mathewson today would throw
splitters, circle changes and all the rest and outthink the
Griffeys, the McGwires and everyone else. Plus he looked like
Apollo - not a bad thing.'' It's something to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``BETRAYAL OF TRUST: THE COLLAPSE OF GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH''
</P>
<P>
   By Laurie Garrett
</P>
<P>
   (Hyperion, $30)
</P>
<P>
   This is a formidable book in size and subject, one that's not
easy to embrace when most of us view global health as distant and
irrelevant to our lives. Newsday's Garrett admits that ``public
health is a negative - when it's at its best, nothing happens.''
But it is not at its best, and we now worry naively if what is
``over there'' might come ``here.'' Garrett visited India to study
the pneumonic plague, Zaire to focus on the Ebola epidemic that
flourished after corruption destroyed all basic elements of public
health, and Russia, where life expectancy plummeted after the
Soviet Union collapsed. Finally, she returns to the United States
to address the devastating effects of budget cuts during the Reagan
years, the rise of antibiotic-resistant diseases, the threat of
bioterrorism and the effects of HMOs and wealth disparities on
public health. It's accessible, informative reading about an issue
that affects the world community.
</P>
<P>
   ``BLUE GOLD''
</P>
<P>
   By Clive Cussler with Paul Kemprecos
</P>
<P>
   (Pocket, $16)
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Brynhild Sigurd, and you don't want to meet her in a
dark alley. She is nearly 7feet tall, which never helps, and her
heart is cold - as Cussler says with his dubious flair for
description, ``she could have sprung whole from the permafrost.''
Brynhild lives in Valhalla, her redwood castle on the shore of Lake
Tahoe, and holds business meetings aboard a life-sized Viking ship
that sits in what passes for her living room. Needless to say, she
is trouble - she is, in fact, plotting to take over the world's
supply of fresh water. Her first ruthless act is the 1991
kidnapping of a beautiful scientist who had discovered how to
purify saltwater, but things went awry and the scientist became the
captive ``goddess'' of a remote Indian tribe in the rain forest of
Venezuela. Luckily, Cussler's manly hero, Kurt Austin, is on hand
to flirt with the scientist and figure out what Brynhild is up to.
If you like action and don't want to think too hard, Brynhild and
Kurt are for you.

   ``SIN BOLDLY''
</P>
<P>
   By David R. Williams
</P>
<P>
   (Perseus, $7.95)
</P>
<P>
   Will anyone read this book? New &AMP; Notable did, waving our fists
occasionally in a show of solidarity, but then we have a soft spot
for quirky ideas. Its real target audience is college students, who
are a harder sell. Subtitled Dr. Dave's Guide to Writing the
College Paper, it tells us what professors want to see in material
submitted by their students: care with grammar and word usage,
awareness of audience, clarity of ideas and expression - in short,
a good performance. Williams, a professor of English at George
Mason University, was tired of correcting the same errors year
after year, so he wrote some ideas on how his students could make
their work better. Self-published at first, the book has come up in
the world and is attracting attention as a blunt, irreverently
philosophical and occasionally long-winded treatise on selling
yourself and your ideas. It's also a primer on that well-known path
to success: pleasing the boss.

<P>
   In (beginitalic)Godzilla 2000(enditalic), the big lizard with a
chip on his shoulder rises from the ocean and once again smashes
Tokyo to bits.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think they'd put up a fence or something.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, things have changed since Godzilla first romped and
stomped through Japan 45 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the big guy has a new makeup man and a new voice coach.
He looks 20 years younger and a lot meaner, with more teeth and
bigger spikes on his back. His trademark roar is louder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese haven't been sitting still, either. In this
delightfully campy remake, they've updated their technology and now
use sophisticated computers to track Godzilla. Well, not that
sophisticated. After all, Godzilla is 170 feet tall and spews
radioactive fire. He's not really that hard to spot.
</P>
<P>
   The government is backed up by the Godzilla Prediction Network,
which tries to figure out when the big guy will emerge from the
ocean. It's curiously underfunded and understaffed, considering
Godzilla's frequent forays into town.
</P>
<P>
   Also, at some point, Japanese scientists and military guys
started cursing on camera. With Godzilla squashing their minimalls
every few years, who could blame them?
</P>
<P>
   Other than those updates, Toho Studios worked hard to bring
Godzilla back to life in all his cheesy glory, complete with the
original, scratchy Toho logo as well as the standard-issue
miniature buildings, ineffectual toy rockets and badly dubbed
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   If you're expecting a modern science-fiction movie with
state-of-the-art special effects, you'll be sorely disappointed.
This movie is a tribute to the days before computer graphics
dominated the movies, when two guys in rubber suits stepping on a
fake city and toy cars didn't seem all that bad.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Godzilla aficionados will enjoy this one,
which is played for laughs. Some of the dialogue is pulled from
other films - (beginitalic)Dr. Strangelove (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Superman, (enditalic)to name a few - while other lines
offer biting commentary on the monster-movie genre. There's also
some influence from American movies, especially
(beginitalic)Independence Day(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   In a good move, this version of Godzilla has no interest in
being a friend to man or cleaning up the environment. He'd rather
just step on buildings and spit fire, which is what Godzilla does
best.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Godzilla shows up one foggy night and
immediately starts squashing stuff. The Japanese, armed with new,
more powerful weapons, bring the full weight of their military to
bear, with somewhat predictable results.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scientists have discovered a huge rock from outer
space lying at the bottom of the ocean. Once they start fiddling
with it, the thing comes to life and turns into a shiny, flying
computer mouse with a bad attitude. At this point, we get a lot of
N.M. (No Monster) time, as the ship lands on a building and the
scientists scratch their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Godzilla shows up just as a monster pops out of the
ship, and the rumble is on.
</P>
<P>
   The offending monster looks suspiciously like the American
version of Godzilla from the 1998 Matthew Broderick movie. In a
not-so-subtle shot at imitators, there's a lot of dialogue about
the monster trying to steal Godzilla's identity.
</P>
<P>
   But that's impossible. There's only one true Godzilla.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll be back.

<P>
   Charm is an undervalued commodity in movies these days.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of sprawling, violent epics and empty special-effects
vehicles, there's not much room for whimsy. And that's too bad
because films such as (beginitalic)Saving Grace (enditalic)prove
how enchanting such movies can be.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Saving Grace (enditalic)is a small film with some
big laughs, mostly due to stellar performances by Brenda Blethyn
((beginitalic)Secrets &AMP; Lies(enditalic)) and Craig Ferguson
((beginitalic)The Drew Carey Show(enditalic)), who play residents
of a quirky fishing village on the Cornish coast.
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn is Grace Trevethen, whose late husband jumped out of a
plane sans parachute, leaving her with a manor house and a mountain
of debt. Ferguson plays Grace's gardener, Matthew, who proposes
digging Grace out of debt by growing marijuana in her spacious
greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is really secondary in this film, which is all tone and
mood, sprinkled with picturesque shots of the Cornish countryside
and cliffs overhanging the Atlantic. The score is equally
entrancing, and the humor is droll and decidedly British, keeping a
smile on your face throughout.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, this is an actor's movie.
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn carries the film with an utterly convincing portrayal of
Grace, a middle-age woman who has to put aside her morals to save
her home. Ferguson, who also co-wrote the movie, slips easily into
the role of Matthew, an easygoing but rugged Scotsman determined to
settle down with his girlfriend, Nicky (Valerie Edmond).
</P>
<P>
   Nicky provides a nice moral rudder for the film, warning Matthew
that his stunt may have consequences and keeping the movie from
becoming a British version of (beginitalic)Up in Smoke(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The film is buoyed by the gang of oddball townspeople who are
determined to help Grace any way they can: the local tavern keeper,
a pair of elderly lady shopkeepers and the seemingly out-of-touch
town constable. Martin Clunes is especially effective in the role
of the town doctor, who takes a fairly relaxed approach to his
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The film is alternately sidesplitting and poignant as we watch
Grace and Matthew struggle to build their marijuana farm in secret,
with some fairly uneven results. When the greenhouse lights up the
entire night sky, the townspeople first blame aliens and then turn
the whole thing into evening entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a funny bit in which Grace, as the ultimate fish
out of water, goes to London to try to peddle her wares. There she
finds an unlikely ally and meets a French drug dealer (Tcheky
Karyo), who has a hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   While the ending is a bit too pat, by that time, we're all too
charmed to care.
</P>
<P>
   And with (beginitalic)Saving Grace(enditalic), that's really the
point.

 &HT;    `THE CELL' UNLOCKS PSYCHOLOGICAL HELL(a) 
 &HT;    (RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS)(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At times, (beginitalic)The Cell (enditalic)is really tough to
watch. But you just can't take your eyes off it.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally powerful and visually stunning, (beginitalic)The
Cell (enditalic)is a triumph of art direction, set design,
costuming and shotmaking. It is, quite simply, like nothing you've
seen before. Or would want to see again, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   The film is patently disturbing and includes gory, graphic
violence that is not for the faint of heart. Still, it succeeds
through sheer magnitude and sweep, with a clever, taut story that
keeps you guessing until the end.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Jennifer Lopez as Catherine Deane, a psychologist
who can enter a comatose mind through the use of a radically new
technique. Once inside, she attempts to counsel the other mind,
attempting to bring the person back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   But we're not quite sure what's going on. Others in the film
question whether the therapy works, suggesting that Deane is
actually seeing drug-induced hallucinations and not connecting with
the other mind at all.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the macabre dream sequences are spectacular from the
opening scene, in which Deane rides a magnificent black horse past
giant sand dunes to meet with a child she is trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) is on the trail
of serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), a sadomasochist
who tortures and kills women who have certain doll-like features.
The police manage to catch Stargher, but not before he slips into a
coma, leaving his last victim hidden with just 40 hours to live.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Deane and her revolutionary treatment. She volunteers to
enter the killer's mind to find the girl. From there, things get
really freaky.
</P>
<P>
   Combining computer effects with brilliant sets and costumes,
director Tarsem Singh takes the audience inside the killer's
twisted mind, creating a nightmarish dreamscape filled with
medieval torture chambers, snarling demons and opulent throne
rooms, where Stargher indulges his sick fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   We watch with fascination as Deane plays Alice, falling into a
surreal wonderland, where the White Rabbit is replaced by spiders,
snakes and other, even less pleasant, creatures - watch for a horse
of a really different color.
</P>
<P>
   Deane is constantly in danger of accepting the bizarre world as
real and perhaps never escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Those scenes are interspersed with the killer's childhood
memories, which include a sparkling 360-degree shot of an
old-fashioned baptism and an artfully shot sequence involving
Stargher's abusive father.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the movie really takes off and, at the same time,
veers into some gory violence. There's one torture scene that will
make most people uncomfortable, and the ending is also quite
bloody. But it seems that the film is trying to be true to its
nature in reflecting the twisted mind of a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez does a nice job in the leading role, portraying the
psychologist with equal amounts of sympathy and determination. She
also gets to wear fabulous costumes as she plays different roles in
the killer's fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is a standout as the obsessed, haunted FBI agent who's
struggling to find the killer's latest victim. He plays the role
with appropriate weariness, as if he hasn't slept for days.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's D'Onofrio, who portrays several characters in this
film as the killer adopts different personas inside his dream
world. He's under a lot of makeup but turns in a solid performance.
</P>
<P>
   But (beginitalic)The Cell's (enditalic)not really about acting.
It's more of a visual feast. Some of the shots are so amazing
they're really hard to describe.
</P>
<P>
   You just have to be there.

   Mark Twain has been dead for a while, but that doesn't mean he
wouldn't make a boffo U.S. president. Fortunately he's running. Or
at least that's the premise of this oddball site, which appears to
be a campaign clearinghouse for fake press releases, fake polls and
campaign-related sound bites (actually uttered once by the
candidate), and it would all be very jolly if Twain's century-old
quotes about various issues weren't so much smarter than what we're
likely to hear from the actual candidates. Our favorite click at
this address allows acolytes to file their own personal campaign
endorsement. ``It is nearly impossible to be morally bankrupt when
you're dead,'' says one. Our second-favorite click is the media
resources page, which advises reporters that ``the candidate's
schedule does not allow interviews except when he can be caught on
the campaign trail {ellipsis} (but) senior advisers to the campaign
are available to respond to media inquiries.'' Run, Sam, run.

George Gilder says that optical networks ``are vital to the
fulfillment of the business plans of the Internet economy and the
future of world peace and prosperity.'' And to think,

   In (beginitalic)Godzilla 2000(enditalic), the big lizard with a
chip on his shoulder rises from the ocean and once again smashes
Tokyo to bits.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think they'd put up a fence or something.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, things have changed since Godzilla first romped and
stomped through Japan 45 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the big guy has a new makeup man and a new voice coach.
He looks 20 years younger and a lot meaner, with more teeth and
bigger spikes on his back. His trademark roar is louder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese haven't been sitting still, either. In this
delightfully campy remake, they've updated their technology and now
use sophisticated computers to track Godzilla. Well, not that
sophisticated. After all, Godzilla is 170 feet tall and spews
radioactive fire. He's not really that hard to spot.
</P>
<P>
   The government is backed up by the Godzilla Prediction Network,
which tries to figure out when the big guy will emerge from the
ocean. It's curiously underfunded and understaffed, considering
Godzilla's frequent forays into town.
</P>
<P>
   Also, at some point, Japanese scientists and military guys
started cursing on camera. With Godzilla squashing their minimalls
every few years, who could blame them?
</P>
<P>
   Other than those updates, Toho Studios worked hard to bring
Godzilla back to life in all his cheesy glory, complete with the
original, scratchy Toho logo as well as the standard-issue
miniature buildings, ineffectual toy rockets and badly dubbed
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   If you're expecting a modern science-fiction movie with
state-of-the-art special effects, you'll be sorely disappointed.
This movie is a tribute to the days before computer graphics
dominated the movies, when two guys in rubber suits stepping on a
fake city and toy cars didn't seem all that bad.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Godzilla aficionados will enjoy this one,
which is played for laughs. Some of the dialogue is pulled from
other films - (beginitalic)Dr. Strangelove (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Superman, (enditalic)to name a few - while other lines
offer biting commentary on the monster-movie genre. There's also
some influence from American movies, especially
(beginitalic)Independence Day(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   In a good move, this version of Godzilla has no interest in
being a friend to man or cleaning up the environment. He'd rather
just step on buildings and spit fire, which is what Godzilla does
best.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Godzilla shows up one foggy night and
immediately starts squashing stuff. The Japanese, armed with new,
more powerful weapons, bring the full weight of their military to
bear, with somewhat predictable results.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scientists have discovered a huge rock from outer
space lying at the bottom of the ocean. Once they start fiddling
with it, the thing comes to life and turns into a shiny, flying
computer mouse with a bad attitude. At this point, we get a lot of
N.M. (No Monster) time, as the ship lands on a building and the
scientists scratch their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Godzilla shows up just as a monster pops out of the
ship, and the rumble is on.
</P>
<P>
   The offending monster looks suspiciously like the American
version of Godzilla from the 1998 Matthew Broderick movie. In a
not-so-subtle shot at imitators, there's a lot of dialogue about
the monster trying to steal Godzilla's identity.
</P>
<P>
   But that's impossible. There's only one true Godzilla.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll be back.

 &HT;    PHYSICIAN: SOME PATIENTS MAKE FALSE ACCUSATIONS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By DAVID PARRISH AND JODIE SNYDER(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Mark D. Goldberg has been in more trouble for more reasons
than perhaps any other physician in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He once prescribed 1,532 addictive painkillers to a woman
without examining her.
</P>
<P>
   He was accused of trading drug prescriptions for sex.
</P>
<P>
   When the state sent an undercover agent to his office with a
fake injury, he appeared to coach her on how to get workers'
compensation benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his patients died when either their X-rays or tests went
unread or ignored; another died when her severe headache turned out
to be a ruptured blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Board of Medical Examiners has censured Goldberg,
placed him on probation and publicly questioned his competency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of that, he is still practicing medicine in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the 42-year-old family practitioner has
owned and operated up to four clinics in Mesa and Apache Junction.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, Goldberg filed for bankruptcy protection, in part
because a patient was suing him, accusing him of sexual misconduct,
and his malpractice insurance policy wouldn't pay if he lost the
case. The suit is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg had amassed debts of $434,000, according to bankruptcy
records. He listed as debts and expenses a $1,000-a-month lease on
a new Mercedes-Benz, $30,000 in credit card charges, $1,800 in
monthly child support payments and a $2,900 monthly mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg declined a request for an interview on the advice of
his attorney. In a written statement, Goldberg said he has treated
thousands of patients for years without problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say I have had no patient complaints,'' he
wrote. ``What I can say is that I have done my best to provide my
patients with the high quality care they deserve and that I
continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AN EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg never graduated from college, according to his
testimony in legal documents.
</P>
<P>
   A New York City native, he attended a community college and a
state university in Los Angeles, but left without a degree to
pursue a career in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he went to the Caribbean, where he attended
Universidad C.E.T.E.C. Escuela de Medicina in the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from medical school in 1983, and the next year, the
school closed after revelations that officials were selling medical
degrees for $5,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pay for anything you want here - diplomas,
transcripts, grades, anything,'' Roger Heil, a New York medical
student, told a reporter in 1984 when the medical school and
another in Santo Domingo were shut down by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Some students never attended classes; they just paid tuition and
got their degrees, Dominican Republic officials said in news
reports at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In his written statement, Goldberg acknowledged that his medical
school was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to point out that the school was accredited
during the period I attended there and that I spent the last two
years of medical school in an exchange program attending the
University of Maryland affiliated hospitals,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg came back to the United States and did his residency
training at South Nassau Community Hospital in Oceanside, N.Y.
Afterward, he taught at a medical and dental college, then worked
in a New Jersey urgent-care clinic. There are no records of
problems during this time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Goldberg came West to practice medicine in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, he became Anna Pauer's doctor.
</P>
<P>
   A Mesa real estate agent and grandmother, Pauer, 69, was
terrified of cancer after her husband died of the disease. She kept
asking Goldberg to watch for signs of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A radiologist read one of Pauer's routine X-rays in 1990 and
spotted what he thought might be a cancerous growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspect vascular lesion in the upper part of the right kidney.
This could conceivably be a neoplasm (possible cancer),'' wrote Dr.
M. Kirdani in his August 1990 report.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg did nothing for nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
   A May 1994 chest X-ray confirmed Pauer's worst fears: She had
cancer. Pauer died three months later.
</P>
<P>
   Her family sued Goldberg, saying he should have diagnosed the
cancer earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg testified in a deposition that he never saw the
radiologist's report, despite the fact that it was in Pauer's
medical file in his office.
</P>
<P>
   There were other indications that Pauer might have cancer.
Lesions were found in a 1992 bone scan, but Goldberg went along
with a cancer specialist's opinion that no further testing was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The medical board reviewed the case in October 1995 and decided
against discipline. Instead, the board issued Goldberg a
non-disciplinary advisory letter. Pauer's family and Goldberg
settled the lawsuit out of court for an undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   PATIENTS WERE DYING
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, two more of Goldberg's patients died.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1995, a 33-year-old woman with a history of high
blood pressure and circulatory problems told Goldberg she had
severe headaches and a persistent cough. Previously, she suffered a
subdural hematoma, an enlarged blood clot in the layer of tissue
covering the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg checked her lungs but performed no other exam, although
severe headaches are a sign of a hematoma or a hemorrhage. Goldberg
noted in her file that she was doing remarkably well, according to
medical board records.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after seeing Goldberg, the woman, who is not
identified in medical board records, was examined by another doctor
who ordered a brain scan. The scan revealed bleeding on the surface
of the brain. She died shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   If treated quickly, about half of patients survive such a
hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1996 hearing on the matter, Dr. Barry Weiss, a medical
board member, said the headache ``warranted a more comprehensive
examination than was noted in her chart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Specifically,'' he said, ``because she died three days later.
She probably had some significant problems during that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Another patient died of lung cancer that was clearly visible in
an X-ray that Goldberg didn't examine for six weeks, according to
the medical board.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 20, 1994, Goldberg ordered a chest X-ray during a
routine physical for a 73-year-old man. The man had other chest
X-rays annually for the five previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, the man, who was not identified by the medical
board, returned, reporting chills and a temperature. Goldberg still
had not read the January X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   A different doctor ordered more X-rays and found a tumor the
size of a golf ball in the man's right lung. He died May 19, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he had five sets of X-rays since 1989, there was no
evidence that (Goldberg) read these X-rays,'' Weiss said during the
subsequent board hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg told the board that he read the man's X-rays from 1989
on. He couldn't explain why the medical file didn't indicate that
he had looked at the X-rays. There must have been a mix-up, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, he didn't get to X-rays quickly when the patient
seemed to be in good health, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever the reason, we had gotten four or five weeks
behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-FLOWING PHARMACY
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Goldberg also prescribed powerful drugs to at
least seven patients with brief or no examinations or without
exploring other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Goldberg prescribed to one patient the equivalent
of 2.1 daily dosages of Lortab, a painkiller, from 1993 to 1995
without documenting that he conducted any examination, according to
medical board records.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Goldberg repeatedly refilled a 10-year-old's
Ritalin prescription without ever seeing the child, board records
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor is rather quick on the draw to treat people with
controlled substances and narcotics for problems that are not well
documented, and often the narcotics are used instead of or in
advance of more standard treatment. That's sort of not good
medicine,'' Weiss said in a report to the medical board.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to questions about his medical practices, Goldberg
has faced accusations of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Two female patients accused him of preying on them when they
went to him for medical care. Goldberg has repeatedly denied any
impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some patients make false charges against physicians,''
Goldberg wrote to(beginitalic) The Republic. (enditalic)''It has
been my misfortune to have experienced the reality of that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rena Headlee, a single mother of three, went to see
Goldberg after a 1992 auto accident, she already had seen a lot of
trouble in her life. She had been abused as a child; she had been
divorced twice; and a third husband had died of cancer. She had a
history of abusing prescription drugs and had undergone treatment
for addiction and depression at a Tucson clinic.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Goldberg gave Headlee painkillers for neck and back
pain. Within a few months, she couldn't sleep without taking one or
two sleeping pills, she said in legal records. She also began
taking Xanax, a drug that eases anxiety and panic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One night, Headlee attempted suicide by overdosing on sleeping
pills. She saw an orthopedic surgeon, who wrote Goldberg a letter
urging him to wean her from the addictive medication.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg did just the opposite, Headlee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted me to know that the average doctor wouldn't be
giving this medicine due to (my) history. Basically, it's just you
do me a favor, I'm doing you a favor,'' she told medical board
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The favor he wanted? Sex, according to Headlee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets your hand and puts it on his privates,'' Headlee said
in a January 1996 interview with medical board investigators. ``He
just wants you to turn around, and it's like a minute or two and
that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Headlee said she had sex at least 20 times with Goldberg in his
medical offices in Mesa and Apache Junction.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg would write her a prescription for 20 pills, then if
she cooperated sexually, he would write a prescription for 100
more, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Headlee said, she persuaded Goldberg to postdate
prescriptions so she wouldn't have to come to his clinic as
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, nearly four years after it started, Headlee said she
felt like ``dirt because of what I was doing,'' and she went to the
Mesa Police Department. They investigated and decided there wasn't
enough evidence to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   Headlee then reported what happened to the medical board.
Attorneys associated with the case said the board is still
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Headlee fatally shot herself.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said Headlee's charge ``was both unbelievable and sad
because it was indicative of a troubled mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's attorneys also contend thatHeadlee had a history of
making sexual allegations. They cited a 1992 Mesa Police Department
report in which Headlee accused a Mesa police officer of fondling
her.
</P>
<P>
   MORE SEX ALLEGATIONS
</P>
<P>
   While Headlee's tragedy was unfolding, another woman was
accusing Goldberg of sexual advances.
</P>
<P>
   Cyndie Mathers, 41, who suffers from a brain injury and
associated behavioral problems, went to Goldberg to get referrals
to a radiologist and neurologist, mainly to pursue a lawsuit
against another doctor. She alleges in an ongoing lawsuit that
Goldberg solicited sex from her in exchange for the referrals.
</P>
<P>
   The medical board said she appeared to have a vendetta against
Goldberg, and in 1996, dismissed her complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The state Attorney General's Office also investigated but could
not build a case against Goldberg, records show. Two
surreptitiously taped conversations were judged to be inconclusive
by investigators because Goldberg never directly asked for sex.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of a Dec. 9, 1993, taped conversation between the two:
</P>
<P>
   Mathers: ``Do you want to meet at a motel or do you want to meet
here or do you want to?''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg: ``Either way, we'll decide. Let's get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathers: ``When? You name the time. You name the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg: ``Mmm, (pause). How about next week?''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to (beginitalic)The Republic(enditalic),
Goldberg said he never sought sex from Mathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had any poor judgment in regard to Ms. Mathers, it was
agreeing to try to help her medically when I was aware of her
history with the other doctors,'' Goldberg wrote.
</P>
<P>
   TAPED CONVERSATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the Attorney General's Office sent Special Agent
Linda Bergevin to Goldberg's office. She posed as a stripper who
had slipped on some beer at work and injured her knee and wrist.
She told Goldberg she wanted to pursue a workers' compensation
claim and a lawsuit against the bar owner.
</P>
<P>
   Transcripts of conversations recorded with a hidden microphone
during several office visits with Goldberg make it clear she was
playing up to him to see if he would proposition her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the nicest doctor I've ever met,'' she cooed to
Goldberg at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg did ask Bergevin out for a drink, but he seemed more
interested in the insurance claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was your right wrist and your right knee, right?'' Goldberg
asked Bergevin during one office visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your wrist is fine now, right?'' Goldberg asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But your knee is still bothering you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we'll just say that it's still bothering you,'' Goldberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still bothering - how long does it have to still bother
me?'' Bergevin asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another couple of weeks,'' Goldberg said, suggesting she come
for three more office visits. ``I mean, just to create a nice
picture for the whole thing. If your pain goes away completely,
well then at that point, a couple more weeks I'll see you and then
we'll dump it. That'll be the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But will I still put my claim in?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, of course,'' Goldberg said. ``They believe anything a
doctor says.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 medical board hearing, Goldberg denied he ever
meant to defraud the state with a specious workers' compensation
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg could not explain to the board why he asked the
undercover agent out for a drink.
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General's Office considered seeking criminal
charges against Goldberg, but decided not to because the state was
never actually defrauded, records show. In January 1996, the
medical board censured Goldberg in the case.
</P>
<P>
   For his other problems, over prescribing drugs and his
questionable treatment of the two patients who died, the medical
board in 1996 gave Goldberg five years of probation and ordered him
to take an exam to prove his medical competency.
</P>
<P>
   He passed.

NBA MEGADEAL GOES BUST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Patrick Ewing nearly became a Seattle SuperSonic,
the Los Angeles Lakers almost landed a desperately needed power
forward and disgruntled Glen Rice came within a New York minute of
becoming a Knick on Monday. But it all crashed with a thud when a
complex four-team megadeal unraveled late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dead,'' an NBA source familiar with the discussions told
the Daily News on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed blockbuster - which revolved around Knicks legend
Ewing, Sonics disappointment Vin Baker and Lakers free agent Rice -
would have involved more than a dozen players, many of them
unsigned free agents, plus draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   But the fragile deal collapsed when the Detroit Pistons - who
would have sent Christian Laettner to the Lakers - pulled out,
sources said. However, some of the officials involved in the
negotiations believe the four-way trade could be revived if the
deal is sweetened for the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, having already lost star Grant Hill, would have
acquired a mish-mash of role players with short contracts in an
effort to get under the salary cap next summer. But the deal proved
unpalatable to the Pistons, who would have given up Laettner while
acquiring the likes of Tyronn Lue and John Celestand from the
Lakers and Vladimir Stepania, Lazaro Borrell and Vernon Maxwell,
among others, from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pistons out, the entire deal fizzled. The Knicks and
Sonics still might try swapping Ewing and Baker, however.
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers' search for a starting power forward, and a home
for Rice, continues.
</P>
<P>
   They have been after Laettner, who has one year left on his
contract, for much of the summer. The Lakers could have earlier
acquired Laettner in a one-for-one deal, but sources said Rice - a
free agent who must first sign a contract with L.A. - did not want
to play for Detroit and nixed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Laettner would have stepped immediately into the Lakers'
starting lineup, filling their greatest need. Had the four-team
deal been consummated, the Lakers also would have acquired Knicks
center Chris Dudley and New York rookie Lavor Postell.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the Lakers would have signed Rice to a contract
starting at about $9 million, then traded him to New York, along
with Travis Knight. They also would have re-signed Celestand, then
dealt him and Lue, along with a first-round draft pick, to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to acquiring two big men, the Lakers would have
unloaded the last four years and $15 million of Knight's deal and
the last year of Lue's contract. Neither player fits into coach
Phil Jackson's plans.
</P>
<P>
   But this deal was not a perfect one for the Lakers, either.
Laettner's contract has a clause that would have bumped his salary
by $1.5 million - to more than $8 million total - if his team wins
a championship. He also would be a free agent next summer, leaving
the Lakers with a vacancy at power forward once more.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley has two seasons at $7 million annually left on his
bloated contract, although the Lakers could have bought out the
second year for $2 million. Thus, they would have paid $9 million
for a 35-year-old backup center with scant skills and a free-throw
percentage that makes Shaquille O'Neal look proficient by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from all four teams declined comment Monday. Lakers
general manager Mitch Kupchak did not return phone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have not made a significant addition to the roster
since winning the championship in June. Their first priority
remains dealing Rice and obtaining players of value in return. They
also have salary-cap exceptions for $2.25 million and $1.2 million
to spend on free agents.

PADRES BEAT METS ON WALK IN 10TH, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The crowd started hooting on Dennis Cook's first
ball to Dave Magadan with the bases loaded in the bottom of the
10th Monday night. The hoots became roars when ball two sailed by.
In his second inning of work, Cook had already walked four hitters.
The unpredictable Mets left-hander was about to unravel again.
</P>
<P>
   Cook got a called strike, then a fastball came in a little low.
Cook smirked _ he felt his strike zone had been squeezed by the
home plate umpire, Gerry Davis, in the ninth _ and his final pitch
was at Magadan's shoe tops. It was ball four, and it forced in the
winning run as the Padres beat the Mets, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Cook (6-3) stalked off the mound, hollering at Davis and holding
his hands close together, giving his representation of Davis'
strike zone. Cook shook his head and glanced once more toward Davis
before slipping into the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Mets two and a half games behind Atlanta in
the National League East, but they retained their
three-and-a-half-game lead over Arizona in the wild-card race.
Trevor Hoffman (4-4) was the winner for San Diego in relief of
Woody Williams, who pitched nine innings but lost a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres got out of the top of the ninth when Derek Bell of
the Mets was called out for interfering with Padres catcher Wiki
Gonzalez, who was trying to catch Darryl Hamilton stealing. Manager
Bobby Valentine argued unsuccessfully with Davis, and Cook came in
to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez led off the ninth with a smash to right-center, and Jay
Payton _ who is fast enough and takes good enough reads to play
shallow _ dashed back to the warning track to take away an
extra-base hit. But pinch-hitter Joe Vitiello walked, and
pinch-runner Damian Jackson stole second. With two outs and runners
at first and second, Cook fanned Ryan Klesko on a sidearm slider to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook opened the 10th with a walk to Phil Nevin. Ruben Rivera
reached on a fielder's choice, and a single by Mike Darr and a walk
to Gonzalez loaded the bases for the pinch-hitter Magadan.
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Rusch's outing had long since ended by then, but his
perseverance allowed the Mets to use their bullpen later rather
than sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Ten times in Rusch's first 13 starts this year, he pitched at
least six innings and allowed no more than three earned runs. For
only the fourth time in 10 starts, Rusch matched that criteria, and
the Mets needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch had to give the Mets innings; the bullpen worked four and
a third innings Sunday, and the long reliever Pat Mahomes is
starting Tuesday for Mike Hampton, who is being held back because
of a stress fracture in his right ribs, which forced him from his
start last Thursday. Hampton will probably need to throw two
bullpen sessions before he can start again, and the Mets are not
sure when that will be.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres jumped to a 4-0 lead, partly because of sloppy
defense but also because they wore down a control pitcher. With two
outs and the bases empty in the first, Klesko fouled off four
pitches with a 3-2 count. Rusch, who averages only two walks per
nine innings, lost the duel and walked Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   Then he had Klesko picked off, but first baseman Lenny Harris,
giving Todd Zeile a day off, threw the ball off Klesko's body for
an error. Phil Nevin's bloop single scored Klesko with an unearned
run.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch threw 34 pitches that inning and 36 in the second, an
inning that began with Rivera being hit by a pitch. Darr singled,
but with two outs, Eric Owens reached on an infield single when
second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo threw late to third in an attempt to
catch Rivera off base.
</P>
<P>
   The bases were loaded, and Rusch did the unthinkable: He walked
the weak-hitting Desi Relaford to force in a run. Rusch kicked his
leg in frustration, and Klesko slammed down his bat and helmet when
he struck out one batter later to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch continued to stumble in the third, when his curveball
escaped him as Rivera bashed it for a run-scoring triple and Darr
pounded it for a run-scoring single that put the Padres ahead, 4-0.
A line-drive double play ended the inning, and there was no telling
then that Rusch would settle down as he did, allowing one hit and
striking out four over three scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could not score for him until the sixth. In the fourth,
Mike Piazza rifled a low line drive to the warning track in left
field, where the ball took one bounce off the soft wall. Piazza
could get only a single; he had hit it too hard for extra bases.
</P>
<P>
   Singles by Robin Ventura and Benny Agbayani loaded the bases for
Jay Payton, who was 0 for 16 in his career with the bases loaded.
He lined out to right, where Darr caught the ball and threw to
first baseman Klesko, whose relay beat a sliding Piazza for the
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, after Ventura's third single put runners at first
and second, Agbayani blasted Williams' first pitch over the fence
in left-center field. It was his 11th home run, and probably his
most important since his game-winning grand slam in Tokyo in March.
The three-run blast got the Mets into the game, and they tied it,
4-4, in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick reached on a throwing error by the shortstop
Relaford and, with one out, Harris singled Bordick to third. Bell,
who is in the midst of another awful slump, chopped a ball in front
of first base, where Williams fielded it, wheeled and threw to
home. But Bordick slid by with the tying run.

LIBERTY DEFEATS ROCKERS, 81-67, TO REACH WNBA FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the mad-dash opening minutes of Monday night's
Eastern Conference finals, the Liberty played as if there were only
a tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The present passed in a blur, as Liberty players steamrolled the
visiting Cleveland Rockers in the first half, turning them into
wide-eyed tourists unnerved by the rush of bodies, bright lights
and brash sounds in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty launched a 30-2 run from the opening tap and held
the Rockers scoreless for 10 minutes in the first half, which was
nearly a repeat of what happened in Sunday's Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in another nightmarish repeat of Game 2 for the
Liberty, the Rockers recovered in the second half, closing within
10 points with just under three minutes remaining in the game and
introducing doubt into what had been total domination.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty players have used doubt as a weapon this year, and
in the final minutes once again turned back Cleveland to send the
confetti showering onto the Garden floor, draping an exhaustive but
eventually convincing 81-67 victory over the Rockers.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight year, the Liberty captured the Eastern
Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of ourselves because of what we had to go through
with nobody believing in us, and here we are again,'' the team
captain, Teresa Weatherspoon, said. ``We're happy with what we
accomplished, but we haven't accomplished anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in the four-year history of the Women's
National Basketball Association, the Liberty earned a trip to the
finals, to play the league's only champions, the Houston Comets.
</P>
<P>
   The two-of-three-game series opens Thursday night in the Garden,
where the Liberty has won 13 straight games, then shifts to Houston
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it got down to 10 points, I was a little bit nervous,''
said Liberty center Tari Phillips, who scored all 12 of her points
in her team's remarkable 46-point first half. ``But I already said
before the game, that was not our destiny. This is what we fought
for all season long; this is why we had 13 wins against great teams
at home, including Houston. We were going to take this win no
matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the Liberty played like a veteran team, using its
home-court advantage and experience to befuddle the much younger
Cleveland group, which could not overcome the Liberty's merciless
defense. The Rockers rode to the end the 13-point effort of Suzie
McConnell Serio, their 35-year-old veteran point guard, who is now
officially retired.
</P>
<P>
   It was her 3-pointer, her third of the game, that put the
Rockers within 10 points with 2 minutes 45 seconds remaining. ``We
lost our concentration,'' the Liberty's Becky Hammon said. ``We
just had to keep together. We just couldn't play not to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Hammon, the second-year shooting guard, scored 6
straight points three ways _ off foul shots, a 12-foot jumper and a
driving layup. That gave the Liberty a 14-point lead and sealed the
victory before a crowd of 15,173, which included Nets guard Stephon
Marbury, who celebrated with the team on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Tamika Whitmore, also a second-year player for the
Liberty, scored a game-high 19 points. ``Last year I came in and I
didn't know what to expect,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, she was so prepared, she was unable to meditate as
usual, restless for the victory. ``This one feels better,''
Whitmore added about the Eastern Conference title. ``It feels
better because a lot of people doubted us in the beginning, and we
still became champs.''
</P>
<P>
   There was doubt after the Liberty dropped the first game of this
two-of-three series in Cleveland. There was doubt Sunday when the
Liberty allowed the Rockers to creep back into the game. But from
the start of Monday night's game, the Liberty made sure there was
no question who was in control.
</P>
<P>
   Signs in large type displaying confident quotes from the Rockers
hung on top of diagrammed plays in the Liberty locker room before
the game, as much motivation as New York would need.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, New York shot 55.9 percent from the floor,
outrebounded Cleveland, 17-12, and with 8:49 to play in the half,
New York already had a 33-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first half they were very emotional, just like
yesterday,'' said Cleveland's Merlakia Jones. ``We were taking
quick shots and they were taking advantage of it. You're just
trying to find some kind of a way to stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hammon's desperation underhand floater found its way into
the basket at the buzzer to end the half, it was an omen, if not a
precursor to the end. New York led, 46-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have hung our heads, but we didn't,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland first closed the deficit to 13 points in the opening
minutes of the second half, but then the Liberty launched an 8-0
run that seemed to put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Johnson, playing on a right ankle she sprained in Game 2,
scored 14 points, and had 10 assists and six rebounds, an emblem
for a team that would not be denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game, it was probably like 70 percent, but I told
Coach that once I warmed up it will be 110 percent,'' she said.
``It's really sore. I turned it three times, but thought I can't
dwell on that _ I couldn't let my team down.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson scored 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had tremendous passion tonight to win the Eastern
Conference championship,'' coach Richie Adubato said. ``That's why
we focused on such a great start in every phase of the game. We
were everywhere, we got rebounds, pushed the ball and made great
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers, meanwhile, made poor decisions, rushing shots. They
won only four road games this season, their last coming three weeks
ago. While the Liberty has been adequate on the road, 9-9, the team
has been virtually unbeatable in the Garden, with a 15-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty has not lost in the Garden since June 25, including
a 69-64 victory over Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat Houston we have to do everything right,'' Whitmore
said. ``We can't have any slip-ups. When you go into the final we
can't have any mental lapses like we did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Just frantic runs, followed by confetti.

   YUGO-IMMIG (Zagreb, Croatia) _ The chaotic lands of the Balkans
have become the latest gateway to western Europe for tens of
thousands of illegal immigrants from China, South Asia and Mideast
countries like Iran and Iraq, according to Western diplomats, local
officials and the increasing number of refugees who get caught en
route. By Carlotta Gall.

   FIRES-THINNING (Flagstaff, Ariz.) _ The Clinton administration
has been sharply criticized for failing to do some things that
would have made this fire season less devastating. One
controversial measure, known as forest thinning, allows more
logging in places where forests have become too dense. But in many
places around the country, environmentalists have successfully

   YOUTHS-EXECUTE (Undated) _ If the state of Georgia electrocutes
Alexander Williams on Thursday, as planned, five men who committed
murder when they were 17 will have been put to death this year in
the United States. That is more than in any year since 1954, when
six teenagers were executed in Florida and Georgia. While
proponents say such executions are justified, given the
increasingly heinous nature of juvenile crime, opponents call it
unconscionable. Most juvenile offenders on death row are in
Southern states, while most countries in the world prohibit the
practice. A Special Report by Sarah Rimer and Raymond Bonner.

   &UR; NATIONAL _ POLITICS _ (Moved in `p' category.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-WORKING-FAMILIES (Washington) _ Through the four days of
the Democratic National Convention last week it was impossible get
through an hour, much less a day, without hearing the words
``working families.'' Neophyte candidates in obscure congressional
districts talked about them in their brief non-prime-time
appearances; the party's platform championed their needs; and the
presidential nominee himself took up their cause and continued to
pound the theme as his campaign steamed down the Mississippi River.
And it's not a matter of coincidence; the phrase was the result of
weeks of research and focus groups, and the campaign is making sure
that voters remember it. By Katharine Q. Seelye.

   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VERIZON-STRIKE (Undated) _ In the lexicon of the high-technology
companies that are reshaping the economy, terms like stock options,
profit sharing and overtime loom large. So it no small wonder that
the contract agreement reached by Verizon Communications and its
unions, which makes provisions on these issues and many more, has
raised eyebrows. While the direct effect is almost impossible to
gauge, the apparent consensus about the settlement is that the
unions came away as winners and, perhaps, as meaningful
participants in the New Economy that was ready to leave them at its
margins, according to analysts. By Simon Romero.
</P>
<P>
   DEBEERS-STRATEGY (London) _ De Beers has had to confront
accusations that the company has links to traffic in diamonds from
Africa's war zones. But it has also had to face a much bigger
challenge: the belief that its huge stockpile of diamonds, used to
help control the supply and keep world prices high, had become a
costly albatross. Now, De Beers is using the controversy over
so-called blood diamonds to advance a strategic switch to address
its commercial problems. The plan is to turn De Beers from a
stockpile manager into a branded, high-value diamond-trader that
would keep diamonds from war zones out of the luxury market.
Marketing, not monopoly, would make sure the company maintained its
leadership position. By seizing the moral high ground, De Beers has
already shown signs that its business is turning around. By Alan
Cowell.

   LATIN-AMERICA-INTERNET (Undated) _ The Internet revolution has
definitely come to Latin America. But whether the businesses and
jobs spawned by that revolution have helped the region begin to
wean itself from economic dependence on the United States and other
outsiders is considered a matter of debate. Starmedia, one of the
biggest and most successful Internet companies in Latin America,
has branch offices in seven countries and millions of subscribers
throughout the region. But its headquarters are in New York. Its
$450 million in funding came from investors in the United States.
Its stock is listed on the Nasdaq but not on any exchange in Latin
America. By Anthony DePalma.

   INTERNET-NAMES (Undated) _ Because virtually all of the catchy
Web addresses ending in ``.com'' have already been claimed, a
growing number of companies have begun to realize that there is

longer want or need. By Sabra Chartrand.

but no riches _ from his writing, which had until recently brought
him only rejection. As F.X. Toole he writes fiction _ a craft that
he quietly pursued when he wasn't stopping blood coming from
fighters' noses in his work as a cutman. His first book of short

   JONI-MITCHELL-PAINTER (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan) _ From 500

   SCI-BUTTERFLIES-CORN (Undated) _ Ever since last year when
scientists reported that pollen from genetically engineered corn

   SCI-COMPASSION (Undated) _ Compassion has become medically and

medical associations and hospital administrators, it is as though
caregivers and thier chargers have suddenly discovered humility,
mortality and goodness. By John Lagone.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WRITING-PHYSICIANS (Undated) _ Each year it seems that more
and more physicians are putting aside their stethoscopes for word
processors. Indeed, the most casual look at publishers' book lists
or major magazines and newspapers demonstrates that an increasing
cadre of doctors is writing best-selling works of nonfiction,
novels, plays, motion pictures and essays. Even professional

   SCI-PERSONAL-TRAINERS (Undated) _ Although more than 4 million
Americans use personal trainers, there are few standards governing
the more than 66,000 people who make a living buffing biceps and
toning pecs. The term is not legally defined and states do not
require certification, a minimum training or licensing. Anyone who
can hoist a dumbbell and print a business card on a home computer
can call him or herself a personal trainer. By Liz Neporent.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PSYCHE-TRAITS (Undated) _ One of the many odd experiences of
being a psychiatrist is discovering that seemingly benign traits
can have a dark and even pathological side to them. A
characteristic that we would typically dismiss lightly in everyday
life _ a tendency to procrastinate, a hot temper or a
fastidiousness about details _ sends up a red flag for a
psychiatrist. At times what appears to be a minor eccentricity can
afford a glimpse into a large and unsuspected landscape of
symptoms. By Anna Fels, M.D.

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Each
year, several hundred people succumb to anaphylactic attacks, the
American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology says, because
they fail to use epinephrine as a first-aid measure or fail to use
it soon enough. Further deaths result when victims fail to seek
professional medical help after using epinephrine, which suppresses
the attack, for only about 20 minutes. By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Women who have had hysterectomies have a 60 percent greater
risk of being incontinent by the time they are 60, according to a
new report in The Lancet. This means the onset can be well after
the date of surgery, since most women who have hysterectomies do so
in their 40s or 50s. The operation is the second most common major
surgical procedure for women.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study suggests that when it comes to one of the
conditions for which antibiotics are often dispensed _ children's
earaches _ the treatment may be of little value. The study,
sponsored by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality, found that almost two-thirds of children with acute otitis
media, or middle ear infection, recover from pain and fever within
24 hours of diagnosis _ without antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   _ As it stands now, millions of diabetics need to take blood
samples several times a day by piercing their fingers _ a
time-consuming and somewhat painful practice. But a recent study
suggests that things may become easier. Writing in the Diabetes
Technology and Therapeutics, researchers said diabetics may one day
be able to monitor glucose levels by just passing a beam of
infrared light through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cochlear implants have been used for almost a decade to help
thousands of profoundly deaf children, but some two-thirds of
insurance companies are often unwilling to pay, citing a lack of
evidence that the devices are cost-effective. A new study, however,
reports that over the course of a deaf person's life, the implants
can save more than $50,000 in costs associated with the disability.

DODGERS SINKING FAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Contrary to everyone's thoughts, the Los Angeles
Dodgers will be involved in a race as the season winds to a close.
</P>
<P>
   First place? Nah. But last place is attainable.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' lead over last-place San Diego could be something
to watch, especially since the Dodgers entered Monday three games
out of the National League West cellar. They pulled even closer
with a lethargic 4-1 loss to the Montreal Expos at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And what's been a taxing mental season on Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson has also brought its share of physical problems. It was
announced after the game Johnson would be having surgery to repair
a partially torn rotator cuff today at 8 a.m. at Centinela Hospital
Medical Center. The surgery will be performed by team physician Dr.
Frank Jobe.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who injured the shoulder earlier in the season by what
he thought was lifting weights, said he expected to be on the bench
for tonight's game against the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be here,'' Johnson, 57, said. ``It hurts every day
anyway, and it'll be a little more sore (today).''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Johnson was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat.
He went to the hospital July 16 after experiencing dizziness at his
home. He missed four games before returning July 20, with the
directive to lay off caffeine, chewing tobacco and wine. In his
absence, bench coach Jim Tracy managed the club.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers trainer Stan Johnston said the shoulder began bothering
Johnson Aug. 8, and an MRI on Monday showed a partial tear in the
rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started aching pretty bad and I got a couple of
injections,'' Johnson said. ``Might as well do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The shoulder is Johnson's physical pain. The losing is mental.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the Colorado Rockies losing to Atlanta, the Dodgers
would be tied for third rather than leading fourth-place Colorado
by a game. But, hey, with 39 games to play, the Dodgers can catch
the Rockies and Padres.
</P>
<P>
   And with six of the Dodgers' last nine games against the Padres,
maybe there will be some meaningful moments in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly beats charting the Dodgers' drop from
respectability, and the playoff race, in the past two weeks. For
those who are near-sighted, the Dodgers are now a season-high nine
games behind front-running San Francisco, but that's a race not
worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough because we're definitely going through tight times
right now,'' Dodgers center fielder Tom Goodwin said. ``We have to
keep fighting and come out here every day. If it doesn't look like
it's going to happen, you still have to work like it's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With boos greeting every Dodgers mistake and disgust shown from
many in the 32,053 in attendance, the Dodgers again fell to a
sub-.500 team with a payroll that's only a fraction of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie right-hander Matt Herges (8-3) is learning the travails
of being a starter, particularly one in the No. 4 or No. 5 spot in
the Dodgers' rotation. Herges was 8-0 out of the bullpen but has
lost each of his three starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the only positive I've been able to find is maybe I
held runners on,'' said Herges, who saw catcher Todd Hundley throw
out three would-be base stealers. ``Other than that, I didn't hit
my spots, didn't make the big pitches. When your offense is
struggling, you have to put up zeros.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight start, Herges pitched six innings, and he
left with the Dodgers trailing 4-0 and showing absolutely no pulse.
The Dodgers (62-61) are 29-30 at home, and with a loss today could
fall to .500 for the first time since they were 3-3 on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   Expos right-hander Dustin Hermanson dominated the Dodgers, whose
sporadic offense lately has a consistency similar to oatmeal.
Indeed, that's the same Dustin Hermanson who hadn't won since July
20, and who was 0-4 with a 7.67 ERA in his past five
starts.!dlim!!dlim!

IT MIGHT BE BEST THIS SWAP WENT BUST

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Well, if you went to bed believing Christian
Laettner and Chris Dudley were on their way to the Los Angeles
Lakers, we hate to have to report it was only a dream. That
four-team, dozen-player trade fell apart Monday night, making it
the biggest deal in NBA history that never was.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, you're shattered.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, you'll wake up on Dec. 25 to learn that
Christmas has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, you're crushed.
</P>
<P>
   It's too painful to think about how the Lakers will get by
without good old Chris and Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Why, oh why, do they build us up like that, only to let us down?
</P>
<P>
   Listen, apologies for the sarcasm, but something about that
proposed trade had to leave a Lakers fan cold. Maybe it was
Laettner, the veteran underachiever and lightning rod for
controversy. Or Dudley, the one professional basketball player who
could stand to take free-throwing lessons from Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Would those have been improvements over what the Lakers had for
a power forward and a backup center when they were winning the NBA
championship? Was that the best the Lakers could get in exchange
for Glen Rice?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are: yes, and yes.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   If this failed deal accomplished nothing else, it gave us a
glimpse of the kind of trade that is bound to happen between today
and the Lakers' 2000-2001 season opener 10 weeks from now. Not
exactly this trade, involving precisely these players, but
something like it.
</P>
<P>
   Something a little bit positive and a little bit flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Kupchak, the head of the front office in the post-Jerry
West era, faces the following facts.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have to get rid of Rice, whose performance and
attitude weren't worth the millions he could command.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers need a power forward to replace A.C. Green, who was
released almost before the championship parade float stopped
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers need a backup center better than Travis Knight and
John Salley, who did little more than keep Shaq's seat warm on the
bench, and then only if they sat side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak will accomplish all of those things, you can be fairly
sure of that. But when he does, it won't feel like an
accomplishment to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   It will mark the failure of the Glen Rice experience, which
began with the trade that cost the Lakers Eddie Jones and Elden
Campbell to get him, and ended with Rice having his worst NBA
season and the Lakers winning a title anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If you sat down with a blank sheet of paper Monday afternoon,
while the big deal was still ``go,'' and diagramed the Lakers'
major transactions of the past few years, you discovered they'd
essentially traded Jones, Campbell and Nick Van Exel for ...
Laettner and Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, after he led Duke to NCAA championships in
1991 and 1992, Laettner was among the most valuable players in the
sport. He was the No. 3 pick in the draft, behind only O'Neal and
Alonzo Mourning. He had outballoted O'Neal for that spring's Wooden
Award. He had been chosen over O'Neal for the token collegian's
spot on that summer's Olympic roster.
</P>
<P>
   Laettner no longer commands such respect. Yet when the Lakers
went shopping for a swap for Rice, he and Dudley were the best they
could find. At that, it would have taken throw-ins of Tyronn Lue
and John Celistand and complicated four-way negotiations, to get it
done.
</P>
<P>
   If you were expecting a big, splashy deal this summer, something
to get excited about, let this be a lesson. As long as O'Neal, Kobe
Bryant and Phil Jackson are under contract, the Lakers will be in a
perpetual process of tinkering with the rest of the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Wake us when it's over.

ANGELS PROTEST LOSS AT FENWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston Red Sox first baseman Brian Daubach was a hero
twice in Monday night's game against the Anaheim Angels - once with
a two-out, two-run, game-tying homer in the ninth, and then again
with a two-out, two-run single in the 11th to win it 7-6 before
32,795 at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Angels have their way, Daubach's hits will be erased
from the record books as though they never happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels played the game under protest because of a play in
the fourth inning. If the protest is upheld the game will be
replayed from the point of the play in question. The Angels will
officially file the protest today.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had already scored a run in the fourth on Tim
Salmon's RBI single and had the bases loaded with one out and
Bengie Molina batting. Molina hit a pop fly to shallow center field
that fell between center fielder Carl Everett, shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra and second baseman Jose Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn scored from third but Offerman picked up the ball and
threw to third trying to force out Salmon. Third baseman Lou
Merloni fielded the throw without either of his feet on the base.
However, there was no umpire within 80 feet of the base to make a
call.
</P>
<P>
   Third base ump Jerry Meals was standing in shallow left field,
presumably to get a closer look at a potential catch of Molina's
popup. Homeplate ump Alfonso Marquez remained at home. So second
base ump Derryl Cousins made the call - out - eliciting a sprint
from Angels manager Mike Scioscia out of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   After several minutes of discussion, Scioscia informed the
umpires the club was playing the game under protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derryl Cousins was grossly out of position,'' Scioscia said.
``They did not know whose call it was. He did not even look at the
play and when I asked to ask for help he refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the rules, when an umpire is out of position and
didn't see the play, he has to diligently ask for help. He refused
four times to do it. The fact that he didn't ask for help on that
play is a gross injustice to our efforts to win the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the call, the Angels were in good position to win
anyway. Starter Scott Schoeneweis and the Angels took a 5-3 lead
into the bottom of the ninth. Schoeneweis retired the first two
batters of the inning before walking Jason Varitek on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach followed and drilled a pitch into the Angels bullpen in
right field to tie the game at 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even consider it a bad pitch,'' Schoeneweis said. ``He
didn't even come close to putting a good swing on that pitch all
night. I get 4,000 ground balls and give up one fly ball and you're
dead. I don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sick. I feel absolutely sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, though, took a 6-5 lead in the 11th when Troy Glaus
doubled, went to third on a sacrifice bunt by Molina and scored on
a squeeze bunt by Adam Kennedy. It was the fourth RBI of the night
for Kennedy, the former Cal State Northridge star who hit a
three-run homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But in the bottom of the 11th, the Red Sox loaded the bases with
none out. The Angels brought the infield in with Shigetoshi
Hasegawa to pitch to Varitek. The strategy not only worked, but it
nearly resulted in a game-ending triple play.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek hit the ball sharply to second where Kennedy fielded the
ball and threw home for the force. Molina then threw to first for
the second out. Vaughn probably had a play at second because Manny
Alexander hesitated going from first to second. But instead Vaughn
threw to third. The throw was too late to get Troy O'Leary,
bringing up Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   First base was open and Daubach's run was meaningless, but
Scioscia elected to pitch to Daubach, who reached down and poked a
(split-finger fastball) into left field, scoring both baserunners
to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The play in the fourth wasn't the only questionable call that
went against the Angels. In the eighth, the Angels had runners on
second and third with none out when Molina and Salmon were at the
center of controversy again. Molina hit a fly ball to left-center
field. Everett called off left fielder O'Leary, made the catch and
made a strong, one-hop throw home.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek caught the throw and held the ball after a hard slide by
Salmon, and Marquez called Salmon out. However, replays showed
Salmon's foot crossed the plate before the tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they picking on me? Everybody's picking on me,''
Salmon said with a smile. ``That was bizarre.''

CAN DODGERS SIGN DREIFORT, PARK?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers will attempt to sign
right-hander Darren Dreifort to a long-term deal before the
free-agent market opens in November, and they also will try to ink
right-hander Chan Ho Park to a contract extension during the
offseason, baseball officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort is available for free agency after the season, and
given the way he's pitched since the All-Star break, he could be
one of the top pitchers available. Dreifort has gone 6-0 with a
3.09 ERA in seven starts since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Dreifort is in his third season as a starter and
has become more consistent with his delivery. Dreifort, who won a
career-high 13 games last season, is tied with Kevin Brown for
second on the staff in wins this season. He's 10-7 with a 4.51 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Park, 27, is eligible for salary arbitration after the season
and could become a free agent before after the 2001 season. But the
Dodgers don't want Park entering a year in which he's pitching with
the pressure of free agency looming, an official said. Park (12-8)
leads the Dodgers in wins and he has a 3.81 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 1999 season, Park turned down a four-year deal
worth more than $30 million. In the past, Park has stated he wanted
to remain with the Dodgers because of his affinity for the
organization and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Both pitchers are represented by Scott Boras, who also
represents pitcher Kevin Brown, third baseman Adrian Beltre and
promising young right-hander Eric Gagne, who's expected to be back
in the starting rotation next season.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 pick to sign: Power pitcher Ben Diggins, a 21-year-old
right-hander out of the University of Arizona, has agreed to a deal
with the Dodgers that includes a $2.2 million signing bonus,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The sides have agreed on the contract, but Diggins first must
pass a physical, a source added. The deal is expected to be
announced Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Diggins, the Dodgers' top pick (No. 17 overall), went 10-4 with
a 3.83 ERA for Arizona last season. He also hit nine homers and
batted .336 for the Wildcats. Time became an enormous issue because
Arizona started classes Monday, and if Diggins were to attend, the
Dodgers would lose his draft rights.
</P>
<P>
   However, Diggins informed school officials Sunday night that he
and the Dodgers were close to a deal and he would leave the
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, he's has not attended any classes,'' said Jeff
Berry, Diggins' agent. ``I think we've come to a point where we can
agree to a number we all feel good about.''
</P>
<P>
   Add Alou to mix?: With speculation rampant about Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson's future, Montreal manager Felipe Alou, who was
general manager Kevin Malone's first choice to manage the Dodgers
two years ago, knew he was the next target. Alou turned down the
Dodgers in 1998 and signed a lucrative deal to remain with the
Expos, but he's under fire by Montreal's new regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing to do right now is to keep my mouth shut until
I have the opportunity to open it,'' Alou said. ``It has nothing to
do with Kevin Malone or the Expos. It has to do with me, and some
personal things I believe I have to express.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Left fielder Gary Sheffield's hearing for his
appeal of his five-game suspension is officially scheduled for
Monday when the Dodgers are in Milwaukee. ... The Dodgers are
expected to soon announce a deal to play minor-league ball in
Wilmington, Del., of the Single-A South Atlantic League and that
they've renewed their agreement with Vero Beach of the Single-A
Florida State League. They continue to seek a place for the
Triple-A club, which will leave Albuquerque after the season.
Portland, Ore., remains the favorite.

ANOTHER ARM IN THE FOLD FOR TROJANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC received an oral commitment Monday night
from All-American quarterback Matt Leinart of Mater Dei High in
Santa Ana. He selected the Trojans over Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Leinart is considered one of the top quarterbacks in the
country, and passed for more than 2,400 yards last season. His
other top school choices were Georgia Tech, Texas A&AMP;M and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason I wanted to go to USC was because it's close to
home and my family and brother can come to games,'' Leinart said.
``I just felt comfortable with the coaches and the program. They've
got good up-and- coming talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Leinart (6-foot-5, 215 pounds) said last week he would wait
until early September to decide, but changed his mind over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like this was the best time. I was really stressed out,
the last month especially,'' Leinart said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have received five commitments. Besides Leinart, USC
has commitments from tailback David Kirtman of Mercer Island,
Wash., defensive back John Walker of Birmingham High, quarterback
Billy Hart of Mission Viejo and defensive tackle Jason Wardlow of
Upland.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons returns: Cornerback Antuan Simmons, who underwent
surgery to remove a stomach tumor in May, made his first appearance
at UC Irvine on Monday and received an enthusiastic round of
applause from his teammates after practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling good. It's good to be back around the team. I miss
them,'' Simmons said. ``I just told them I was glad to be back and
to see everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, who was a preseason All-American, weighs 167 pounds,
about 18 less than he weighed at the end of last season. He will
redshirt this year and return next season for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   He expects to practice at least some this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to work out, and if I feel healthy enough, I'll
practice with the team,'' Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has only viewed one practice, Simmons already was
critiquing the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the secondary looked young and made a lot of mental
mistakes,'' he said. ``I think I can talk to them about their
mistakes. I can be on the sidelines and lift their heads up.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons will accompany the Trojans to Giants Stadium in New
Jersey for the Penn State game.
</P>
<P>
   His presence affected his teammates, many of whom had not seen
Simmons since his surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Towards the end of the practice, when I was beginning to feel
sorry for myself,'' said cornerback Darrell Rideaux, ``I saw Antuan
out there and it's an extra inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen hit road: USC coach Paul Hackett said he will decide
today which true freshmen will accompany the Trojans to the Kickoff
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Anywhere between six and 10 freshmen will make the trip, Hackett
said. He has already decided strong safety Matt Grootegoed,
quarterback Matt Cassel and offensive tackle Joe McGuire will make
the travel roster. Other sure bets are tight end Alex Holmes, wide
receiver Keary Colbert and defensive tackle Kenechi Udeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that travel are people that have a chance to play,''
Hackett said.

QB SET BUT QUESTIONS REMAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The largest big question facing UCLA during fall
camp - who would start at quarterback? - was answered Monday when
Cory Paus was chosen to lead the Bruins. But as the season opener
against Alabama on Sept.2 draws nearer, a handful of jobs remain
unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Right guard: Oscar Cabrera, who earlier this week was ruled out
three to four weeks with a high ankle sprain, was out of a soft
cast Monday and working in agility drills with a trainer. However,
if the three-year starter isn't ready, redshirt freshman Shane
Lehman has been getting most of the work as his replacement. Two
other potential replacements, senior Micah Webb (shoulder) and
Blake Worley (concussion) have practiced sporadically since last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Third receiver: 6-foot-4 junior Jon Dubrovac has good size,
surprising speed and excellent hands - sound like Danny Farmer? -
but two others are playing their way into the mix: true freshman
Tab Perry and former quarterback Drew Bennett. Perry has tremendous
skills and poses another deep threat, while Bennett, who missed
most of spring practice with a bad back, drew raves from offensive
coordinator Al Borges.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle: In what may be the closest battle on either
side of the ball, redshirt freshman Rodney Leisle or true junior
Anthony Fletcher will start opposite Ken Kocher. Fletcher missed
most of spring practice with a back injury and Leisle took
advantage with an excellent spring.
</P>
<P>
   Zdenek Zman: Defensive coordinator Bob Field said Monday that
Jason Zdenek, a seldom-used, fifth-year senior from Chaminade High
of West Hills, will likely start at free safety against Alabama.
Zdenek, who has one career tackle, had an excellent spring and has
held off a host of challengers
</P>
<P>
   John Hall, Jason Stephens, Audie Attar and Ben Emanuel among
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's decided,'' Field said. ``If something happens
between now and then, fine. But Jason had a good spring and a good
fall camp. I see no reason why he won't start.'
</P>
<P>
   The name game: Ed Stansbury is at fullback this season - his
third position in four years - but it's not the only thing new. He
now goes by Ed Ieremia-Stansbury, taking on his mother's maiden
name to honor the woman who reared him in El Paso, Texas.

PAUS PICKED TO QB BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cory Paus lost the starting quarterback job twice
to injury last season, but he's never lost it on performance.
</P>
<P>
   Paus kept that record intact Monday when UCLA coach Bob Toledo
put an end to the competition for the quarterback job by announcing
that Paus had beaten out fellow redshirt sophomore Ryan McCann and
will start the season opener against No. 3-ranked Alabama on Sept.
2 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   When fall camp opened nine days ago, Toledo said he'd allow
McCann and Paus to compete on even terms - the same amount of reps,
the same amount of work with the first team, etc. - and then make a
decision by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, it became clear early on that Paus was more consistent
and made fewer mistakes. While McCann improved late last week and
both played well during Saturday's scrimmage, it wasn't enough to
sway Toledo and offensive coordinator Al Borges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was all said and done, Cory at this point operates the
offense better and that was the whole key,'' said Toledo, who added
that junior Scott McEwan of Thousand Oaks High will remain the No.3
quarterback. ``Ryan is still learning and he's made great strides
and he's closed the gap a little. He just doesn't have the total
knowledge of the offense like Cory does.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo informed McCann and Paus of his decision Sunday night
after a quarterbacks meeting in Borges' office.
</P>
<P>
   In Paus' mind, the only reason for the competition was the
broken collarbone that ended his season in the 10th game and
off-season shoulder surgery that limited his participation in
spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally excited,'' Paus said. ``In the spring, I felt like
I was getting better, knowing the offense and knowing what was
going on before it was going to happen. From the first day I felt
really good about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the minute he said Wednesday (was the decision day) ...
I thought he'd do it before because I was confident I was showing
that it should be named before then. I'm excited to start the
season as the starting quarterback and get on my curve and get
going so I can be a really great quarterback in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus said he's much more prepared for the job than a year ago,
now that he has seven career starts. The experience is critical in
UCLA's offense, which expects more of the quarterback than
well-thrown passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it entails knowing who to throw to and when to throw
it,'' said Toledo, who added that Paus was ahead of Cade McNown at
this stage of their development because Paus had the benefit of a
redshirt year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big thing is getting us out of bad plays and into good
plays. We have checks at the line of scrimmage and he has to do
that. We give them the opportunity to put us in the right
formation. If you go watch the scrimmage and you see a guy throw
two touchdowns, you think that's all he has to do. It's not. It's a
pro type of offense and it takes some time to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus said he received congratulations from McCann, but
acknowledged that they aren't close. McCann, who practiced Monday
afternoon after missing the morning session with back spasms,
appeared to take the decision in stride and said he is determined
to work harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly disappointed, but the coach has to make a
decision,'' said McCann, the left-hander from Agoura, who began
last season as the No. 4 quarterback before leading the Bruins to
their biggest victory, an overtime win against Washington, and
starting against USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Paus) had a good camp. In the beginning I struggled. I felt
like I did well, but the gap was too big. Now I've got to work hard
to get back to being No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Toledo quickly quashed any ideas of a quarterback
controversy. Last season, he played Drew Bennett and Paus equally
in the first two games and then announced that Paus had won the
job. This year's tryout is over, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reins are now in Paus' hands, meaning he'll take two out of
three snaps in practice and he'll begin to assert the leadership
that the job requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want Cory looking behind his back and I told both of
them that,'' Toledo said. ``Because (the quarterback) throws an
interception or makes a mistake he's not out. I don't believe in
that. But I did tell him he's got to move the team, he's got to
score points and he's got to do a good job. Otherwise, eventually
we've got to make a change.''

VAUGHN'S FENWAY RETURN IS TAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It wasn't quite the same as last year, and that was
just fine with first baseman Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn returned to Fenway Park last season for the first time
since leaving the Boston Red Sox after the 1998 season. But on
Tuesday there wasn't nearly the same hoopla that surrounded his
return last season on May 7, when dozens of reporters swarmed
Vaughn on the field during batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from interviews with some local reporters and a few
catcalls from the fans, it was pretty tame.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Vaughn was hindered by a severely sprained ankle,
and went 3 for 20 with eight strikeouts and only two RBI in five
games at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurt, now I'm healthy,'' Vaughn said. ``I might not get
any hits in the series, but now at least I can walk up to the plate
and feel good in the batter's box.''
</P>
<P>
   In his second at-bat Tuesday, Vaughn hit a liner high off the
green monster in left field for a long single, but said before the
game he didn't plan to alter his approach at the plate to take
advantage of the short porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get a pitch to drive,'' he said. ``I want to
keep this game as simple as possible. It doesn't count for five
home runs if you hit one against this team. I'm not trying to get
back at them. I just want to help my team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn even chatted with a former nemesis of his, Red Sox
general manager Dan Duquette, before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to work hard not to speak to somebody,'' Vaughn
said. ``That's negative energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad wants in: Outfielder Darin Erstad did not play for the
second consecutive game because of tightness in his left ribcage.
His status is still day-to-day, but manager Mike Scioscia said
Erstad probably won't play today either and that the Angels miss
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our lineup he's the most important hitter,'' Scioscia said.
``He sets the table and drives in runs. In my estimation he's done
it better than anybody in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Not playing is driving Erstad crazy, even before games when he
goes through a regimented routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lost,'' Erstad said while sitting on the dugout steps,
watching his teammates take batting practice. ``I don't do this. I
don't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight: The Angels were well-aware that pitcher Kent
Bottenfield threw a five-hit shutout against the St. Louis
Cardinals on Sunday night. Bottenfield, traded to Philadelphia for
outfielder Ron Gant on July 30, is 1-1 with a 2.89 ERA for the
Phillies. Since the trade, the Angels have released Ken Hill and
put Jarrod Washburn and Seth Etherton on the disabled list.

CONGRESS TAKES SMALL STEP TO RESTORE FREEDOM OF WORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His email address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle between Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court continues
_ over the significance of religious liberty and the right to
worship without government intrusion. Congress supports a much
broader interpretation of the constitutional protections afforded
to the freedom to worship than does the court.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's stingy interpretation of the U.S. Constitution
in Employment Division v. Smith (1990) involving the legitimate
religious use of peyote by Oregon members of the Native American
Church severely truncated traditional protections for religious
worship.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon outlawed the use of peyote in all circumstances, despite
the fact that Congress had made it legal for NAC members to use it
in religious worship. In its 6-3 decision, the high court held that
any generally applicable law could burden or even prohibit a
specific mode of religious worship. Oregon's law was a considered a
generally applicable law.
</P>
<P>
   Until that decision, the Free Exercise Clause provided
heightened protection for those involved in legitimate religious
worship or religious ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the 1990 decision, Congress passed the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, only to have it struck down by the
high court in 1997. The court, in its decision, said that Congress
had exceeded it authority.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of July, before Congress took its August recess, both
the Senate and the House quietly passed a new religious liberty
bill _ by unanimous consent. The legislation is narrowly focused to
use the acknowledged power of Congress to regulate under the
Commerce Clause, the Spending Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment.
The bill intends to widen the protections given to religious
worship in areas where Congress has the unquestioned authority to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill didn't receive much attention in the press, it
now awaits President Clinton's signature. Clinton has already
expressed support for the bill, so there is little doubt he will
sign it into law soon.
</P>
<P>
   When Senate Bill 2869 (Religious Land Use and Institutionalized
Persons Act of 2000) becomes law, it will prohibit all levels of
government from implementing land use regulations ``in a manner
that impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a
person, including a religious assembly or institution, unless the
government demonstrates'' that such a burden furthers a compelling
governmental interest and that it is the least restrictive means of
achieving that compelling interest.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for a governmental agency to prove it has a
compelling interest and that the method of regulation used to
further that compelling interest is the least restrictive means of
achieving it. This strict test reinstates the traditional test for
whether a law unconstitutionally burdens religious worship _ the
test that the Supreme Court did away with in the 1990 peyote case.
</P>
<P>
   This law will apply to all programs or activities that receive
federal funds _ regardless of whether the land use regulations are
generally applicable and do not specifically target religious
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The first section of the mini-religious liberty bill is meant to
thwart zoning regulations that often harm churches and interfere
with religious ceremonies. In numbers of cities and towns, city
officials have sought to limit the number of worshippers at
churches and pressured houses of worship to shut down soup
kitchens. This bill would force city officials to have a compelling
reason to inflict a burden on religious worship.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of bipartisanship, Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., issued a joint statement to prove the need
for such a bill: ``Sometimes, zoning board members or neighborhood
residents explicitly offer race or religion as the reason to
exclude a proposed church, especially in cases of black churches
and Jewish shuls and synagogues. More often, discrimination lurks
behind such vague and universally applicable reasons as traffic,
aesthetics, or `not consistent with the city's land use plan.' ...
This discrimination against religious uses is a nationwide
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Understated but as important, the bill also gives some leverage
to American Indians who find their religious worship at sacred
sites restricted or outlawed altogether because of tourism, mining
or road building.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of S. 2869 deals with persons residing in or
confined to government institutions. The bill states: ''No
government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious
exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution ...
unless the government demonstrates the imposition of the burden on
that person is 1) in furtherance of a compelling governmental
interest; and 2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that
compelling governmental interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill will provide protection for the religious beliefs and
worship of all those persons confined in state residential
facilities, homes for the disabled and correctional institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Institutionalized persons are often subject to the authority of
a very few local officials who don't want to go out of their way to
allow them to practice their faith. In a joint statement about this
part of the bill, Hatch and Kennedy pointed out: ``Whether from
indifference, ignorance, bigotry, or lack of resources, some
institutions restrict religious liberty in egregious and
unnecessary ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Committee on the Judiciary even learned of a case in
which prison authorities recorded the sacrament of confession
between a prisoner and the Roman Catholic chaplain. In another
prison, an inmate was allowed to attend Episcopal worship but
forbidden to take communion.
</P>
<P>
   A Wisconsin prison would not allow Christian inmates to wear
even tiny crosses. And, in the West, we are well acquainted with
prison officials who arbitrarily forbid American Indians from using
sweat lodges for their worship _ although there is sufficient room
for them to be built on prison grounds.
</P>
<P>
   As a safeguard, this bill does not amend or repeal the Prison
Litigation Reform Act which protects prisons and prison officials
from frivolous lawsuits filed by prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   A very broad coalition of religious and civil liberties groups
and conservative organizations like the Family Research Council
supported the passage of this bill. Melissa Rogers, general counsel
of the Baptist Joint Committee, successfully led the coalition in
urging for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   Until the U.S. Supreme Court can be convinced to revisit its
decision in Employment Division v. Smith and come around to an
interpretation of the Constitution that is consistent with our
nation's vision of the great significance of religious worship, we
must rely upon Congress to hack away at the court's mingy
understanding of one of America's great freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   This bill is a small step toward restoring the meaning of the
Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, but one which will be
more difficult for the high court to gut.

WASHINGTON IS ABOUT TO GET A LOT LESS FUNNY 

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   I was very impressed, but at the
same time saddened, by President Clinton's speech at the Democratic
National Convention.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until he told me, I didn't realize Clinton was personally
responsible for 22 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 30
years, 8 years without a direct hit from an asteroid and no new
wars with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, I had assumed that Clinton's two terms had
mostly been spent chasing interns around the Oval Office and
renting out the Lincoln bedroom. Who knew he had time for anything
else?
</P>
<P>
   But my pride in President Clinton's accomplishments was tinged
with sadness. Soon, he will be leaving the White House. Where will
he go? What will he do? And most importantly of all, where will
humor columnists and late-night comedians turn for material?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore? Please. Gore's handlers recently torpedoed Rep. Loretta
Sanchez of California's plans to hold a Democratic fund-raiser at
the Playboy Mansion. Imagine how much fun that would have been!
There's Hef, a Benton twin on each arm, defending the right of
every American to buy soft-core porn at the convenience store of
his or her choice. There's the infamous grotto, aswim with former
Playmates, each with something to say on health care reform and the
high cost of boob jobs. And everywhere celebrities, celebrities,
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Clinton would have jumped into an event of this
sort like Billy Carter belly-flopping into a vat of Billy Beer. Al
Gore, however, wants none of it. The only time he would even
mention Playboy would be to say how much he enjoys the articles.
Gore wants to disassociate himself from the excesses of the Clinton
presidency. The image he is trying to cultivate is that of a monk:
austere, abstemious, strictly G-rated. In other words, boring.
</P>
<P>
   George W.? He and Gore seem to be trying to out-sanctimony one
another, the top prize going to the first one to sprout wings and a
halo. George W. has humorous potential in the sense that he mangles
the English language and comes across as sort of _ how can I put
this delicately? _ dumb, but there is little chance that his cadre
of handlers will allow him to be the next Dan Quayle, hard as he
might try.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton says he's really going to miss being president and
it's possible that we're going to miss him, too. But before he
begins work on his memoirs and his library, Clinton needs to take
some time off and relax. Which is why I'm inviting him to spend
some time in my adopted hometown of Bradenton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Bradenton has lots of golf courses, including one built on top
of a landfill. If your round is going badly, Mr. President, you can
always poke around and find a nice used tire or refrigerator part.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the people I play with, bending the rules is not only
tolerated, but encouraged. If you want to kick your ball out from
behind a tree or toss it out of a sand trap, feel free to do so.
Chances are the people you're playing with are cheating worse than
you.
</P>
<P>
   Bradenton also has a topless nightclub that you could
investigate periodically to make sure it is abiding by the new
county law that requires that no more than 20 percent of the breast
and 80 percent of the buttocks are exposed. Or maybe it's 80
percent of the breast and 20 percent of the buttocks. Either way,
being a smart guy, I'm sure you'd be able to grasp the situation,
so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Bradenton is a small town and kind of isolated from the
rest of the world, so if Hillary gets elected to the New York
senate, chances are we won't hear about it here for several months,
if at all.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Mr. President, I think you'd be very comfortable in
Bradenton for a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't stay too long. We've got our reputation to think
about, don't you know.
</P>

   CAN YOU PATENT YOUR BUSINESS MODEL?
</P>
<P>
   PATENT-CONTROVERSY-HARVARD-BUSINESS-REVIEW _ The high-profile
court cases over Amazon's patent on its one-click shopping process
and Priceline's patent on its reverse auctions have propelled the
notion of patenting business methods into the limelight. In the
Information Age, in which entire business models can be embedded in
digital code, attempts to use patents as competitive weapons have
intensified. So have the attendant controversies. To shed light on
this contentious topic, Q. Todd Dickinson, director of the U.S.
Patent and Trademark office, talks about the myths and realities of
business patents. A Q&AMP;A. 800 words. By Andrea Ovans.

<P>
   GLOBAL-WARMING-HARVARD-BUSINESS-REVIEW _ In December 1997,
global warming began to assume a prominent position on business
executives' agendas. That's when representatives of 160 nations,
convened by the United Nations in Kyoto, Japan, adopted a plan that
would limit the amounts of greenhouse gases being released into the
atmosphere. If ratified, the Kyoto Protocol will require industrial
nations to dramatically reduce emissions of those gases by 2012.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The high-profile court cases over Amazon's patent on its
one-click shopping process and Priceline's patent on its reverse
auctions have propelled the notion of patenting business methods
into the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   It's not, however, a new phenomenon. Businesses have always been
free to patent their methods. Companies have, for instance,
patented the way they sell airline tickets and the way they manage
moneymarket accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But in an information economy, in which entire business models
can be embedded in digital code, attempts to use patents as
competitive weapons have intensified. So have the attendant
controversies.
</P>
<P>
   To shed light on this contentious topic, Q. Todd Dickinson,
director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, talks about the
myths and realities of business patents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What constitutes a patentable business model?
</P>
<P>
   A: We distinguish between a business model, which is a general
vision or strategy, and a business method, which is a specific way
of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   In law, there's a four-part test for patentability of a business
method, as there is for any invention. The way of doing business
has to be useful. It has to be new. It can't be so incremental that
it would be obvious to a skilled practitioner. And in the
application process, disclosure of the innovation has to be so
complete that fellow practitioners can understand it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are we seeing a rush to patent business methods now?
</P>
<P>
   A: For a couple of reasons. First is the court opinion on State
Street Bank vs. Signature Financial that was handed down about two
years ago, which definitively stated that software that governs
business methods can be patented as long as it produces some
concrete, useful and tangible result. That ruling made companies
much more aware that they could patent software- based business
methods.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there's been a general rise in software
patents of all types, fueled in part by the burst of innovation
generated by the Internet. That being said, though, let me put it
in context. We issued about 161,000 patents last year. Some 600
were software-related business methods. I expect we'll issue
another 1,000 such patents this year. That's a fairly modest amount
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you concerned that patenting business methods will
ultimately dampen innovation?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is not the first time that argument has been raised. It
was raised over telephony. It was raised in the chemical industry
when companies applied for patents on various monomers and
copolymers. And it was argued originally in relation to patenting
any kind of software at all. But in all those cases, innovation in
the general industry actually increased.
</P>
<P>
   Patents give their owners rights to their innovations _ for 20
years from the date they file the application, currently. But then
patent owners must make their innovations public, which lets other
people build on them.
</P>
<P>
   Historically _ and I would argue it's no different now _ that
can give small companies and entrepreneurs some parity with large,
powerful business concerns, rather than the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But what about complaints in some quarters that companies are
getting patents for business methods that aren't really new?
</P>
<P>
   A: The patent office does not issue patents for old business
methods simply made electronic. it is partly our responsibility to
find evidence of existing methods _ what the patent office calls
prior art _ to make sure that doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   We have a very good collection of software prior art in a range
of disciplines, including business, and we continue to expand that
collection. We held hearings last year to make sure we were getting
access to prior art that exists outside of the patent process,
particularly as it relates to software.
</P>
<P>
   But people have pointed out that, in the past, when a lot of the
software was released, prior art was not available. And even now,
we don't have a consolidated, comprehensive database _ a one-stop
shop _ of prior art for software that embodies business methods, as
we do in other fields.
</P>
<P>
   In chemistry, for example, there's the Chem Abstracts, and in
medical technology there's Medline. If some party would develop
that, it would be a great help.
</P>
<P>
   But remember, too, that applicants must understand that they are
legally required to disclose all relevant prior art themselves. if
they do not, they risk invalidating their patent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The possibility that the Earth's surface temperature is rising
caught the public's attention during the brutal summer of 1988. But
it wasn't until December 1997 that global warming began to assume a
prominent position on business executives' agendas. That's when
representatives of 160 nations, convened by the United Nations in
Kyoto, Japan, adopted a plan that would limit the amounts of carbon
dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases being released into
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto Protocol was accepted by representatives of the
industrial nations, but in most cases the full legislative bodies
each have to ratify the protocol. If ratified, the Kyoto Protocol
will require industrial nations to dramatically reduce emissions of
those gases by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts believe that human activity is contributing to an
increase in the Earth's average surface temperature. Scientists
also agree that an increase of as little as 2 degrees Fahrenheit is
likely to cause more severe storms, floods and droughts and to
accelerate the spread of disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto Protocol also sounded a warning to business leaders.
If large-scale reductions of emissions are mandated by law, many
manufacturers will have to dramatically change the way they
operate. They will also have to contend with shifts in demand, as
energy-efficient products overtake those that have long been
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Where to begin? A good place to start is to look closely at the
risks _ and the opportunities _ associated with shifts in the
weather, potential regulatory changes and the battle over public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   BAD WEATHER AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Most of the extreme effects associated with climate change have
yet to emerge. Nevertheless, companies whose assets are directly
affected by the weather must start planning now.
</P>
<P>
   For example, insurance companies should adapt their predictive
models to ensure that their prices are accurate and to prevent
large financial losses because of payouts after unexpectedly severe
storms.
</P>
<P>
   To value waterfront properties correctly, real estate companies
will have to keep up with the latest thinking on changes in flood
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   For companies that sell seeds, risk management may mean
developing crops that can deliver higher yields in drier
conditions. For timber operations, it may mean spending more on
fire and pest management: Drier conditions increase the risk of
fire and make young trees weaker and more vulnerable to insect
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, companies in a variety of industries may
experience shifting demand for their products as climate change
affects more people. For example, if tropical diseases migrate into
more industrialized nations, which is likely as temperatures rise,
pharmaceutical companies may see their markets expand.
</P>
<P>
   ANTICIPATING REGULATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Although it may be decades before people in Munich or
Minneapolis have to worry about tropical diseases, regulations
designed to curb climate change are already being proposed.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, government likely will impose additional taxes on
fossil-fuel consumption and require that cars and appliances use
less energy.
</P>
<P>
   Such regulatory programs will change asset values. Fleets of
trucks that get particularly low gas mileage will suffer. The
programs will also increase the value of goods and services such as
renewable-energy technology, process-control equipment and
telecommunications services _ for example, teleconferences that
substitute for transportation.
</P>
<P>
   As government regulatory schemes take shape, companies should
speak up and support programs that give them flexibility in
deciding how to reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
   A command-and-control approach _ in which all sources would be
required to make proportional reductions in carbon-dioxide
emissions, regardless of the cost or difficulty _ could cost six
times as much as market-based solutions, according to the White
House Council of Economic Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, most businesses have not actively promoted market
approaches as an alternative to command and control.
</P>
<P>
   One market approach is to tax emissions of greenhouse gases.
Companies could then decide if it's more efficient to pay the tax
or invest in reducing emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution would be to set up a system of tradable
permits. Under such a system, the government allocates emissions
permits that companies can then buy and sell. Businesses that would
have to pay huge sums to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases
could instead buy permits from companies that are able to make the
required operating changes more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever regulatory systems emerge, some companies stand to make
money from the changes. Makers of industrial process controls, such
as Honeywell and ABB, may be among the big winners. They are
already investing in sophisticated thermostats, equipment that
generates electricity more efficiently and other products and
services whose value will increase in a world of higher-cost
energy.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why companies that make energy-efficient
products may support new regulations. But it's less clear why a
company such as General Motors has advocated government policies
that may make driving more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   GM and other large automakers such as Ford see climate change as
an opportunity to gain advantages over their less technologically
sophisticated rivals. That's why they are investing in cars that
run on a combination of gasoline and battery power and in fuel
cells. As the cost of driving conventional automobiles rises, Ford
and GM will dominate a new market and freeze out smaller
competitors for whom the required investments will be too great.
</P>
<P>
   Like automakers, energy companies stand to be hit hard by any
new policies that arise from the anticipation of global climate
change.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco has been a leader in supporting international efforts
to slow climate change. It has even announced voluntary cutbacks of
its own carbon dioxide output _ cutbacks similar to those required
under the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, BP Amoco believes that taking a leadership
position gives it a distinctive identity in the eyes of government
officials, scientists and environmental groups. That may mean
better access to government-controlled oil deposits and more
operating flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the company's experiments with emissions trading
are likely to give it clout at the negotiating table when
international regulatory frameworks are being devised. It will also
stimulate the company's employees to think more imaginatively _
and, in turn, feel valued.
</P>
<P>
   THE CLIMATE OF PUBLIC OPINION
</P>
<P>
   Probably the only thing more unpredictable than the weather is
public opinion. But good publicity can pay big dividends: As the
intensity and level of public interest increase, companies known to
have made early efforts to tackle climate change will have seats at
the negotiating table when regulations are being debated.
</P>
<P>
   For strategic reasons, some companies have chosen to be quiet
about their efforts. Honeywell and ABB would gain advantages from
more stringent emissions regulations, but they've had to be
cautious in their public statements on global warming. Some of
their biggest customers are fossil fuel and electricity companies.
</P>
<P>
   While good PR buzz on preventing or preparing for climate change
has its appeal, smart companies know it's simply bad business
practice to make investments, relocate resources or change
strategies solely for the sake of appearance. That's why David
Allen, who oversees BP Amoco's solar energy investments, is careful
to emphasize that the company's foray into solar ``is not just a
public relations sop. We would not do that. If you just paint
something, then people will in due course see it as paint.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to think steadily and consistently about a topic as
complicated as climate change is a tough test of management acumen.
Some executives are meeting it head-on. Those who are not should
wonder why they aren't _ and so should their shareholders.

   PELEE ISLAND, Ont. - It's Canada's southern-most island in Lake
Erie - it measures 9 miles, north to south, and somewhere between 3
and 4, east to west.Year-round residents number 200 hearty souls.
</P>
<P>
   With summer's end, the pace here slackens as ferries from the
Canadian and U.S. mainlands cut back their shuttles to a sparse
winter schedule that lasts until the lake freezes over. Life on the
island slows to a pleasant walk. I know because I've been reading
all about it in some back issues of the local newspaper - The
Grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   The big news in November, 1992, was that two hunters had
accidentally cut loose on one another with bird shot.
</P>
<P>
   In December there was a ``euchre shootout'' beginning at 8:30 in
the hotel,andthe LCBO (Liquor Control Board of Ontario) gave notice
that empties would be accepted during the winter months until they
ran out of room. A bingo fund-raiser sponsored by the Pelee Island
public school students raised $98,and anyone interested in a puzzle
exchange was advised to ``contact Pat at the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer, however, has always been a different story. The
following is anupdate on the latest breaking hard news as reported
in the ``Blotter''section ofThe Grapevine:
</P>
<P>
   ``July 7, 2000. R.S.C. Trenton contacted O.P.P. (Ontario
Provincial Police) Pelee Island for missing overdue boater reported
missing by concerned spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Boater (husband) located at a party in Sandusky, Ohio. Spouse
advised of findings and was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``July 8. Center Dyke Road. One male intoxicated on bicycle
while riding to residence at 03:00 fell on face and required
medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``July 8. West Shore Road. One male and one female under the
influence of alcoholic beverages passed out in front lobby of
O.P.P. station. Offered free room and board with a Provincial
certificate for public intoxication. Declined. Requested an
established B&AMP;B.
</P>
<P>
   ``July 22. East West Road. A party of four visiting from
Michigan, inquired what O.R.R. stands for. Advised it's O.P.P. This
party thought Canada was policed only by the Mounties and was
surprised to see a police cruiser insteadof a horse (see TV show
North of 60). Visitors thought it 'cute' that officers in Ontario
are armed.
</P>
<P>
   ``July 22. At the corner of East West Road and West Shore Road.
Police officers while on duty in a fully marked police cruiser came
upon a male who was standing next to a seated female at a picnic
table engaged in an (in)appropriate behavior. This male looked over
at the police and appeared to have a 'deer caught in the light'
look on his face and continued with his activity. Officers
activated high intensity spotlight but this party continued and
only stopped when one officer yelled, 'Ahem! This is the police!'
Both parties apologized for their behavior and stated, 'This is our
first time on Pelee Island,' as if that were to make a difference.
Officers explained that this was a family island and such
activities should be limited to private quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``July 22. Two boxes of filet mignon and a case of beer reported
stolen from the hotel, and five folks from Ohio crashed into the
rocks on West Shore Road. Alcohol and poor vision were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``August 5. East Shore Road. Suspicious vehicle reported by
cottager. Police located two young males who were canvassing public
beach area for new female friends. Advised to go home and have a
cold shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``August 13. West Shore Road. Mischief complaint. Two turtle
signs found hanging from trees and appeared to be hung in effigy by
their necks.
</P>
<P>
   ``August 13. East Shore Road Lizard Point. Six people in a
26-foot boat ran aground at Lizard Point. Extensive damage to
propeller. Vessel towed without incident. Charges to follow.
Special thanks to Dave Hodare, the Rodigers, and Matt Abbey with
his boat, The Minnow. Also an anonymous male swam out twice to
rescue and assist boaters only to find out these individuals were
weak swimmers stranded in seven feet of water. Novice boaters will
make short of this new hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it folks, crime on an island.
</P>
<P>
   And a reminder: ``Steingart Septic Service is No. 1 in the No. 2
business.''

 &HT;    Stroll down memory's hall is cavalcade of confiscations
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas - Ah, the newborn days of another school year.
Welcome back, child. Now, turn right around and march that tongue
stud of yours back home.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of our town is a young lady in Lorena whose offense
isn't a body ornament but hair that is too short, or too alert. The
principal said her spiked 'do won't do. Fascinating, the age-old
process.
</P>
<P>
   And hair-styles aren't the half of it. I was reminded of this
recently by a scent in, of all places, the boys' room. Actually, it
was in the men's room.
</P>
<P>
   A cinnamon-scented air freshener had transported me back 30-plus
years _ to a time of innocence and ruby-cheeked stealth, to the
quest to smuggle something into school, flaunt it and not catch
hell.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about cigarettes, booze or guns. I'm talking
about cinnamon toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   I never smuggled them. I didn't have the guts. Only the boldest
seventh-graders smuggled cinnamon toothpicks. Guarded like stolen
plutonium rods, the toothpicks were dipped in cinnamon oil to bathe
a tongue in eye-watering fire.
</P>
<P>
   It was guaranteed status to trot out 10 or 12 toothpicks in wax
paper. Even more impressive was he who possessed an amber vial of
oil. Its scent could sit you down.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon toothpicks were sort of a nether-vice: not food, not
gum, not drink and _ oh, no _ not drugs. They were just
delightfully mysterious, easily concealed, and of course forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   A modern-day variant among grade-schoolers is a salty substance
in a small shaker, a Mexican candy called Lucas, commonly licked
off a palm. Mmmm. Hey, kids. How 'bout a show of hands?
</P>
<P>
   Thus two examples that conjure and color an eternal intrigue: to
test in relative innocence the limits of ``off-limits.''
</P>
<P>
   These days such testing runs up against the principal's ban on
Pokemon cards or yo-yos. Laser pointers, hand-held games and pagers
are more recent nuisances.
</P>
<P>
   I asked around for adult recollections of school contraband _
odd and puny stuff that became big by being forbidden. Go ahead, I
said. Show me what was in your pockets.
</P>
<P>
   One remembered when her school banned paper clips, or at least a
certain contrivance thereof. Students who somehow felt envious of
others with orthodontal mouths fashioned paper-clip chains they
stretched over their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   One person recalled a ban on clackers, noisy tethered plastic
balls. Several remembered the confiscation of so-called paper
footballs, little triangular constructs of notebook paper made for
field-goal flicking.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a retired educator about such vices and they will come
pouring forth from her mind's confiscation closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nail polish was the worst thing girls could bring,'' said one.
The vapors from the polish would disrupt class, and their hues
could end up everywhere _ on desks, on walls, on schoolboys' noses.
Perfume was similarly disruptive, she said, with the potential of
toxic spills.
</P>
<P>
   At one school, little-girl glitter, for sparkling up eye brows
or highlighting one's locks, became a forbidden because it ended up
everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the no-no that spans the ages is food in class,
always disruptive. Always gooey.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the scene of Waco grade-schoolers who had just been on a
bakery field trip, each receiving a wrapped Twinkle or Ding-Dong or
somesuch, and the smiling principal greeting the grade schoolers at
the bottom step of the bus, holding a grocery sack into which each
cream-filled treat vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Today some grown-up is lamenting the Ding-Dong that got away.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ If Bill Clinton is indicted and faces potential
prison time after he leaves the presidency for lying under oath
about going too far with Monica Lewinsky, so be it. After all, the
president got himself into this fix and there is no reason why an
ex-president should be cut any legal slack the rest of us wouldn't
get. And that is precisely why Clinton shouldn't be charged. Almost
no one else would be in the same circumstances.(Teepen, Cox News
Service.) MOVED.

<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Howard Kleinberg's column is not available
today. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service.)
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ With summer's end, the pace in Pelee Island,
Ontario slackens as ferries from the Canadian and U.S. mainlands
cut back their shuttles to a sparse winter schedule that lasts
until the lake freezes over. Life on the island slows to a pleasant
walk. I know because I've been reading all about it in some back
issues of the local newspaper - The Grapevine. (Schuett, Cox News
Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BOOKMAN-COLUMN _ While the GOP may officially oppose what it
calls ``quotas,'' there's no question that party leaders wanted a
certain number of minority faces broadcast on the nation's TV
screens from the convention in Philadelphia, and that those faces
were far out of proportion to their actual number and influence in
the party. Rather than an expression of hypocrisy, however, perhaps
it's best to look at that radiant picture of diversity from
Philadelphia as the stating of a goal. (Bookman, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

contraband. Not drugs, but the more benign goods of another time.

 &HT;    Freshmen testing independence need to be taught the dangers of
credit
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Santanya Cofield graduated from college three years ago with
$10,000 in credit card debt, a camcorder and only the haziest idea
where the rest of the money went.
</P>
<P>
   Even with her diploma, the 26-year-old Atlanta native felt she
had failed. ``I was very depressed,'' she recalled. ``And I had a
lot of anxiety from those bill collectors calling me all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her story is a common one, and it will start afresh for
thousands of young people just now stepping into the freedom of
their college years.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and retailersirst card for 15 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Parents don't necessarily have much to say about it. ``Most
college freshmen have just turned 18, which means they are eligible
to sign a contract,'' pointed out Suzanne Boas, president of the
Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The offers certainly can look attractive. There are cash
rebates, discounted airline tickets, free long-distance phone calls
and introductory interest rates as low as 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On many campuses, recruiters offer T-shirts, coffee mugs and the
like to students who fill out an application on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   But many young people _ some of them imitating their parents _
haven't achieved an adult relationship with easy credit. College
students owe $1,843 on their credit cards, on average. Three out of
four use their cards for routine spending _ things like food,
clothes, toiletries and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Two of every five let the debts ride from one month to the next,
and as a result many will graduate with consumer debt piled on top
of their student loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A credit card is just a tool,'' said Charles Frazier, a
certified financial planner, ``but it can lead to a false sense of
security, at least until the bills arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some families have worked for years to instill financial
discipline in their offspring. Others have left it to the last
minute, or to fate.
</P>
<P>
   For worried families, here are some timely ways to corral the
credit monster.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Educate your freshman. Too many young people do not understand
the broad concepts, such as budgeting and compound interest. Even
more know nothing about details like grace periods, late payments
and finance charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most effective way is for parents to show a young adult
what a credit card statement looks like,'' said Steve Rhode,
founder and president of myvesta.org, a nonprofit organization
formerly known as Debt Counselors of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can show what it means. You can go over your bills with
them, so they can see how those casual purchases add up and how
interest does too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lilli Friedland, a family counselor, suggests bringing in
outside experts, many of whom can be found on the Internet.
``Because finances are such a delicate issue, it's really important
to show it in black and white as well as to teach it,'' she said.
``When you get it from a variety of experts, it supports what
parents are saying.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Explain the consequences of credit abuse. ``I realized I had
to work to support my credit cards,'' said Cofield, an Atlantan who
was raised in the city's Adamsville neighborhood and now works in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse after she graduated. Her bad credit record showed
up with prospective employers, and landlords checked her out. ``I
had to explain it,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It helped when she pointed out that she enrolled in a repayment
program with Boas' CCCS.
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback: Her current lifestyle is diminished by the
$275 a month she allots to paying off the debts of long ago. She
still owes $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spell out who is responsible for debts. Frazier and others
believe parents should not make a practice of bailing out their
near-adult children. ``You have to make them responsible,'' he
said. ``If the kid knows he doesn't have to pay the bill, there are
no limits.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't co-sign for a credit card. ``You're the one with better
credit, and if there is a problem, they're going to come after
you,'' said Rhode.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Treat your student as an adult. ``You have to walk a fine line
between giving advice they need and allowing them make their own
decisions and their own mistakes,'' Boas observed. ``Like
everything else in life, they will live up to our expectations of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Set a good example. If you can, show that you follow a budget
and pay your bills on time. If you can't, point out the problems
you've brought on yourself. Even a bad example can be a teaching
tool.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stay in touch. Mistakes are part of the learning process.
Parents can be part of that process, but only if they're willing to
be helpers, rather than hanging judges.

four use their cards for routine spending _ things like food,
clothes, toiletries and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Two of every five let the debts ride from one month to the next,
and as a result many will graduate with consumer debt piled on top
of their student loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A credit card is just a tool,'' said Charles Frazier, a
certified financial planner, ``but it can lead to a false sense of
security, at least until the bills arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some families have worked for years to instill financial
discipline in their offspring. Others have left it to the last
minute, or to fate.
</P>
<P>
   For worried families, here are some timely ways to corral the
credit monster.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Educate your freshman. Too many young people do not understand
the broad concepts, such as budgeting and compound interest. Even
more know nothing about details like grace periods, late payments
and finance charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most effective way is for parents to show a young adult
what a credit card statement looks like,'' said Steve Rhode,
founder and president of myvesta.org, a nonprofit organization
formerly known as Debt Counselors of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can show what it means. You can go over your bills with
them, so they can see how those casual purchases add up and how
interest does too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lilli Friedland, a family counselor, suggests bringing in
outside experts, many of whom can be found on the Internet.
``Because finances are such a delicate issue, it's really important
to show it in black and white as well as to teach it,'' she said.
``When you get it from a variety of experts, it supports what
parents are saying.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Explain the consequences of credit abuse. ``I realized I had
to work to support my credit cards,'' said Cofield, an Atlantan who
was raised in the city's Adamsville neighborhood and now works in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse after she graduated. Her bad credit record showed
up with prospective employers, and landlords checked her out. ``I
had to explain it,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It helped when she pointed out that she enrolled in a repayment
program with Boas' CCCS.
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback: Her current lifestyle is diminished by the
$275 a month she allots to paying off the debts of long ago. She
still owes $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spell out who is responsible for debts. Frazier and others
believe parents should not make a practice of bailing out their
near-adult children. ``You have to make them responsible,'' he
said. ``If the kid knows he doesn't have to pay the bill, there are
no limits.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't co-sign for a credit card. ``You're the one with better
credit, and if there is a problem, they're going to come after
you,'' said Rhode.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Treat your student as an adult. ``You have to walk a fine line
between giving advice they need and allowing them make their own
decisions and their own mistakes,'' Boas observed. ``Like
everything else in life, they will live up to our expectations of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Set a good example. If you can, show that you follow a budget
and pay your bills on time. If you can't, point out the problems
you've brought on yourself. Even a bad example can be a teaching
tool.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stay in touch. Mistakes are part of the learning process.
Parents can be part of that process, but only if they're willing to
be helpers, rather than hanging judges.

 BOSTON: ... are heard.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all her connections to the wired sector, Plotkin's
credentials are solidly old economy. The skills she uses at work
``are people skills, not technical skills,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in Wheeling, W.Va., where her mother taught in
public schools and her father worked in advertising. After studying
radio and television at Ohio University, she moved to Boston in
1970, following a friend from high school who had a teaching job in
Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Soon she was working as an aide to John Larkin Thompson, then
president of Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the big health insurer,
and a member of the Vault, a group of top executives from companies
such as Bank of Boston and Boston Edison, which was the dominant
business lobby of its day.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson sent Plotkin to monitor debate on Beacon Hill on a bill
that set safety standards for ambulances. From that job, ``I
learned it was all about relationship building,'' Plotkin said.
``You don't usually win on your first try, but you have to build
bridges . . . and make sure you touch base with the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Plotkin marketed executive programs for Harvard's School
of Public Health and ran a membership program for another
association, the New England Council, made up of businesses,
colleges, and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, at a political fund-raiser, she met Eric Vogt, founding
president of what was then the Massachusetts Computer Software
Council, who soon offered her the job she has held ever since.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the council included executives from just 13
companies, among them Saddlebrook Corp. and MicroMentor Inc., who
were chiefly interested in trading tips on running their businesses
and didn't care much for public debate.
</P>
<P>
   Vogt said those early members ``didn't give two hoots about
politics and basically saw it as a waste of time and resources.''
But he said he hired Plotkin partly for ``her insistence that we
listen and pay attention and consider the impact of public
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of her advice became clear in 1990, when the council
helped convince the Dukakis administration to table a
loosely-written computer crime bill that would have outlawed the
teaching of computer-security courses.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Plotkin was working out of a new office in Copley Square,
arranging meetings at which executives could compare notes on new
inventions, such as spreadsheet programs and something called the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   She also invited politicians to receptions at the Newton
Marriott and other Route 128 hotels and brought in guests such as
Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Clinton administration technology
adviser Ira Magaziner.
</P>
<P>
   A poised public speaker herself, Plotkin rarely takes the podium
at such events and can usually be found making introductions in the
back of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thinks her job is to make other people look good, not
herself,'' said Dan Bricklin, chief technology officer of Trellix
Corp. in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   Since many software executives aren't known for their smooth
social skills, Plotkin also makes sure speakers are ready for the
stage. ``She gives you all the material you would want if you need
to fall back on something,'' Bricklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin was married in 1977 to a computer programmer. Their son
Arlen was born in 1986, the same year she started her current job
at the council. Four years later, she was divorced and began
raising Arlen as a single parent, taking him everywhere from
council strategy meetings to trade missions to Israel and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have found a babysitter, but she wanted to take
advantage of the opportunity to introduce him to new things,'' said
David Blohm, who is chief executive of SmarterKids.com in Needham
and the council's past chairman.
</P>
<P>
   She also didn't want to miss out on Arlen's upbringing. Once she
spent a Saturday morning watching him play soccer, then raced off
for lunch with the president of China.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, Plotkin married again, this time to a Sudbury
psychiatrist, in a low-key ceremony attended by just 21 people.
They live in Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin won't discuss her salary, but she says she has turned
down ``friend-of-the-company'' shares as gifts from about four
companies who are council members.
</P>
<P>
   Such gifts are a common practice among technology companies, but
Plotkin says that accepting them would create conflicts of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job has to be representing all of the software companies in
the state equally,'' she said. If she were to accept shares, she
said, ``there would be an issue whenever somebody asked me to
recommend a company.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing up the payoffs is worth it to keep a job she enjoys,
Plotkin said, one that is ``all about networking.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate, Plotkin mentions a meeting several years when
John Hamill, then president of Fleet Bank, agreed to lend $1
million to a state program to finance technology companies. Plotkin
followed up with a question on a more personal note: Maybe Hamill
could help her Chestnut Hill hairdresser get a loan? Hamill called
him the next day and eventually Fleet financed a renovation for the
shop, Changes Salon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I try to do,'' Plotkin said, ``is to remember people
and to connect people in ways that they may not have thought to
connect themselves.''

 &HT;    Teacher stress can lead to job burnout
 &HT;    By Hap Lecrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the beginning of the school year, I would like to encourage
you to think about a topic that is often neglected but extremely
important. The topic that I am referring to is teacher stress and
burnout.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, in our society, is expected to produce positive
results, often without the tools that are essential for success.
Since free public school is one of the cornerstones of our society,
the successful education of our children is often taken for
granted. Many parents simply enroll a child in school at the
appropriate age and sit back and wait for expected results.
Parents, and society in general, are often oblivious to the
stresses felt by educators:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Work overload _ many teachers feel compelled to take work home
in the evenings and on weekends in order to meet the
responsibilities expected of them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lack of appropriate reward and recognition for their work _
teachers' salaries remain very low in comparison to other
professionals in our society.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Unrealistic and/or idealistic expectations from those they
serve or those they work with _ teachers are often seen as
surrogate parents, counselors, character-builders, caretakers,
disciplinarians (often without any authority), etc.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pervasive feelings of lack of control in their profession _
positive results are expected without the tools needed to
accomplish these results.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lack of positive feedback from students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Working environments that are overcrowded, outdated or in
high-crime areas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Multiple pressures from those they serve _ parents, students,
governmental agencies, administrations and the media.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Personal pressures _ produced by the need to take care of
their own families, health, living environments, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Often we expect teachers to have no personal problems, no
worries or concerns outside of their teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The end result can be that we want results but we don't want to
do what is really necessary to help. The problem can go even
further when parents actually retard the learning process in their
children by promoting counter-productive alternatives at home such
as too much television; letting their children stay up too late,
causing the children to suffer from fatigue the next day; lack of
support from parents regarding school regulations; and lack of
assistance with homework assignments.
</P>
<P>
   All of this puts teachers in a very stressful position and may
lead to teacher burnout, physical ailments, depression and a desire
to leave the teaching profession.
</P>
<P>
   Next week I will discuss ways that we can all assist teachers in
their extremely important wo

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ If Bill Clinton is indicted and faces potential
prison time after he leaves the presidency for lying under oath
about going too far with Monica Lewinsky, so be it. After all, the
president got himself into this fix and there is no reason why an
ex-president should be cut any legal slack the rest of us wouldn't
get. And that is precisely why Clinton shouldn't be charged. Almost
no one else would be in the same circumstances.(Teepen, Cox News

</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ With summer's end, the pace in Pelee Island,
Ontario slackens as ferries from the Canadian and U.S. mainlands
cut back their shuttles to a sparse winter schedule that lasts
until the lake freezes over. Life on the island slows to a pleasant
walk. I know because I've been reading all about it in some back
issues of the local newspaper - The Grapevine. (Schuett, Cox News
Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BOOKMAN-COLUMN _ While the GOP may officially oppose what it
calls ``quotas,'' there's no question that party leaders wanted a
certain number of minority faces broadcast on the nation's TV
screens from the convention in Philadelphia, and that those faces
were far out of proportion to their actual number and influence in
the party. Rather than an expression of hypocrisy, however, perhaps
it's best to look at that radiant picture of diversity from
Philadelphia as the stating of a goal. (Bookman, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

the red lipstick and fishnet stockings come out,'' innkeeper Donna
Sparks clarified. ``This town can be charming, beautiful and

   GETAWAY-SAVANNAH _ The only Savannah night life I'd heard of was

``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.'' ``By day, Savannah
puts on her makeup and wants to be a Southern lady, but at night
the red lipstick and fishnet stockings come out,'' innkeeper Donna
Sparks clarified. ``This town can be charming, beautiful and
sedate, but also as much fun as you want.'' Then she mapped out a
grand sortie for a group of us on a route that would wind through
the dark to end at dawn on the beach at Tybee Island. Off we
went... (Byrd, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40. WITH PHOTOS.

Cut into it. And it is tasteless. In August, the odds switch to our
favor. That's when farmers bring America's favorite melon to

 &HT;    Teacher stress can lead to job burnout
 &HT;    By Hap Lecrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the beginning of the school year, I would like to encourage
you to think about a topic that is often neglected but extremely
important. The topic that I am referring to is teacher stress and
burnout.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, in our society, is expected to produce positive
results, often without the tools that are essential for success.
Since free public school is one of the cornerstones of our society,
the successful education of our children is often taken for
granted. Many parents simply enroll a child in school at the
appropriate age and sit back and wait for expected results.
Parents, and society in general, are often oblivious to the
stresses felt by educators:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Work overload _ many teachers feel compelled to take work home
in the evenings and on weekends in order to meet the
responsibilities expected of them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lack of appropriate reward and recognition for their work _
teachers' salaries remain very low in comparison to other
professionals in our society.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Unrealistic and/or idealistic expectations from those they
serve or those they work with _ teachers are often seen as
surrogate parents, counselors, character-builders, caretakers,
disciplinarians (often without any authority), etc.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pervasive feelings of lack of control in their profession _
positive results are expected without the tools needed to
accomplish these results.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lack of positive feedback from students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Working environments that are overcrowded, outdated or in
high-crime areas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Multiple pressures from those they serve _ parents, students,
governmental agencies, administrations and the media.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Personal pressures _ produced by the need to take care of
their own families, health, living environments, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Often we expect teachers to have no personal problems, no
worries or concerns outside of their teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The end result can be that we want results but we don't want to
do what is really necessary to help. The problem can go even
further when parents actually retard the learning process in their
children by promoting counter-productive alternatives at home such
as too much television; letting their children stay up too late,
causing the children to suffer from fatigue the next day; lack of
support from parents regarding school regulations; and lack of
assistance with homework assignments.
</P>
<P>
   All of this puts teachers in a very stressful position and may
lead to teacher burnout, physical ailments, depression and a desire
to leave the teaching profession.
</P>
<P>
   Next week I will discuss ways that we can all assist teachers in
their extremely important work.

SOFTWARE: MICROSOFT DENIES LINUX REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft? Writing software for Linux? No.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. officials last week were quick to deny a rumor
that the company had begun working on porting its popular
office-software suite to the Linux operating system. Rumors to the
contrary had enlivened the LinuxWorld trade show in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the spur of competition is making Microsoft a bit less
insular than it used to be. The company is eager to challenge
RealNetworks Inc. for dominance of the Internet multimedia
business. That's why Microsoft has ported its Windows Media Player
to Solaris, a popular version of the Unix operating system produced
by a bitter rival, Sun Microsystems Inc. There's also a version
that's compatible with HP-UX, Hewlett-Packard Co.'s version of
Unix. And Microsoft has created Solaris and HP-UX versions of its
Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not unimaginable that Microsoft might someday try to
plant the flag in Linux country. Just not this week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Linux-land, VA Linux Systems Inc. has been
rearranging the furniture. And companies like IBM, Sun, Compaq,
EMC, Hewlett-Packard, and Intel are doing much of the heavy
lifting.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux is consolidating several of the Andover.net sites into
the Open Source Development Network, a service designed to
encourage and support software developers working on Linux and
other open-source software projects. The site will provide
centralized access to lots of old Andover.net services, such as
Freshmeat, a repository of interesting new open-source programs,
and Question Exchange, where visitors can get answers to complex
programming questions.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux is also beefing up the SourceForge Web site, where
programmers publish their ongoing work on open-source projects. The
site will offer the ability to compile and run newly written code
over the Internet on a variety of different computers provided by
IBM, Sun, Compaq, Intel, and Hewlett-Packard, with EMC providing
advanced data-storage equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, even amateur programmers will be able to test-drive
their code on some of the hottest machines around. VA Linux is
betting that will lead to more good open-source code and more
demand for the company's Linux computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux isn't alone in its quest to find bright new software
talent. Tucows Inc. came to Harvard Square last week from the wilds
of Flint, Mich., hoping to milk a few good programs from the code
warriors of Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Tucows (www.tucows.com) is one of the Internet's biggest
distributors of shareware, programs that can be downloaded for a
tryout before purchase. The advertiser-supported service features
an index of 40,000 shareware programs, as well as product reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Scott Swiderski says Tucows is always grazing for new
products from up-and-coming programmers, and lots of interesting
stuff comes in over the transom. ``We deal with thousands of people
every month,'' said Swiderski, but most of those contacts happen
over the Internet. He wanted a chance for direct contact with
programmers. And where better to look than the land of Harvard and
MIT?
</P>
<P>
   And so Tucows set up what Swiderski called its ``casting
cowch,'' a sofa coated in Holstein-spotted leather, and a heap of
bovine squeeze toys, on the second floor of the Harvard Coop on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A number of local programmers showed up, including Sharon
Housley of Hanover's NotePage Inc., who already sells her software
through Tucows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity to speak face to face with the
reviewers,'' said Housley. Her company's WebGate e-mail paging
software has a four-cow rating; perhaps a few pointers from the
critics can show Housley how to earn that fifth cow and make her
product an udder success.

ONE-WAY CALLING GETS A BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This may sound like the beginning of a mean-spirited insurance
salesman or former lover joke but . . . did you ever wish you could
have a phone call with someone without their knowing your phone
number?
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea behind the latest example in a flood of
specialized Internet-based communication services. A Boston company
called Acallto.com is ramping up its service with new features this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to use the Internet as your secretary to get someone
on the phone. You send addressees an e-mail or a Web page address
asking them to call.
</P>
<P>
   They click on the message or a link on the Web page and enter
their phone number. Within a few seconds, their phone rings and,
when they answer, a call is completed to your phone number, using
voice-over-Internet-protocol connections.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Internet fuels an ever-greater number of
contacts among strangers, from people doing deals through an
auction site to lonely hearts cruising in a chat room.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine a growing number of situations where we
might like to talk on the phone with someone once or twice but not
give them our phone number. (Government officials and business
executives who have been kind enough to share a home phone number
with a reporter covering a story can relate to this.)
</P>
<P>
   From the recipient's perspective, it can often be nicer to get
an e-mail proposing a conversation than to pick up your phone and
have some stranger babble at you out of the blue.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers pay $6 a month, plus 19 cents a minute, for calls
anywhere in the world (the first 15 minutes are free). Besides the
privacy issue, Acallto allows subscribers to exert considerable
control over how and when they are reached.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you could send someone an open-ended invitation to
call you that would be routed to your work number during work hours
and to your home or wireless phone at other times, reducing the
chances the person you want to speak with has to play voice-mail
tag to catch up with you.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can send someone ``an Acallto,'' as the company dubs it,
that only works during a two-hour window on Thursday morning when
you feel like answering the phone, or you can shut down an Acallto
link you opened for someone you quickly realized you never want to
have to talk to again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a little mind-bending is that we are turning the phone
call around,'' said Acallto chairman and chief technical officer
Allen Razdow. Razdow is a former top executive with MathSoft Inc.
of Cambridge, a software company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as one of those old-fashioned situations where you
pick up the phone and hear a secretary say, `Please hold for Mr.
Smith,' '' Razdow said.
</P>
<P>
   One feature allows senders to check a little pop-up screen on
their computer desktops that indicates whether a recipient of an
Acallto request has received it, so they can anticipate whether a
call might be coming soon. The company is also looking into
adapting the service for sale to auction sites and chat rooms to
offer their visitors a controlled, more anonymous way of talking.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that perhaps only the marketplace can resolve is
whether some recipients might react negatively to getting an e-mail
that could be interpreted as saying: Her Royal Highness may or may
not wish to speak to you between 9 and noon tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone who might be rubbed the wrong way, there could be
more people who are glad to have the chance to make a call more at
their convenience than someone else's and with the Acallto
subscriber who initiated the call paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Gardner, research director for messaging and directory
services for consultants Aberdeen Group in Boston, said he could
see the service becoming a popular marketing tool. ``It's much more
of an opt-in, less annoying version of communication,'' Gardner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main value to me seems to be to initiate phone calls
through e-mail,'' Gardner said. ``Making yourself private is kind
of an ancillary benefit.''

FOR ETOYS, IT'S TIME `TO EXECUTE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a year ago, most investors cheerfully applauded Edward
``Toby'' Lenk, chief executive of eToys Inc. and the undisputed toy
baron of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But running an Internet retail business in today's dot-com
environment is no fun and games. The 38-year-old Lenk, a graduate
of Harvard Business School, has watched his company's stock price
spiral downward from a high of $86 in October to $4.0625 last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lenk managed to raise $100 million by selling
convertible preferred stock to private investors, he accepted less
favorable terms than in previous rounds of funding.
</P>
<P>
   But he was unshaken by the recent announcement that online giant
Amazon.com Inc. and bricks-and-mortar retailer Toys R Us Inc. have
forged an alliance to create what they hope will be the Internet's
biggest toy business.
</P>
<P>
   Lenk said the two rivals joined forces because they ``made the
decision that they can't compete with us alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other dot-com executives, Lenk has discovered that the bar
is much higher this holiday selling season for eToys, which is
based in Santa Monica, Calif. And like Jeff Bezos, founcer of
Amazon.com, Lenk must prove that he can continue to expand sales
rapidly while keeping a lid on expenses, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lenk talked about his competitors, his
investors, and his strategy to keep eToys in the number-one
Internet toy position.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does the new relationship between Amazon.com and Toys R
Us impact your company?
</P>
<P>
   A. Toys R Us made the decision that they can't compete with us
alone. And Amazon made the same decision.
</P>
<P>
   Last holiday season, we had about 10 competitors, who spent $200
million in advertising and promotions to compete with us. We spent
$26 million in our core television campaign last year. We were
massively outgunned in this space. Despite that, we were three
times the size of the number-two player.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you set a date when eToys will become profitable?
</P>
<P>
   A. Our target is to come close to breaking even next holiday and
then to break even in 2002. So two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How have the shakeout and the unfriendly reception on Wall
Street toward Internet retailers impacted your company?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a very interesting question, because the corollary
questions I get are: How is employee morale? How is employee
retention? The reality is that there was clearly a speculative
bubble over the last two years. Because of this crazy bubble, you
had a situation last holiday season where we had 10 competitors
spending $200 million. But here's the thing: What goes up hard and
fast crashes even harder and faster. I've been stunned by the pace
of the shakeout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You used Fingerhut last year to help fill your orders. What
happened to Fingerhut?
</P>
<P>
   A. We fired them. Third-party relations like the one our friends
just embarked upon are very challenging.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How would you rate eToys' performance in filling orders last
holiday selling season?
</P>
<P>
   A. The piece of the business that went to Fingerhut we were not
happy with. So we weren't perfect. But we were really, really good.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How is your merchandising different than a bricks-and-mortar
store?
</P>
<P>
   A. Toys R Us carries about one-tenth the selection we have. In
fact, their Web site has never gotten up to their physical store
selection. So we probably have 20 times the items they have on
their Web site. These aren't all toys. The other thing people don't
understand is we're a children's company. We have every single
children's book in print at eToys. These are the kind of things you
can do on the Web that you can't do (in off-line stores).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What will the Internet landscape look like after the holiday
season this year?
</P>
<P>
   A. Cynically, if you're Toys R Us, with this deal, you've just
taken Amazon out of the (toy) market. And they could just hope we
go away. You're darn right they hope we go away.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you gotten your message out to analysts?
</P>
<P>
   A. In this climate, analysts are followers. We have to execute.
Last year, they were valuing every Internet company assuming they
were going to be successful. This year, they're valuing every
Internet company as if they're all going away. So it's a show-me
climate.

DOWNLOAD WAR, THE SEQUEL: FILM TRADING STIRS NEW FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the underground world of computer hackers, he goes by the
name Dvdboy and is renowned for his skill at converting DVDs into a
format that allows movies to be shared easily _ and illegally _
over the Internet. A self-described movie buff who owns more than
300 DVDs, the 27-year-old network engineer takes great pride in his
work. ``For me, the motivation is being considered the best,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Dvdboy, who lives in the United Kingdom and requested that his
real name not be used, thinks of himself as an artist. Executives
in the film industry use another word: pirate.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the latest battleground in the download war that
began with free music and Napster, a conflict that is pitting
hackers and activists against entertainment industry executives.
While digital piracy is not as rampant with movies as it is with
music, an estimated 250,000 to 350,000 movies are traded every day
on the Internet, from summer releases like ``Me, Myself, and
Irene'' to cult favorites like ``Star Wars'' and ``The Matrix.''
And the movie industry isn't sitting back quietly. The Motion
Picture Association of America won round one on Thursday when a
federal judge ruled that it is illegal to publish DeCSS, a computer
program used to crack antipiracy features on DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be mistaken: The war has only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they win, they lose,'' says Bruce Forest, director of
media and entertainment for Viant, a New York consulting company.
``The war is still raging, and the technology cannot be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the underground trading of movies is growing rapidly,
thanks to new technology. First, programmers use DeCSS to decode
the encryption used to protect DVDs from piracy. Then, they use a
compression program named DivX (which is not related to the defunct
alternative to DVDs that used the same name). Developed earlier
this year by a Jerome Rota, a French videographer, the technology
enables programmers like Dvdboy to compress huge DVDs into files
that are small enough to store on a CD or on a hard drive. With a
high-speed connection, it is now possible to download a full-length
movie in one or two hours, a process that would have taken days
without DivX. And the quality is near picture-perfect.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say it's easy. Movie trading today is where music
trading was a year or so ago: It's a byzantine process that is
still largely underground. Most of the action takes place on
Internet Relay Chat, the system of underground chat channels
dominated by hacker cliques. Films are also traded on Usenet
bulletin boards, although they are often divided into many small
files that must be retrieved separately. They are also distributed
on private sites that are restricted to insiders, and some movies
are traded on networks like Gnutella and Scour Exchange. The
process is hardly as easy as point and click.
</P>
<P>
   But a little more than a year ago, the only people who regularly
traded music online were the true tech heads and code freaks, and
now, more than 24 million people are sharing music files on
Napster, which simplifies the download process. Industry experts
expect that movie sharing will become as simple in a matter of
months, cautioning that the movie industry has a very short window
before a movie version of Napster becomes a new household word.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the movie industry has taken its case directly to the
courts, going after individuals and suing such companies as Scour,
a strategy derided by techies. ``In the worst case, you take all of
the users who were above ground and you drive them underground,''
says Gene Kan, one of the developers of Gnutella, a decentralized
file-sharing system developed after Napster was sued. ``They do
exactly what they were doing before, only now they are forced to
realize that there are more deceptive ways of doing what they
wanted to do anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders counter that they will use technology to defeat
technology. ``We are determined to put our movies online, but we
won't do so until we can dispatch them to homes in a safe and
secure environment,'' says Jack Valenti, president of the Motion
Picture Association.
</P>
<P>
   The movie industry is attempting to learn from the music
industry's less-than-successful attempts to sell digital music
online; so far, three of the four major record companies have
launched pilot programs, but they are extremely difficult to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to downloading music, it's easier to be
dishonest than to be honest,'' says Richard Wolpert, a former
Disney executive and the head of Chance Investments, a venture
capital firm that funds digital entertainment ventures, including
Scour. ``People won't put up with it. The entertainment companies
have to come up with a system that is as easy to use as Napster.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of folks vying to do just that. Rota, 27, has
teamed with several Internet entrepreneurs to found a company
called ProjectMayo.com; the firm aims to release a simplified
version of DivX that can be used for legal purposes such as sharing
home videos. The firm is also developing a database that can be
used for a digital video-on-demand system; it has yet to ink any
deals with the studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have about 9 to 12 months to lead the charge,'' says
Jordan Greenhaul, ProjectMayo's CEO. ``After that the
infrastructure will change, and it will become a slugfest between
the motion picture industry and the underground Internet world.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies are becoming more popular on the Internet every day. A
20-year-old Virginia Tech college student who runs
www.divxnews.com, a site that distributes news about DivX movies,
says that his site receives 40,000 hits a day _ and that number is
rising.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhaul goes so far as to say that a little piracy is a good
thing. Pirates, he says, are ``scum-of-the-earth types (who)
accelerate the opening up of markets that wouldn't open up without
them. Piracy may be a viable force in our social dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   Few other entrepreneurs hoping to capitalize on the
digital-movie market would go so far as to argue the social value
of piracy. But some say that piracy will not be such a big issue if
the movie industry can get its act together soon. ``There will
always be some minimal form of piracy,'' says Howard Weizman, CEO
of Massive Media Group, a digital rights management company. ``But
most consumers aren't comfortable stealing. Once they have a legal
option for digital entertainment content at a reasonable price,
piracy will be miniscule.''
</P>
<P>
   As the clock ticks, the definition of copyright is evolving and
mores are changing as consumers become accustomed to downloading
music _ and eventually movies _ for free. ``The proliferation of
information increases its value,'' says John Perry Barlow, a
founder of the Electronic Freedom Foundation. ``Information isn't
an industrial product. You can't think of movies as though they
were toasters.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the movie industry's definition of copyright has
prevailed in the courts, and some say they will win the battle for
control over content. The movie industry will eventually figure out
how to turn digital movies into a new revenue stream, the way it
did with videocassettes and DVDs. Even Dvdboy, the European
programmer, contends that DivX movies serve as samples that
increase the sales of DVDs. ``DivX is not a replacement for the DVD
itself, as the quality of the video cannot compare to that of my
home theater,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of Harvard's Berkman
Center for the Internet and Society, predicts that a new generation
of Internet appliances will be developed, specifically for the
distribution of legal entertainment content. ``The arms race is in
earnest,'' he says, ``but it is too early to count the giants of
the movie industry down and out. You wouldn't like them when they
are angry, and they are definitely angry at this point.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Everyone makes time for Joyce Plotkin. Even as a
strike loomed at Verizon Communications earlier this month, company
public-affairs director Joe Zukowski cleared his schedule to see
the president of the Massachusetts Software and Internet Council.
</P>
<P>
   The post makes Plotkin, a 51-year-old self-described soccer mom,
the official envoy of the new economy. Each month, she visits
dozens of executives and public officials eager to do business with
the 775 booming technology companies she represents.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin was seeking funds from Verizon to pay for an advertising
campaign to draw more skilled workers and investment to the state.
Verizon sells millions of dollars of services to the software
sector, and Zukowski was ready to tell her what she wanted to hear,
even if his company isn't a member of Plotkin's group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to participate at the $25,000 level,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes!'' exclaimed Plotkin, who has a made a career of her
ability to make connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give that man a T-shirt!'' she told an aide. The slogan
emblazoned on the white garment read, ``Massachusetts. The State of
Things to Come. www.dotcommonwealth.com,'' a reference to the Web
site that is just one of 20-odd projects Plotkin has helped to
dream up or operate for the Software and Internet Council.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin's organization is a lobbying and fund-raising group and
more. With a budget of more than $1 million annually, her council
hosts more than 50 meetings a year for executives and programmers
to mingle with each other and venture capitalists,
intellectual-property lawyers, and other specialists whose
deal-making keeps the software industry humming.
</P>
<P>
   Though she is the hostess for all this hobnobbing, Plotkin shuns
the spotlight. But after 14 years in the job, she has built a
network that has become an economic force in itself, encouraging
contacts that lead to new products and sales for the mostly young
companies she represents. (The council's membership roster runs,
alphabetically, from Akamai Technologies to Zoesis Inc.)
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin networks constantly, referring companies, public
officials, and investors to each other. In 1998, she helped involve
labor unions in a project to wire Boston schools for Internet
access; the relationship paid off recently when the AFL-CIO
supported a proposal by Senator Edward M. Kennedy to increase the
number of visas issued to skilled computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Her matchmaking doesn't always involve policy. A few years ago,
she made introductions that led to the Look and Feel Band, a
rhythm-and-blues outfit of software executives, and arranged for
their first gig aboard a cruise boat in Boston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Joyce as someone who knows everybody,'' said the band's
bass player, Drew Hannah, chief executive of Fishman Transducers
Inc. of Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Church Lewis, president of the Boston investment advisory firm
Beeson Gregory International, says he has met three clients so far
at council meetings and comes back to troll for more. ``The more
people you meet, the more business you're going to do,'' Lewis
said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question the sector is doing more business than ever.
According to the thick guidebook the council publishes each fall,
the number of software and Internet companies in the state has
grown from 800 firms employing 46,000 people in 1989 to 3,000 firms
employing 138,000 people last year.
</P>
<P>
   The combined revenue of these businesses more than tripled, from
$3 billion to $10.7 billion over the same period. By comparison,
computer and communications-hardware makers employed 77,591 people
in the state last year, according to the Massachusetts Technology
Collaborative, a state-funded trade group, down from more than
100,000 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the increase are myriad, but Tom Hubbard, vice
president of the Technology Collaborative, says the role of Plotkin
and her council shouldn't be minimized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any growth industry creates a trade association sooner or
later, but I think what Joyce has done is to improve the climate,''
Hubbard said. ``She's really made it easier for people to
interact.''
</P>
<P>
   And Plotkin says she doesn't foresee any slowdown soon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One spur for Plotkin is competition, both from Silicon Valley
and from a rival trade group in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   She's still vexed by a 1994 book by a California academic,
AnnaLee Saxenian, who argued that Massachusetts fell behind Silicon
Valley because local companies were too rigid and hierarchical to
keep up with new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin says the author ignored the local software sector, an
industry that was already practicing many of the prescriptions for
success _ flexibility, collaboration, and decentralization _ that
Saxenian outlined in the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already had over a thousand companies at that point who
were working with a lot of energy that didn't seem to make it into
the book,'' Plotkin said. ``They already knew they had to learn new
ways of doing business, and you can see today how it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the software industry in and around Boston signals a
shift away from hardware makers such as Digital Equipment Corp. and
Data General, among the state's largest employers a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   A priority for those companies was cutting taxes. They supported
blunt representatives such as Howard Foley of the Massachusetts
High Technology Council, who once said of an opposing interest
group, ``We'll bury them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Software and Internet Council's members include many
smaller companies that worry more about finding the financing,
office space, and skilled workers needed to keep expanding. ``The
agenda is not, `Give us tax cuts,' because that's not what I'm
concerned about right now,'' said Mike Attili, president of Amaxo
Inc. in Newburyport, which sells software services for online
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Plotkin's top lobbyist _ Bruce Holbein, a one-time
Digital employee _ concentrates on federal issues, such as rules
related to visas and accounting guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin's group and Foley's High Technology Council agree on
some matters. Both advocate normalized trade relations with China,
for example. Some big companies, such as EMC Corp. and IBM, are
members of both organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups seldom cooperate, however. Chris Anderson, vice
president for public policy at the High Technology Council, said he
has asked Plotkin for help in lobbying state lawmakers on issues
such as a plan to reduce the cost of unemployment insurance, but to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Software Council has taken a nonactivist role,'' which is
why it generates little criticism, said Anderson, who is slated to
become the High Technology Council's president next January, when
Foley retires. ``When you make decisions and draw lines in the
sand, people are going to be upset with you, and when you don't,
nobody does.''
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin says she has declined to help on Beacon Hill because
most of the concerns of her members relate to matters in
Washington. ``We just have different agendas,'' she said. ``They
have an economic agenda, and we have a technology-policy agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Plotkin has struck an alliance with TechNet, a
technology trade group based in Palo Alto, Calif., with similar
priorities in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal is to broaden the local technology industry's influence
on congressmen outside the Massachusetts delegation. Unlike the
Software and Internet Council, TechNet makes contributions to
political candidates from both parties, and its fund-raising
organization will channel funds from local contributors, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is ``the next evolution of political involvement
for us, for the Massachusetts technology community,'' Plotkin said.
``Money doesn't buy influence, but it helps to ensure that your
positions are heard.''

EVERYONE'S TRYING TO RIDE THE PENGUIN'S COATTAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN JOSE, CALIF. _ At LinuxWorld, everyone wanted to dance
with the penguin.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations such as Dell Computer Corp, IBM Corp., Sun
Microsystems Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., and Compaq Computer Corp.
lined up to profess allegiance to the Linux computer operating
system, whose mascot is a penguin.
</P>
<P>
   But riding on the penguin's coattails is a tricky thing.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Corel Corp. Last year, Corel placed a large bet by
selling Linux versions of its software, including its marquee
WordPerfect Office programs.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't paid off, at least not yet. The Ottowa software
company's finances are dismal. Sales of Linux-based software make
up an anemic 5 percent of Corel's overall revenues. And the
company's founder, CEO and chief Linux champion Michael Cowpland,
abruptly resigned last week.
</P>
<P>
   Corel's experience suggests the limitations of a grass-roots
software movement, i.e., Linux, in a pure corporate world where the
primary objective is not to make cool software but to make a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Corel's problems predate its Linux conversion. The
company's sales have languished for years after it lost its battle
with Microsoft Corp. in the mid-1990s for the word-processing and
spreadsheet markets.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Corel's victories have been sporadic and symbolic.
The US Department of Justice, which is suing Microsoft for
antitrust infringement, recently chose WordPerfect as its official
word-processing program. But Corel's word-processing and
spreadsheet software market shares remained less than 5 percent in
1999, according to IDC in Framingham. Microsoft claimed over 94
percent of both markets.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Linux. Cowpland, who founded Corel in 1985, saw Linux as a
potential key to his company's rebirth. Corel committed to making
Linux versions of its key software, including CorelDraw, just
released at LinuxWorld in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Corel also invested in a project called WINE, which is
researching ways to let Linux users run programs made for Microsoft
Windows. The company also distributes its own version of the Linux
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves gave Corel's stock a boost, at least temporarily.
Its shares hit a high of $44.50 on the Nasdaq last Dec. 9, weeks
after it started shipping its Linux products. On Friday, Corel's
shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $3.40625.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the temporary stock surge, Corel's bottom line hasn't
benefited much from its Linux efforts. In June, the company posted
losses of $23.6 million on revenue of $36.6 million in its second
quarter ended May 31. For the same period in 1999, the company
earned $9.2 million on revenue of $70.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   So why hasn't Corel been able to capitalize on Linux mania?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is that Linux, while growing rapidly, is
still a tiny portion _ just 4 percent _ of the market for computer
desktop operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's making money from Linux,'' said Jean W. Orr,
technology analyst with BlueStone Capital Partners in New York.
``Ninety-eight percent of Corel's revenues still come from selling
applications on Windows and Macintosh. It simply can't be assumed
that Linux is somehow going to turn the company around. Corel has
to focus on making its core business profitable before it invests
in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   A second obstacle is price. While WordPerfect Office for Linux
sells for $139, Sun Microsystems is distributing a competing
product, StarOffice, for free. ``Even though Corel's product is
very inexpensive, it still costs more than StarOffice,'' said Dan
Kusnetzky, vice president of system software research at IDC.
</P>
<P>
   This is the crux of Corel's dilemma. At the heart of the Linux
ethos is the concept of ``free software.'' Though it doesn't
necessarily mean software should be given away for free, it does
mean companies openly share the source code, or recipe, for its
products.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most Linux companies don't make money selling
software. Instead, they rely on selling technical services to go
along with the software, services such as consulting, installing,
or maintaining the programs. It's a business model that can take
years to mature because it requires a large base of computer users
to switch to Linux from other operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Corel's problems, however, are immediate. Derek J. Burney,
Corel's interim CEO, knows this. So while Corel will continue its
Linux efforts, Burney made it clear that the company ``definitely
needs to roll up our sleeves on the Windows and Macintosh
applications.''

A COMPANY TEN YEARS IN THE MAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Scott Killoh received his first angel money in a duffel bag.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1990. The old Shawmut Bank, swimming in bad loans, had
just canceled the business loan Killoh had been promised. He needed
money fast to handle a $50,000 order from his first big client. He
was setting up networks of clone computers at the time and needed
to buy parts for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Just when he was starting to sweat, a friend from his class at
UMass's Isenberg School of Management came to his rescue. Killoh
says the woman convinced her father, who was living at a YMCA in
Connecticut after a messy divorce, to lend him $35,000 in cash he
had literally tucked under the mattress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of crazy, looking back,'' Killoh says. But the
money was repaid within a couple of weeks, with interest.
</P>
<P>
   Most angels don't get their money back nearly so fast _ and they
expect far bigger returns. But the cash helped Killoh get his
networking and consulting business off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   He developed a niche with universities and publishers and began
building database products for news companies. That ultimately led
to the current Web strategy of his Openpages Inc., a Westford,
Mass. content management player with a large office in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I joined them, they had a profitable business,'' says
Warren Huff, a lawyer Killoh asked to become Openpages' chief
executive in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself is unusual. Then, even after repositioning the
company to take advantage of the Internet, ``we operated the
company cash-flow positive in 1998 and 1999,'' Huff says. Revenues
this year should exceed $13 million, triple what they were a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists love that kind of story. In December,
Openpages raised $14 million from Boston's Matrix Partners and
Sigma Partners' Boston office. And today, the company plans to
announce a $30 million round _ $20 million from Matrix and Sigma,
plus $10 million from Wall Street's Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   What others might call a second round, Openpages is dubbing
mezzanine money. That means the company and its backers are looking
to go public in the very near future.
</P>
<P>
   Little surprise. The IPO market has come back strongly from its
spring plunge. And one of Openpages' backers, Sigma, was the first
investor in Vignette Corp., the Austin, Texas, content-management
company that many believe has seized the lead in the field.
Vignette went public in February 1999 and soared. Shares are up 284
percent over the past 12 months, despite slumping 28 percent so far
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sigma says this is not a me-too play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole space is very complicated because no one does
exactly the same thing,'' says John Mandile, managing director at
Sigma. Other competitors include Broadvision, Art Technology Group,
and Interwoven.
</P>
<P>
   Mandile describes the company as ``compatible with Vignette''
but handling a specific need: managing content on one system so it
can be distributed in a number of ways, whether printed in a
newspaper, blasted to a Web site, or broadcast over television.
</P>
<P>
   Openpages provides services to many news clients, such as
Fidelity Investments' Community Newspaper Co., which is using the
service for its townonline.com Web portal; the Miami Herald; and
Knight Ridder's RealCities.com. But the company says it can service
business-to-business and e-commerce sites, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the Web era, Killoh, 34, says, ``Everyone is really a
publisher. Even if they're selling sweaters.''
</P>
<P>
   He's spending about half his time in the company's growing
Moscow office these days. That's where Killoh's early collaborator,
Yuri Kirkel, oversees 80 of Openpages' 215 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Killoh hired Kirkel in 1994, when the Russian PhD was delivering
pizzas in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really couldn't understand English,'' Killoh says. ``But he
was a great programmer.'' And when he wanted to move home, Killoh
let him set up the office in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Now the office is considered a competitive advantage, Killoh
says, because Russia doesn't face Boston's hiring crunch. The
company has tapped dozens of skilled engineers from Moscow State
University, Russia's MIT, and plans to hire many more this year.
</P>
<P>
   If he has any regrets, Killoh jokes, it's that he wishes he'd
started his business later. It's funny to have been toiling away
for a decade, he says, while more recent grads launch companies and
go public within a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he says: ``I personally prefer to actually
build value.'' He adds: ``My goal has been to build a product that
people can install. That's what I enjoy doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Looks like the investors like it, too.

   INCOME-CALIF (San Francisco) _ The economic picture for
Californians is not as rosy as it is perceived, despite the state's
newly minted dot-com millionaires, movie moguls and real estate
barons, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve Bank
of San Francisco. Income for California families is declining
against average family incomes for the nation, the study says. By

   LIVING-WAGE (San Francisco) _ After two years of hardcore
lobbying and delicate negotiating, the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors approves a broad living-wage law. The action is an

for more than 21,500 workers in line for bigger pay checks, paid
days off and, eventually, health benefits. By ILENE LELCHUK.

   RAPID-RAIL (San Antonio) _ The Texas portion of a rail route
that carries more than 35,000 people to and from San Antonio each
year could become one of 11 high-speed rail corridors nationwide.
It might not revive talk of a bullet train whizzing across Texas at
200 mph., but it could help Amtrak's Texas Eagle, which already is
leading the national rail company out of financial troubles. By

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hearts with angel wings and a riverside oasis
with golden monkeys. A desert goddess with beatific smile and a
tusked elephant resplendent in princely robe.
</P>
<P>
   The creations of clay and on canvas are idyllic. But this art
does not imitate life.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Community Art Studio in San Francisco's gritty
Tenderloin district, the landscape features decrepit buildings and
scarred lives.
</P>
<P>
   But those who enter the studio are not just homeless or junkies
or drunks or ex-cons or any of the other labels that society brands
on them. They are artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was always `Who am I?''' said David Seiler, 47, a
Vietnam veteran beset by drug and drinking problems who has been
homeless for about 15 years. ``Here's an answer. Whoever I am out
there, I'm not that here. I walk in that door, I'm an artist. At
the very least, I'm an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this place because of the spirit of community,'' said
J.B. Saunders, 47, a former crack addict who has been homeless for
most of the past 10 years. ``You see all ages and all races.
Everybody is given their space to create what they want and be who
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Run by the Central City Hospitality House, the center that
provides counseling, job training and shelter for the homeless and
indigent, the Community Art Studio began in 1969 as a place for
hippies left over from the Summer of Love to hang out and do their
macrame, said Samantha Giles, 30, the studio director.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, however, the storefront art studio and gallery
started targeting homeless and low-income people. About three dozen
show up during the studio's hours _ noon to 5 p.m. on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   Space and art supplies and camaraderie are free to whoever walks
in the door, no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love is that people don't have to give their Social
Security number or income level or who they are in the system,''
said Giles, a former social worker who joined the studio last year.
``They can just walk in and be an artist and this is who they are
for five hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Donations provide about half of the studio's $109,000 budget for
salaries and art supplies. But the artists pitch in, too, donating
their art for the annual silent auction, the studio's biggest
fund-raiser. The last one, in June, netted about $55,000, Giles
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 12, the artists hope to raise money for themselves. An
exhibit, the People's Art Show, will showcase their sculptures,
paintings, sketches, tile mosaics, and pottery. All the proceeds
will go to the artists.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the artists could certainly use the money and ego boost
from making a sale, but that is not why they create art. Even if
they had no previous formal art training, many say they now see
their art as their salvation and the studio as their sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The karma is good. It's like a sanctuary atmosphere,'' said
Roya Bozman, 49, a drug addict and former homeless musician who has
been coming to the studio about a dozen years. ``It takes me away
from it all when I'm in here. It keeps me away from the
environment. It keeps me motivated instead of out there where I'm
just drifting around. It's like a vacation for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gem in a mudslide,'' said Dale Fiegl, 47, a former
homeless artist living in a hostel, who views the Tenderloin and
its morass of poverty and drugs as the mudslide. ``This brings an
oasis to people who have no oasis.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio looks not unlike any other, with walls filled with
watercolors and drawings, shelves filled with canvases and
paintbrushes, and bins filled with clay.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the room, where the clay artists congregate,
William Bacon, 37, an accomplished sculptor, holds court as he
creates Ganesh, an Indian deity that is a man in the body of a
four-armed elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, who said he became homeless four years ago when he
suffered dioxin poisoning while working at an oil refinery, was
advising Seiler on how to best lay out his tiles for a mosaic.
Nearby, Bozman was showing Saunders how to create shadows and tones
in his oil portrait of a nomadic African woman.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Saunders had been coming to the studio for the
better part of a decade, he had until now stuck to clay. The
portrait _ an homage to women, he said, as an apology for the
shabby way he had treated them when he was doing crack _ was his
first oil painting.
</P>
<P>
   As the men and women work alongside each other, they tell their
tales and offer advice not only on art techniques but survival.
Many share tips on the best places to go for a hot meal and a long
shower, which agency has decent job training and how to work the
shelter system.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork is also great therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Pepe Benjamin, 44, was homeless for many years when started
going to the art studio. After mastering the potter's wheel, he
felt he could master anything. He earned his high school
equivalency degree and now he has a steady job cleaning and
managing a nearby apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started from coming here,'' he said. ``Doing this is
highly inspiring. You move onto something else: `I can do that,
too.' It all starts with a little clay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This place like saved my life,'' said Thomas Carney, 46, who
said he suffered from depression. ``It's been building my
confidence. I feel like I'm finding my voice now.''

&HT;     HOW TO WIN THE GAME OF `SURVIVOR' IN THE OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nobody is eating barbecued rat anymore. It's all
about cliques and politics and manipulation, the human drama of
back stabbing. That's why any worker with half a brain and
absolutely no social life has to watch Wednesday night's television
finale of ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   It's down to four people now, and one basically unlikable soul
will walk away with $1 million. If you watch how the ``Survivor''
people interact and really pay attention, you will learn a lot
about office politics and how to get promoted, even though these
people are on a deserted island in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   (Brief background: 16 castaways were broken into two tribes of
eight people each, called Tagi and Pagong. Once the field was
reduced to 10 castaways, they became one tribe, but former Tagi
members systematically voted out all the former Pagong members.)
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's show milks the drama and commercials for all
they're worth, the four finalists will vote to eliminate one of
their own. After more drama and lots of commercials, the three will
narrow it to two. Then all four people from this episode, plus the
last five previously cast-off castaways will decide which of the
two finalists wins $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   So who will win? The person who keeps these things in mind:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pure talent is rarely enough.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, some kind, wholesome, apolitical soul could win on
``Survivor'' by winning every episode's immunity challenge (the
person who wins the week's contest can't be voted off during that
episode). It didn't happen in ``Survivor,'' and it rarely happens
at work.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Hardly anyone is perfect for any job. The good news is that
you don't have to convince your boss that you're a perfect fit _
just that you're the best person available.
</P>
<P>
   What helps immensely is if you show bursts of talent and energy
at the right time. A brilliant idea on a $10,000 project is nice; a
brilliant idea on a $10 million project can change your life. If
you put in long hours all the time, you can get taken for granted;
if you put in long hours to help meet a crucial deadline, you can
win someone's eternal gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how good you are at office politics, you have to be
good at what you do to survive. If you let your politics write a
check that your talent can't cash, you will be in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your place in the pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   Of the final four on ``Survivor,'' let's assume Kelly has the
most support, followed by Sue and then kind of a tossup between
Rich and Rudy. That's how I see it.
</P>
<P>
   If Sue, Rich or Rudy has an inflated sense of self-esteem,
though, it could cost him or her $1 million. Anyone who makes it to
the final twosome with Kelly will probably lose.
</P>
<P>
   Workers with inflated egos are the most common casualties in
office politics. Instead of just having a gut feeling that you're
doing a good job, look for evidence that the people upstairs like
you, such as promotions, bonuses or raises. If you can't find such
evidence, you might not be as good as you think you are.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are talented, you need to find people who will
support you _ and trust you to support them. A lot of people move
up in an organization once a trusted ally has been promoted, or
they follow that person to another workplace.
</P>
<P>
   You should know your key rival's strengths and weaknesses. If
you can show strength in a rival's weak area and convince the boss
that the area is crucial, you'll increase your chances of getting
promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, too, the best thing you can do is form a shaky
alliance and help your rival land a great promotion _ with another
company, of course. That trick can work for pain-in-the-neck
bosses, too, assuming they have at least some shred of talent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take advantage of random acts of stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Rich is still in the game is because of a stupid
policy adopted by a recently eliminated contestant, Sean. Until the
last couple of weeks, Sean always voted to eliminate people in
alphabetical order because he was trying not to offend anyone.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out, though, that Sean unwittingly cast the deciding
vote to eliminate another contestant, Jenna, when he could have
wiped out the influential Rich. It was a dumb move, and Sean
eventually paid for it when the Rich-led alliance voted him off.
</P>
<P>
   In the office or on a deserted island, ridiculous twists of fate
will take place. Smart people won't attempt to explain them, but
will think about how they can benefit. If everything falls into
place, the Rich just might get richer.

   &UR; ALBANY, N.Y.: x x x have some pearls.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The AtomFilms Web site is a case in point. On any given day, the
site offers a smorgasbord of animated and live-action shorts _
``short'' meaning anything from around half a minute to half an
hour or more. Some are ironic; some are thoughtful; some make
shrewd use of the interactive capabilities of Web-based technology;
and some of them stink.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Guinea Pig Theatre Presents Romeo and Juliet,'' a
two-minute, 34-second reduction of the Bard featuring caged
rodents, goes down easier than ``The Easter Bunny SUCKS,'' in which
the bouncing icon is cast as a potty-mouthed tobacco addict who
rebuffs kids in a park.
</P>
<P>
   Far more successful is ``Capitol Ill,'' a hands-on music video
that invites the viewer to manipulate dancing cutouts of George W.
Bush and Al Gore. Click on a turntable to add a scratch to the
tune; pull on a lever, and the presidential aspirants slide across
the stage. Other knobs and levers toss around beats, sound bites
(``I took the initiative in creating the Internet,'' boasts Al) and
other effects. After a few minutes, Bill Clinton (in boxers) and
George Bush the Elder boogie in for a cameo. It may not qualify as
Serious Art, but it sure is a kick to play with.
</P>
<P>
   And playfulness is part of the digital era. Literally. Think
Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some indie films will look more and more like games, which is
OK,'' said Ortali, a neat native of France who once chaired the
French department at the State University of New York at Albany.
``I just want to make sure that it's the scriptwriters who create
good indie films who will be the ones to do games also. ... I don't
want to leave games of the future just to programmers.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Ortali is a devout believer in Web-linked DVDs and the
interactive future of digital filmmaking: He expects, as do many,
that the new technology will permanently, profoundly alter not just
how movies are made but how we watch them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The age of nitrate is over,'' announced screenwriter Paul
Schrader (``Taxi Driver'') at the Lake Placid Film Forum earlier
this year, and he was dead serious when he said it. Filmgoing, like
filmmaking, may never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, when you write a script, you're very aware of how
it's going to look. You imagine it every step of the way,'' said
the Adirondack-based novelist Russell Banks, who has seen two of
his books adapted into film (``Affliction,'' directed by Schrader,
and ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' by Atom Egoyan). Banks has just
finished a screenplay draft for a prominent filmmaker (too early to
say what, or for whom) that will likely be shot in digital. To that
end, he included in the script suggestions for ``a mix-up'' of
different visual textures, from handheld video to 35mm to grainy
black-and-white.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do things differently,'' he said. ``There's an
intimacy with digital, a friendliness _ it puts you right up close
to the faces and the bodies and the locales, the close locales, of
human beings. ... So it does change how you write. It allowed me to
get much more intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   The new technology ``is one of the most interesting and
promising things since the talkies came along _ and it's going to
be that revolutionary,'' he said. Banks is critical of a breed he
terms ``technobrats'' _ technological sophisticates who have little
or ``only cliched interest'' in storytelling _ but holds out hope
that someday, the art will catch up with the craft. Filmmakers will
learn ``how to use the technology for more interesting
storytelling. Because, finally, that's what film is all about. In
the end it's not a strictly visual art, it's a storyteller's art,
it's a narrative art. And I think, in time, that'll come to the
foreground.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   NEW WORLD OF EFFECTS
</P>
<P>
   At Lake Placid, Schrader cited ``Forrest Gump'' as the first
film to use computerized visuals as ``part of the everyday language
of film,'' not in cacophonous blow-'em-ups but as effective
narrative tools. The digital elimination of Gary Sinise's legs is
one such example, and one reason why ``Gump'' represents a
watershed film.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now we're moving into an era where everything will be
effects,'' he said. ``It's a very big change out there, and we'll
be living in a completely different world.''
</P>
<P>
   The new filmmaking can change an actor's eye color. It can alter
the lighting in a room. It can change tint, tone, atmosphere,
aspect, the entire ``look'' of a movie. It can do just about
anything, from making live animals pucker up for dialogue to
resurrecting John Wayne for a beer commercial.
</P>
<P>
   There may even be a time, in the not-so-distant future, when
movie actors are made _ sprung from computer chips _ rather than
born. (``I have no problem with virtual actors,'' quipped Schrader.
``You know, you don't have to try to get 'em out of the hard drive
when they don't want to come to the set.'')
</P>
<P>
   For the Masuccis, at least, the future is neither remote nor
rapping at their door; they'll be using conventional actors in
their next movie, ``Judgment Time,'' a half-hour sci-fi thriller.
Every stage of filmmaking excites them _ the planning of
preproduction, the controlled mayhem of shooting, the creative
end-game of editing and post-production. ``The most exciting
phase,'' said Joe Masucci, ``is when you stumble upon the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, an idea is all they need. ``Anyone who ever wanted to
make a movie, if you're serious about it, the tools are affordable.
There's no reason not to do it,'' said Joe, and there are plenty of
young filmmakers who agree with him. Even a few from an older
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a kid today, 25 years old or whatever, it would be
really irresistible to go out there and buy $5,000 worth of
equipment and produce, make and distribute my own movies,'' Banks
said. ``And you can do it now. And there's no way you could do that
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With digital filmmaking,'' said Tugman, ``everything is about
kind of closing your eyes and seeing the images so clearly in your
head, then opening your eyes and for the first time not feeling
that lost, hopeless feeling of, `That's nice, but if only ...'
</P>
<P>
   ``The `if onlys' have changed. Now you can close your eyes and
dream what you wanna dream and open your eyes,'' he said. ``And you
will be able to realize anything in your head.''

&HT;     TECHNOLOGY PUTS THE POWER OF HOLLYWOOD IN EVERYMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ You've heard of low-budget film. You've heard of
micro-budget film. You may even have heard of people who make
low-budgeted and micro-budgeted films. At the very least, you've
heard of ``The Blair Witch Project'' (for good or for ill), patched
together by nobodies for a mere $30,000 and destined, thanks to
savvy Internet marketing, to make $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of all that. But chances are _ unless you're their
mother _ you've never heard of Joe and Dan Masucci, two guys who
make films so minutely budgeted that you'd need a microscope to
read the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   They make their movies entirely with digital equipment, on
digital tape, transferred to desktop computer and edited _
digitally, of course _ with widely available software. The end
product is stuff that looks good and costs little. And not a speck
of celluloid need apply.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about the behemoths of Hollywood, about $95
million hollow men and $84 million Klumps, the mild-mannered
Masucci brothers are the real future of filmmaking. Their most
recent venture, a savvy, 50-minute mock ``X-Files'' episode titled
``Graceland'' that's part homage, part spoof, part hyperarticulate
Elvis conspiracy theory, cost less than $500 to make.
</P>
<P>
   Dan, an Apple computer technician who lives in Albany, directed
and starred as an dourly Duchovny-like Fox Mulder; Donna Hayes, a
friend, played Scully. Joe served as director of photography. Both
wrote and produced the film, in which an extraterrestrial Elvis
abducts and impregnates a humble Albany waitress.
</P>
<P>
   The end product, plugged on the Masuccis' Web site
(www.fountainheadpictures.com), has been distributed free of charge
to anyone who mails them a videotape or CD. So far, they say, about
150 copies of ``Graceland'' have been sent around the globe _ to
``Australia, Lithuania, Argentina, Belgium, Athens, Greece and all
around the country,'' said Dan, a stay-at-home dad in suburban East
Greenbush. ``When you include digital technology with use of the
Internet ... '' he begins, and his brother quickly finishes: ``...
you have a worldwide audience.''
</P>
<P>
   They can't make money off it. If they wanted to, they'd have a
few copyright holders to contend with (the Presley estate; Thirteen
Productions, which makes ``X-Files''; the Fox network). But the
project is nevertheless a masterstroke of self-promotion, a slick
business card that raises audience and industry awareness of the
Masuccis' filmcraft.
</P>
<P>
   They sent a copy to ``X-Files'' scribe Vince Gilligan, and
although nothing may come of the gesture, he replied with a
complimentary thank-you note and promised to pass on the episode to
his colleagues. It's a small victory for the Masuccis, but it
typifies the do-it-yourself mentality that drives such budding
filmmakers and points to the synergy between low costs and high
hopes that fuel the digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   MAINSTREAM MOVIEMAKING
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, just about anyone can shoot a movie. Just about
anyone can edit it _ avoiding the cost of hiring a traditional
editor in a traditional studio at the traditional
$100-plus-per-hour fees. And just about anyone can market it,
shilling on personalized Web pages or finding distribution on any
of several burgeoning sites (AtomFilms.com, for one) that screen
on-line movies for viewers with the proper software.
</P>
<P>
   As the Masuccis illustrate, the latest digital advances are
prying hard at the tightest seals of Hollywood. It's moviemaking
for Everyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filmmaking, in the Hollywood sense of the word, will never be
democratic, even if you go as far as Gus Van Sant shooting his next
project with Jim Carrey on digital. I don't think that means that
the industry itself is going to be more accepting of two guys from
Albany making a movie,'' said Jason Tugman, a digital filmmaker and
self-described ``Chief Idiot'' of a Chicago-based troubleshooting
Web site, DigitalIdiots.com. ``But I think what it's doing is
leveling the independent market and making the independent market
so that it is even more so _ independent in separating itself from
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Tugman's Web site helps filmmakers make sense of the new
technology, providing organized tutorials and plentiful how-tos.
The idea is to provide a digital leg up, ``to educate people in the
basics of digital filmmaking so they feel extremely comfortable
with the foundation. Because once you have the foundation, you can
take that and get in depth as much as you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   All filmmakers, he said, ``have these little ideas _ and they're
not these big, fancy ideas. They're sketches, they're bits, they're
moments, they're little things that in (traditional) film would
cost me a thousand dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new technology, ``I can literally free my mind from all
these things that are trapped in there, because I can spend _ what?
_ $15 on a DVD tape?''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   FUN AND GAMES
</P>
<P>
   This is, as people in this exploding industry seem to agree, a
good thing. Inexpensive equipment (maybe $1,000 to $4,000 for a
camera; $1,600 for the computer hardware; $1,000 for the software)
is a good thing. The freedom to experiment is a good thing. The
plethora of filters and visual effects that can be applied in
post-production, at sub-sub-minimal cost, are good things. And
opening up the arcane world of filmmaking to anyone with a few
thousand bucks and the chutzpah to spend it is surely good thing.
As Joe Masucci observed, ``You can put a whole movie studio
together for $5,000.''
</P>
<P>
   All the same, there is a downside: the fact that a lot of these
new filmmakers are rank beginners, not all of them blessed with
talent. ``We will have a huge amount of bad, bad movies coming
along,'' said Ray Ortali, founder and chief executive of Prime
Technologies, a Delmar, N.Y.-based company that designs Web sites
and DVDs. ``But in this mountain of crap _ if we put it that way _
we are going to have some pearls.''

&HT;     LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE IS BRISK FOR SBC 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SANFORD NOWLIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ SBC Communications Inc. has signed up more than
500,000 long-distance customers in Texas in the six weeks it has
been allowed to offer the service, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The brisk customer growth surprised some analysts by exceeding
that of Verizon Communications _ formerly Bell Atlantic _ when it
launched long-distance service last year in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon took more than three months to attract its first 500,000
long-distance customers. It passed the million-customer mark in
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly surprising to see SBC add this many customers
this fast,'' said David Burks, a telecommunications analyst for
J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons in Louisville, Ky. ``The company's off
to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Burks said SBC's aggressive advertising and its good track
record with existing local-service customers contributed to the
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working very hard to get the word out that we're
offering long-distance service in Texas,'' said SBC spokesman Selim
Bingol. ``It's gratifying to see this kind of response.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC, the corporate parent of Southwestern Bell, posted news of
the customer additions in an investor briefing released late
Friday. San Antonio-based SBC also is the parent company of Pacific
Bell Nevada Bell in the West and Ameritech in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators gave final approval for SBC to enter Texas' $7.7
billion long-distance market on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Regional Bell companies such as SBC may offer long distance to
customers in their service area once they have shown state and
federal regulators their markets are open to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   So far, SBC and Verizon _ the partnership formed this year by
Bell Atlantic and GTE Corp. _ are the only regional Bells that
regulators have allowed to sell long distance in their home
territories. Both also are seeking permission to enter the
long-distance market in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Also in its investor briefing, SBC said it has more than 435,000
subscribers to its DSL (digital subscriber line) service, which
allows ultra-fast Internet access over standard phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   It wants to have 1 million DSL subscribers by year-end.

 &HT;    Online banking growing rapidly
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   That traditional but unconvincing excuse _ ``The check is in the
mail,'' has gotten even flimsier for the 10 percent of U.S.
households who bank on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10.5 million households used online banks last year
for bill-paying, checking accounts, credit cards and loans, buying
certificates of deposits or other financial services.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are many. ``People's money is something they are
always interested in following,'' said Jim Bruene, editor and
founder of the Online Banking Report newsletter. ``Online is an
easier way to do it, rather than waiting to look at a printed
statement once a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors: More families have access to the Internet. Banks
have made it easier to use. And the array of services has
increased.
</P>
<P>
   More banks have rushed in to compete for that business, too.
Search for U.S.-based banks at www.onlinebankingreport
</P>
<P>
   .com, and you will find 789 listings. Some are only online. Many
more are subsidiaries of existing banks, large and small.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond convenience, some online banks also offer higher interest
rates on checking accounts and certificates of deposit than
conventional banks, no monthly fees and free online bill-paying
services.
</P>
<P>
   All those factors account for rapid growth since the first
online banking services appeared in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But there are drawbacks. You can't make cash deposits. You can
make direct deposits of your paychecks, but you have to mail in
other checks. ``Some people are really not happy with the downtime
until their money is deposited in their accounts,'' said Greg
McBride, a financial analyst at Bankrate.com.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be delays paying bills. A number of corporations,
such as AT&AMP;T, will accept electronic payment now. About half of
bill payments are made by that swift route, according to Bruene.
But the rest go from your online bank by mail.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based
watchdog organization, found that some online banks make it hard to
get questions answered, through the banks' Web sites or on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   True online banks have no ATMs, of course. Nor do they have
branch offices where you can talk to real people about real
problems. ``People want to work with someone they trust with their
money,'' Bruene said. ``Who do you trust more than your existing
bank?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bruene expects rapid growth to continue. He believes 15
million households will use online banks or credit unions by the
end of this year, and 20 million by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Banks will be happy with that. One recent study showed that the
cost of a full-service teller transaction is $1.07. The bank spent
27 cents for each ATM transaction _ but only 1 cent for
Internet-based transactions.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to open an online account, it pays to shop
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates differ considerably on checking accounts and CDs.
No-fee checking accounts and bill-paying are the norm, but not
universal.
</P>
<P>
   You may also want to check on what other services are offered.
The array varies considerably from one Web bank to the next.
</P>
<P>
   You can find frequently updated reports of interest rates at
www.bankrate.com and rankings of online banks at www
</P>
<P>
   .gomez.com.
</P>
<P>
   Among its rankings, Gomez says Atlanta-based Security First
Network Bank is best overall, Wachovia is the easiest to use and
USAccess Bank has the lowest overall cost.
</P>
<P>
   It will also pay to ask yourself some questions. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Am I comfortable with computers?
</P>
<P>
   Online banking requires basic computer skills and confidence to
entrust both money and financial information to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you amenable to banking with an entity you can't tangibly
see?'' asked Bankrate.com's McBride. ``The primary objection seems
to be placing your money with an institution that is more virtual
than traditional bricks and mortar, and that maybe in a different
part of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What services do I want?
</P>
<P>
   Low-cost accounts are an attractive feature, as are the
relatively high interest some online banks pay on checking accounts
and CDs. A tidy process for bill-paying attracts others.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're accustomed to meeting your money at the
neighborhood ATM, you'll have to consider how much the fees will
be. If you remember Jimmy Stewart as the infinitely kind banker in
the movie ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' rest assured you will not meet
him _ or any other real person _ on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How do I know an online bank is safe?
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Action recommends looking for ``128-bit encryption,''
the standard in the industry, and for a written guarantee to
protect account holders from losses due to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   You should also visit www.fdic.gov to check whether the bank
you're considering has deposit insurance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Do I still want face-to-face contact?
</P>
<P>
   Most people do. At least 95 percent of online bank customers use
the online services of a traditional bank, according to Bruene.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason is the trust that comes from maintaining an
existing relationship with a bank, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   So far the dominant theme of Al Gore's presidential campaign
seems to be that he's not Bill Clinton. Of course, there are 275
million other Americans who are also not Bill Clinton, but there
you have it.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Biddle, for example, is not Bill Clinton. Puff Daddy is
also not Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Aguilera? Nope. She's not Bill Clinton either.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing day the Gore camp is going to more drastic
extremes to distance their man from the pants-around-the-ankles
legacy of the president. It's only a matter of time before they
make the claim that even though Gore has been the vice president of
the United States for nearly eight years, he's never actually met
Clinton in person. Not since Darva Conger fled Rick Rockwell's
clutches have I seen anyone try to desperately to shed a former
partner.
</P>
<P>
   It's ridiculous. I mean, was it really necessary for the
fabulous Gore daughters to form an alliance and vote Clinton off
the island during the tribal council portion of the Democratic
National Convention last week?
</P>
<P>
   And how about Gore's rousing refrain from ``the most important
speech of his political life,'' as 8,000 pundits dubbed it. (That's
about as insightful as calling the Super Bowl the most important
football game of the year.) In front of God and Tipper and country,
Gore proclaimed he was standing ``as my own man.''
</P>
<P>
   Well gee whiz. As a statement of independence, that's right up
there with, ``I think I deserve a later curfew, mom!'' and, ``Can I
stay at Tommy's house tonight? His parents said it was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republicans are furiously working to keep the
Clinton-Gore linkup at the forefront of the public consciousness,
like a busybody matchmaker who refuses to believe a marriage is
crumbling. As a guest editorialist reminded us in the New York
Times on Monday, Gov. George W. Bush's acceptance speech included
the line, ``After all the shouting and all of the scandal, we can
begin again.''
</P>
<P>
   Begin what, I'm not sure. But if you're a reporter and you
venture near any Bush staffer or Republican leader these days,
they'll hit you with some variation on that theme, some unsubtle
dig at Gore via Clinton. In fact if you venture anywhere near a
hardcore GOPer these days, you risk being wrestled to the ground
and told: ``Al Gore and Bill Clinton are the same guy! And Soylent
Green is people!''
</P>
<P>
   The media are also addicted to this whole
six-degrees-of-separation angle. Political cartoonists, columnists,
cable-talk yappers, even aliens like Sam Donaldson _ each day they
offer their take on the Clinton-Gore connection and whether the
candidate is doing a good enough job of separating himself from the
lame duck, scandal-tainted, yucky prez. Among both parties and the
press, it's a given that in order for Al Gore to win the general
election, he must shed that Clintonian snakeskin and stand alone.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong! Gore shouldn't be in Clinton denial, he should be riding
those Teflon coattails all the way to the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   What everybody seems to be forgetting is that Clinton is a
winner. The ultimate survivor, forever prevailing over the
Republican Party. He defeated George Bush, he beat Bob Dole, he
whupped Newt Gingrich, he dismantled Henry Hyde's posse and he
could probably travel back in time and figure out a way to swipe an
election from Abraham Lincoln if he had to.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Clinton ``lost'' to the GOP in the midterm debacle of
1994, he won. Contract with America, my eye.
</P>
<P>
   We're living in a golden age of prosperity and peace. Maybe
Clinton shouldn't receive the bulk of the credit for that _ but
he's been the guy at the wheel for seven and a half years, and for
the majority of the voting public, that's always been good enough.
He's still in office because we kept him there.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore's really his own man, he'll reconsider the conventional
wisdom and stand next to Clinton as often as possible, wearing a
T-shirt with an arrow that points to the president and proclaims,
``I'm with him!'' Leave the dramatic breakup to Anne Heche and
Ellen Degeneres. Gore should stick it out with the one who brought
him to the dance in the first place.

&HT;     GROWING WEARY OF THE PUNDIT'S PRATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On behalf of all registered voters, likely
voters, the American people and America in general, I'd like to ask
how television, radio and print media ``experts'' know enough to
speak for me?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, for us.
</P>
<P>
   There must be close to 2 million such political pundits on
various payrolls these days. They are everywhere, at all hours. In
Pulitzer Prize-winning newspapers and the most esoteric cable
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly male, mostly white and _ it appears from the nice suits
and expensive haircuts of those on TV _ mostly well-paid, these
experts presume over and over to pronounce with unshakable surety
what the American people want with regard to:
</P>
<P>
   _ A president.
</P>
<P>
   _ A presidential candidate's acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   _ The specific acceptance speech of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   _ The specific acceptance speech of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   _ The behavior and speeches of all presidential candidates and
vice presidential candidates during the months separating their
nominating conventions and the national election.
</P>
<P>
   _ The behavior of Republican and Democratic presidential
candidates during the televised debates that take place over the
abovementioned time period.
</P>
<P>
   _ Any and every socio-political thing we might hear or think
about in these prosperous times, when ``everybody'' is so allegedly
fat and happy.
</P>
<P>
   How did these political analysts and observers get so very, very
informed?
</P>
<P>
   The word ``pundit'' comes from Hindu where it means a scholar
who is fluent in Sanskrit and educated in matters of law, divinity
and science.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, such qualifications are not required of the modern U.S.
version. But the easy confidence with which our pundits talk and
write about ``America's'' wants, needs and dreams sounds like an
ordinary person relaying the news to another that the sun does
indeed rise in the East.
</P>
<P>
   My fellow ventriloquist's dummies, have any of you invited any
of these people over to your house for pizza and beer or some
kebobs on the Weber?
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone tell me about the day that Tim or Chris or Morton or
George or William or Maureen _ or any of the 2 million _ knocked
upon your front door and said: ``Hi. I'd like to ask you if you
thought Al and Tipper's kiss was genuine passion or cynical
political manipulation?''
</P>
<P>
   Did a few of them send you a lengthy questionnaire along with
the U.S. Census form? Did you happen to take a long cruise or
cross-country flight with any of them? Are they calling everyone at
home during telemarketing time but me?
</P>
<P>
   Surely the pundits are not basing their omniscience on polls.
</P>
<P>
   All 2 million of them cannot seem to construct a compound
sentence without referring to ``the latest polls.'' But, I have
noticed, they all also never miss a chance to demonstrate their
consummate sophistication by dismissing the polls as ``interesting
but not at all conclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless the polls happen to support the specific point
the political expert is about to make or affirms the point he/she
made (so pointedly) the time before.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it's possible all 2 million of them are psychic.
</P>
<P>
   That would certainly explain how they can say things like,
``Americans want Al Gore to provide detail on his proposed
policies, but not too much detail.'' Or, ``America expects its vice
presidential candidates to play the role of the attack dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Americans are pretty happy in this economy; they just
can't get excited about the possibility of George Bush appointing
two anti-abortion justices to the U.S. Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   If all the experts and analysts were gathering intelligence by
spying on us with big telescopes and phone bugs, I think we'd know
it by now. William or Tim would slip and say, ``Unlike most of
America, Max and Florence Thompson in Topeka are very interested in
hearing about Hadassah Lieberman's recipe for her husband's
favorite egg dish.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what can explain it?
</P>
<P>
   How did the pundits get to be such experts? How do they continue
to get away with speaking for you and me? Won't someone solve the
mystery? America wants to know.

 By JOAN SCOBEY  
 c. 2000 Joan Scobey  
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two minutes after I'm shown into my panelled room at the luxe
Lanesborough Hotel in London, where even the bathtub and toilet
have mahogany accents and the rugs are set flush into the parquet
floor, the doorbell rings and I meet my butler. Dark suit, pearl
gray striped tie, warm smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Christopher,'' he says pleasantly. ``May I unpack
for you?''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. I blush to think of anyone looking in my suitcase, not
least a butler who, I suppose, has unpacked at some of Britain's
stateliest homes. Inside are no ball gowns, no black satin teddies.
Instead images of my faded blue jeans, turtlenecks and sensible
walking shoes pass before my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmm, thanks,'' I mumble. ``I think I can manage myself.'' I'm
already having trouble dealing with this butler concept.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher is obviously used to diffident Americans who aren't
up to being buttled. ``Here is your stationery,'' he moves on
pleasantly, pointing to some sheets of letterhead on the desk
printed: In residence, Joan Scobey. They sit next to business cards
with my private Lanesborough telephone and fax numbers. The fax
machine is hidden in a desk drawer, and Christopher shows me how it
works, along with an entertainment system tucked into a period
armoire.
</P>
<P>
   Last in my butler tutorial is the intricate panel of bedside
buttons that are control central for lights, temperature and a
variety of other earthly desires, including Privacy _ aka ``Do Not
Disturb.'' The most important button _ Butler _ seems to be
everywhere. There is hardly a corner of my bedroom or bathroom from
which I can't summon Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher is small and French. He was just promoted from room
service, and already knows discretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So who's at the hotel now?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businessmen,'' he answers smoothly. ``Entertainment people
love it. A gentleman from the Middle East is in the Royal Suite.''
That's as far as Christopher goes. But the staff still talks about
the time Madonna stayed in the Royal Suite and had the dining room
lined with mirrors and packed with fitness equipment. From her
balcony overlooking Buckingham Palace she even bestowed royal waves
on her fans below.
</P>
<P>
   After I had booked my room, I received the hotel's Guest Profile
form. It requested my choice of drinks for the bar, morning
newspapers and preferred mode of transportation (Did I want to be
picked up at the airport in the Jaguar or the Bentley?), as well as
my favorite music. I checked Jazz/Blues. Christopher was waiting
with ``Still Got the Blues,'' ``Hooked on Big Bands,'' ``Duke
Ellington'' and a long list of CDs from which I added ``The
Complete Beatles'' and Handel's ``Water Music.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar comes complete with a bucket of ice, tongs at the ready,
crystal decanters holding Scotch, gin and vodka, and six
Bordeaux-shaped bottles of Sparkling Blenheim mineral water. I'm
ready to settle into the leather sofa with a drink, kick back with
``Abbey Road,'' delve into the bowl of dates and strawberries _ and
contemplate life with a butler.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. I feel woefully inadequate for this
upstairs/downstairs scene. There's not only the matter of
butler-worthy clothes, but I'm not even up to speed on the business
amenities. Sure, I've stayed in hotel rooms with faxes before, but
never with anyone taking such a correct interest in my well-being.
</P>
<P>
   At the touch of the Butler button, Christopher appears in less
than a minute. Lanesborough butlers are trained to respond to their
discreet beepers within two minutes; if they don't, the call is
forwarded to another station and the butler team goes into code
blue alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christopher, I'd like to ask a friend to stop by for drinks
later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, Mrs. Scobey. I'll organize it.'' Christopher comes
from Epernay, so he knows a thing or two about champagne. I leave
everything to him.
</P>
<P>
   Lanesborough butlers are chosen for their aplomb and cool, I
later learn from Robert, the head butler. Calm, quick thinking and
a congenial personality are far more important than training.
Anthony Hopkins followed Robert around to pick up pointers for his
role in ``The Remains of the Day.'' Lanesborough butlers are not,
however, in the starchy Jeeves or John Gielgud tradition. They are
friendly, humorous, easy-mannered _ and completely correct.
</P>
<P>
   They also know when you're in your room and when you're not.
There are no hidden cameras to reveal exactly what you're doing and
where, but it's hard to escape the unnerving notion that Big Butler
is watching. Robert showed me how it's done. Sophisticated
computers register the status of motion detectors and sensors for
lights, television and air-conditioning in every room. If you
forget to turn off your Privacy button when you leave, and there's
no movement in your room for twenty minutes, the lights go out and
the staff feels free to enter.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to never disturb a guest. That works fine, unless
you happen to be quietly reading or soaking in a bubble bath and
find that the room suddenly goes dark, or that your butler has come
in to check the bar. (A regal wave of your hand will turn the
lights on at once; your butler won't blink an eye.)
</P>
<P>
   Walking dogs, buying clothes, planning menus and choosing wines,
even a 3 a.m. call to rehang a picture _ it's all in the life of a
Lanesborough butler. The Christophers, Sergios and Susans will do
just about anything that's asked of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One butler had to roll an Indian prince's turban on his head,
which took hours,'' said Robert. ``Another had to find a
thoroughbred horse for a guest to buy _ lucky one of our butlers
had been a horse breeder. Another with an economic degree wrote a
speech for a Thai banker, then trained him to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   I had far less taxing needs, and they were usually anticipated
(another mark of a good butler). With Christopher, I never had to
put my boots out. Every evening he spirited them away and returned
them polished to a fine patina and stuffed with tissue paper. One
day, a button on my jacket came loose. Of course, I could sew it on
myself, but hey, if there's a butler in your life, you might as
well let him buttle. I was beginning to get the hang of this.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of my stay I felt confident enough to ask for help
with some research. Richard happened to be on call at the time.
(You didn't think the same butler attends to you round the clock,
did you? You can enjoy three of them a day.) I was trying to find
the name of a particular restaurant a friend told me about. All I
knew was that there were no prices on the menu and you pay what you
think the meal is worth. It sounded like fun, but the concierge had
never heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a couple of hours,'' said Richard. Two hours later
there was a note on my desk with the name, address, tube station,
even the bus route.
</P>
<P>
   So that's the story. And when I leave for the airport, I hope
there'll be two of us going back to the States. Christopher and me.
</P>
<P>
   If you long to be pampered at The Lanesborough, singles start at
about $380 and doubles about $510, suites begin around $780, and
the Royal Suite, with three bedrooms for your entourage, is about
$6,000. The butler comes for free. Call 800-999-1828.

ATHEISTS TO DISTRIBUTE BOOK COVERS IN TEXAS SCHOOL DISTRICT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By TAWNELL D. HOBBS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ An atheist group, spurred by the school
district's recent decision to allow book covers printed with the
Ten Commandments in schools, has received approval from the
district to distribute covers.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent David Barbosa said he followed board policy in
giving the Metroplex Atheists permission to distribute the covers.
The policy states that each school shall designate an area where
non-school materials approved by the district can be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on board policy, we think that they should be given
permission, and I have given them permission,'' Barbosa said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The book covers, which are dominated by a message from missing
atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair and include quotations from U.S.
presidents about religion and separation of church and state, will
be distributed beginning this week, said Shelly Hattan of Metroplex
Atheists.
</P>
<P>
   School board President Norris ``Stretch'' Rideaux said he
doesn't approve of the atheist book covers, but it appears that the
covers meet criteria set in board policy for non-school
publications, such as not being obscene or sexually inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't approve of having atheist book covers in
our schools, but I have to accept it because it's in our policy,''
Rideaux said.
</P>
<P>
   Hattan, who lives in Watauga, said the group, which has about 15
active members, plans to distribute the covers in all Grand Prairie
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there's a Ten Commandment book cover, we'll put ours,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 covers bearing the biblical commands were
distributed last week by Grand Prairie resident Karen Wiegman, who
led the effort to place the covers in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegman, who attends First Church of the Nazarene in Grand
Prairie, said last week that she has no objections to atheists,
Druids or worshippers of Satan putting book covers in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth lawyer Frank Colosi, who serves on the American Civil
Liberties Union state legal committee, said under the district's
policy, virtually anyone will be allowed to place book covers in
the schools, including political groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual for a district to do something like this, because
most districts just don't want to open this kind of thing up,''
Colosi said. ``I'm kind of pleasantly surprised that the school
district is willing to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Hogan of the American Atheists Inc., the parent
organization of the Metroplex Atheists, said the group was
initially told by the district that it could not distribute the
covers because ``they were derogatory toward Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that this is a separation of church and state
issue,'' Hogan said. ``It's our position that no book cover should
be in the schools. They have created such a gray area by
introducing these book covers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux said the district anticipated that an atheist group
would want to put its book covers in the schools after the district
in June allowed the distribution of book covers with the Ten
Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a board we anticipated this would happen, but we didn't
anticipate it would happen so soon,'' Rideaux said.
</P>
<P>
   The district does restrict the content of some book covers.
</P>
<P>
   Although covers distributed to students contain advertisements,
district policy provides that ``... the principal or superintendent
shall reject any proposals or materials that are reasonably
foreseeable to be disruptive, libelous, obscene, inflammatory,
sexually inappropriate for the age of the audience or that endorses
actions endangering the health or safety of students.''
</P>
<P>
   Ads for alcohol, tobacco or substances that promote health
hazards are specifically prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan said his organization is prepared to distribute as many
book covers as needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to meet this front in every way we can, and to take
it nationwide,'' Hogan said. ``It is my position that no myth nor
magic nor the cruelties displayed in any Bible, or any God
mentioned in the Bible, should be forced into the mind of a child
in or out of school.''
</P>
<P>
   Trustee Michael Grace said the atheists should be allowed to
place their covers in the schools, but he doesn't like the wording
on the book cover, which appears to be an attack. Quotes from past
U.S. presidents on religion are included on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It concerns me that there could be confusion to elementary
kids who are kind of impressionable,'' Grace said. ``But we have to
defend the (atheists') right to put them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Board Secretary Bebe Bingham said the board should allow the
atheist covers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we allow the Ten Commandment covers, we have to allow
these, too,'' Bingham said. ``What's fair is fair.''

&HT;     IT'S MIND OVER BODY IN PURSUING TIGER 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As Sydney beckons and the National Basketball
Association turns inside out, Ms. Demeanor gives her mailbag an
overdue once-over.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: How about the way Tiger Woods' competitors
have tried to get into better shape to deal with him? I've heard
that Colin Montgomerie lost 20 pounds, and everyone has heard about
David Duval's fitness obsession. I admire their drive. Don't you
think it will have an effect?
</P>
<P>
   _ R. Simmons, Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Dear. Mr. Simmons: Well, if you watched the PGA Championship,
you saw Tiger pushed as hard as ever by a man with an extra chin.
This is not to say that tighter abs won't help golfers challenge
Tiger, who, aside from all of his other assets, maintains the
sleekest physique in the game. But the area where the other golfers
need the most help is in the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Bob May had no reason to believe that he could keep up with
Tiger in the PGA, and maybe that's the reason he did. David Duval
skipped the tournament because he has a fragile back, but his body
isn't the only reason for his inability to keep pace with Tiger.
His confidence comes and goes. His lean body doesn't look merely
fit. It looks starved, and angry, a web of misplaced passions.
</P>
<P>
   All of Tiger's passion aligns perfectly. It might make him
unbeatable, but May proved that Tiger isn't untouchable. It would
be great to see some more real challengers, if only to frame
Tiger's ability better.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: Can you explain the deeper meaning of the
big, four-way trade in the NBA that everyone's talking about? Where
would it leave my Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.N. McMurphy, Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Dear J.N.: As the stylists say, the key to success is how you
accessorize. If this deal goes through as planned, the Lakers would
have details to flatter both Phil Jackson, pensive guru, and
Shaquille O'Neal, the favored canvas of cheap-shot artists
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Their frontcourt would include graduates of Yale (Chris Dudley),
Stanford (Mark Madsen) and Duke (Christian Laettner). The potential
for intellectual pretensions is boundless . . . until you consider
that they will all be flak jackets for a guy who dropped out of LSU
. . . and that the brightest Laker just might be the youngster who
never went to college at all. A gossipy item in L.A. recently
placed Kobe Bryant at a posh Italian eatery, speaking fluently in
Old Country tongue to the staff.
</P>
<P>
   As for the soon-to-be-departed Glen Rice, when he sang ``Me, me,
me, me, me,'' he wasn't tuning up for La Traviata. He never spoke
the right language for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: What do you think of this softball team that
won the Little League World Series with five 14- to 16-year-old
boys on the roster? I know it's legal to put boys in the girls
sport, but it doesn't seem fair. I can't blame the organizers for
saying they want to rewrite the rules to exclude the boys.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara Riggs, Kalamazoo, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Riggs: The winning team came from Eloy, Ariz., a small
town that couldn't put together enough players to field an entire
baseball or softball team. I'm not confident supporting a team that
could encourage other cities to transform a girls sport into a boys
one. But if girls are entitled to take spots away from boys on a
Little League baseball team, it's hard to argue that boys should be
banned from softball.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so hard to figure out that the coach of the
second-place team made a huge mistake by choosing to forfeit the
final game. His players apparently wanted to go ahead and compete.
He refused, saying that three of them had been hurt in a prior game
against the big, burly boys.
</P>
<P>
   I have a problem with his argument because his all-female team
had lost by only one run to the coeds in the prior game. In another
showdown earlier in the tournament, they actually beat them by a
run.
</P>
<P>
   What I really want to know is, given the way female athletes are
expected to promote themselves these days, when will the Eloy Five
be asked to pose naked for a calendar or crawl seductively across
the floor for a Sports Illustrated picture?
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: One question, two words: Bela Karolyi?
</P>
<P>
   _ Flip Dout in Boston
</P>
<P>
   Dear Flip: Here's my theory: Ever seen him and Bob Knight in the
same room together? The initials are the same. The attitude is
similar. The only difference is that none of the gymnasts would
dare challenge Karolyi. So he ends up looking like Knight on happy
pills.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: What have you thought of Dennis Miller so far
on Monday Night Football?
</P>
<P>
   _ Roger Nielsen, Dallas
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mr. Nielsen: He'd be marginally passable as a commentator
on professional wrestling. Give me Chris Rock, or Ellen DeGeneres,
or any of the other comics with regular gigs on HBO, Miller's
stand-up home. But Rock and DeGeneres won't do football, because
they're too good at their first jobs. Miller's blather is vapid
pretension, delivered in the most irritating voice imaginable. Come
to think of it: Pretentious, irritating? Has anyone seen Miller and
Christian Laettner in the same room?

   BEIJING _ Ding Meiyuan likes to go out in a nice dress and feel
pretty, but those thoughts will have to wait at least another
month. She is preparing for the Olympics, and at 227 pounds, her
biggest concern is that she'll lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me now, eating is first; training is second,'' she said
after a workout one afternoon recently.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old fisherman's daughter is the women's
weightlifting world champion in the super-heavyweight division, 75
kilograms and over. Some say that makes her the world's strongest
woman. But she is not the heaviest.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the slimmest of all her competitors,'' said Wei Di, who
heads the weightlifting program. ``The rest of them weigh at least
265 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's weightlifting will make its debut as an Olympic sport
next month at Sydney. With world records in four of the seven
weight classes, China's team is heavily favored to win several gold
medals.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women on China's national team come from peasant
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese women are good at enduring hardships,'' Wei said.
``For those from the countryside, this is a path to a better
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ding grew up in a fishing village near the port city of Dalian
in northeastern China. Like many on the team, she started training
when she was just 12, after a coach decided she had the right body
type and convinced her to enroll in a state-run sports school,
which is where almost all Chinese Olympic athletes are trained.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years on the Liaoning provincial team, she moved up
to the national team at age 15. At 19, she won three gold medals
and broke two world records at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok.
Last November, she won the world championship in Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't the only Chinese woman picking up medals in Bangkok.
She and her teammates won all seven weightlifting gold medals and
broke world records seven days in a row.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Liaoning Daily newspaper, the women's
weightlifting team has not shown its true strength in international
competitions for fear of dominating the sport too heavily and
jeopardizing the chances of it becoming an Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   Ding's strongest rival is Agata Wrobel, the 19-year-old world
record-holder from Poland.
</P>
<P>
   As for the American team, ``there's one kid who's pretty good,''
said Zhang Wenxi, the women's weightlifting coach.
</P>
<P>
   At 17 and 300 pounds, Cheryl Haworth of Savannah, Ga., is the
U.S. national champion and America's best chance for a women's
weightlifting medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she can maybe get a bronze,'' Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
   Since China has been allotted just four slots for women's
weightlifting, Zhang and Wei say they are still deciding on the
final line-up, which will be announced August 27. Everything from
competitors' performances to menstrual cycles are being factored
into the equation.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the team to win gold has been building. With
recent injuries and doping scandals in swimming, diving and track
and field _ high-profile events for which China had high Olympic
hopes _ women's weightlifting is one of the few events China feels
confident about.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese state-run media have been talking about a gold medal
sweep for all four women. Zhang says he feels secure about at least
three golds.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic medals also come with financial rewards in China's
state-sponsored sports system. Gold medalists will receive 80,000
yuan, or almost US$10,000, which is the equivalent of 20 years'
income for many farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But sports is starting to get commercial sponsorship too. For
example, all athletes who win medals will be required to wear
clothing from Chinese manufacturer Li Ning during the medal
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The weightlifting team, so far has not attracted much corporate
backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are not very interested in weightlifting,'' Wei
said. ``We hope after these Olympics we'll get more support.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, they have to get the gold.
</P>
<P>
   The women's team works out three to five hours a day at a
Beijing gym. Ranging in age from 19 to 26, they repeatedly hoist
barbells to their chests and over their heads. For several hours
each week, they also do mental exercises, which Zhang says involves
deep breathing and recalling their best performances from the past.
</P>
<P>
   The team has experts in Chinese medicine monitoring each athlete
and giving them pills made of ginseng and deer antler to enrich
their blood and energy levels.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Ding lifts more than 30,000 pounds a day. To sustain
her, she eats four meals a day and snacks as much as she wants to.
Her arms are big, but her thighs are massive.
</P>
<P>
   At first, building bulk was hard on her psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be skinny,'' she said. ``I weighed only 40 kilograms
(88 pounds).''
</P>
<P>
   After getting big, ``I didn't like to go outside because I
thought I was too fat. I felt like everyone was looking at me,''
she said. ``But now, doing this sport, I have to be like this.
After I stop training I'll lose weight.''
</P>
<P>
   One thought keeps her going when she longs to be thin again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about when I'm in Australia getting my medal,
listening to China's anthem, how other girls won't be able to do
this,'' Ding said.

IT'S LAST-MINUTE HEROICS FOR THE RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES 
c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Perhaps, Trot Nixon suggested, it's time for the
nightly packed houses at Fenway Park _ 38 straight sellouts and
counting _ to do the opposite of the crowds in southern California,
who leave in the seventh inning to beat the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why play the first eight innings?'' Nixon said Monday. ``Let's
just go straight to the ninth. We'd finish a lot quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful thing, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast meeting with the boss? Catching the 7 a.m. shuttle to
LaGuardia? Got to make your deliveries to Kiki's Kwik Mart before
dawn?
</P>
<P>
   If that's your schedule and you're a Red Sox fan, your life has
taken on another layer of pain in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   But who's complaining? If it takes an extra cup of coffee or two
every morning for the next six weeks to survive, fire up the
grinder. The way the Sox are winning lately, with the accent on the
first syllable, you go to bed at your own peril.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was Brian Daubach, hitting a home run with two outs
in the ninth to tie the score, then dumping a two-run flare over
shortstop in the 11th inning, again just one out away from defeat,
to lift the Sox to a 7-6 win over the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a whole lot of hits lately,'' said Daubach, who
had had just 10 hits and 3 RBIs in 61 at-bats this month and had
been dropped into the No. 8 hole by manager Jimy Williams. ``But
I've gotten some huge ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the last eight games, the Sox have won in their
last at-bat. Six times in the last 24 games, they have come from
two or more runs behind after failing to do so once in their first
97 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games like this bring you together a little bit more,''
reliever Rod Beck said. ``Everyone remembers how much fun it is to
win. It's important to feel that from time to time, because it
reminds all of us what the goal is.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox closer Derek Lowe was one out away from being the losing
pitcher after giving up a double to Troy Glaus to open the 11th and
two successive bunts, including a suicide squeeze by Adam Kennedy,
the same player whose three-run home run had broken a 2-all tie in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe was in the dugout when Daubach reached out and hit
Shigetoshi Hasegawa's trick pitch, ``the Shuto,'' a
sinkerball/forkball tailing away from him, inches off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just went `who-o-o-o-o-o-o,' '' Lowe said, the wide arc of
his smile matching the motion he was making with his hand to
describe the looping flight of Daubach's game-winner, which fell a
short hop in front of the hopeless dive of Angels left fielder
Orlando Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional swing was almost unbearable for everyone on the
premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the bottom of the emotional scale,'' said catcher
Jason Varitek, who had just hit into a bases-loaded, no-out double
play that almost became a triple play because of the inexplicable
delayed reaction by baserunners Troy O'Leary and Manny Alexander.
``I had just hit a ball hard, but right at somebody, exactly what I
didn't want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Brian came up big again. We were pretty much written off
in that game. Two outs, nobody on in the ninth inning. But I
happened to get a walk, and Brian hit that home run. Just a great
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, of course, first arrived here as the ultimate
replacement player, in more than one sense of the word. He was, of
course, the widely ridiculed choice of Sox general manager Dan
Duquette to replace Mo Vaughn, which was a little like asking an
accordion player to replace Seiji Ozawa as conductor of the Boston
Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   While buried in the Mets' minor league system, Daubach had been
pressed into service to play as a replacement for the striking big
leaguers during spring training of 1995. For all the underdog
stories of the minor league lifer making it to the big time last
season, there was a subtext that rubbed some people raw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the whole story,'' Beck said. ``A lot of guys still
aren't over the strike. I have mixed feelings about it. I like
Dauber. He's a good dude. But that will be an issue he'll have to
deal with for the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, (ex-Sox pitcher) Mark Portugal treated him like
(expletive). It didn't matter that he was a good guy. A lot of guys
lost a lot of money during that thing, and a lot of guys lost a lot
of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm over it. It doesn't bother me so much. There were a lot of
guys lied to who were in (Daubach's) position. They were threatened
that they would never get back in the game if they didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big mess for everyone concerned. I think it was the
worst thing that ever happened to this game, but to dwell on it is
useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Better, instead, to savor the sweet taste left by Daubach's
dramatics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Rico Brogna's slam,'' said first-base coach Tommy
Harper, referring to last Monday's scene stealer. ``You can't
describe those feelings. When that game is over, and you know that
you don't have to go back out there, and the fans are just
delirious when that first ball goes out, two out in the ninth, and
the same man gets the winning hit with two outs two innings later,
that's got to be an unbelievable feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell you, because I never did that. But I've got to
imagine Dauber's feeling pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Nixon was pounding on Daubach in the midst of
another joyous postgame scrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's had such buzzard's luck for so long,'' Nixon said.
``You look at the scoreboard, and you think he hasn't been hitting
the ball hard at all. But he's been hitting the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really happy for Dauber. I told him before he went up
there, `Show him what you can do.' That's an inside joke we have
throughout the clubhouse. And that's what he did. He got a tough
pitch, and flared it out there.''

LABOR FALLS IN BEHIND GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Vice President Al Gore's huge postconvention bounce last
week, it appears that many rank-and-file union members have put
aside their disappointment over Gore's support of the China trade
bill and made his election a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's leap in the polls, which brought him from more than a
dozen points behind George W. Bush to six points ahead in one poll
and dead even with the Texas governor in other polls, is largely
attributed to his populist-oriented speech.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, whenever Gore mentioned working families _ which has
been organized labor's catchword for middle-class families
struggling in spite of the booming economy _ many union workers
felt Gore was talking to them. And, indeed, he was.
</P>
<P>
   As the polls have shown, Gore's support among males increased
significantly. No doubt much of that gain was from union workers
who had earlier expressed their displeasure over Gore's support for
the bill that would normalize trade relations with China despite
China's poor record on human and workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also expanded his lead over Bush among women (apparently
including working women) both single and married.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's ``fight for working families'' theme struck a chord
with union leaders and the rank and file. They know that a Bush
administration may try, legislatively, to weaken the strength and
effectiveness of unions. The GOP also knows union support of
candidates can make a difference not only in congressional races,
but also in the making of laws that can help or hurt unions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's bump in the polls also comes at the expense of the Green
Party's Ralph Nader. Before Gore's convention speech, Nader and his
populist approach, which included a strong stance against the China
trade bill, appeared to cut into Gore's Democratic base.
</P>
<P>
   But after Gore s speech, which included many of the populist
themes Nader has espoused, Nader's rankappeared to have temporarily
halted at 3 or 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Gore's boost among unions and working families was
helped when the UAW endorsed him almost immediately after he chose
Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate.
Ironically, Lieberman also supported the China trade bill, which
the UAW denounced as a threat to US jobs. However, Lieberman still
has a strong labor record, of which the UAW is aware.
</P>
<P>
   But the UAW, which had considered supporting Nader, apparently
decided to back the Gore-Lieberman ticket. They know that Nader,
despite his appealing themes, cannot become president. And
supporting Nader would serve only to help Bush win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's earlier endorsement of Gore, and its continued
backing of his candidacy even after he supported the China trade
bill, probably helped to keep much of the vice president's base
together up to the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has nearly his entire Democratic base intact and can now
reach out for the independents, whom he hopes will see him as the
one who best represents their views, their concerns, and their
futures. However, Gore knows _ as does Bush _ that the race is
still very close and could be decided by a few states.
</P>
<P>
   And, as former Governor Michael S. Dukakis found out in his
election battle with former President George Bush, who in turn
later found out in his battle with Clinton, that even a significant
lead in the polls during the late summer is no guarantee of a
victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past week, Gore has increased his standing in the
polls largely because rank-and-file union workers have decided to
stand with him. Now Gore can run for the White House with the
renewed and energetic wind of labor at his back.

BARGAINS ON CRUISE VACATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've thought of taking a cruise, the time to do so has
never been better.
</P>
<P>
   This year is seeing the largest influx of new ships since 1998,
and even more are expected in 2001 and 2002. With cruise capacity
growing and bookings softer than cruise lines expected, discounting
throughout the industry is rampant. It's the old story of supply
and demand: Supply is up, demand is down, and discounting is the
way to fill the ships.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're looking for a good deal, this is the year. Next
year may not be so great. ``I think the overall amount of
discounting seen in 2000 will dissipate'' in 2001, Rick James, a
Princess Cruises senior vice president, told a Florida panel
recently, according to Travel Weekly, a national trade publication.
The publication said he saw the lines promoting ``more aggressive
early-booking discounts'' as a marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   However, discounting cruise fares by one means or another should
be around for a while as long as there are more staterooms to fill
than passengers. Just as the sticker price on a new car is not the
final price, so to is the list price for a cruise. Most lines offer
early-booking discounts already that are far below the brochure
price. When shopping for a cruise, don't discount the luxury lines
_ you just may find luxury at the price of a lower-costcruise.
</P>
<P>
   While the buys on the seas are great, don't let price alone be
the reason for choosing one line or ship over another. The best
advice is to see a knowledgeable travel agent who can match your
interests and desires with the right ship.
</P>
<P>
   Many travel agencies now specialize in cruises only or have a
special cruise department with agents who have first-hand
experience on many cruises.
</P>
<P>
   World Wide Cruises in Florida offers a last-minute desk _ in the
cruise industry that can be anywhere from two days to six months
prior to sailing. To find out what some of these deals are,
consumers can call their hot line at 800-882-9000 or visit
www.wwcruises.com.
</P>
<P>
   The savings or discounting on upcoming cruises can vary greatly.
For example, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises is offering savings of up
to 50 percent off the second-guest fare and ``immediate desposit
rewards'' of up to $1,000 in shipboard credits for deposits secured
with a credit card at the time of booking on its Feb. 2, 2001 Grand
Circle South America 58-night voyage. Passengers have the
flexibility to choose one of four shorter segments or combine two
or more segments for savings up to $17,590 a couple on the full
cruise, as well as receiving complimentary first class air.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also offering two-for-one savings on fall
sailings of its Radisson Diamond from Europe and on four Caribbean
sailings as well as on its Paul Gauguin on its cruises of from
Tahiti.

Victory sets sail
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To experience the newest ship in the world, one just has to head
to New York City where the Carnival Victory will be offering a
series of four- and five-day eastern Canada cruises beginning Aug.
31. In late September, the ship will sail on one- to five-night
cruises from Newport News, Va., and Charleston, S.C., followed by a
program of seven-day alternating eastern and western Caribbean
cruises from Miami beginning Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction of the 102,000 ton Carnival Victory and
its 15,000-square foot health and fitness facilty, annual spa usage
on the line's 15-ship fleet is expected to top the million mark for
the first time. That means 50 percent of Carnival's nearly 2
million annual guests are expected to be using the health and
fitness facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exercising has become an important part of people's daily
lives _ even while on vacation _ and the Carnival Victory was
designed with today's health-conscious guests in mind, offering a
variety of sophisticated equipment and expansive facilites, along
with pampering treatments they otherwise might not indulge in back
home,'' said Bob Dickinson, Carnival president.

Irish cruise
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 10th annual Irish Festival Caribbean Cruise will be held
aboard the Holland America line's Westerdamn departing Fort
Lauderdale Jan. 19. More than 50 hours of traditional Celtic
entertainment from music to dance and culture will be featured as
the vessel cruises to six ports of call. And there will be daily
workshops on all things Irish, from learning to dance a jig to
instructions on the tin whistle. Guests are also encouraged to
socialize with the performers. The seven-day cruise cost from
$1,299 to $2,499 and can only be booked through Irish Festival
Cruises at 800-441-HARP.
</P>

7 days with Disney
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Cruise Line is now offering a seven-night Caribbean
cruise in addition to its three- and four-day sailings.
</P>
<P>
   While the Disney Wonder will continue to offer its combination
land-and-sea vacations that combine a three- or four-day cruise
with a three- or four-day stay at Disney World, the Disney Magic
expands the cruise experience with a cruise that offers three days
at sea, and three ports of call _ St. Maarten, St. Thomas, and
Disney's own isle, Castaway Cay.
</P>
<P>
   For its seven-day cruise, Disney has created a new show, C'est
Magique, that combines magic, stagecraft, and sensational
illusions. ``We have taken clasic magic to a level never before
seen,''said Cliff Perry, Disney Cruise's entertainment director.
</P>
<P>
   Just as on the shorter cruises, the Magic will offer rotation
dining, where guests and their waiters move from themed dining room
to themed dining room. In addition there will be special dinners
including a ``It's a Small World'' one with dishes from throughout
the world. For adults, the Palo specialty restaurant will open
during days for champagne brunch and afternoon tea. There's even a
midnight buffet behind kitchen galley doors.
</P>
<P>
   During days at sea the Magic features a new themed approach to
adult programming through conversations with experts in nautical
lore, entertaining, and Disney heritage. And for children there are
30 new programs and activities keyed to ages 3 to 4, 5 to 7, 8 to
9, and 10 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Both ships feature a visit to Castaway Cay where the ships dock
and passengers can walk ashore rather than take a tender in as on
other lines; a nighttime entertainment area just for adults, nearly
a deck of children's programming, original Disney shows, and
first-run Disney films and animated classics in the theater.

   BOSTON _ When naming their three black boys, Michelle and Alan
Shaw chose words that would underscore treasured roots and
religion: Chinua, Nigerian for God's own blessing; Yesuto, Ghanaian
for belongs to Jesus; and Obasi, Nigerian for in honor of God.
</P>
<P>
   So, when it came to selecting the best school for their boys,
the Dorchester couple _ she an attorney with a Harvard law degree,
he a computer expert with a master's and doctorate from MIT _ took
the same care.
</P>
<P>
   Home, they decided, was the best place to teach their children
strong academics, religious values, and instill their own sense of
ethnic pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``For black people in this country, there is a need for not
letting our kids forget their history,'' saidAlan Shaw, whose sons
are 3, 6, and 7. ``We shouldn't look to something that's been
designed by the state as a way for us to teach our kids about their
past and their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a desire to rescue their children from academic
failure and neglect at the hands of overburdened public schools and
determined to weave tight-knit families, more African-Americans and
other minorities nationwide are deciding that when it comes to
school, there's no place like home.
</P>
<P>
   This, even as they are accused of abandoning the very public
school system that for decades minorities who fought to overcome
separate and unequal education have been told is the ticket up and
out of oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them have recognized that academically the public
school system has not saved them,'' said Brian Ray, president of
the National Home Education Research Institute, a nonprofit based
in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no concrete figures, anecdotally, experts say
there is a growing diversity in homeschooling. Single parents are
venturing into it, and it is proving to be a sanctuary for many
interracial couples. In the past, homeschooling has been a choice
made mostly by white, middle-income families who could afford
setting themselves apart from the traditional educational system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homeschooling has now become so prevalent that it has gotten
to the point where it is not seen as wacky or nutty,'' Ray said.
``So it makes it easier for minorities to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that there about 1.3 to 1.7 million K-12
homeschooled children nationwide, about 1 percent of those black
and a lesser percentage Hispanic. ``I think over the next five
years, you're going to see real growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid expansion and growth in use of the Internet also has
meant plenty of inexpensive resources for homeschoolers, easing
some socioeconomic barriers. A book written in 1996, ``Freedom
Challenge: African American Homeschoolers,'' even features essays
by 15 families that serve as a road map.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in homeschooling is growing so much that Joyce and
Eric Burges of Baker, La., are creating a national networking group
that encourages African-Americans to homeschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I want to put a beacon of light out there that
says this is an option, this is a choice you have,'' said Joyce
Burges, an executive secretary who homeschools three children.
Missy and Rick Parker, who have been homeschooling for 16 years,
created a similar group in 1994 in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of commitment,'' said Missy Parker, a Southern
Baptist who homeschools to teach religious values. She estimates
that at least 200 African-American families in Detroit are
homeschooling. ``Most African-Americans wouldn't venture to do it
because they didn't feel they were equipped. But, that's what the
support group is for, so you don't have to do it on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeschooling, however, doesn't come without challenges or
criticisms as any family, black or white, knows. These include fear
of the unknown, lack of support from relatives and friends,
financial belt-tightening and questions about the legitimacy of
homeschooling.
</P>
<P>
   And for African-Americans the accusation of black flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that we take away from the public schools, especially
in the cities has a detrimental effect,'' said Steven C. Leonard,
headmaster of the Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester. ``I
would much rather have minority parents, black parents, all
parents, fight to strengthen the public shcool systems because like
it or not that's where the bulk of the students who compose our
future will be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   Other African-American educators believe students lose something
when parents chose to school at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great benefits of public schooling is that we teach
people, children how to both ask for help from others as well as to
give help to others who need it,'' said Charles Willie, a Harvard
professor emeritus and one of the designers of Boston public
school's controlled-choice assignment plan. ``These are valuable
learnings that are difficult to replace in an isolated learning
environment''
</P>
<P>
   Still, minorities are choosing to homeschool for reasons as
diverse as the ways in which they are teaching their children.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like the Shaws, say the public school system is failing
African-American children, who often end up at the bottom of
achievement assessments. Results by race on the 1999 Massachusetts
Comprehensive Assessment System showed black and Latino students
behind whites in every category for every grade.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Shaws point to a 1997 study by Ray and the Home
School Legal Defense Association showing less of a disparity
between achievement rates in math and reading among minority and
white homeschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lamenting the loss of close-knit black communities,
some parents say homeschooling allows them to fortify their
children in nuturing environments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This early stage is critical to establishing what is
important, what we believe in,'' said Alan Shaw, a computer
consultant who works from home.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Kevin Brooks, a divorced father in Arlington, say
they are homeschooling to compensate for school systems that allow
too many children to fall through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, a researcher for Motorola, pulled his 14-year-old son
Kristoff out of public school in February when he found he was
spending hours trying to help his son through course work the youth
should have already mastered. This year, Brooks also plans to
homeschool Kristoff's twin sister.
</P>
<P>
   He uses a network of friends, black and white, to help teach
Kristoff. ``One of my challenges, and it will increase, is feeling
comfortable having someone who isn't black talk to my kids about
issues of race one-on-one,'' said Brooks, who shares custody with
his formerwife.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent homeschooling session, one of Brook's white
friends and Kristoff had a complex conversation on how black people
are sometimes portrayed negatively in cartoons. It taught Brooks a
lesson: ``When you are learning from the world, outside the
classroom system, you are exposed to more things,'' he said. ``So
talking about stuff is a lot more important now.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment that Beverley Foreman, a Jamaica native, set
foot in this country in 1976, she had trouble with traditional
schools. It started with her youngest son, who at 5 was already at
a second-grade level, able to read and write in cursive. Here, he
was placed in kindergarten and put in a corner to play with blocks,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became so distracted and disinterested in school,'' she
said, and watched as he was bused out of his community to a school
with special needs students, and told her son might have attention
deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually graduated high school, but after that Foreman
pulled her other children out of public schools. The Maynard mother
of four boys was ``terrified'' when she began homeschooling seven
years ago, but she got over her fear and is still homeschooling her
youngest son using libraries and museums as classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The teachable moments, insist the families, proves it is worth
it over and over again. The Shaws, for example, were there when one
son assumed God was white. They told him God has no color but
people generally project on Him an image with which they identify.
</P>
<P>
   And while it was their parents' choice, some minority homeschool
children also applaud the move.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Burges, 15, values the one-on-one attention. ``If I were
in school now, the average teacher has to teach about 30 kids in
one classroom. With my mom, it's only three,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And self-esteem, Burges said, is nurtured at home. ``Sometimes
African-American students are underestimated in school and they are
teased and people really don't know who they really are,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Shaw, who attended public schools, says he never envisioned
homeschooling his children. But, back in college he was one to go
against the grain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been hoping there would be some alternative to
mainstream life,'' Shaw said. He found it at home.

STUDENT ADVANTAGE SAID TO BE BUYING OUT RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Student Advantage Inc. of Boston, a leading online service for
college students, is expected to announce a deal to buy most of the
assets of its troubled top competitor CollegeClub.com, according to
people familiar with the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, due this week, will make Student Advantage the
overwhelming leader in a higher education market targeted by more
than a dozen start-ups and millions in venture-capital funding over
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Student Advantage's fee-based service counts 2.1 million
students as members nationwide. CollegeClub.com, based in San
Diego, is used by 2.9 million registered students at 3,600 college
and university campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Though CollegeClub managed to attract a huge student following,
it was driven to serious financial trouble in the process. The
company filed for Chapter 11 bankrupty protection Monday, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisition of CollegeClub assets will be subject to the
approval of a Bankruptcy Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Student Advantage has agreed to pay about $20 million in cash
and stock to acquire CollegeClub's Web site and other intellectual
property. It also will assume some of the company's revenue
contracts, including a relationship with General Motors Corp. The
company had purchased the assets of another CollegeClub subsidiary,
eStudentLoan LLC, for $1 million last month.
</P>
<P>
   Student Advantage has secured a $10 million financing commitment
from FleetBoston Financial Corp. to help fund the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   CollegeClub executives could not be reached Monday. A Student
Advantage spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   CollegeClub is another example of the fast-changing fortunes of
consumer-oriented Internet companies. Though its assets are selling
at bargain-basement prices, CollegeClub had been contemplating an
$85 million initial public stock offering just two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company pulled its IPO registration in June, when chief
executive and cofounder Michael Pousti resigned. CollegeClub's
chief operating officer, James DeBello, quit soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Student Advantage has built a larger and more predictable
business by charging student members $20 per year and forging
relationships with big corporations and universities themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Card-carrying members pay for exclusive student discounts,
mostly available offline at stores and restaurants, as well as
access to information and services on Student Advantage's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The company has relationships with 50 national retailers,
including AT&AMP;T, Amtrak, Tower Records, and Staples Inc. It also
maintains retail discount relationships with 15,000 local
participating stores in 125 cities across the country. Student
Advantage sometimes is paid a percentage of any increase in
student-discount business the national retailers receive as a
result of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Other national sponsors, such as AT&AMP;T, buy membership cards in
bulk and distribute them to students as customer premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Student Advantage, founded eight years ago by former Bain
Capital executive Ray Sozzi, was just one company in a crowd of
competitors trying to use the Internet to reach students in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation and financial struggles have whittled the field
down to just a few public competitors.
</P>
<P>
   CollegeClub became one of the young industry's leading
consolidators, acquiring College
</P>
<P>
   student.com, Versity.com, eStudentLoan.com, Izio.com, and
Campus24.com in just the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Student Advantage acquired two competitors in the last year,
College411 and Scholaraid.
</P>
<P>
   Other surviving public competitors have been struggling in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of YouthStream Media Networks Inc. have lost more than 88
percent of their value so far this year. It bought Acton-based
Teen.com for $5.4 million in stock last month.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Washington-based Varsity Group Inc., which went public
at $10 each in February, traded below $1 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Student Advantage has hardly been immune from stock market
problems. It went public at $8 per share in June 1999, and the
stock peaked at $28 in December. But those shares have tumbled to
as low as $3.0625 this year and finshed Monday at $7.0625.

PILOTS SAY BETTER OXYGEN MASKS COULD SAVE LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AirTran Airways DC-9 made an emergency landing on Aug. 8 in
Greensboro, N.C., when smoke filled the cockpit about 10 minutes
after takeoff and spread into the passenger compartment.
</P>
<P>
   As the flight crew struggled to bring the airplane with 61
people on board back to Greensboro, their ability to see outside
the plane as well as to view critical cockpit gauges was hampered
by thick smoke, sources close to an investigation of the incident
say. The crew not only had to fly the plane and locate the source
of the smoke, they also had to put on cumbersome oxygen masks to
cover their noses and mouths as well as don and adjust smoke
goggles.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of time, attention, and coordination required to put
on the oxygen masks and smoke goggles has been an issue with pilots
since at least 1996, when a ValuJet DC-9 crashed in Florida,
killing all 110 on board. After the accident, ValuJet became
AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are dealing with all that, it means you can't be
doing anything else _ like flying the airplane,'' said Paul
McCarthy, the Air Line Pilots Association's safety chairman. The
union represents more than 50,000 pilots at major airlines, but not
AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent incident involving AirTran has received scant
attention in the press. But safety officials say privately it is a
prime example of the need for improved masks for cockpit crews
fighting smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots say that there is a much better safety system. Full face
masks, which are form fitting, can be put on with one hand in
seconds and provide oxygen and clear air around the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   With a handful of exceptions, virtually every major carrier,
however, still uses the two-piece set with an oxygen mask for the
mouth and separate goggles for the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those masks go back to ancient technology,'' said John Mazor,
a spokesman for the airline pilots' union. ``Their primary job is
to deliver oxygen and not keep out smoke and fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the two-piece set requires both hands to put on and
adjust and takes as long as 15 seconds to put on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when the cockpit is filling with smoke, seconds
count,'' said Mazor.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots say that smoke in the cockpit is the most urgent
emergency in flight because it can easily get out of control,
options are limited, and time is critical.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, 1998, Swissair Flight 111, an MD-11, crashed off the
coast of Nova Scotia with 231 on board. The pilot reported smoke in
the cockpit and was circling to dump fuel before attempting to land
in Halifax. Everyone on board the jet died.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines, which at the time code-shared with Swissair,
announced last year that it would begin retrofitting its entire
600-airplane fleet with one-piece masks that have a communication
system inside and are large enough to fit over prescription
eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for United Airlines said its Airbus aircraft have
the full face masks, and the airline is putting the newer masks on
all of its planes, a procedure that is expected to be completed by
the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration requires equipment for
breathing and protecting eyes in the event of smoke in the cockpit,
but has not required a particular design.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates all
aviation accidents in the United States and makes safety
recommendations to the FAA and airlines based on its
investigations, concluded in the wake of the 1996 ValuJet crash
that the system of an oxygen mask and smoke goggles is cumbersome.
The safety board recommended that the FAA ``establish a performance
standard for the rapid donning of smoke goggles; then ensure that
all carriers meet this standard through improved smoke goggle
equipment, improved flight crew training, or both.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for American and Continental airlines said their
planes are equipped with the two-piece masks. A US Airways
spokesman said the airline's fleet is split with some planes having
two-piece masks and others having full face masks.
</P>
<P>
   Tad Hutcheson, a spokesman for AirTran, said the airline's 12
newer airplanes, Boeing 717s, have full face masks, but the fleet
of 35 DC-9 aircraft does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things our safety department is evaluating right
now is whether to convert the DC-9 mask to a full face mask,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The AirTran flight took off from Greensboro on Aug. 8 bound for
Atlanta. When the plane was 15 miles from the airport and climbing
through 7,000 feet, the first officer smelled smoke and seconds
later the captain smelled it.
</P>
<P>
   They declared an emergency, shut down the main electrical power,
and returned to Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I heard the sound of the engines make like a
drastic slowdown,'' said passenger Clarence Thompson of Chicago.
``It was very unusual because we were still cimbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started banking,'' said Thompson. ``I was on the left side
of the plane, in row 20 by the window, and all I could see was
ground and I thought `we are going down.' About a minute later, the
pilot comes on and said we have to return to the airport. He never
came back on again. The next thing we heard was the flight
attendants telling us to put our heads down. I looked up one last
time and saw smoke in the front of the plane. I was sure we were
going to crash.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed and turned onto a taxiway and stopped, its tail
sticking out on the active runway. Using emergency slides and
over-wing emergency exits, everyone got out safely. The copilot was
one of four AirTran employees treated at a local hospital for smoke
inhalation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew did a good job getting the aircraft back. If the
weather was bad or they were a little further out, the outcome
would have been a lot different,'' said a federal transportation
official familiar with the investigation of the incident.

&HT;     RISON ARRIVES IN OAKLAND WITH AN ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE ADAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ Never mind what you have heard about Andre
Rison. The wide receiver is nothing like the trouble-maker you've
read about, say friends and former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a guy that, despite what the media might believe, is
very much a team football player,'' said Oakland Raiders
quarterback Rich Gannon, who played with Rison on the Kansas City
Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The two are teammates again. The Raiders signed Rison Monday,
following the 11-year player's release by the Chiefs last week.
</P>
<P>
   On his flight to Oakland on Sunday night, Rison said he turned
to a Raiders fan sitting behind him and said, ``You can't hate me
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Rison is a five-time Pro Bowl player. He has 702 catches for
9,599 yards and 78 touchdowns. He also has been involved in
questionable off-field incidents and has sometimes been accused of
causing trouble in the locker room. During training camp with the
Chiefs in Wisconsin this year, he was cited for failing to identify
himself to a police officer. He also goes on trial next month on
charges of stealing a $1,000 tape recorder. Four years ago his
girlfriend, singer Lisa ``Left Eye'' Lopes set fire to his house
after a domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy that likes to do his own thing, from what I know
about him,'' said wide receiver Tim Brown, who said he and Rison
were friends. ``As long as he does his own thing on the field,
that's all I care about. And, hey, this is the Raiders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to judge him for ourselves,'' coach Jon Gruden
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a new home, a new environment,'' Rison said. ``I've got
a new lease on life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rison spent the past three years with the Chiefs. The Raiders
are his seventh team.
</P>
<P>
   Gruden would not be specific about what role Rison will play
with the Raiders, other than to note that Brown and James Jett
remained the team's starting wideouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to overstate anything right now,'' Gruden said.
``We'll see what happens in the next couple weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But players were doing plenty of speculating on how the talented
receiver might help diversify the Raiders' passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he lines up wide by himself on one side and me and James
Jett are on the other side, they can't just say that's another
guy,'' Brown said. ``That's Andre Rison over there. Of course he
has to go out and make some plays, but I think his name is going to
carry a lot of weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Rickey Dudley also was pleased with Rison's addition.
``I've got to believe it's for the better,'' he said, noting the
challenge defensive secondaries will face in covering him and the
three wide receivers. ``Somebody is going to have a mismatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Gannon said the Raiders were unlikely to move too far from their
basic run game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've invested a great deal of time and money into two great
football players in (running backs) Napoleon Kaufman and Tyrone
Wheatley, and you don't want to abandon that and say we're going to
start throwing the football all the time now,'' Gannon said. ``But
we threw the ball quite a bit last year and we were productive, and
we can be a little more aggressive and effective this year. But
we're still going to run the football.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have been looking for another receiver since Terry
Mickens was lost indefinitely due to a bruised spinal column.
</P>
<P>
   Rison said even though he was contacted by several teams, he
knew he would become a Raider as soon as he was cut in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my mind made up,'' he said, noting the Raiders and the
Chiefs ran similar offenses. ``But they run it to perfection
here.''
</P>
<P>
   After going to the Super Bowl with the Green Bay Packers and to
the playoffs with the Atlanta Falcons, Rison said he was hoping to
add a winning edge to the Raiders. ``My biggest thing I'm bringing
here,'' he said, ``is I want this team to have an attitude. . . .
No one beats us.''

STARS DISH IT OUT BUT CAN'T TAKE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most neutral observers have absolved Tampa Bay's Mamadou ``Big
Mama'' Diallo of blame in the collision that resulted in
season-ending injuries to MetroStars goalkeeper Mike Ammann last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the MetroStars continue to accuse Diallo of ``malicious''
intent in the incident, which left Ammann with three broken ribs, a
punctured lung, and facial cuts. Though MLS has cleared Diallo,
MetroStars general manager Nick Sakiewicz threatened to take the
matter to another level _ either the US Soccer Federation, FIFA, or
the US courts.
</P>
<P>
   And after the MetroStars' 5-3 win over Colorado Saturday,
defender Mike Petke revealed a T-shirt that promised revenge.
Petke, it should be noted, had been assigned to mark Diallo, who
scored three goals in the Mutiny's 4-3 overtime victory over the
MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   MLS vice president Ivan Gazidis planned to address the situation
in a conference call Tuesday. He has likely placed a gag order on
the MetroStars and should stick by the decision not to punish
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diallo might have been a little reckless or clumsy,'' a league
spokesman said Monday. ``But the intent to injure wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars' protests seem somewhat shrill. They have
reversed their on-field fortunes this season, improving from a
dispirited team to one that could contend for the MLS Cup title.
They also have developed a reputation for overly aggressive play.
</P>
<P>
   Petke, for instance, was recently spotlighted on the ESPN Extra
Time show for a dangerous, studs-up challenge. Commentator Alexi
Lalas correctly analyzed Petke's play as brainless, though it was
also destructive in intent. In fact, such tackles occur in more
sophisticated leagues only in extreme cases; yet Petke made the
tackle in the final minutes with his team leading, 4-1. Even more
alarming, Petke proclaimed his innocence after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Also disturbing are reports that Sakiewicz previously offered to
compensate MetroStars players who had been fined for overly
aggressive play. And MetroStars defenders are certainly encouraged
to be destructive; MetroStars press releases refer to the team's
``defensive backfield,'' a football term that connotes a propensity
for colliding with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern that emerges is that the MetroStars are not
uninterested in being involved in rough play, motivated partially
because they wanted to prove they would not be as dysfunctional as
in '99.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of Petke's tackles are well-timed, and his
positioning is good. Petke is a very competent defender who could
become a US national team candidate, but to encourage him to be
brutish is doing him a disservice.
</P>
<P>
   A final word about rough play, then.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous incident in high-level soccer in the US in
recent years occurred July 4, 1994, at Palo Alto, Calif. Brazilian
midfielder Leonardo delivered an elbow that nearly killed Tabare
Ramos, who is now a MetroStars midfielder. MLS would be wise to
draw the line on gratuitous violence now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Olympic choices solid
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The choice of players for the US Olympic team was made long ago
by coach Clive Charles. The team has played together for two years
and had success, and Charles was not about to break up a group that
had developed loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   There are questions about some of the choices, especially the
naming of Bayer Leverkusen's Frankie Hejduk as an overage player.
</P>
<P>
   The other over-23 players, Jeff Agoos and Chris Armas, should
bring stability.
</P>
<P>
   But Hejduk, despite being potentially more talented, does not
seem to be what the team needs. Some observers blame Hejduk for
costing the US in its first two World Cup qualifying matches last
month. In a 1-1 tie in Guatemala, Hejduk did not kill the clock and
wasted crosses with the US leading in the final minutes. And in a
2-1 loss at Costa Rica, Hejduk's wild tackle in the penalty area
led to a likely makeup call and Hernan Medford's deciding goal in
the 93d minute.
</P>
<P>
   Charles also is faithful to the central defensive duo of the
Revolution's Brian Dunseth and Tampa Bay's Chad McCarty. Chicago's
Carlos Bocanegra seems to be a viable challenger for position but
was not included.
</P>
<P>
   But a more fundamental problem with the team was noted by Soccer
America columnist Paul Gardner in a brilliant analysis that traced
the roots of Charles's selections to Portland, Ore., and East
London. During the NASL heyday, the Portland Timbers became a huge
success by importing mostly workmanlike players from England. The
Timbers had success on the field, the players were active in the
community, and general manager Don Paul (a former Cleveland Browns
player) responded to critics who said the game needed to be
Americanized:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're filling the stands with Americans _ that's how we're
Americanizing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles, who had played for West Ham United, was among those
players. Charles has been successful as a collegiate coach and he
has chosen some excellent players on this Olympic team. But, as
Gardner notes, the players who will thrive in Charles's system will
likely be heavy on physicality and light on fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   If soccer is to progress in the US, creativity must be
encouraged. There are hundreds of thousands of excellent athletic
specimens involved in soccer in the US. Unless we want to watch
them running around in circles for the next decade, they are going
to have to be placed in situations where their imagination and
intuition can thrive. For Gardner, this means encouraging Hispanic
involvement. And those aware of the changing demographics of the
Western Hemisphere would likely agree.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whither Baggio?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The potential savior of MLS is currently training by himself in
the small town of Caldogno in the Veneto region of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But the league is unlikely to pursue Roberto Baggio, even though
he is not with a team and likely has no real future in Italy's
Serie A.
</P>
<P>
   Baggio, 33, is far from finished. Several European and Japanese
teams are bidding for him, and Udinese seems likely to sign him for
$2 million-$2.5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Baggio was the star of the game for the FIFA
World All-Stars in Marseille, France. Incredibly, though, no
top-level Italian teams can fit Baggio into their plans, partially
because they believe he has overvalued his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Inter coach Marcello Lippi benched Baggio for nearly the entire
1999-2000 season, though Baggio reemerged to lead the team to a
Coppa Italia title, and Lippi has said he has no plans for Baggio
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Sconcerti, an admitted Baggio backer, urged him to face
reality in an article titled, ``Give Me a Half Hour of Baggio,'' in
Guerin Sportivo magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baggio is a great player but not for more than a half-hour,''
Sconcerti wrote. ``That is not faint praise. A half-hour is a very
long time on the field. Only special players can fully capitalize
on that time. In the last 30 minutes of the game, when the other
players are tired, there is probably not another player in the
world who can make the difference like Baggio.''

JOSTLE PUSHES HER RIVALS OUT OF THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All season, the 3-year-old colts received the lion's share of
attention. While every move made by Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet
was chronicled, the sophomore fillies were all but ignored.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the real head-to-head battle in the 3-year-old
ranks wasn't between Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus and Red
Bullet, who met only when Red Bullet prevailed in the Preakness,
but between females Secret Status and Jostle, who fought it out
three times, with underdog Jostle emerging as the leader of the
division.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Status, a daughter of A.P. Indy, established her
credentials by winning the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs, while
Jostle, a daughter of Brocco, showed promise by taking the
Black-Eyed Susan at Pimlico. Secret Status struck the first blow in
the rivalry when she defeated Jostle by more than 2 lengths in the
Mother Goose at Belmont July 1. Regularly ridden by Pat Day, Secret
Status was 3-5 in the Mother Goose, run at 1 1/8 miles, while
Jostle, whose jockey is Mike Smith, was dismissed at 18-1.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting set up the Coaching Club American Oaks at Belmont
July 22. The Coaching Club is raced at a demanding 1 1/2 miles, and
Jostle, at 5-2, went all the way in front to defeat Secret Status,
who could do no better than third (behind Resort) at 2-5.
</P>
<P>
   The rubber match came Saturday in the $750,000 Alabama at
Saratoga, and while the bettors stuck with Secret Status, off at
4-5, Jostle proved much the best, winning by nearly 4 lengths at
7-2 ($9.50 to win). The time for the 1 1/4 miles was a slow 2:04
3/5 over a track that was officially labeled ``fast'' but had been
made heavy by frequent rain.
</P>
<P>
   After Jostle, who is trained by John Servis, went gate-to-wire
in the Coaching Club, Neil Howard, who trains Secret Status,
entered a rabbit, Valleydar, especially purchased to ensure an
honest pace in the Alabama. Valleydar did take the lead (before
fading to last) under Aaron Gryder, but she established such
dawdling fractions (:24 for a quarter, :48 3/5 for a half) over the
dull surface that the tactic was ineffective. Jostle stalked the
pace for a mile, put a head in front turning for home, and ran away
through the stretch. Secret Status, who was headstrong early, also
followed the pace, but had to fight hard to secure the place by a
head over 7-1 shot Spain and Jorge Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised that she won as easily as she did,''
said Servis. ``I thought Secret Status would be real tough at a
mile and one-quarter, but Jostle just keeps getting better. As far
as the 3-year-old filly championship goes, I don't know what else
you could ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The race unfolded like I picture in my mind,'' said Smith.
``Jostle proved that she would have no problems rating off the
pace, and I actually think she's a better horse when she does
rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama was a bitter blow to the connections of Secret
Status, who felt her loss in the Coaching Club was attributable
mostly to the vagaries of the pace scenario in a 12-furlong race,
which often allows front-runners to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Secret Status ran OK,'' said Howard. ``She might
have been closer to the pace than I would have wanted, but I don't
think that was any fault on the jockey's part. I really don't know
what happened. I'll have to figure it out. But Jostle is a nice
filly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Secret Status's kick was not effective because of the way she
was in the first turn,'' said Day. ``She was a little bit on the
bridle, a little bit too eager.''

   Fusaichi Pegasus has not run since the Preakness in May, and Red
Bullet, who is now out of the upcoming Travers at Saratoga because
of a lingering virus, has not run since the Dwyer in July. While
the boys are being held under wraps, the girls have been fighting
it out.
</P>
<P>
   Which contender is the leading 3-year-old colt: Fusaichi
Pegasus, Red Bullet, or Dixie Union, who won the Haskell at
Monmouth? We don't know because thay haven't run enough. What we do
know is that Jostle is the top filly. That's what happens when
racehorses actually race.

   Everything seemed fine that spring afternoon as Capt. Ken Blyth
watched over the loading of his ship in Singapore. He was
skippering the Petro Ranger, a medium-size tanker with a $1.5
million cargo of jet fuel and diesel oil bound for Ho Chi Minh
City. It was a three-day turnaround. No big deal. After it was
over, he'd fly back to his home in Queensland, Australia, to
celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary the following week with his
wife, Denise.
</P>
<P>
   When the Petro Ranger finally slipped its berth, it was just
another cargo vessel amid the daily parade that makes Singapore the
busiest port in the world. Not far outside the harbor is the
Horsburgh Lighthouse, the last outpost of domestic law. From
Horsburgh on, you pass into the only true frontier of the 21st
century: international waters _ the no-man's land of the new world
economy. Not technically owned or patrolled by anyone, these waters
are the last place on earth where you are truly alone.
</P>
<P>
   That night, a Malaysian sailor of Indian extraction was the
officer of the watch, but instead of performing his duties, he
tuned the shortwave to his favorite Indian music station and didn't
pay attention to the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 1 a.m., the blue speedboat opened its engines.
Cruising straight up the wake, without any threat of detection, it
pulled up to the ship's stern. There were 12 pirates on board _ as
multicultural as their 18th-century avatars: seven Indonesians,
three Malaysians and two Thais. They had learned the layout of the
ship beforehand and moved with feline grace. Securing bamboo
ladders to the stern, the men scrambled to the main deck and leapt
upon the outside ladder of the accommodation housing, climbing five
stories to the open bridge. Dressed in jeans and T-shirts and with
balaclavas pulled over their faces, they appeared in the bridge's
doorway. They were armed with machetes. The officer of the watch
panicked and fled the chart room by a back exit. The lookout was
overtaken in a struggle that thumped the floor loudly enough to
awaken the captain below.
</P>
<P>
   Blyth sat up in the dark, thinking perhaps that someone on the
bridge had been drinking. Suddenly, he was startled by the sound of
a loud banging at his door. Instinctively, he unlocked it. The door
blew open. Four hooded pirates waving machetes rushed in. A fifth
pirate stepped forward with a gun. He put the barrel to Blyth's
head and ordered the captain to place his hands in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates bound Blyth with boat lacing. He would remain bound
for the next 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have burn marks on my wrists,'' Blyth, 55, a tall,
blue-eyed Scot, recently told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pirates wanted me to go around with the master key _ the
one the captain has to unlock any door _ and round up the crew,''
Blyth recalled of that April 17, 1998, night. ``The idea was that I
would knock on the door, tell them not to worry and not to do
anything silly. Then the pirates would tell them to get their hands
out and tie them up.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, every crew member, except for the officer of the
watch and an engineer who accompanied two pirates to the engine
room, was taken and dumped in the captain's day room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they took me to the bridge,'' Blyth continued. ``I was
still tied up, and then they taped my arms and legs to the chair.
They didn't understand how to turn off the automatic pilot, and the
pirates were baffled by touch-screen computerized piloting. So I
said, 'If you're going to kill me anyway, why should I help?'''
Then one of the head pirates told Blyth something that convinced
him: the names of his wife and two daughters _ and their street
address.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates unbound Blyth long enough for him to alter course,
taking the Petro Ranger far from the regularly trafficked corridors
of international shipping and into the maritime equivalent of a
dark alley. By the time the pirates retaped him to the chair, the
ship was still steaming northward but no longer on a course for
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates had taped over the portholes, but the captain once
saw through a crack in the tape over the bathroom porthole that the
bottom half of his ship's identifying blue funnel had been painted
red. And could he have seen the stern, he would have found that the
Petro Ranger no longer existed. He was now aboard the ``Wilby,''
just another vessel bobbing along without notice in international
sea lanes. Over the next several days, changes in the weather and
the flies buzzing in through the vents were enough to convince
Blyth that they were nearing the China coast. Blyth theorized that
the pirates intended to meet some black-market tankers to offload
the fuel cargo. They would need Blyth and his crew to help make
that transfer. But then what?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Piracy's Rivival &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Piracy on the high seas resurfaced in the mid-1980s and in
recent years has ratcheted up to a true crisis both for shippers
and recreational yachtsmen. In 1989, there were 48 acts of piracy
reported around the world; in 1999, there were 285. So far this
year, it's up by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of piracy's revival is no different from its
appearance centuries ago. Ships serving the top trading nations
(England, Holland and Spain in the old days; America, Germany and
Japan now) are transiting through a global geography of poverty,
envy and desperation. Often these vessels are carrying on board a
king's ransom of commodities _ no longer cinnamon, indigo and flax,
but jet fuel, alkali and aluminum ingots _ all easily
black-marketed into quick money.
</P>
<P>
   Modern piracy ranges from desperate fishermen pulling off petty
larcenies at sea to highly organized syndicates slaughtering crews
to steal multimillion-dollar vessels. Today's pirates are a
troubling symptom of a new world order, one shaped by a fierce
Darwinian struggle in the feral markets of modern international
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Most piracy is of the mugging-at-sea variety. The pirates just
zip up in a speedboat, point a rocket launcher at the hull and
demand money. Lately it has been getting a little rougher. Last
January, an Australian couple were sailing around the world. In the
Gulf of Aden off Yemen, a small powerboat pulled up beside the
couple's catamaran; a burst of machine-gun fire tore through the
hull, wounding the wife. Four pirates boarded the boat, ripped out
some high-tech communications equipment, then left.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, more ambitious pirates realize that stealing some
watches and shipboard cash is small stakes when you're dealing with
a huge vessel carrying cargo worth millions. Often the pirates will
contract with black marketeers to hawk the cargo. And they also
want the ship. This may mean repainting it at sea, obtaining fake
registration papers and then selling it or just using it themselves
to become seemingly legitimate shippers. This process, known as
phantom shipping, is costly and dangerous, requiring serious
planning and organization.
</P>
<P>
   The more sophisticated forms of piracy are carried out by
Southeast Asian syndicates and Chinese triads. According to a 1998
report on piracy published by the International Chamber of
Commerce, the corporate-style organization of the syndicates is
impressive: ships can ``be hijacked to order in the Philippines for
about $300,000 and delivered within three days.''
</P>
<P>
   The global reaction to the piracy revival has been, by all
accounts, slow. So the pirates aren't too scared. Ships disappear
pretty regularly and with impunity. Once a ship has been captured,
the crew faces one of two fates. In the case of the tanker Global
Mars, which was seized by pirates last Feb. 23, the 17 crewmen were
bound and blindfolded before being set off in lifeboats. But the 21
crew members of the Hualien No. 1, which disappeared with a cargo
of river sand last Feb. 28, have never turned up and are now
presumed dead. Most seamen know such stories. They hear them and
can't believe it will ever happen to them. Ken Blyth was certainly
thinking about them when one of the junior pirates told him that
their leader wished to see him at once.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Pirate King &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blyth was escorted to his own day room, where the pirates had
set up their headquarters. The pirate king was 49 years old, a
well-educated and heavyset Indonesian of medium height. He spoke
four or five languages, including grammatically perfect English.
The pirate king's name, Blyth would learn, was Herman.
</P>
<P>
   The two men sat down and had a cup of coffee. Blyth was
surprised that Herman wanted to chat a little. ``The impression I
got,'' Blyth told me, ``was that having achieved what he had done _
the Petro Ranger was the most modern tanker he'd swiped _ he would
have loved to phone up CNN and say, 'Look what I pulled off.' He
was so exhilarated he wanted to share it with someone. I was the
only one around who could possibly appreciate what he'd done.''
</P>
<P>
   The syndicate he worked for, Herman explained, had five men in
leadership positions: one each from China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore. He claimed that they had ``inside access''
to Petroships, the shipping company. They knew that the Petro
Ranger would be sailing with a simple commodity _ fuel _ easily
fungible on the black market. They knew the date of embarkation.
They knew all about Blyth and most of the crew. Herman had all the
documents he would need: registration for the ``Wilby,'' papers
that identified Herman as the legitimate captain along with his
crew and bills of lading identifying the cargo on board as part of
a legitimate charter.
</P>
<P>
   Blyth was returned to his mattress, quite impressed by the
extent of Herman's operation. One thing worried him, though. Why
would Herman tell him all this if he didn't also intend to kill
him?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Great Escape &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a week, Blyth realized time was running out. Somewhere at
sea, two tankers had pulled up alongside for cargo transfers. A
third tanker was delayed, Blyth learned. The Petro Ranger idled at
sea for several days. Then, on the 13th day of the crew's
captivity, one of the pirates made a huge mistake. With the third
tanker sailing around unable to find the ``Wilby,'' the No. 2
pirate called the tanker on the public VHF frequency. The Chinese
heard him.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, a Chinese patrol vessel stopped, boarded and
inspected the Petro Ranger. But Herman handled it smoothly. He
locked Blyth and a few of his men down below in crew cabins. He
presented papers indicating that he was the captain and passed off
both Blyth's legitimate sailors and his own henchmen as his crew.
(The pirates kept Blyth's crew in check by routinely reminding them
that they knew the whereabouts of their wives and families.)
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting a smuggling operation, the Chinese withdrew and
waited to see what might happen. When the third tanker did arrive,
the Chinese sped in, stopped both ships at sea, and escorted them
to Haikou harbor on the island of Hainan in southern China. Since
the Chinese were now convinced that the ``Wilby'' was a smuggling
ship, Herman quietly contacted his syndicate and got a lawyer to
facilitate the usual round robin of bribes. Blyth learned all this
from, of course, Herman, who enjoyed summoning the captain back to
the day room to boast about his caginess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I had to get to the Chinese,'' Blyth recalled, ``and
then I could only hope that I was in fact getting to the good guys,
the ones who weren't corrupt.'' With one of his crew members,
Saini, who spoke a little Mandarin, he arranged a midnight meeting
with a Chinese lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saini explained who I was,'' Blyth recalled, ``and I gave him
my passport and some Malaysian documents stating I had command of
the Petro Ranger, which the pirates had neglected to destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Chinese soldiers came to the ship and herded
first Herman and his ``officers'' and then nearly the entire mix of
pirates and legitimate crew onto their boat. Told they were simply
going ashore to sign documents granting port clearance, they easily
complied as 30 armed soldiers held their weapons at the ready.
Blyth then pointed at each man in turn, identifying him as either
pirate or crew.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trouble in Port &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the Chinese officials arrested the pirates, Blyth
was taken ashore and interrogated by two different law-enforcement
agencies: the People's Liberation Army, all dressed in green
outfits, and the Public Security Bureau, distinguished by khaki.
Days of repetitive interviews and odd accusations _ at one point, a
PSB official suggested that Blyth had made the whole pirate thing
up _ gave the captain the impression his ship had become ensnared
in a major power play. The PLA was deeply concerned with how this
might look internationally (and were, therefore, sort of on Blyth's
side). The PSB, however, seemed more beholden to provincial powers
in southern China, which are widely suspected not only of
tolerating piracy but also of organizing it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Petroships retrieved its stolen ship _ but the
Chinese kept all of the remaining 5,100 tons of fuel, nearly half
the original cargo, as ``evidence'' before waiting some time and
selling it off.
</P>
<P>
   Petroships was luckier in some respects that the owners of the
Anna Sierra, which was ``saved'' from pirates by the Chinese in
1996. In that case, the cargo was sold and the authorities even
refused to permit the owners to reclaim the ship. Without care, it
took on water and to this day the ship remains beached in Beihai
harbor in southern China, a rusting monument to the inadequacy of
policing modern piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after Blyth went home, the Chinese authorities
quietly released Herman and all of his men. The Chinese have
refused to explain why they would let the pirates go, as they have
done repeatedly in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my old crew members phoned me up in early August,''
Blyth said. ``He's still at sea, and he told me that five of our
pirates, three of the Malaysians and the two Thais, have been
spotted doing piracy again, working the waters between Port Dickson
and Port Klang near Kuala Lumpur. You just can't believe it, but
they're back out there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a balmy night in Albuquerque, 80 homeowners shuffle into the
cafeteria at Whittier Elementary School to listen to New Mexico's
governor, Gary Johnson, a lithe, boyish figure in a checked blazer
and clashing patterned tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made you all a pledge that I was going to put the issues
that should be on the front burner on the front burner, regardless
of the consequences,'' he says. ``Half of what we spend on law
enforcement, half of what we spend on the courts and half of what
we spend on the prisons is drug-related. Our current policies on
drugs are perhaps the biggest problem that this country has.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone tells kids not to do drugs, Johnson says. Despite this
chorus, nearly 80 million Americans have tried them, including more
than half of this year's graduating high school class. No one
condones this, he adds, but do we really want our kids to be
branded ``criminals'' for having experimented with drugs? If
they're not driving or stealing while high, where is the harm?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson looks down at his cheat sheet; he's an unpolished if
ardent speaker. Last year, he points out, 450,000 people died from
smoking cigarettes. Alcohol killed 150,000, and another 100,000
died from legal prescription drugs. How many people died last year
from the use of marijuana? Few, if any. From cocaine and heroin?
Five thousand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet we are arresting 1.5 million people a year in this country
on drug-related crime,'' Johnson says, his voice rising. ``Half of
those arrests are for marijuana, and half those arrested are
Hispanics. Tell me that half the users of marijuana in the United
States of America are Hispanic! I don't think so.'' We're locking
up nonviolent people senselessly, he tells the mostly white
audience, his blue eyes and neck veins bulging. ``We ought to
legalize marijuana. We need to stop 'getting tough' with drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe this is a Republican governor. People say
they want politicians who will give it to them straight. Well, this
is what straight must sound like. Yet people look dubious. ``If
everyone were like Gary Johnson and a triathlete, it would be
fine,'' one man tells me. They'd have the fortitude to steer clear
of legally available dope. ``But they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   That's putting it mildly. Johnson, 47, regularly finishes near
the top of his age group in Ironman competitions, which combine a
2.4 mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a marathon. He once ran 100
miles in 30 consecutive hours in the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   And these are just his physical feats. Johnson is manic about
being on time. He sets 10 or so goals each year and writes them on
the back of a business card; this year, the list includes learning
yoga (he's in a class each Wednesday after work), reading a book a
month and having one ``adventure'' each week.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a hokey role model like Johnson come to be viewed by
the drug policy establishment as a threat to the nation's youth? By
acting like the uncompromising heroes in the Ayn Rand novels he
admires. Last summer, a few months into his second and
(constitutionally mandated) final term, Johnson told state GOP
leaders that he was determined to make the most of his bully pulpit
while he had it. Days later, without having thought it all through
(he says now), Johnson told reporters that he would support
legalizing marijuana and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Into the Spotlight &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ka-boom! The White House drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, flew
in to condemn him. Ed Bradley came down to do a segment for ''60
Minutes.'' Johnson became the toast of the libertarian Cato
Institute and Rolling Stone magazine, on his way to a starring role
at the recently convened ``shadow conventions.'' Meanwhile, his
chief law-enforcement official quit in protest, a local sheriff
called him an ``idiot'' and his approval rating sank from 54
percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people surrounding him wish he would stop,'' says
Darren White, the top cop who quit Johnson's cabinet. ``But this is
vintage Gary Johnson.'' Meaning pigheaded or principled, depending
on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has vetoed a record-shattering 578 bills during his
tenure, producing the state's worst gridlock _ and lowest spending
increases _ in decades.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that Johnson, the highest-ranking official
ever to call for partial drug legalization, may have just the
temperament to force an overdue debate. Can a fitness addict who's
an improbable mix of Howard Roarke, Tony Robbins and Stephen Covey
break America's $40-billion-a-year drug-war habit?
</P>
<P>
   It is 5 a.m. in Santa Fe the morning after his elementary school
talk. I've come along for his notorious morning workout. We're
running 11 miles up a mountain in the dark. I'm gasping for air
after 10 minutes. By the 25-minute mark, he has circled back four
times to urge me on. I finally persuade him to go on alone; he'll
catch me on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has a point system for his workouts _ one point each for
a running mile, a quarter-mile swim, three miles of biking or 10
minutes of weight lifting. Johnson racks up 77 points a week. (It's
one of his goals.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hasn't always been this driven. His father was a public
school teacher; his mother worked at the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
A middling student, Johnson never thought about going anywhere but
the University of New Mexico. That's where the pot he started
smoking in high school became something of a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The governor talks about those days with remarkable candor. He
didn't just ``experiment'' with marijuana, the invariable
confession of boomer politicians. Johnson told me he was high two
to three times a week between his senior year of high school and a
year after college, when he decided it was a ``handicap'' and
stopped. He also tried cocaine twice. ``Whoa!'' Johnson remembers
feeling. ``I understand why people do it. This is
UN-be-LIEV-able.'' And therefore too dangerous to continue, he
reckoned.
</P>
<P>
   Having put himself through school with a string of construction
jobs, Johnson began his own handyman and remodeling business. His
break came a decade later, when his company got a hefty chunk of a
huge Intel plant expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal swiftly took Johnson's revenues from $1.5 million to
$38 million, sparking a classic small-business crisis. Endless days
spent chasing receivables to meet his firm's swelling payroll drove
him to the brink. ``I felt like I understood suicide,'' he recalls.
To cope, he took a night course in time management in 1987. It made
him reassess everything.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Turning Point &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized, looking back over my life,'' he says, ``that when
I was fit everything seemed to work.'' He gave up liquor, ramped up
his fitness program and began writing down goals.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, at age 40, the now-prosperous Johnson told friends he
was ready to run for the U.S. Senate. But the incumbents looked
entrenched, so he decided he would become governor. Republican
elders were amused. They told him a likable young businessman could
have a big future if he started with the state legislature. Johnson
thanked them for their advice, plunked down half a million dollars
(serious money in New Mexico politics) to win the GOP primary and
rode Newt Gingrich's coattails into the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   I ask Johnson about his political philosophy. He says he is not
a true libertarian, because he thinks government often has a role.
But he will never qualify as a ``compassionate conservative.''
After six years of his stewardship, New Mexico remains among the
nation's poorest states, with one of the highest levels of
uninsured citizens. Shouldn't government do more on health
coverage? Johnson dismisses the problem, saying that many folks
don't want insurance and that with emergency rooms, nobody really
goes without.
</P>
<P>
   What about help for the working poor in an age when unskilled
folks are losing ground? ``I don't buy into that,'' Johnson snaps.
``Anybody that wants to be an entrepreneur in this country can make
an absolute fortune.'' Even somebody who cleans houses, he says.
</P>
<P>
   How's that? I ask, huffing behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I started a business tomorrow just cleaning houses by
myself,'' he says, ``I think I could make $100,000 a year. You
clean four houses at $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what these people do when they come in and clean. In
three hours I could do what they do. I just don't buy into the
notion that anybody can't still make it today if they are willing
to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Paradoxical Approach &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's empathy gap highlights a paradox in his approach to
drugs. His fierce belief in personal responsibility is what
convinced him that the drug war is a waste of money; if you're
spending $40 billion and the drugs keep coming in, he figured, why
not just legalize the stuff and work on people so they don't get
hooked? Yet he has vetoed millions for drug treatment partly
because he seems to feel people should be able to straighten
themselves out by an act of willpower, just as he did. As a result,
he has alienated natural allies in the public health community in a
state that boasts the county with the highest death rate from
heroin overdoses in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, government at all levels spent less than $5 billion on
drug control and incarcerated about 50,000 Americans for nonviolent
drug offenses; today, it spends some $40 billion and jails more
than 450,000 (more than Europe, with a larger population, jails for
everything). Blacks make up 17 percent of cocaine users but also 88
percent of those convicted on crack cocaine charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson isn't the first official to say there's something
wrong with this picture, but a crusade by a sitting Republican
governor marks a new high point for dissent. For years,
conservative intellectuals like Milton Friedman and William F.
Buckley Jr. have made a libertarian case for legalization. But both
political parties found prison-building, ``tough'' sentencing laws
and calls to ``Just Say No'' politically irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1988, Kurt Schmoke, the black mayor of Baltimore and a
rising Democratic star, stunned the U.S. Conference of Mayors by
saying the drug war was doing more harm than good. All options,
decriminalization included, he said, should be considered.
Schmoke's stand landed him on the front page of newspapers around
the country. When he was re-elected twice afterward, it proved that
a black, big-city mayor, at least, could buck the bromides and
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The year since Johnson glibly floated the notion of providing
heroin legally by prescription has seen the taming of governor. He
now seeks legalization for marijuana only and promotes ``harm
reduction'' strategies for other drugs, a policy associated with
reformers like Ethan Nadelmann of the George Soros-backed
Lindesmith Center. These analysts view drugs as a public health
problem, not a criminal one, and back broad programs for needle
exchange and methadone maintenance. They also criticize ``mandatory
minimum'' sentences that can leave nonviolent drug offenders in
jail longer than rapists or burglars.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who has himself fought to fix unfair sentencing laws,
nonetheless views much of the harm-reduction agenda as a ploy to
pave the way toward full legalization. Johnson's efforts, he tells
me sharply, are ``irresponsible,'' ``misguided'' and ``anathema to
America's parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but back at Whittier Elementary School, at least, a
lot of parents see it differently. A Vietnam veteran, an elderly
man in a red baseball jacket and a 40-ish professional type rise
one after another to say they don't usually agree with Johnson but
admire his courage in raising this issue. There's assent and
applause from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says that a number of governors have told him privately
they respect what he's doing; they also say their careers would be
over if they tried it. But the issue is gaining steam. A California
ballot initiative this November would divert nonviolent first-time
drug offenders to treatment; New York's chief judge recently
introduced a similar system administratively. Johnson, meanwhile,
has his first-ever bipartisan task force coming back in December
with a slate of reforms in drug policy, which he says could even
include pardons for nonviolent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is determined to get something done. He has been at it
only a year, and he has two and a half more to go before he leaves
office. After that, as everyone in the state seems to know,
Johnson's only firm plan is to climb Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing this, Raymond Sanchez, the speaker of New Mexico's
House of Representatives, hunts down his copy of ``Into Thin Air,''
Jon Krakauer's best seller about the 1996 Everest disaster, and
cites this passage to sum up what you need to know about Gary
Johnson: ``Any person who would seriously consider'' climbing
Everest, Krakauer writes, ``is almost by definition beyond the sway
of reasoned argument.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, I went for a swim at Barton Springs, a
freshwater pool that lies at the geographical and spiritual center
of Austin. Under an oak tree, I found Stuart Stevens of the Bush
campaign, typing on a Dell laptop. He was writing the script for
the video that would be shown at the Republican National
Convention. All around him, half-naked kids with ornate tattoos
lolled on the grass, working on nothing except their tans.
</P>
<P>
   Austin has always been a city of distinct worlds _ a college
town, a state capital and a live-music center all in one. But
lately the number of worlds that Austin contains has been
multiplying, and now, everywhere you look, there is the spectacle
of worldviews clashing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last century, the population of Austin has doubled
every 20 years, and in the metropolitan area there are now more
than 1 million residents. Thirty-five thousand people, the
equivalent of a fair-sized town, moved here last year alone. And in
the last five years, Austin has produced or acquired 17,000 new
millionaires. Now an upper class of tech barons lord it over a
middle class of state government and university workers; a national
Republican campaign machine whirs above a local Democratic power
structure; yuppies infiltrate the habitat of punk rockers. It's as
if every Austin stereotype has spawned its opposite: easy-going
Slackers live beside hard-driving Techies, and old-school liberals
drink at the same bars as new-school conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of this transformation was not wholly apparent to
me until I spoke with John Thornton in mid-April. Thornton is a
general partner at Austin Ventures, the most powerful venture
capital firm in town. That puts him at the epicenter of the New
Economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of change in activity in venture capital has been
larger in Austin than probably anywhere else in the country,''
Thornton told me. ``In 1996, venture capitalists spent $67 million
in Austin. In 1999, we told people that we thought, Gee golly, $700
million would be spent. The actual number ended up being about $1.1
billion.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of all this new money on Austin is debated endlessly
over breakfast tacos and barbecue dinners. Is the laid-back
hipster's paradise doomed to become another mess of a big city?
People talk a lot about it, but few end up doing anything.
</P>
<P>
   An exception, Thornton told me, is a guy named Ross Garber, one
of the city's freshly minted tech millionaires. After Thornton
introduced us via e-mail, Garber and I arranged to meet at a
Starbucks in his neighborhood southwest of downtown. Garber's
mild-mannered looks disguise an intense personality. He began his
career in the tech corridor along Route 128 in Boston, he told me,
and moved with his wife to Austin in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasons for coming, I learned, were remarkably similar to
those of most Austin newcomers. Jobs, yes, but also that amorphous
allure known as ``quality of life.'' With its bars, bands and
barbecue joints, its lakes, parks, low crime and temperate winters,
Austin is a lifestyle mecca that attracts all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Garber and I took a driving tour of Austin when we met for the
second time. As we nosed under an elevated highway, we came face to
face with a modern-looking fortress of red brick and glass.
``That's Vignette,'' he said, tapping on the window. He helped
start Vignette four and a half years ago; today it is the largest
e-business software firm in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vignette has created about $3 billion worth of employee
wealth,'' he noted with pride. Garber himself is 33, and his net
worth is somewhere upward of $200 million. On Garber's side of
town, brand-new mansions have spread as rapidly as cedar trees
across the rolling limestone hills. The recent history of Austin is
written on those hills. For a generation, the definition of a
political fight was a developer wrestling with environmentalists
over how fast the city should grow. Those fights seem almost quaint
compared with what's on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Because of all the new people, Austin now suffers from
world-class traffic jams, polluted air, a serious lack of
affordable housing and a school system in disarray. Eager to become
part of the solution, Garber recently formed a coalition of tech
leaders to hustle a light-rail project through the city's
cumbersome political process.
</P>
<P>
   Garber's perspective on Austin _ that its extreme rate of growth
threatens to wipe out the very qualities that attracted people in
the first place _ may be the one notion that finds support across
the city's disparate worlds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Decade of Change
</P>
<P>
   When the movie ``Slacker,'' set in Austin, came out in 1991, the
city was in the grip of a profound economic malaise. Rent
``Slacker'' today, and it's like flipping through a scrapbook of
how much has been eradicated in one busy, busy decade. Gone are the
vacant lots, the Quack's coffee shop near campus, the bookstore
staffed by JFK conspiracy nuts. Today the local paper publishes
breathless stories about $500 bottles of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of ``Slacker,'' Richard Linklater, is working on an
animated feature called ``Waking Life.'' When I visited him at
Detour Filmproduction, every room was filled with artists sitting
in front of Macintosh computers, transforming film footage into
animated action. ``It's very human,'' said Linklater of the
results. ``It's a great marriage of film and computer. I think
Austin is the kind of place where that cross-pollination can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Linklater doesn't think he could start out
here today. ``I came to Austin 16 years ago. My rent was $133 a
month, all bills paid, and I could live on $3,500 a year. So I
spent all my time watching movies, editing, shooting. Film students
are like, How do you do it? I don't know. If you have to work all
day just to pay your rent, I don't know. If I was just starting out
now? Might go to San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rest of Texas, Austin has always been a place where
what mattered most _ music, film, education, public policy _ was
supposedly motivated by concerns that were not entirely commercial.
Now Austin has developed an indigenous business scene. First came
Dell, later Tivoli, Trilogy and Vignette. These days Austin has a
1.9 percent unemployment rate and has been named the best city in
the country for doing business by Fortune and Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Day-to-day living, however, has become harder for a lot of
people. The public schools, for example, used to be considered
pretty solid; now the Austin Independent School District struggles
to keep up with the profound population shifts. For every new
computer programmer who arrives in town, a gardener, a housecleaner
and a couple of construction laborers follow. In recent years, the
greatest job growth has been not in the software industry but in
the restaurant sector: busboys, dishwashers, short-order cooks,
waitresses. These service workers are generally poor _ their
incomes have not kept pace with the rising cost of living _ and the
school system struggles to find a place for their children. One
thousand new kids converge on schools in the southern part of the
district every year.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot is Travis High School, which, by all rights,
should be a catastrophe. The student body is 90 percent minority,
80 percent low-income. So many students get pregnant that there is
a waiting list for their infants to get into the nursery that
principal Nelda Howton set up.
</P>
<P>
   Howton set up a foundation to accept donations of money and
equipment. When she held meetings with executives at companies in
town, they responded generously _ particularly hardware companies
like AMD and 3M. Howton looked at what was happening in Austin and
decided to start classes in C++ and Java computer languages, and
set up a multimedia lab where students build Web sites. She filled
classrooms with orange and aqua i-Macs, got every kid an e-mail
address and wired up the shabby brick building with fiber-optic
lines. It's a blinking, glowing declaration of progress where you'd
least expect to find it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fusion of Old and New &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Austin's politics have been changing right along with the
economy. Mayor Kirk Watson represents a fusion of old and new
priorities and has earned a reputation as perhaps the most
effective mayor in memory. Early in May, Watson wooed the New
Economy crowd at a mixer to raise money for his re-election.
Venture capitalists and software CEOs lined up to shake Watson's
hand, then write him a check. It has been a difficult constituency
to seduce. Many hardware companies have a long tradition of civic
engagement. But the software types are younger, more arrogant, less
responsible. Their start-ups also have no tradition of corporate
philanthropy, and few, if any, local clients.
</P>
<P>
   National politics has a certain luster to it, and many of
Austin's tech lords have gotten swept up in George W. Bush's bid
for the White House. Two local tech stars, the hardware king
Michael Dell and the software guru Steve Papermaster, have formed a
team of high-tech executives to advise the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Papermaster whether he thought it was weird that this
liberal enclave should become the launching pad for a possible
Republican presidency. ``Austin has changed from being a purely
liberal city into being more centered, though still with a liberal
bent,'' asserted Papermaster. ``It's a place that has aggressively
embraced growth. And that reasonably approximates the governor's
philosophy. It's not a clash. It's closer to a parallel, and
perhaps even a convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   As for local affairs, the various tasks of making a city
function, well, that just isn't as sexy, compared with national
politics. Earlier this year, at a gathering of local software CEO's
called the Austin 360 Summit (which Papermaster helped start),
Watson delivered an impassioned speech about the challenges facing
the city. While the mayor was talking, a baby-faced CEO raised his
hand. ``Why are you looking at us to help with these community
issues?'' asked the software CEO. ``That's your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed as if the tech barons deserved to be cast as
villains, matters took an unexpected turn. Last year, after
Vignette went public, Ross Garber sold a large amount of stock,
turned down a bunch of job offers and spent nine months wondering
what to do with his time.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Garber was sitting in traffic when his cell phone
rang. It was Lee Walker, whom he knew from the 360 Summit. Walker
is Old Austin (he has shoulder-length white hair and wears a suede
hat) but possesses a New Austin resume (he was the first president
of Dell). He's now the volunteer chairman of Capital Metro, the
city's public transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   Walker approached Garber with a small request. In November, the
city was going to vote on whether to build a light-rail system. By
law, Capital Metro could not campaign for the ballot initiative.
And the idea faced stiff opposition from people like Gerald
Daugherty, a conservative figure in Old Austin circles who had
formed an antirail group called Reclaim Our Allocated Dollars, or
ROADS. ``I need a high-tech poster boy,'' Walker told Garber.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, light rail is a deeply countercultural idea. Natives
consider the pickup truck roughly equivalent to the American flag
in symbolic value, and public transportation a Kremlinesque
conspiracy to undermine their way of life. But Dallas, of all
places, built a light-rail line that has proved surprisingly
popular, and now Austin's leaders were convinced that they could,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Garber formed a team of techies to consider light rail. John
Thornton joined it, and so did Steve Papermaster, among others.
Light rail was imperative, the group determined; the city's air was
becoming so dirty that it would soon violate federal health
standards. Garber got all fired up. ``I'm not a train hugger,'' he
vowed. ``But this place is exploding.''
</P>
<P>
   Garber then embarked on something that might be called a
21st-century political campaign. Early in May, we drove past
rainbow-colored bungalows smoldering in the heat in search of
Garber's billboards. Downtown, Garber spotted one: MORE TRAFFIC
AHEAD. PERIOD. On I-35, a main north-south artery, a yellow
billboard announced: FREE PARKING AVAILABLE ON I-35.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing mass transit as their cause, the techies were
picking a fight with Austin's traditional business groups, the real
estate developers, car dealers and oilmen who have always loved
highways. Garber himself went through culture shock. ``Different
language, different pace,'' he reported. ``With Old Austin, the art
is the process _ the listening, the communicating, the cajoling,
the time it takes. In tech, you just don't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been clear what would happen if the tech people had
remained secluded in their parallel universe. This dusty Eden would
turn into another Silicon Valley, then everybody who could afford
to would move on to the next paradise. But what if Old and New
Austin learned to work together instead? This was what was so
promising about the rail project: Maybe someday Austin could become
the kind of place where the private sector gets involved and stays
involved, instead of just sitting idly by while the public sector
falls apart. A school like Travis might become the rule, not the
exception.
</P>
<P>
   But as time passes, the balance of things keeps tilting the
other way. In July, Nelda Howton gave up. The buzz around Austin
was that she wasn't appreciated sufficiently. Howton said that
wasn't true. ``I couldn't get to work!'' she told me. She lives in
a town called Salado, and she used to be able to get to work in 45
minutes. But as Austin kept expanding, her commute did, too, until
it swelled to two hours. ``I was spending 20 hours a week on the
road,'' she said. There was a lightness in her voice, as if some
great frustration had eased. She was going to open a brand-new
school in Killeen, about 60 miles from Austin, and now it would be
somebody else's job to worry about whether the children of Austin's
housekeepers and gardeners and short-order cooks had food, or beds,
or access to modern marvels like the i-Mac.

A CANDY MUSEUM? HOW SWEET! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things weren't going well for brothers James and Gilbert Ganong
in 1873. They'd opened a grocery store in St. Stephen, New
Brunswick, but it was failing. They needed something to attract
customers, and they needed it quickly. So they added what was then
a specialty item: candy.
</P>
<P>
   Good career move.
</P>
<P>
   The candy drew plenty of customers, so the brothers decided to
eliminate the middle man and make their own sweets. Before long,
they sold the grocery and were in the candy business exclusively.
By 1930, the company was employing 700 people and selling tons of
chocolate and other candies across Canada. Among the favorite items
were chicken bones, a concoction with cinnamon candy on the outside
and chocolate on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet story of Ganong candies is told at our Museum of the
Month, the year-old Chocolate Museum in St. Stephen. Although this
is not a factory tour, some of the early and present equipment is
on display, along with chocolate-making demonstrations (and
samples!), hands-on displays, games (can you fit the big
make-believe chocolates into the properly shaped slots?), and a
unique collection of candy boxes and wrappers, including some
picturing Longfellow's Evangeline, once the symbol of Ganong
candies.
</P>
<P>
   A guide will show you early valentine boxes _ Ganong was the
first in Canada to sell them _ and will probably tell you the story
of how in 1910 Arthur Ganong, who would later become company
president, and factory superintendent George Ensor needed a
convenient way to bring candy along on their fishing trips. So they
invented what became the world's first five-cent chocolate bar.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a video that includes a delightful interview with
retired chairman of the board Whidden Ganong, known as the Candy
Man. Your guide will later tell you that he ate a pound of
chocolate a day _ and died at age 93!
</P>
<P>
   (The Chocolate Museum is on Milltown Boulevard, St. Stephen, New
Brunswick, on the US border with Calais, Maine. Adult admission is
about $2.75 US. In addition to the museum, the refurbished complex
(it was the chocolate factory until 1990) also houses a large store
that sells crafts and, oh yes, Ganong candies. For more
information, call 506-466-7848.) &QL;

Travel Trivia: Which state begins with an ``A'' but doesn't end
with one? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Some travelers want to go to foreign places but are
dismayed when the places turn out actually to be foreign'' _
Margaret Atwood, poet and novelist. &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: Two Seattle television stations have the call letters
KING and KONG. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: In Hartford, you cannot cross the street while
walking on your hands. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The naked truth: According to a survey by Choice Hotels, 17.8
percent of guests surveyed wear nothing to bed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mailbag: Margaret Ahearn of Concord disagrees with the use of
``America'' to mean only the United States. In response to last
week's trivia question _ what is the largest island on America's
East Coast? _ she writes: ``Newfoundland with 43,548 square miles
is more than 25 times bigger than Long Island, and even though it
is in Canada and not the US, it is still in America and on the East
Coast. . . . Why do we assume that Canada is not in America?'' She
has a point, but even Canadians refer to US residents as Americans.
The usage may have come about because, of all the countries in the
Americas, the United States of America is the only one with
``America'' in its name. &QL; 
 &QL; 
History in a hotel: The Lenox Hotel, one of the first hotels in the
Back Bay, has been added to the roster of the National Trust
Historic Hotels of America. The hotel was built in 1900 in eight
months for $1.1 million. And because the Lenox was adjacent to a
rail yard for many years, wealthy guests such as opera singer
Enrico Caruso would pull their rail cars up to the hotel and walk
right in. &QL;

   Stephen King is addicted to writing. It isn't a matter of liking
to write or even loving it. He needs it, chemically, the way years
ago he needed his cocaine and his beer, sometimes a case a day.
``Writing is just this great big conduit, this outflow pipe that
keeps the pressure nice and even,'' he says. ``It just pours all
this (expletive) out. All the insecurities come out, all the fears
_ and also, it's a great way to pass the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he hadn't been able to make a career of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'd be dead. I would have drunk myself to death or drugged
myself to death or committed suicide or some goddamn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, he almost died anyway. He and his family were
staying at their lake house in western Maine. It was late afternoon
and King was finishing up his daily four-mile walk. As usual, he
was carrying a book. Although he often reads while walking _ on
dirt roads, for instance, or down Broadway while visiting New York
_ he was not reading at the moment, for this stretch took him up a
steep hill alongside a small highway.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a blue Dodge minivan crested the hill and pinballed
King off its windshield. He came down in a clump. His head was
bleeding, his lap seemed to be turned sideways and he saw that a
bone in his right leg was pointing in the wrong direction, skyward,
bulging out of his jeans. A short while later, one of his lungs
collapsed. This was all happening in a blur, literally, for King's
eyeglasses were missing. They had somehow landed on the front seat
of the minivan. They would help convince Bryan Smith, the man
driving the van, that he had hit a person and not, as he first
thought, ``a small deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, after King knew he would survive but before he
knew if he would walk again, he resumed writing. His wife, Tabitha,
who is his rock and his redeemer, set him up at a makeshift desk in
the back hallway of their Victorian sprawl in Bangor. It reminded
him of the laundry room in their old trailer, where he wrote
``Carrie,'' back when he washed motel sheets for a living and she
sold Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sat in a wheelchair, propped up by foam cushions,
brimming with pain and painkillers. Besides the fractured hip,
mangled leg, collapsed lung and lacerated scalp, he had four broken
ribs and a chipped spine, and he had lost 50 pounds. He didn't feel
like working, but a voice in his head _ yes, Stephen King, like his
characters, hears voices _ told him to.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an opposite of writer's block, King has it. As a
teen-ager, he would come home from a Roger Corman movie, write a
novelization in two days, mimeograph a few dozen copies and sell
them at school for a quarter each. By the time he was a college
sophomore, he had five finished novels in a drawer. Last month, his
hyperproductivity paid off yet again. Reaching into another drawer,
he pulled out a novel called ``The Plant'' and did something with
it that made worldwide headlines: he published it himself.
</P>
<P>
   A few months earlier, he became the prince of e-publishing by
releasing, through Scribner, an Internet-only novella. Its success
tickled him, and made him yearn for an even closer-to-home
publishing experience. Enter ``The Plant.'' Instead of a mimeograph
machine, he used his Web site to release it; instead of a quarter a
copy, he suggested a $1 payment for the first installment, with
more to come only if 75 percent of the downloaders paid up. ``My
friends,'' he wrote on his Web site, ``we have the chance to become
Big Publishing's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the novel's plot _ a writer sends a man-eating plant to
a publishing house that rejected his manuscript _ Big Publishing
did its best to appear unruffled. ``I don't feel particularly
threatened,'' said Susan Moldow, the publisher of Scribner, King's
offline publishing house. The literary agent Mort Janklow told a
reporter, ``That's a fellow sitting up in Maine having fun, but
it's not a way to run a business.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after ``The Plant'' was released, King said in an e-mail
message: ``I'm satisfied with the downloads _ about 40,000 as of 4
p.m. yesterday, and we're estimating a total pay-through of maybe
88 percent. Let Mort Janklow put that in his pipe and smoke it!''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the hubbub was the novel's provenance. King began ``The
Plant'' back in the early 1980s but shelved it because it too
closely resembled ``Little Shop of Horrors.'' It was distributed
only to the people on his Christmas-card list. ``If I gave someone
a coffee maker and they sold it at a yard sale, it wouldn't bother
me,'' he said at the time. ``If they want to sell 'The Plant,'
fine. It's theirs. They can tear out the pages and use 'em for
toilet paper, if that's what they feel like doing.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be what his friends mean when they call him a genius.
After all, who but the chairman of Stephen King Inc. would think to
turn 15-year-old toilet paper into an Internet rage?
</P>
<P>
   The book he finished in his wheelchair, meanwhile, ``On Writing:
A Memoir of the Craft,'' will be published in _ yawn _ early
October. With paper and cloth and glue. For King, 52, it was one of
the scariest books he has written. While a large part of it gives
point-blank advice to the aspiring author (``The adverb is not your
friend''), it also tells the true story of how writing saved
Stephen King from the sort of life _ or death _ that he has instead
had the luxury of turning into fiction.
</P>
<P>
   He has two offices in Bangor: one in the house for writing, the
other in a low-slung flesh-colored building near the airport. This
is where he and two assistants manage the empire that has arisen in
the wake of more than 40 books and nearly as many films based on
the writing of Stephen King and Richard Bachman, King's
pseudonymous counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Monday morning, mid-June, almost a year to the date of
his accident. King uses one red metal crutch to get from his pickup
truck to the office door. He is sick of the crutch. At a recent
reading in New York, he was determined to appear without it but was
stymied by three steep flights of stairs. Once onstage, however, he
leaned the crutch against a wall and limped to the microphone. He
got a standing ovation. King, as his longtime editor puts it, ``is
the rock star of writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after telling his assistants, Marsha and Julie, how nice
they look, King lowers himself into a jungle-print recliner. He
appears healthily haggard, if that's possible _ still underweight
but generally fit. He's wearing faded jeans, a blue sweatshirt and,
on his feet, soccer socks (maroon-and-white stripes) and karate
shoes (soft white leather). The combination invokes something like
a woodsman who breaks at lunch for ballet. At one point in the
conversation, he raises his right pant leg to illustrate the story
of visiting his beloved Red Sox at spring training: ``Nomar comes
over, Bret Saberhagen comes over, Tim Wakefield comes over, and Tim
goes, 'Come on, get it up, get it up!' They wanted to see the leg,
and they all knew what the injury was.''
</P>
<P>
   The major scar, running the length of the calf, is surrounded by
any number of puckers and pockmarks. The leg is not pretty (maybe
it never was), but it's there. Attached to the rest of him. ``I
tell Tabby this is the bonus round,'' he says. ``And I believe it,
man. I have a lot of pain, but there's so much that doesn't hurt,
that I'm capable of. To be able to walk around, to still be able to
make love to my wife _ because that could have gone as well, it's
just a physiological thing. I'm grateful for everything that I
have, and I try to stay as grateful as I can, because it doesn't
matter how much money you've made or how rich you are or whether
your book's on the Internet or anything else. If you snap your
spine, you're a quad, and mine was chipped in five or six places,
almost down to the bare wires in a couple of places, so I'm very
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   His desk is stacked with books to be autographed, the rest of
the office thick with Kingalia. It traces the arc of a long and
variegated and uniquely successful career: a ``Green Mile''
director's chair, a ``Pet Sematary'' rug, a chipper little sign
reading ``Redrum'' (if you have to ask ... ). In the bathroom,
there's a framed photo of a very large woman in a bathtub,
presumably a fan, with a thought bubble above her head: ``A Ton of
Fun?''
</P>
<P>
   King doesn't want for fans. In the summertime, tour buses idle
outside his house. On the Internet, King rumors swarm: his minivan
encounter was not an accident (false); he is suffering from
writer's block (false); someone else _ maybe his wife, also a
novelist _ actually writes some of his books.
</P>
<P>
   That rumor is also false, as far as anyone can tell. Still,
King's prolificacy borders on promiscuity. ``You almost expect when
he refers to 'the boys in the basement''' _ King's term for his
internal muses _ ``that maybe there are real people, doing at least
his typing,'' says Chuck Verrill, a literary agent who is also
King's personal editor.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since King went back to work, he has written the
second half of ``On Writing''; ``Riding the Bullet,'' the e-novella
whose success prompted a storm of the-future-is-here coverage; the
better part of a haunted-house screenplay for a six-hour ABC
miniseries; and a 900-page novel, ``Dreamcatcher,'' which opens
with a group of hunters coming upon a man who claims to have been
lost in the woods. (He finished another novel, ``From a Buick
Eight,'' just before his accident, but its release has been pushed
back, in part because it involves a nasty car crash.)
</P>
<P>
   As King says in ``On Writing,'' the first draft of a novel
shouldn't take more than three months. That, after all, is how it
works for him. He writes seven days a week, with the stereo turned
up loud (lots of Eminem, Kid Rock and Wilco these days), but he
often knocks off by lunchtime. Friends say that despite his ambling
disposition, King is fiendishly focused and gets more done per hour
_ whether writing or not _ than any other human they know. ``He's
curious about everything around him,'' says Kathi Kamen Goldmark,
who founded the Rock Bottom Remainders, the authors-only rock band
that includes Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Dave Barry and, on
rhythm guitar, King. ``You can't mention a book he hasn't read, you
can't mention an obscure musician who he can't sing a lyric of one
of his songs.'' King's brain is known as an extraordinarily fecund
place, constantly sprouting jokes, opinions and, above all, story
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   King alone fails to marvel at his output. That would be like a
sprinter gloating over his speed. What does delight King is his
forward momentum. He is not only the richest and most famous living
author but also among the most entrepreneurial. A few years ago, he
pulled a Dickens and published ``The Green Mile'' in six serial
installments. (At one point, all six volumes sat on The Times's
best-seller list.) Earlier this year, he released a short-story
collection exclusively as an audiobook. Even his contract with
Scribner is an anomaly, sacrificing gigantic advances for a bigger
piece of the back end. (He doesn't remember the specifics, he says:
``I think the deal is a million dollars a book and split the
royalties pretty much down the middle.'')
</P>
<P>
   And now he has given e-publishing a kick-start. ``Riding the
Bullet,'' released in March, was the world's first mass e-book,
with more than 500,000 downloads. The number of actual readers was
another question because the encryption caused countless computers
to crash. Still, thanks to King, online publishing seemed a real
possibility at last. (Never mind that the Web was already swimming
with downloadable music and movies; even though plain words are far
easier to upload, it was somehow taken for granted that Big
Publishing would be the last one in.)
</P>
<P>
   King was stunned by the success of ``Riding the Bullet.'' In
Scribner's office pool, he had predicted 16,000 downloads. Now he
wanted to try again. He made up a wish list: a downloadable story
without encryption ... released in serial form ... with
honor-system payments ... published by ... ME! Thus was ``The
Plant'' brought forth from its drawer and posted on
www.stephenking.com.
</P>
<P>
   The media worked hard to turn King's insurgent act into a
writers' revolution. It is probably not. Most writers, unlike King,
can't book themselves onthe ``Today'' show and ``Good Morning
America'' on the day of their launch. Most writers, like Carlos
Detweiller of ``The Plant,'' would make more of an impact by
sending a man-eating vine to the publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   For King, though, anything is possible and, in time, probable.
``I've continued to say yes to these things rather than kind of
pulling back and saying, Well, I'm going to write a book a year,
and that's what I'm going to do,'' he says. ``I dislike writers who
behave like old cart horses, dozing their way back to the stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has written a how-to-write book laced with memoir. Some
critics, King says, ``think I can't write,'' and he knows how ``On
Writing'' will sit with them: ``Like the town whore trying to teach
women how to behave.'' He doesn't care. In the book, he even
invites his readers-writers to submit their work to him. He's
thinking about publishing the best offerings in the paperback
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Such approachability is a major upside of King's down-to-earth
reputation. Even in his native Maine, where celebrity is considered
a sort of disease, he is extraordinarily well regarded. It doesn't
hurt that he and his wife are world-class philanthropists, but
their just-folks nature is just as deeply appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one more upside to his earthiness. ``He said
to me recently,'' Verrill says, ``that one of the advantages of not
being an acclaimed literary novelist is that you get to write about
stuff like ...,'' and here Verrill names a variety of bodily
functions that are regularly featured in King's work.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, King wants to write from the gut and be an
acclaimed literary novelist. His complaints are by now familiar:
the literary establishment has long misunderstood popular fiction,
and just because he sells millions of books, serious readers won't
take him seriously. King has recently made headway. His novels have
come to be reviewed more respectfully; a Hawthorne-ish short story
he wrote, ``The Man in the Black Suit,'' won a 1996 O. Henry Award.
King was happy for the award, ``but it made me feel like an
impostor too,'' he says. ``Like someone made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the main, King is right: serious readers generally haven't
read him. When they do, they are usually impressed. Cynthia Ozick,
for instance, had never given King much thought until they did a
reading together. ``It dawned on me as I listened to him that,
never mind all the best sellers and all the stereotypes _ this man
is a genuine, true-born writer, and that was a revelation,'' she
says. ``He is not Tom Clancy. He writes sentences, and he has a
literary focus, and his writing is filled with literary history.
It's not glib, it's not just contemporary chatter and it's not
stupid _ that's a bad way to say that something's smart, but that's
what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   If King wanted to find the genesis of his bad reputation, he
might try looking in Hollywood. Except for ``Carrie'' and ``The
Shining,'' most early King films _ think ``Pet Sematary'' or
``Maximum Overdrive'' or ``Children of the Corn'' _ were dopey
gorefests. As King the author became a brand name, his movies gave
serious readers everywhere reason not to read him.
</P>
<P>
   But as his writing matured, so did the films. In 1986, Castle
Rock released ``Stand by Me,'' a sharp coming-of-age film based on
a King novella. Castle Rock has since made five more King films:
``Misery,'' ``Needful Things,'' ``The Shawshank Redemption,''
``Dolores Claiborne'' and ``The Green Mile.'' Each one was a few
thousand percent better than ``Children of the Corn.'' Too bad for
King that Castle Rock wasn't around in the 1970's. On the other
hand, he often hurts his own cause. Last year, King gave himself a
party at Tavern on the Green to celebrate the 25th anniversary of
the publication of ``Carrie.'' It was a fancy night, full of
literary VIPs, capped off by ... a highlight reel including the
goriest moments in King's film repertory.
</P>
<P>
   King never set out to be a horror writer and doesn't consider
himself one now. Horror, he implies, is a cheaper version of fear,
and it's the fear he's interested in: the frantic bleats in a
protagonist's mind more than the monster causing them. Two of his
recent works, ``Hearts in Atlantis'' and ``Bag of Bones,'' seemed
intent on minimizing the monstrous. They are driven by character,
not scenario, and are each rooted in sober realism. They are big,
serious-ish books; Scribner even classed up their dust jackets. But
by story's end the ghosts have arrived. A reader feels almost as if
the writer wanted to resist but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   A reader feels more of King at work than of most writers. His
narrative voice, extraordinarily controlling and full of wry
intrusions, is always right in your ear, just outside the
campfire's light. But what most makes King unique is that he fully
exploits the writer's great natural advantage: he is the one making
up the story. If there is a single trait common to most of King's
writing, it is the reader's feeling that the author is playing God.
He can and will make really bad things happen to his beloved
creations. He will then watch them confront this evil, occasionally
offering aid. Finally, after they've been scared witless and have
proved themselves worthy, they are welcomed back into His warm
embrace, humble and grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,'' a novella that King published
last year, is a good example. In it, a 9-year-old girl gets lost in
the woods and ends up praying to her hero, the Red Sox pitcher Tom
Gordon, to help save her. It is a simple, beguiling, frightful
story. It begins in innocence, passes through the valley of the
shadow of death and ends with a benevolent wink of an author's
note: ``The woods themselves are real. If you should visit them on
your vacation, bring a compass, bring good maps ... and try to stay
on the path.''
</P>
<P>
   King says he might soon retire _ ``I think that my trick bag is
pretty well empty'' _ but instantly cautions that he probably won't
be able to. Those who know him well agree. He is preternaturally
driven, they say. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   Warren Silver, a Bangor friend and one of King's lawyers, says
that ``he's just a competitive guy who wants to be the best at what
he does.'' King has befriended John Grisham _ a few years ago, they
paid their own way to the National Book Awards, in sly protest of
being perennially unconsidered _ but he is bothered by the
inferiority of other best-selling authors. ``I never wanted to be
content with being, let's say, a Robin Cook or even a Michael
Crichton, who's a little bit better,'' he says. Of Danielle Steel
and Mary Higgins Clark, he complains, ``These people are selling
fairy tales.''
</P>
<P>
   If King's Internet orgy proves anything, it's that he likes
attention, a lot. What doesn't drive King is money. ``The truth is,
Stephen King is rich because he never set out to be rich,'' says
Susan Moldow of Scribner. ``If the money mattered to him, it
wouldn't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is, many times over. Responding to an e-mail query about
his finances, he wrote: ``I don't know how much I make in a good
year. Gross could be $40 million, I'd think. What finally nets out
is maybe a third.'' For the movie of ``The Green Mile'': ``I think
I got $3 million plus a piece of the back end (up to a certain
point). The movie has earned, unlike most of them, so I think I'll
see some back end. I saw some from 'Stand by Me,' too. Mostly
(people won't believe it) the movies are just sort of fun. Like
investing in some weird margin stock like United Kurmfurling or
Yermal SpringTronix. I can't break my finances down further than
that, and you are impudent to ask (I say it without rancor, but you
know it's true). The money isn't very important. The idea is to
take care of your family and have enough left over to buy books and
go to the movies once a week. As a goal in life, 'getting rich'
strikes me as fairly ludicrous. The goal is to do what God made you
for and not hurt anyone if you can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   The not-hurting-anyone credo is important to King, and personal.
When he was 2, his father ``did a runout.'' King grew up with his
mother and older brother, on the move and poor. In ``On Writing,''
he recalls this childhood with typical candor (which can be very
moving) and typical scatalogical flair (which will probably keep
him, for now, on the wrong side of Art). His mother set high
standards, worked like a martyr, encouraged his writing; he loved
her. Shortly before his first book was published, she found out she
had uterine cancer. ``We could hear the pause after each rasping
breath she drew growing long and longer,'' he writes. ``Finally
there were no more breaths and it was all pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, King's own family is his greatest happiness. He speaks of
Tabitha with the ardor of a newlywed and the awe of a Lourdes
pilgrim. It was Tabitha who, about 15 years ago, gave him a choice:
clean up or move out. He was a mess; he says he can't really
remember writing ``Cujo'' at all. Tabitha took him before a group
of family and friends and emptied his trash can onto the rug. Out
poured, he writes, ``beer cans, cigarette butts, cocaine in gram
bottles and cocaine in plastic Baggies, coke spoons caked with snot
and blood, Valium, Xanax, bottles of Robitussin cough syrup and
NyQuil cold medicine, even bottles of mouthwash.'' He bought a
little time, as addicts will do, but soon started treatment and
stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   King seems genuinely surprised that he has lived to see his
first grandchild. He and Tabitha have had an eventful marriage;
friends say it is one of the strongest they have seen. For Tabitha,
who has published seven novels, it cannot have been easy being the
No. 2 writer in this two-writer home. Worse yet, for years they
shared a publisher. Tabitha's last manuscript got caught in limbo
when Elaine Koster, Tabitha's editor and Stephen's paperback
publisher, left Penguin Putnam in 1997. Stephen wound up signing
his lucrative deal with Scribner. Tabitha's novel wound up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now two of their three children are writers, Joe near Boston
(who writes under a pseudonym) and Owen in New York (who doesn't).
``I read Joe's stuff, and I kind of relate to it because it's like
plot-driven, it's high conflict,'' King says. ``Owen is more like
this sort of _ I don't want to dis him but _ Bret Easton Ellis. I
don't know, more like flavor-of-the-month, New York
relationships.'' The Kings' daughter, Naomi, is a Universalist
minister. ``I tell her, and I think it's true, that Unitarianism is
God for people who don't believe in God, and she just laughs.''
Naomi, who once owned a restaurant in Portland, Maine, now lives in
Chicago. ``She met a woman out there, and she's going to marry this
woman or have a commitment thing or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the whole family was up at the lake, including
Joe's wife and infant son. It was the first time in six months they
had all been together. On June 19, a Saturday, Owen was returning
to New York, so his father dropped him at the airport, drove home,
took a nap, then headed out for his daily constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Owen had just walked into his apartment when he got a phone call
from Tabitha: his father had been in an accident. He flew back.
King had been airlifted to the Central Maine Medical Center in
Lewiston. Tabitha, Joe and Naomi arrived, and later, Owen. ``What
they did to me there was apparently set something in my leg,'' King
recalls, ``and there's this horrible scream _ it came out to where
they were signing papers. Joe turned pale at that. The nurse gave
them a form, a do-not-resuscitate kind of thing. Tabby said Joe
realized it was serious and he just left, went out for a while. He
had his Red Sox cap. He put the cap over his face until he was in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   King, leaning forward in his recliner, takes a pause, and a
breath. ``Later, they all gathered around.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's fully choked up. He whispers, in a model of Maine
understatement, ``They're good people.''
</P>
<P>
   King's near-death, as the facts came forth, unspooled like a
scene from his novels, full as they are of automotive menace and
rural blunderings. The driver who hit him, 42-year-old Bryan Smith
of Fryeburg, is known locally as a bit of a simpleton. King recalls
a sheriff's investigator visiting him in the hospital and saying,
``That Pepsi can has more IQ than Bryan Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith hit King, his minivan was well onto the right
shoulder. He had been distracted by his Rottweiller's trying to get
into a food cooler. Smith came back and sat with King to wait for
the ambulance. A woman and three children soon joined them.
According to her, Smith apologized and told King he had never even
gotten a parking ticket before, to which King replied, ``Well, I've
never been hit by a car before.''
</P>
<P>
   The local weekly, The Bridgton News, later reported that Smith
actually had a long history of driving violations. He had been
convicted for operating under the influence, driving to endanger
and failure to stop for a police officer. Once, after running
several cars off the road, he pulled into his driveway and promptly
passed out on his lawn, in view of the police officer who had been
chasing him. In 1998, his license was suspended three times but
each time was restored.
</P>
<P>
   At it turned out, Smith has a brother, Everett, on the Fryeburg
police force. The sheriff's deputy who responded to the King
accident, Matt Baker, used to serve on the Fryeburg force with
Everett Smith. And the only eyewitness Baker took a statement from
on the scene was his own uncle, Chip Baker. ``It's not nepotism,
it's ineptness, that's what I would credit those police departments
with,'' says Lisa Williams Ackley, who covered the story for The
News.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were enraged when it was announced that only
misdemeanor charges would be pressed against Smith. The accident,
they felt, should be treated as a seriously criminal act. ``They
should have impounded the vehicle, and they should have tested him
for drugs and alcohol at the scene, and they didn't do it,'' says
Warren Silver, the Kings' lawyer in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   Silver had gone to western Maine shortly after the accident to
investigate it and meet with Smith. He came home with an idea that
he prayed Smith hadn't had: the 1985 blue Dodge Caravan, fresh with
King's dents, might fetch a frighteningly high price on eBay. The
next day, Silver called Smith, offered him $1,500 for the van and
had it shipped back to Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   King wants to use the van for a charity event: three
sledgehammer swings for $5. ``But my wife is kind of like, 'Why
don't we just get past this whole thing,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles at his own grisly perseverance. He takes off his
glasses, rubs his eyes, puts the glasses back on. They are the same
lenses he was wearing that day; only the frames had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he still wearing them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that I wanted to say that things that we ordinarily
would see as quite fragile aren't necessarily that fragile,'' he
says. ``It's true of the glasses, and it's true of me. I got bent,
I got busted around a lot, but I'm still here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Iovine, co-chairman of Interscope Geffen A&AMP;M, slips the
videocassette in the player and plunks down in a comfy chair. He's
screening an early episode of ``Farmclub.com,'' a weekly music show
he's producing on the USA network. ``Farmclub'' runs right after
the World Wrestling Federation's ``Raw Is War,'' a
let-them-eat-beefcake extravaganza that is cable TV's highest-rated
show. The conjunction was no accident. Iovine avidly pursued it
because he wanted to capture the young males who watch wrestling.
The star of this episode is unquestionably Fred Durst, front man
for Limp Bizkit, a group that minted rap-metal, the aggressive,
hypermacho and extremely lucrative new pop-music genre that mixes
rap with rock. ``Watch this,'' Iovine says. ``This is what
'Farmclub' is all about.'' Just then, on the tape, Durst, enraged
that the show has just run the wrong version of a Limp Bizkit
video, threatens to hide a TV camera somewhere on the person of a
staff member.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is quite possibly the future of white male youth
culture _ camera-ready anger, staged to resemble wrestling. Iovine
is an entrepreneur of rage. He linked arms with the rap label Death
Row in the early '90s and made the gangsta rappers Snoop Dogg and
Dr. Dre household names. He signed Nine Inch Nails, whose
transgressive lyrics are the target of Washington conservatives,
and he, along with Dr. Dre, brought the world Eminem, the
anti-role-model white rapper who has recently been embroiled in a
public dust-up over virulent antigay lyrics. Iovine sees a great
future ahead for artists who take hip-hop in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you understand the impact on young white America that
hip-hop is having?'' he asks. To illustrate, he searches his Los
Angeles office for the FBI tally of crime statistics he keeps close
at hand. ``Crime has gone down remarkably. And rap music has been
the biggest it's ever been. So do guys like Tupac and DMX deserve
the Nobel Peace Prize? I don't know. What do you think?'' He's
joking, but only just.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that Iovine frequently ponders the connections
between outrageous music and outrageous behavior, if only because
his artists and others like them often have a foot on both sides of
the line. Take last year's Woodstock, where rap-metal had its messy
coming out. The artists Rage Against the Machine, Korn, the Insane
Clown Posse and Everlast all played there, all of them fusing heavy
guitar sounds to boastful, profane hip-hop attitude. Promoters were
hoping for a nice millennial assortment of good vibes, while
audiences and artists clearly wanted to carve out a nastier slice
of history. It was Durst who put his finger on the scale. Before
the sea of Woodstock humanity, he announced: ``They want us to ask
you to mellow out. They said too many people are getting hurt.
Don't let nobody get hurt, but I don't think you should mellow
out.'' And then the seams split open. Limp Bizkit played their
testosterone-drenched ``Break Stuff,'' and the mood changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break Stuff'' rants against ``the he says-she says'' and
builds to a vow to ``break your ... face tonight.'' That's the
quintessential rap-rock moment, when everyday pressures and the old
he says-she says ignites in an updraft of rage. At Woodstock one
woman was reportedly raped as Limp Bizkit played, and a gang rape
allegedly occurred while the band Korn performed. Crisis counselors
say there were even more attacks, and at party's end, fires broke
out all over the grounds as rock fans trashed vehicles, automatic
teller machines and vendor stalls. There were few reports of
anybody mellowing out.
</P>
<P>
   Iovine thinks those who link Limp Bizkit to the Woodstock melee
miss the point. Earlier that day, he informs me, a 6-year-old
Michigan youth shot and killed another child. Iovine's artists have
been blamed before when fans have engaged in criminal behavior, so
he is quick to say now that music is not responsible for the
Michigan killing. While he laments what happened at Woodstock, he
contends that pushing audiences to respond is what great art does.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Detroit _ rap-metal's ground zero, home to Kid
Rock, Eminem and the Insane Clown Posse _ and I knew people who
needed Kid Rock in their lives, an artist raising the self-esteem
of doormats everywhere. The last time I saw my best friend from
high school, he was standing on the hood of his car, smashing in
the windows with his dad's golf clubs. I bet today he and his
children are Kid Rock fans. Boasting that he comes ``straight out
of the trailer,'' Rock hurls the epithet of ``white trash'' back at
the world, much in the same way gangsta groups like NWA did with
Compton and ``nigga.'' At its best, the current fusion of rap and
metal lets people who feel unblessed by the economy express some
righteous anger. But more often, rap-metal aims a lot lower.
</P>
<P>
   The new rap-metal frequently seems calculated _ to offend, to
rake in a quick, lewd buck. The influence of pornography on this
culture is worth noting. The band Korn, for example, garnered early
credibility among fans by posting interviews with porn stars on its
Web site. The Insane Clown Posse goes on cable-access porn shows.
Fred Durst appeared in ``Backstage Sluts 2.'' Porn gives bands cool
points and boosts their fan base.
</P>
<P>
   There is something creepy about the ongoing compulsion to wed
rap and metal and from there to fuse it with wrestling and porn and
seemingly every other precinct in popular culture. And it hasn't
peaked yet. Recently, Eminem's new album broke records for
first-week sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the music itself can sometimes be profound. Eminem, in
his brilliant ``Guilty Conscience,'' ponders robbing a liquor
store, taking advantage of a 15-year-old and killing a cheating
wife. He gleefully forces you to consider whatever differences
exist between thoughts and deeds while making you extremely
uncomfortable to discover that maybe the two aren't far enough
apart. (And judging from recent reports of his offstage behavior,
words and deeds might not be so distant for Eminem, either.) It is
about the meaninglessness of good intentions and maybe even the
death of them.
</P>
<P>
   Call them knuckleheads or young white guys; Spin magazine
lambasted them with the term ``mooks,'' a label that has since been
picked up as a badge of honor. And suddenly there are enough
members of the mook club to fill up many Woodstocks. We've all seen
them at the mall: kids who ostentatiously say ``whuzzup'' to one
another; the frat brothers who wear stop-and-frisk fashions; the
countless fans who recognize the porn star on the cover of
Blink-182's last album.
</P>
<P>
   White music fans have long been curious about black culture, but
the wholesale interest in miming the black underclass is new. As
far back as ``On the Road,'' Jack Kerouac fantasized raptly, ``At
lilac evening I walked with every muscle aching ... wishing I were
a Negro, feeling that the best the white world offered was not
enough ecstasy for me, not enough life, joy, kicks, darkness,
music, not enough night.''
</P>
<P>
   James Brown fascinated white kids in the '60s with a peephole
glimpse of a world of grace and grit. But the black rapper DMX, and
before him Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., now offers a
wide-screen movie of ghetto life, relishing the details, relating
the intricacy of topics like drug dealing, brawling, pimping and
black-on-black crime. Rap makes these things seem sexy, and it
makes life on the streets seem as thrilling as a Playstation game.
</P>
<P>
   Today black youth culture is no secret, nor is it about joy and
kicks. Today a thousand arena spotlights shine on such race
fantasies, and they are billboarded and exploited by media outlets
and entertainment conglomerates. The fantasy lands of rap,
wrestling and porn have aligned to shape a real audience, one that
looks awfully hardened. Woodstockers have been called spoiled
brats, pacified suburbanites, testosterone junkies with no real
reason to be angry. Their crime, to their critics, is one of
insincerity. It's a powerful argument. But once the windows start
breaking, rage isn't really earned or counterfeit. It just is. And
at that point, rage is no longer the problem of a group of problem
kids. At that moment, it's everybody's problem.
</P>
<P>
   The literature of mookography is full of family turmoil, of
parents and children turning on one another. Take the weekly saga
(run between matches) involving the WWF overlord McMahon and his
kids, who wrestle, turn very, very bad, ``marry'' wrestlers Dad
doesn't approve of, get ``gang raped'' and so on. Even professional
wrestling is about family excess.
</P>
<P>
   Making parents mad and recounting family tensions have always
been a part of rock 'n' roll since Daddy took the T-Bird away, but
today's full-out family trauma is different, and part of what makes
rap-metal stand out in comparison with the other top-ranking pop
music, teen bubble gum. Eminem raps about discovering that his
mother was a drug addict. In real life, she's suing him for $10
million for defamation of character. Kid Rock once told an
interviewer that he found career motivation in being kicked out of
his parents' house for refusing to go to family therapy. The band
Korn once put out a news release stating that some of its members
were child-abuse survivors. Fans know the lyrics and the back
stories and are drawn in because in these stories, they see
something of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Fred Durst, the man who has taken lumps for
``triggering'' Woodstock, hedges his bets, sounding simultaneously
apologetic and defiant. ``I literally don't do anything to hurt
anyone,'' Durst says. ``I believe in karma more than you
understand. And I believe in God. And when I'm at Woodstock and a
riot breaks out _ I didn't know. Everybody's jumping and I can't
see and all of a sudden there's these riots and someone got raped.
Dude, if I'd known that, I would have stopped it.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls ``Break Stuff,'' the song he played when the mood
palpably changed at Woodstock, ``a mistake,'' which he won't repeat
on the next Bizkit album. But he's not ready to shoulder all the
blame: ``They burned the place down, but it's not my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst, 29, grew up in Gastonia, N.C., a small town where one of
his best friends was a black kid whose father, a D.J., played Fred
rap records that he had bought in New York. ``All of a sudden I was
obsessed with this beat and this way of storytelling,'' Durst
explains. ``And I thought, Man, I tell you what, this has got to be
the best thing that's ever happened in my life.'' He became a
figure common everywhere today: the white kid with the boom box,
the stylized walk, the pants flashing boxers. Before this kid was
an archetype, though, he was more likely to be called weird, or
worse. In a place like Gastonia, and then Jacksonville, Fla., where
his family moved, Durst was called ``nigger lover.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined a break-dance crew _ four black kids and him _ and won
the seventh-grade talent show. But after that, things were
different at school. Suddenly all the jocks wanted to beat him up,
he says, ``and anybody that was, like, 'normal' said, 'Hey this
guy's a freak.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after school, Durst fathered a child, spent a year
in the Navy, worked as a tattoo artist and then formed a band. The
mid-90's was a savvy moment to create a new sound. Jordan Schur,
who founded Limp Bizkit's label, Flip, explains: ``Rock had kind of
fizzled, and a lot of these young kids in the suburbs, the
skatekids, they wanted a rock-star element. They were getting more
of that from rap. But a lot of those kids still liked the big riffs
and the big sound of rock. It was natural to go toward a fusion of
the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the Los Angeles rehearsal studio, standing among
mannequins of monsters, the members of Limp Bizkit don't look like
teen-age icons. Durst sits on a couch, repairing a skateboard as
the rest of the group sets up. The band plays four songs that this
fall, on their next album, ``Chocolate Starfish and Hotdog Flavored
Water,'' will continue posing the argument that hip-hop is white
culture too.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with where the music is going. The
African-American rapper Mos Def pointedly attacks Limp Bizkit
(along with Elvis and Kenny G) on his recent album ``Black on Both
Sides,'' recasting a familiar charge that hip-hop and rock 'n' roll
are both black music that whites have appropriated. He is in some
ways right.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Limp Bizkit continues to pursue total world
domination. Durst has become a senior vice president at Interscope
Records; as a high-ranking talent scout, he envisions huge
battles-of-the-bands traveling across the country, with the best
getting signed to his label. And Durst says he has raised
``hundreds of thousands of dollars'' for a cable channel featuring
round-the-clock extreme sports and music programming.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even his most ambitious project. He hopes to erase the
blot of Woodstock with a huge festival of hard-core hip-hop and
rap-metal, the edgiest stuff he can get. He would like to line up
Korn, the Ruff Ryders, Wu-Tang Clan, Dr. Dre and Eminem and more.
The show will be free, and he's toying with the idea of making the
food and drinks free, too, a rebuke to Woodstock's $12 pizzas. And
he vows to make it violence-free.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility weighs heavily on Durst's sloping shoulders.
``Pretty much everybody says our generation has this problem,'' he
says. ``We were the problem at Woodstock. But you know what? I'll
put together the heaviest rock and hip-hop bands, and it will be
the most peaceful, fun, killer event you'll ever see.'' It's a long
way from happening, though. Should it work, a generation will have
a whole new set of defining symbols. And one of them will be
wearing a red baseball cap backward.

 From The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Follow the crack of the Liberty Bell as far as the eye can see
and there he is, alone on a park bench in the middle of
Philadelphia, as obscure as he wants to be. ``Getting a little
vitamin D,'' he says when I reach him, and lifts his face to the
first sun either of us has seen after 15 hours on a bus, riding the
interstate through the night and into this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He's as obscure as he wants to be _ except for all those tour
buses parked on the other side of the square, his in particular,
with the tops of two '49 Buick Roadmasters erupting through the
roof and a license plate that reads POCAHONTAS. For a while we talk
about the allure of the road (``I like it,'' he says, ``I mean, I
miss my family, but. ...'' and then shrugs, a concession not an
apology), the music he listens to (``I don't play that much pop
these days, mostly Beethoven, Wagner''), about his recent CD,
``Silver and Gold'' (his first studio recording in four years). We
talk about the eight-disc archival box set he's preparing for
release this fall, covering his ascent from obscurity in the
mid-'60s to 1972, when he had Billboard's No. 1 album of the year;
and the two tours he's staging, one on his own and one with three
old friends, who, 30 years ago, were the biggest band in America.
</P>
<P>
   Time has finally cornered him long enough to monumentalize him,
it seems; but we'll see. Once he wrote songs with titles like
``Journey Through the Past'' _ barely conscious efforts to conquer
the present and cheat the future _ and he has always given a very
good impression of a man running from his place in musical history
as if it were a tomb. When we make our way to the hotel where the
bus is parked, a fan works up the nerve to ask for an autograph,
but Neil Young says, ``No, I don't do that,'' and walks right on
by, breaking his stride not even a little.
</P>
<P>
   Until I actually step on board, everyone assures me the
Pocahontas is a sanctuary never breached. Back beyond the special
well designed for Ben, his 21-year-old son with cerebral palsy who
watches the highway from his wheelchair, Young sprawls on his huge
bed. ``I was playing in a club in Fort William,'' he begins, ``and
we're doing a song called 'Farmer John,' and toward the end of it
we started jamming. ...''
</P>
<P>
   This is way back. This is back in the autumn of 1964 with a band
called the Squires, in Canada, where Young was reared in the little
town of Omemee with its ``blue, blue windows behind the stars'' and
where at the age of 3 he slipped into a nearby lake and nearly
drowned. This is back before his early days as part of a Motown
band with Rick James, back before his long exodus to L.A. in a
hearse looking for Stephen Stills, whom he would find only at the
last minute in a Sunset Strip traffic jam, before they formed
Buffalo Springfield. This is before ``After the Gold Rush'' and
``Harvest'' put him on the map in the early 1970s, and before the
subsequent 28 albums that have kept him on and off the map ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   This is way back, before a crumbling spinal disc in 1971 and
before the epilepsy, which still haunts him onstage. This is before
the afternoon he fired his lead guitarist for an uncontrolled
heroin problem that took the guitarist's life that very night, and
before the subsequent music that Young recorded in a
tequila-flooded exorcism of grief and guilt. This is before the
Thermidor of late-'70s punk, when one rock icon after another fell
before its guillotine of cultural relevancy, and Young was the one
'60s artist not only spared by the revolution but also embraced as
a kindred spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This is back before the nitwitted lawsuit filed against him in
the '80s by the head of his record label, David Geffen, for not
making true ``Neil Young'' records, before the '90s, when Kurt
Cobain quoted him in his suicide note, before he became the only
artist in the year 2000 that one could possibly imagine sharing a
concert bill with, say, Merle Haggard on the one hand and Nine Inch
Nails on the other. This is back before he became rock's Man That
Time Forgot, making music at once primordial and futuristic,
homegrown and surreal, traditional and insurrectionist, beguiling
and cataclysmic _ before he became, with his distinctive voice and
racked Mojave-storm guitar, a one-man vortex for folk, country,
blues, psychedelia, grunge, electronica, symphonic sweep, metallic
squall.
</P>
<P>
   Way back, playing ``Farmer John'' when he wasn't yet 20, Young
remembers, the music got really wild. ``I had never played like
that before. We were just slamming it. We played the song without
the song, we played what the song was about,'' and in that moment
his musical identity was born. If rock has always been driven by
two impulses, the utopian and the anarchic, many of its most
enduring figures have straddled the two: Chuck Berry, Elvis
Presley, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young. It's the
utopian Neil whose records people buy in droves. But with songs
like 1995's sonic Imax ``I'm the Ocean,'' or the brilliant
``Powderfinger,'' about a young frontier boy killed in an explosion
of survivalist pride and madness (``Then I saw black, and my face
splashed in the sky''), it's the anarchic Neil who howls into the
zeitgeist and alters it.
</P>
<P>
   He likes it when the zeitgeist howls back. With Crazy Horse, a
band just cacophonous and primal enough to capture ``Farmer John''
on record with Young a quarter-century after Fort William, he makes
a point of recording around a full moon, when ``a lot of mechanical
things go wrong, technical difficulties, things that usually work
don't work.'' And in the congenitally enlightened company of
Crosby, Stills and Nash, unabashed utopians who have always sounded
a little funny singing ``Down by the river I shot my baby,'' Neil
Young is Baader-Meinhof: when he performs ``Rockin' in the Free
World'' in Philadelphia, it seems he simply won't let go of the
song, until it becomes clear the song won't let go of him.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the conflict between utopia and anarchy has emerged
moral ambiguity and complexity. In 1970, when he wrote ``Ohio''
following the murder of four students by National Guardsmen at Kent
State University, his rage was more instinctive than political:
``My lyrics get personal about it,'' he acknowledges. ``I'm
singing: 'What if you knew her and saw her dead on the ground? How
could you run when you know?''' But that anger was also answered a
few years later by ``Campaigner,'' when alone among major spokesmen
for the counterculture he expressed compassion for a disgraced
president who lost everything (``Even Richard Nixon has got
soul''); and conspicuously over the years he has refused to adopt
any ideological line. At one time or another he has supported
Ronald Reagan and Jesse Jackson. His ideal ticket in 2000 is
Gore-McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The utopia of his early music succumbed to anarchy most
spectacularly during an unhinged 1973 tour that was his rude answer
to superstardom. The shows would routinely climax with Young
screaming, ``Wake up!'' at his audiences as the '60s crashed down
around him in a rain of dead junkies; now, at the back of the
Pocahontas, all he can manage to say of the period is, ``I'm glad I
made it through it,'' before a pall settles over the interview.
Whenever Young ``tried to get away from success,'' his manager,
Elliot Roberts, remarks of the period, ``it just turned into a
bigger success,'' which wasn't just confusing but mortifying, since
success wasn't particularly subtle about its human toll. Young went
on to chronicle the deaths of the people around him in a series of
anti-drug songs _ ``The Needle and the Damage Done,'' ``Tired
Eyes,'' ``Tonight's the Night'' _ that were all the more
authoritative for the way they were reportorial rather than
judgmental, never denying for a moment the attraction of excess and
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like people telling me what to do,'' he explains
almost offhandedly. ``I didn't like people telling me if I made
more records like 'Harvest,' I would be successful. That's when I
came up with the concept of destroying what I created in order to
move on. I wanted to do what I called audio verite.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and looks out the window. ``At a certain point,
trained, accomplished musicians'' _ which is to say, not him _
``hit the wall. They don't go there very often, they don't have the
tools to go through the wall, because it's the end of notes. It's
the other side, where there's only tone, sound, ambience,
landscape, earthquakes, pictures, fireworks, the sky opening,
buildings falling, subways collapsing. ... I don't know too many
musicians who try to go through the wall.'' He stops for a moment.
``I love to go through the wall,'' as if you ever doubted it for a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the collective memory of his longtime audience, he may
forever be the brooding figure reclining alone in the shadowy
gatefold of ``After the Gold Rush.'' But in fact virtually everyone
who has ever known him attests to his humor _ sometimes zany,
sometimes wry, mischievous. Over six feet tall, he has an easy yet
determined stride that encompasses all his contradictions: zen yet
a little obsessive, open yet a little unapproachable, lurching
toward his ambitions yet held back by his wariness of having to
explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   During a disgruntled taping with Crosby, Stills and Nash of
``Storytellers,'' the VH-1 series in which songwriters relate the
stories behind their songs, he paces the small stage like a caged
animal and cracks, ``I thought the song was supposed to tell the
story.'' And when I bump into him in a hotel lobby one afternoon
after failing to pin him down for an interview, and he assures me,
``I'm really not avoiding you, I'm just waiting until I feel more
alert,'' personally I feel quite certain he's avoiding me. But I'm
in the curious position of respecting him all the more for it.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Elliot Roberts was just a 22-year-old from the Bronx
managing Buffalo Springfield when Young abruptly stopped a
rehearsal one afternoon to demand Roberts be fired on the spot. ``I
was shocked,'' Roberts recalls. ``It blew my mind.'' For days he
wandered L.A. stunned, trying to figure out what hit him, only for
Young to appear suddenly one night at 2 a.m. to explain he was
leaving the band and wanted Roberts to manage him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he had plotted it all out,'' Roberts now laughs. ``I
thought, Wow, cool _ this guy is as devious as I am.'' To those who
have watched him over the years, Young comes off as a mastermind of
unpredictability. But sometimes he can appear less integrated and
more genuinely divided against himself than people think. The
utopian-anarchic ``schizophrenia'' (Young's word) of his music
reveals both a Spontaneous Neil and a Control-Freak Neil, each real
and each peering over the other's shoulder, each trying to correct
the other's misjudgments, each averting the other from perceived
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better example of this than the recent misadventures
of Young's authorized biographer. After signing a contract with
both Young and Random House, Jimmy McDonough, a journalist, spent
eight years writing, researching and interviewing more than 300
people, all with Young's cooperation. But when McDonough delivered
a manuscript at the end of 1998, Young suddenly _ according to the
publisher _ ``sabotaged'' the book by withholding his approval of
it, and Random House dropped the biography. In the Young camp,
nobody will comment for the record about why he killed the project.
But the unofficially stated reason _ that McDonough submitted the
book to Random House before submitting it to Young and thereby
breached the contract, betraying Young's trust _ sounds flimsy.
McDonough is now suing him for $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The melodrama of Neil Young's early life reached critical mass
in November 1978 with the birth of his second son _ by his wife,
Pegi _ and the subsequent realization that, like Young's first son,
Zeke, by the actress Carrie Snodgrass, Ben had cerebral palsy.
Zeke's case is mild (he is 27 and works as a sound engineer on a
number of his father's projects), but Ben is a quadriplegic. Young
would later recount walking out of the hospital and ``looking at
the sky, looking for a sign, wondering: What did I do? There must
be something wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But cerebral palsy is a twist of fate, not of genetics _ Young's
daughter, Amber, doesn't have the disease. If all this weren't
overwhelming enough, not long after Ben's birth, Pegi was found to
have a brain tumor, from which, at the time, she had only a 50-50
chance of recovering. So in the early '80s, the man whose obsession
with his music was supposedly all-consuming set the music aside to
devote himself to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of thoughts in my mind at that time,'' he
says now, ``that I wasn't ready to share with the world,'' and the
matter of Ben's health was so personal that in 1982, when Young
released a strange album called ``Trans'' with electronically
distorted vocals, few knew it grew out of an effort to communicate
with his speechless son by computer. During the rest of the decade,
Young's music seemed at loose ends on a series of recordings that
in hindsight appear redeemed as stylistic explorations of an
artistic identity in turmoil _ out of which ultimately emerged one
of his best albums, ``Freedom,'' in 1989. He then spent the '90s
making one important record after another.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in Philadelphia, when we had once again scheduled
an interview and he had once again vanished, I found out he had
gone to a school for children with cerebral palsy. Along with Pegi,
Young is a major supporter of such a school in California, and
during tours he often arranges for young people with the disease to
see the shows. I was annoyed that I hadn't been with him to get the
scene at the school for the story; in true Neil Young fashion, it
even happened during a full moon, when an elevator at the school
suddenly malfunctioned and the singer hovered for several
precarious minutes between floors. But then it occurred to me that
99 out of 100 rock stars would have jumped at the chance to drag me
along and put their humanitarianism on display, and that like so
much else with Young, maybe this was private, too.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, you know, he just wings it. Sometimes it's not a
matter of a personal code (which he obviously has), or a
Machiavellian ploy (of which he's clearly capable); it's a matter
of impulse. Standing in the middle of a shopping-center parking lot
on the highway to Cleveland, waiting for the bus to refuel, Young
is talking about spending some time with his family after the tour
on the volcanic Big Island of Hawaii, when a young woman pulls up
in a pickup truck. She leans over and rolls down the window on the
passenger side, and on her face is the disbelief of her own eyes.
``Are you who I think you are?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you think I am?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Neil Young?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he finally answers.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended between astonishment and opportunity, she sputters,
``Would you sign your name for me?''
</P>
<P>
   She scrambles to find something for him to write on. I'm
remembering the autograph hound outside the hotel in Philadelphia.
Now this woman in a pickup truck on her way to get her kid from
school maybe, or coming home from a job waiting on tables, in the
middle of a Wal-Mart parking lot that everybody knows is nowhere,
happens to peer through her windshield to see, standing over on a
small square of grass waiting for his dog to relieve himself, the
full-moon genius of rock 'n' roll. And then she makes two
decisions: the first, to have faith in what her eyes tell her; and
the second, to confront it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he says. He steps up to the truck, leans in and
scrawls his name on whatever she has offered him, a gut reaction to
the purity of her wonder; and then as she drives away, with a story
she'll tell for the next 50 years, he goes back to contemplating
volcanoes and the sea, and the tropical winds where utopia and
anarchy converge.
</P>
<P>
   As he now seems eternally young, in earlier days Young was old
before his time. ``I'm getting old,'' he sang in his most famous
song, ``Heart of Gold,'' written when he was 24. In Phoenix, after
another show, as the others in the band celebrate with friends
backstage, Young sits alone in a dark, hushed room with a few
candles burning low nearby, nursing his back with an ice pack; he
seems every one of his 54 years. Earlier onstage he lost himself in
a deranged ``Down by the River'' as he had with ``Rockin' in the
Free World'' in Philadelphia, the Man That Time Forgot shredding
time to ribbons. But back here in the dark he's the Man That Time
Remembers, and it's remembering him in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   So for a while we make small talk that he probably finds more
awkward than his graciousness allows him to admit. And then I
finally leave, after he has just ``slammed '' one more time through
the wall of age, the wall of fear, the wall of passion, to the end
of the night. As if you ever doubted it for a moment, he loves to
go through the wall, beyond the end of notes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for an adventurous outing? How about being part of a
schooner race, or pretending you're a World War II ace in a genuine
fighter plan of that era.
</P>
<P>
   For tall-ship fans, maritime history buffs, or those who just
like to sail, the place to be on Labor Day weekend is the 16th
annual Gloucester Schooner Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The Gloucester, Mass. festival features open house exhibits
aboard tall ships, a traditional fish fry, a lighted ship parade,
fireworks, and, on Sept. 3, the great schooner race.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest will be the race between the American
Eagle, a 1930 Gloucester-built schooner and three-time winner;
Alabama, a 1926-built schooner returning to the race for the third
time, and a race newcomer, the Californian, a square topsail
schooner. Would-be schooner sailors can race aboard the Alabama or
the Californian. No experience is required, just a good attitude,
and $125 (which includes a light lunch while underway). Space is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   For information on joining the race or being aboard a spectator
craft, call Boston Nautical Heritage Group at 781-344-1749 or visit
www.Advenure(at)BostonNautical.com.
</P>
<P>
   Now if you'd rather take to the air, you can fly in a genuine
North American T-6. Warbird Adventures, which has been flying from
Kissimmee, Fla., for the last three years has brought one of its
planes to Rhode Island through mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   The flights are not simulated, but the real thing. Certified
instructors will take you up and teach you to fly, let you take
control, and execute an aerobatic maneuver. The fighter-trainer T-6
is the same plane that former President George Bush learned to fly.
</P>
<P>
   A basic 15-minute flight is $154. On 30- and 60-minute flights,
maneuvers are undertaken. An hour flight, recorded with three video
cameras, is $544.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island flights are out of Lincoln. For information or to
book a flight, call 800-386-1593.

   It's time to plan a Labor Day getaway. Here are just a few
ideas:
</P>
<P>
   The sixth annual Mount Snow Brewers Festival is Sept. 2-3. More
than 75 microbrews from 20 breweries will set up shop at this
Vermont resort. There will be live music, and Mount Snow is open
for mountain biking, h9iking, scenic chairlift rides, and golf.
Festival admission is $12, which includes a souvenir beer pint
glass and beer ticket. A weekend pass is $20. For information, call
800-245-SNOW.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston you can catch the 18th annual Boston Antique &AMP; Classic
Boat Festival at Long Wharf from noon to 5 p.m. Sept. 2, and 11
a.m. to 3 p.m. Sept. 3. Classic sailboats, power boats, and
hand-powered craft, even an 1890s steam launch will be on view.
There will also be schooner sails, a crafts market, music, and, at
3:15 p.m. Sept. 3, a parade of boats. Admission is $4. For
information, call 617-422-1703.

Hudson ramble
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A weekend walking festival highlighting some of the 3,000 miles
of trails within the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area
will be held Sept. 23-24. More than 70 guided walks will be
featured in the area that extends from just north of New YOrk City
to the state capital of Albany on terrain ranging from paved rail
trails to rugged ridge hikes on the heights of the Palisades. Many
walks are family-friendly and several walks are accessible to
people with disabilities. A highlight will be the oening of a new
section of the Hyde Park Trail to Top Cottage, President Franklin
D. Roosevelt's private retreat on the family estate.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service has called the Hudson River Valley
Heritage Area ``the landscape that defined America.'' Within its
boundaries lie the vistas that inspired the rise of America's first
school of landscape painting, estates on which American landscape
architecture took shape, Revlutionary War sites, and pristine
wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Other walks planned include a 1777 Hike into History, a geology
walk for children, sunset walks, and an architectual walking tour.
Also planned are concerts, house tours, and food events. All walks
are free except for a few where site and parking fees cannot be
waived. For a brochure on the Hudson River Valley Ramble or lodging
information, call 800-453-6665 or e-mail

FLOWING FUN ON THE DEERFIELD RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLEMONT, Mass. _ Long known for the beauty of its
surroundings _ the Mohawk Trail scenic highway is also the town's
main street _ in recent years Charlemont has found a new claim to
fame: it's now the white-water rafting capital of southern New
England.
</P>
<P>
   From mid-April to mid-October four rafting companies _ Zoar
Outdoor, Crab Apple Whitewater, North American Whitewater and
Wilderness Plus _ run rafting trips on a roughly 20-mile stretch of
the Deerfield River that offers white-water conditions ranging from
Class I (an occasional ripple) to Class IV (lots of challenging
rapids.)
</P>
<P>
   To minimize environmental impact, the number of rafters allowed
on the river is limited to 320 a day. Zoar Outdoor and Crab Apple,
both operating on the Deerfield since 1989, can each carry 130. The
other two outfitters are allowed 30 rafters each.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I reached Zoar Outdoor's base camp just west of the
center of town, it was clear that the company would be putting a
full complement of rafters on the river this mid-week day. Scores
of people _ including a number of noisy and excited school and
summer-camp groups _ were milling around outside the red clapboard
office building, all ready to hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   We were divided into two sections, the red and blue trips. The
reds, mostly males in their teens and 20s, would be doing the
Dryway, a roughly 4-mile section of river that has Class III and IV
white water for almost its entire length. Billed as an experience
that ``keeps your adrenaline flowing'' red-trip participants are
required to be ``comfortable in the water, in good physical
condition, and ready for a fairly strenuous adventure.'' They also
have to be at least 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
   My cautious selection was the blue trip, a 10-mile run through a
section of the Deerfield that is mostly Class I and II white water
but includes the challenging (but not terrifying) Zoar Gap rapids,
which have a Class III rating. Zoar Outdoor's most popular, the
Zoar Gap trip is suitable for children as young as 7 and appeals to
family, office, church, camp, and scout groups.
</P>
<P>
   After a safety lecture (`` . . . if you fall out of the raft,
keep your feet up and point them downstream.''), we picked up
helmets, life vests, and paddles and boarded buses for the put-in
point at Fife Brook Dam. Rafting is possible on the Deerfield
through the summer and into autumn because of daily controlled
releases of water from its dams by Pacific Electric Generating Co.
Trips are timed to coincide with releases so that rafts in effect
are riding a flood tide down river.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-trip flotilla of six-person rafts was waiting for us by
the bank below the dam. I shared a raft with the O'Neil family from
Foxborough, Michael, Sue, and their sons Mike, 14; Christopher, 12
and Patrick, 10. The kids were rafting for the first time but their
mother and father had white-water rafted in northern Maine, where
more than a score of rafting companies are based.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide, in effect the skipper of the raft, was Sarah Harper.
A native of St. Louis, she grew up on the banks of the Mississippi,
discovered New England rivers while a student at Marlboro College
in Vermont, and has been a guide with Zoar Outdoor for four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   After pushing off, Harper gave us _ her crew _ some basic
rafting lessons, largely a matter of paddling in unison and
responding quickly to commands to shift the raft right or left. She
also taught us how to read the river, that is to spot shoals, small
whirlpools, or eddies, and also rocks hidden just below the surface
of the water.``Eddies are fun and you can surf them,'' she said,
and took us swirling though a good-sized one. Rafting lessons
learned, the crew had to make a group decision. ``Do you want to be
a war boat or a peace boat?'' Harper asked. War boats engage in
running water fights with other rafts, using large plastic bailing
buckets as cannon. Paddlers in peace boats can avoid combat _ and
stay relatively dry _ by holding up two fingers in the traditional
V-shaped peace sign.
</P>
<P>
   As did a majority of the rafts, ours opted for war and for most
of the trip there were frequent skirmishes between ours and other
rafts, with lots of well-aimed showers of water usually accompanied
by loud war cries. However, in the interest of community relations,
sections of the river with houses on the bank were declared peace
zones and paddled through quietly.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the trip took us through stretches of the
Deerfield that flow tranquilly between steep wooded banks:
classically beautiful Mohawk Trail country. In several of these
sections, it was possible to get out of the raft and swim. But,
there was also a good sampling of Class II white water involving
teamwork and fast paddling in order to snake around and in between
rocks and even slide over a few. Not adrenaline- producing exactly
but challenging _ and a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   The high point of the trip was Zoar Gap rapids. Although not
terribly long, the rapids were serious, i.e. Class III, white water
with a sudden sharp drop into a swirl of foam that threatened to
overturn the raft. No one fell out of our raft (although I think I
came close) but a couple of people did from other rafts _ all to be
quickly pulled back in.
</P>
<P>
   The Zoar Gap trip usually takes five or six hours and includes a
leisurely picnic lunch in a state park a mile or so below Zoar Gap
rapids. The picnic this day was less leisurely than usual: In the
middle of it a fast-moving thunderstorm forecast for the evening
finally rolled in.
</P>
<P>
   Since everyone was wet already the rain didn't matter much, but
paddling home made more sense than picnicking with soggy sandwiches
and we took to the rafts. By the time the blue flotilla pulled into
the landing across from the base camp, the sun was shining again.
</P>
<P>
   Like other commercial rafting trips, this one was followed by a
slide show. A photographer stationed on the river bank had taken a
photo _ copies of which were, of course, for sale _ of each raft as
it went through Zoar Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Our raft looked pretty good. The O'Neils were clearly having a
wonderful time and Sarah Harper was professionally serene. To my
surprise, instead of appearing terrified, I just looked very
worried.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, maybe next time I'll try the Dryway.

FOR AL GORE, SO FAR, SO GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; _ This is not only fragile; it could also be
fleeting. But it is real. Vice President Al Gore has succeeded in
changing the chemistry _ and not just a few polling numbers that
have pulled him even in his general election tussle with George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the images of his run down the Mississippi with Joe
Lieberman and their spouses are surprising even the people who
planned the excursion, Gore has managed to pull off a rare feat in
presidential politics _ the two-week national convention that
provides major boosts coming into as well as out of the four-day
event.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't happened on this scale since Gore and Bill Clinton
pulled it off eight years ago with a major assist from Ross Perot.
But the accomplishment deserves more praise because it was much
more difficult, more on the scale of the work Bush's dad did in New
Orleans 12 years ago, struggling up the steep hill that all sitting
vice presidents must scale.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, what happened in Philadelphia was fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush reassured people by selecting a veteran
conservative operative as his running mate, and he put on a vintage
infomercial convention. The result was a bounce in the horse race
polling data but not in any underlying perceptions about Bush the
person or Bush the potential president.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of bounce usually ends quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The check list here for Gore was formidable, containing far more
than positive reviews of an acceptance speech. A defining decision
on a running mate makes a difference, as does an initially
favorable impression of the choice; the sitting president must at
some point step aside, however reluctantly in this case; the new
guy's party has to be seen coalescing behind him; and then, if he
comes through on speech night, the images and messages in the days
that follow have to serve as exclamation points.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of Lieberman, already. Same for Bill Clinton, the speech,
and the Mississippi River. The element of Gore's convention that
has received the least attention is the Democratic Party itself.
</P>
<P>
   From all my jottings, none stands out more than a line delivered
in a downtown hotel about a mile from the convention itself by an
impeccably credentialed liberal, Senator Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences,'' Wellstone said, referring to Bush and Gore
on the major issues, ``make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is a guy who was there early for Bill Bradley and
who disagrees on many major questions _ from missile defense to
health care _ with Al Gore. But away from the convention hall,
Wellstone and scores of other liberals _ John Sweeney of the
AFL-CIO, Representative Maxine Waters and other Black Caucus
stalwarts, and Bob Chase and Sandy Feldman of the teachers unions _
were plugging for Gore even as they pressed their own agendas.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in other words, a lousy week for Ralph Nader, most of
whose Green Party supporters abandoned the policy forums around
town for the message-challenged rabble in the streets. Nader,
arguing that the Bush-Gore differences don't make a difference, is
getting bested by liberals on the merits (abortion rights, gay
rights, health care, education, and the environment), leaving him
with his petulant superiority and spirited defense of his
MasterCard ripoff of a TV commercial.
</P>
<P>
   People forget, but Gore's support from the party's liberal core
has some history, notably the decision by Senator Edward Kennedy to
support him over Bradley at the beginning of this year. From that
moment on, Bradley was never able to expand his appeal beyond
higher-income, relatively independent primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   Americans who watched the convention could also see the results
from the podium last week. Unlike Philadelphia, where the
conservative Republicans' core was confined to hotels, Democratic
liberals were featured speakers. The roster included not just
Kennedy and his niece, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, making a
connection to the convention that nominated John Kennedy here 40
years ago; it also included Jesse Jackson and civil rights hero and
Representative John Lewis of Georgia, who nominated and vouched for
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   What was stunning, however, was not so much their appearances
but the fact they were all delivering the essence of the Gore
campaign message. No matter who it was, every speech had some
version of the argument that the government's surplus could either
be ``squandered'' on tax cuts benefiting the wealthy or invested in
priorities important to working families.
</P>
<P>
   These are not people who have put their own agendas on hold,
however. Wellstone, for example, has begun pushing hard for a
universal health insurance proposal that would cost $700 billion in
subsidies over the next decade. It would require universal coverage
under national standards but leave the actual mechanisms to the
states.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, who is moving ahead under House
Democratic leader Dick Gephardt with a fresh approach to the
divisive issue of trade, told me during the convention that he
wishes the First Amendment could itself be amended to make it
illegal to argue that idealism and pragmatism are contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   The convention here _ meaning its full scope from Lieberman to
the Mississippi _ gave Gore for now the same high level of support
from his own universe that Bush was getting from his.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to knot up the race. But Gore's focus on working
families is an attempt to take things beyond that. For a few days
it has worked, but this new public impression remains both new and
fragile.

WHAT IF HAVING YOUR PERIOD WAS A CHOICE?

<TEXT>
<P>
   The ancient Persians didn't have much patience for a woman's
period. If she continued to bleed after four days, she could be
whipped, then placed in isolation for five more days. And woe to
the woman whose bleeding continued after her release.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal as it was, the Persian disdain for menstruation had a
certain evolutionary logic. In the centuries before Christ, death
rates were high and the community had a collective interest in
producing more children. And a woman having her period was neither
pregnant nor breast-feeding a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a new movement against monthly periods is building, this
time led by researchers who say menstruation is neither necessary
nor even healthy. Because of longer lives and fewer children, women
today have almost three times as many periods as they did just 200
years ago, bringing them far more discomfort than women of the past
as well as an elevated risk of ovarian cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no good medical reason for menstruation,'' said
Dr. Freedolph Anderson, director of clinical research at the
Eastern Virginia Medical School's Institute for Reproductive
Medicine, and one of the leaders of the anti-period movement.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is overseeing a nationwide test of a form of
birth-control pill that would reduce the number of periods a woman
has each year from 13 to four. And Anderson believes there is no
reason to stop at four: Within a few years, he said, women might
view menstruation _ with all its attendant cramps, mood swings and
other discomforts _ as entirely optional.
</P>
<P>
   But, for many women, Anderson's campaign presents an
uncomfortable choice that cuts against years of social training
that a woman's period is both natural and cleansing, not to mention
a declaration that they are not pregnant. The idea that they would
take a pill to stop their period unsettles them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To regulate a lot of these health problems through a pill is
an absurdity and is really cutting women's options . . . to deal
with the problem,'' said Dr. Susan Lark, a women's health
specialist in California. ``I don't think it's necessarily more
desirable to be going toward more medication.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Anderson _ along with Dr. Elsimar Coutinho, a
Brazilian gynecologist who wrote the book, ``Is Menstruation
Obsolete?'' _ is simply making public what a lot of women with
uncomfortable periods have known for a long time: Birth control
pills in the right dosage can make periods stop altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The pill delivers a combination of two hormones, estrogen and
progestin, that prevents a woman's body from going through its
monthly preparation for pregnancy. Normally, seven out of the 28
pills in a monthly pack contain no hormones, allowing the woman to
menstruate at the end of the cycle, which is the body's way of
clearing a path for the next ovulation.
</P>
<P>
   But, if women skip the seven placebo pills and take
full-strength birth control every day, their periods stop. Bonnie,
who is 49, began doing just that more than 25 years ago after her
doctor suggested a hysterectomy to cope with painful periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it for years, and it was fine,'' said Bonnie, who asked
that her full name not be used. ``I just didn't want to have (my
period) any more and deal with it. I'm surprised more people don't
do this. As far as I'm concerned, it was a godsend.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cramps, mood swings, cravings, and headaches
commonly associated with monthly menstrual cycles can be enough to
make any woman want to follow Bonnie's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, an estimated 2.5 million women are affected by
serious menstrual disorders, causing them to miss work and seek
gynecological care, according to a study published in the February
1996 issue of the American Journal of Public Health.
Menstrual-cycle-related complaints account for 50 percent of all
gynecological visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If women would stay on the pill, I would be out of a job,''
said Dr. Patricia Sulak, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Scott and
White Hospital in Temple, Texas, and author of the 1996 study.
``Why are they coming to me? Because they have irregular periods,
heavy bleeding, PMS, cysts on their ovaries. For the majority of
women, (continual use of the pill) takes care of all their
menstrual problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even women on conventional birth-control pills experience
symptoms associated with menstruation. During the time they are
taking inactive pills, the number of women experiencing pelvic
pain, bloating and swelling more than triples, breast tenderness
more than doubles, and headaches increase by almost 50 percent,
according to an article in the February 2000 issue of the Journal
of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, doctors increasingly recommend continuous use of
hormones, both for women with difficult periods and those who want
to skip periods for honeymoons or other special events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-seven percent of gynecologists are recommending this to
(some of) their patients already, mostly just to delay menstrual
periods at certain events, but also to cut down on the number of
periods per year,'' said Anderson of Eastern Virginia Medical
School.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say there is no harm for women on birth-control pills to
skip the menstrual period. Since a woman's uterus doesn't thicken
in preparation for carrying a fetus, there is little material to
flush in preparation for a new cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing magic about taking the placebo pills
every fourth week,'' said Dr. Karen Freund, director of the Boston
Medical Center for Excellence in Women's Health. ``There's a lot of
sense that (menstruation) cleanses the body. Some women are also
assured that they're not pregnant if they in fact have bleeding
every month.''
</P>
<P>
   And, contrary to popular belief, continuous use of the pill does
not affect a woman's fertility. Bonnie had no trouble conceiving
once she stopped taking the pill. She became pregnant within two
months.
</P>
<P>
   The major ``new'' argument that leaders of the anti-period
movement are raising focuses on the reduced disease risk that is
derived from birth-control pills. Women on the pill for five years
cut in half their risk of ovarian cancer, which kills 14,000 US
women annually, and they reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.
Studies also show that benign cysts of the ovaries and breasts as
well as pelvic inflammatory disease decrease with pill use.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Anderson said periods can intensify existing
conditions, such as epilepsy, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and
migraines. Anemia, an iron-deficiency disorder that afflicts
millions of menstruating women worldwide, is linked to menstrual
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Some cancer risks, however, may be increased by the pill. There
is still uncertainty as to whether continued use of estrogen causes
an increased risk of breast cancer, the leading cause of cancer
among women. A recent study by the World Health Organization found
slightly higher breast-cancer risk among women on the pill, but
another major study found no increase among women who had taken the
pill for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-disease arguments don't persuade Dr. Susan Love,
director of the Santa Barbara Breast Cancer Institute in
California. She has argued that women can reduce their ovarian and
endometrial cancer risks by taking conventional birth-control pills
rather than the constant hormone variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not whether you bleed or not that's the key thing'' in
reducing cancer risk, Love said on NBC's ``Today'' show recently.
``It has to do with the levels of hormones.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, conventional birth-control pills have drawbacks, such
as daily ``breakthrough'' bleeding in some women and the fact that
it raises long-term estrogen levels by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women who are very sensitive to the hormone effects of
the pill will have more symptoms when they use the pill this way,''
said Dr. Robert Barbieri, chief of obstetrics-gynecology at Brigham
and Women's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Lark, the California physician who has specialized in women's
health for 26 years, said that women would be better off managing
premenstrual syndrome and other discomforts without taking hormones
at all. Lark said that lifestyle modification, such as changes in
diet, stress-reduction efforts, and regular exercise combined with
over-the-counter drugs like Midol and Pamprin, ``don't suppress a
woman and promote better health.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the pros and cons of menstruation lies a difficult
philosophical argument: Are women's periods a natural event to be
celebrated or an unnatural problem to be eliminated?
</P>
<P>
   In ``Is Menstruation Obsolete?'' Coutinho stated that women were
never meant to have periods each month. In primitive societies,
most women would get pregnant very early, have more children, and
experience menopause at an early age. A woman in ancient Persia may
have experienced 100 periods in her lifetime. Women today get their
period earlier, have fewer children, experience menopause later, so
that a childless woman might have 480 periods in her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never understood why women bleed when they don't have
to,'' said Dr. Florence Haseltine, an obstetrician-gynecologist
with the Society of Women's Health in Maryland. ``If you're having
regular ovulation, it is normal to have a period. If you're
suppressing ovulation, using drugs, then there's no reason to have
a withdrawal bleed,'' the term for having a period while on the
pill.
</P>
<P>
   The clinical studies of the new pill being carried out in
Norfolk, Va., and 49 other US locations won't resolve the
philosophical dispute. But they could present women everywhere with
a chance to settle the question for themselves. The trial involves
two forms of low-hormone birth-control pills that women would take
for 84 consecutive days, before taking seven days off. Women taking
Seasonale, as the new pill is called, would have just one period
every three months.
</P>
<P>
   If the trials are successful, Seasonale could be available by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   And a survey by the International Health Foundation suggests
many women are eager for the choice. The survey of 1,500 women who
currently use oral contraceptives found that 62 percent were
interested in having their period just four times a year. Almost
half favored complete suppression of menstruation.
</P>
<P>
   But Lark said women are the subjects of a giant experiment and
should be well aware that the continuous use of the pill regimen
might have some dangers attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``(A woman) has no way of knowing 20 years later what
(continuous use of the pill) will do to her body,'' Lark said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a top federal health official urges women to be
cautious, even if a world with no PMS, no more pads, and no cramps
sounds like heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is giving women the idea that a period is wrong and
unnatural,'' said Dr. Sara Mark, senior medical adviser with the
Office on Women's Health at the US Department of Health and Human
Services. ``We start medicalizing our bodies, our natural systems.
I think that is not a good thing because it causes fear and it
causes unnecessary concern for women.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, ethnic cleansing was reported in Kosovo. Serbs
employing executions, gang rape, and other techniques of terror
were driving ethnic Albanians from their homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The West, led by the United States, responded by launching an
air war against Serb forces in Kosovo and other parts of the former
Yugoslavia. The United States took in 14,000 Kosovars within a few
months. Only 4,000 of them have returned home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, genocide was reported in Rwanda, in central Africa,
where the Hutu majority went on a rampage against the Tutsi
minority, butchering, mutilating, and raping.
</P>
<P>
   The West did little to stop the violence, and less to help the
refugees. In contrast to the Balkans, where US officials actively
recruited in the refugee camps, there was no effort to open
America's doors to Rwandans. The United States accepted 88 Rwandans
in 1994 and 457 others in the years since.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between Kosovo and Rwanda sharply reflects
continuing trends in US admissions of refugees and immigrants. Such
patterns, advocates for refugees and other observers say, reflect
racism in US policy.
</P>
<P>
   US officials deny this, but they acknowledge that the legacy of
decades of blatant race-based bias and the political nature of
setting immigration quotas have tended to work against Africans in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics kept by the State Department and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service have found a preponderance of East Europeans
among recent refugees, and of East Asians among immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   While there are genuine needs in these regions, Deborah Anker, a
founder of the Immigration and Refugee Law Program at Harvard Law
School, said, ``The very large refugee flows are in Africa. Vast
numbers are in need of resettlement, and there are relatively low
admissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, their critics, and refugee advocates agree
that admissions often serve US foreign policy objectives, such as
defusing European tensions over the burden of accepting Balkan
refugees, rather than honor the ideals of the Statue of Liberty to
``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to
breathe free.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, 514,443 refugees, more than half of the total
admitted to the United States in the decade, came from Eastern
Europe, although ethnic and religious strife in much of the region
was generally easing. A third of the total came from Southeast
Asia, primarily Vietnam and Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Just 64,294 refugees were admitted from Africa in the same
period, a little over 6 percent of the total, as ethnic and
political persecutions in many African countries were growing
dramatically worse.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph W. Mutaboba, Rwandan ambassador to the United Nations,
said the small number of refugees coming from Africa reflected ``a
double standard, or just plain bias.''
</P>
<P>
   When genocide was afoot in Rwanda, US leaders ``knew but acted
as though they did not know,'' he said, noting that President
Clinton later acknowledged, and apologized, for this.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Frelick, policy director at the US Committee for Refugees,
a Washington-based advocacy group, said the Rwandan genocide was
``studiously ignored'' by the US government, but not out of blatant
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the US not wanting to put resources into humanitarian
lifesaving endeavors that did not offer any short-term payoff or
gain,'' he said. By contrast, the admission of tens of thousands of
Balkan refugees served to keep key countries, particularly Germany
and Macedonia, from breaking with US policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resettlement is an area that lends itself to bias because
resettlement is completely discretionary,'' Frelick said. ``Unlike
in a country of first asylum, where it is against international law
to force them back into peril, resettlement you do out of
generosity and humanity. It is susceptible to ethnic constituencies
and prejudices.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures for immigrants _ who unlike refugees do not have to
show they are being persecuted or are in danger _ clearly reflect
this susceptibility. Immigration quotas for each country are
established through negotiation between the INS and Congress, and
Asians and Latin Americans, as well as Europeans, are far more
likely to be admitted than Africans.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 through 1998, the most recent year for which
statistics are available, 30 percent of immigrants to the United
States were from Asia, particularly Vietnam and the Philippines; 29
percent were from Mexico; and 13 percent from Europe. Less than 4
percent were from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are core constituent groups out there who advocate for
people from their homelands,'' said Bill Strassberger, a spokesman
for the INS. ``We saw it when the Iron Curtain disappeared. There
were opportunities, and suddenly you had Polish-Americans lobbying
to ease conditions for Poles to come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument is made that one of the problems for Africans,''
he said, is that because of the history of slavery,
``African-Americans don't know which countries their forerunners
came from, so they don't know who to advocate for.''
</P>
<P>
   But even refugees from Liberia, a country with deep historic
links with the United States, do not get much sympathy here.
Liberia was established in 1822 as a homeland for former American
slaves; its government is patterned on the American model; and 12
of the men elected president before civil war erupted in 1989 were
US-born.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, US officials declared it safe for 10,000 to 15,000
people who fled that war to return to Liberia. About 3,000 of those
were from Massachusetts; 4,000 were from Rhode Island. The
government gave them 60 days to pack up and go _ despite the fact
that, after nine years, many had homes, careers, and children who
were born here and are, therefore, US citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberians got a one-year reprieve through a presidential
order, but face another departure deadline next month.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, said Torli Krua, executive director of Universal
Human Rights International in Roxbury, demonstrates prejudice
against Africans, since the Kosovo Albanian refugees allowed into
the country last year were given a status allowing them to stay
permanently, while the Liberians have been kept in a temporary
status for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say there was no bias _ that most of the Liberians
were in this country on visas for study or tourism when the civil
war broke out; they were given what the State Department calls
``temporary protected status'' and simply have no legal claim to
permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the actions of other countries have almost a
controlling influence on refugee policies of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Kreczko, deputy assistant secretary of state in charge of
the US bureau of population, refugees, and migration, pointed out
that countries of first asylum in Europe, particularly Germany and
Macedonia, were threatening to close their borders to fleeing
Kosovars, or even force people to return to the Balkans against
their will, unless other countries took in more refugees. Had they
made good on those threats, it would have dealt a severe blow to US
goals for the future of the Balkans. There was no such threat in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fair observation,'' Kreczko said, ``that our program
has definite humanitarian components but also serves foreign policy
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Although African countries are often willing to shelter refugees
from their neighbors, said Louise Bailey, a spokeswomen for the
Organization of African Unity's mission to the United Nations, ``it
is obviously not always in the best interests of the refugees to
remain in those countries,'' where they are sometimes easy targets
for murder and rape. ``The OAU is concerned at the lack of parity,
which was clearly demonstrated by the recent handling of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The order for Liberians to return home also may have been in the
service of policy objectives. When the order was made, the State
Department was asserting that western Africa had become safe and
stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that national security and other factors come into
play, and that because of this there will be disparities,'' said
Frelick of the US Committee for Refugees. ``But policy makers need
to question, and advocates and others need to examine, the extent
to which, when lives are in the balance, one human being is weighed
as worth more than another based on the color of skin.''

SOME WORRY ABOUT THE DECLINE IN RESEARCH INTEGRITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE DEMBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Scientific research to improve medical care has
become so commercialized in the last decade that existing
safeguards are failing to protect both patients and scientific
integrity, participants agreed during a landmark
government-sponsored conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   Once these experiments were largely funded by the federal
government and primarily conducted openly in academic settings, but
now most are done in the private sector under a cloak of secrecy.
Even the fraction still conducted at academic medical centers is
potentially tainted because the centers and their scientists
increasingly hold a financial stake in the outcome, said speakers
from academia, government, industry and advocacy groups who were
among 700 discussing recently the financial conflicts of interest
in human research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profits do drive this business,'' said Jane E. Henney,
commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conflicts of interest are very real, very serious and a threat
to our entire endeavor,'' said Dr. Greg Koski, director of human
research affairs at Partners HealthCare and the newly named
director of the federal Office for Human Research Protection.
``During the last five years, they may have gotten out of control.
Public trust has been eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ethically dubious tactics include cash payments to
doctors who recruit their patients into experiments as well as bias
in the design and reporting of studies to favor the projects'
funders, participants said. For example, when drug companies funded
experiments, the results favored their new drugs 89 percent of the
time, compared to only 61 percent among those funded from
independent sources, according to a review cited by one speaker.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done? The federal Department of Health and Human
Services hosted the conference to get advice on shaping new
policies on scientific conflicts of interest. Some participants
pressed for a surgical separation of research and private money,
while others suggested that more public disclosure of financial
interests, coupled with prohibition of the most severe conflicts,
was the solution.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Currently, more than 60,000 human
experiments are under way in the United States, at a cost topping
$7 billion, according to CenterWatch, a Boston organization that
tracks these studies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, nearly 80 percent of these studies were conducted by
nonprofit academic medical centers. Now, CenterWatch estimates that
the nonprofit share of research has been cut in half, and 60
percent of studies are conducted by for-profit companies. A whole
industry of private research firms has developed, numbering nearly
500 nationally, according to a trade group. Massachusetts is home
to the third-largest, Parexel International of Waltham, as well as
at least 15 others, according to CenterWatch.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is being driven by industry pressure to speed products
to the market as cheaply as possible. The commercialization was
also spurred by the federal Bayh-Dole Act, which gave academic
researchers and their institutions the rights to products developed
with government money. Today, it's a rare academic researcher who
has no financial ties to the biotechnology or pharmaceutical
industries.
</P>
<P>
   With more research moving to private settings and even
storefront clinics, more studies are beyond the reach of federal
rules. And most conference participants agreed that those rules
don't go far enough to protect participants or to limit fnancial
ties that could bias the research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we have a national law that covers the safety of
animals in research, but not one for humans?'' asked Abbey S.
Meyers, president of the National Organization for Rare Diseases, a
patient advocacy group. ``If you want patients to continue to lay
their lives on the line . . . you must regain the public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Several participants mentioned the death of a healthy young man
last September in a gene therapy experiment at the University of
Pennsylvania in which both the university and the lead researcher
owned stock in the company backing the study.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they pointed to cases in which doctors eager to
collect stock options or cash payments of up to $5,000 per person
have enrolled their patients in studies for which they were not
qualified, potentially compromising their health as well as the
validity of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some doctors are selling their patients into clinical
studies,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health Research
Group of Public Citizen.
</P>
<P>
   In other instances, studies are structured to compare new
treatments to ``straw men,'' making them useless, said Dr. Marcia
Angell, former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Bodenheimer, an internist at the University of
California at San Francisco, blew the whistle on a growing number
of published articles favoring new treatments that are
ghost-written by drug company employees but carry the name of a
hired academic researcher who had nothing to do with the study.
</P>
<P>
   The government leaves much of the oversight of experiments to
the institutions or companies sponsoring the research _ in the form
of an ``institutional review board.'' But in the private sector,
those boards are made up of hired hands, whose primary allegiance
may be to the company rather than to the research participants. At
universities, the boards must police institutions that themselves
own a piece of the research.
</P>
<P>
   Many institutions deal with these conflicts by asking
researchers to disclose any financial interest that would lead to
conflicts. But it's unclear how much is ever revealed. At Johns
Hopkins University Medical School last year, researchers disclosed
conflicts of interest in only 4 percent of 2,800 studies proposed,
according to an administrator, Julie Gottlieb. Even fewer of these
conflicts are ever made public to participants or doctors seeking
to evaluate the studies.
</P>
<P>
   Money paid to patients in exchange for their participation can
also be a corrupting factor, said Duke University medical ethicist
Dr. Jeremy Sugarman. ``I know of instances in which individuals
have lied about themselves in order to be enrolled in a clinical
trial. In some cases, they lie to get the money; in others, they
lie to get the drug.''
</P>
<P>
   The few industry representatives at the conference questioned
the depth of the problems, suggesting that most companies follow
government rules and act ethically, if partly out of fear that
deception or bias would prevent them from getting their products
licensed.
</P>
<P>
   But there was general consensus that the nation must find a way
to immunize science from financially induced bias. At one extreme
were those industry and government officials who said more
disclosure was the answer. At the other was Wolfe, who advocated
banning finder's fees for doctors and outlawing for-profit ``human
experimentation corporations,'' his name for contract research
firms. And Angell, who called for strict limits on financial ties
between academic researchers and companies, said ``institutions
should not become outposts of industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Disclosure is simply passing the buck to the
patient-subject,'' she said. ``Patients should not have to wonder
if the investigator is motivated by financial gain. The only way to
deal with the problem is to eliminate it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was widespread praise for the American Society of Gene
Therapy, which in April decided that no member should hold equity
or stock options in any company sponsoring experiments in which he
played a leading role. And several speakers lauded Harvard Medical
School for sticking with what is believed to be the strictest
ethics policy of any university nationwide. That policy prohibits
faculty from conducting research on any product or for any company
in which they own more than $20,000 in stock or from which they
earn more than $10,000 in consulting fees.
</P>
<P>
   David Korn, senior vice president of the Association of American
Medical Colleges, said the variations in policies among colleges
and professional associations were so broad as to be dangerous. He
urged those organizations to seek agreement _ at a minimum _ on
``limits as to what is prima facie unacceptable'' before the
government imposed such limits.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Harvard's dean, Joseph Martin, is convening a group of
colleagues this fall to seek agreement on common policies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the federal government is moving ahead to establish
stricter policies that Koski suggested will probably bar some
financial arrangements, while requiring that remaining conflicts be
disclosed to study participants in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disclosure is not enough in most instances, but openness is
essential,'' said Koski, who in September will become the top
federal official overseeing the ethics of human experimentation.
``Institutions and individuals who fail to truly accept their
responsibilities . . . should not be permitted to engage in this
endeavor.''

DOES DNA HAVE A COLOR?

<P>
   Q. What color is DNA? Are free nucleotides a different color
than nucleotides in a strand of DNA? Are nucleosides different
colors than nucleotides? J.A.S., Chelmsford, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. DNA is a long molecule made of many pieces called nucleotides
strung together. Nucleotides are nucleosides with phosphates added
on. A nucleoside, in turn, is made of a sugar molecule stuck to one
of four different nitrogen-containing molecules corresponding to
the four basic letters _ C,G,T and A _ of the genetic code. OK.
With the terminology out of the way, on to your question.
</P>
<P>
   All these things are pretty much colorless (that is, they look
white). Incidentally, you can look at DNA yourself with nothing
more than simple kitchen equipment. If you're interested, have a
look at the ``Amateur Scientist'' column in the September 1998
issue of Scientific American.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, do keep in mind that you asked about color,
which I take to mean you're asking how something will look to a
human eye. Of course, there will be small variations in how
different colors of light (including infrared and ultraviolet,
which humans cannot see) are absorbed and reflected and these are
as unique to each chemical compound as a fingerprint. If your eyes
were a lot more sensitive, you might, indeed, detect a subtle
difference in the shades of white that would lead you to say they
were different colors and, in fact, chemists can use just such
differences to distinguish things that might look just the same to
you, like sugar, salt and strychnine.

 IT'S SUMMER AND AT LAW FIRMS, A KEY WORD IS `ASSOCIATE' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Not every summer job gets you a tan.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, not every summer job pays $2,400 a week.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much Amanda Vamvakias and her fellow summer
associates are earning at Ropes &AMP; Gray, the prestigious downtown
law firm.
</P>
<P>
   With annual salaries for first-year associates at major firms
shooting up (at Ropes &AMP; Gray, they're currently $125,000), the pay
for summer associates has kept pace. So in the minimum-wage,
room-and-board world of the classic summer job, summer associates
can seem to belong to another universe.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Vamvakias, 24, appreciates that. The native of
Falmouth, Maine, has had among her previous summer jobs stints as a
salesclerk at L.L. Bean and a waitress in a Portland diner
(``Probably the hardest work I've ever done,'' she says of the
latter).
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the upper reaches of the legal profession, the job title
``summer associate'' is as evocative of June, July, and August as
``lifeguard'' or ``camp counselor'' is for the population at large.
``Summer,'' after all, is part of the name.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, elite law firms throughout the United States pay top
dollar, recruiting second-year students from leading law schools to
work for them during the upcoming summer. The competition is
intense. Vamvakias, for example, had upwards of 15 on-campus
interviews and seven or eight callbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Earnest, upbeat, down-to-earth, she does not come across as your
classic high-powered-lawyer-in-the-making. With her deep brown eyes
and sweet, shy smile, Vamvakias could be Sandra Bullock's nicer kid
sister. She's a graduate of Duke (``I thought I'd be a walk-on for
the basketball team,'' she deadpans) and about to begin her third
year at Harvard Law School. She has already picked out her area of
specialization, trusts and estates, and feels she's settling in for
the long haul professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that I wanted to go to law school pretty early in my
college career,'' she says. ``There's something empowering about
knowing what you can and can't do, how you can help people, how you
can solve problems. That's the biggest thing for me: helping people
solve problems. I just like that work and the satisfaction you get
from helping people in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides high salaries, major law firms dangle before 2Ls (as
second-year law students are called) the chance to add a prominent
name to their resumes, the likely offer of a job after graduation,
and the opportunity to enjoy a relatively undemanding workload.
</P>
<P>
   There are social perks, too. Among the events Ropes &AMP; Gray has
sponsored for its summer associates this year have been a private
dinner at Figs; a walking tour of Beacon Hill; a performance of
``Shear Madness''; a dinner cruise while the Tall Ships were in
town; and a visit to Fenway Park. The Red Sox game was Vamvakias's
favorite event. ``I'm a big fan, anyway,'' she notes, ``and Brian
Daubach won it in the ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do the most sought-after law firms in the country go to such
trouble? For the same reason a top college athletic program tries
to attract the best high-school players: In the courtroom, as on
the field, recruiting is how to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiring is the life blood of the firm,'' says Bryan Chegwidden,
one of three partners in charge of summer-associate recruiting at
Ropes &AMP; Gray, ``and the summer program probably satisfies somewhere
up to 90 percent of our hiring needs.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, there are 60 summer associates. About 360 lawyers
work at Ropes &AMP; Gray, and 155 of them are partners.
</P>
<P>
   The after-hours festivities are as much a part of integrating
the summer associates into a firm as departmental meetings and
training seminars (both of which Ropes &AMP; Gray offers). Top firms
are very much aware that summer associates are coming to a city as
well as a firm. If it's an attractive, lively city, the firm hopes
that doesn't go unnoticed. As Vamvakias says with only the hint of
a smile, ``They don't want us chained to our desks for 13 weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not so much a case of catering to the summer associates as
courting them. A summer associate at Ropes &AMP; Gray is someone who
can write his or her own ticket at almost any law firm in the
country. Since such a large percentage of the associates and
partners were themselves summer associates there, they need no
reminding of this.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all play and no work can seem pretty dull _ or at
least it can to the sort of person likely to flourish at law
school. So it's not all fun and games for 13 weeks. ``We don't do
make work,'' Chegwidden says. ``We try to make sure that (summer
associates) partake in active work and productive work.''
</P>
<P>
   Vamvakias, for example, has worked in two different departments,
real estate as well as trusts and estates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In T&AMP;E there's a lot of drafting to see if this is what the
client had in mind with a trust or a will or power of attorney. On
the real-estate side, there's also research. Then there's a lot of
drafting of leases and agreements, that sort of thing. You're
writing a memo one minute, then the next you're doing research for
someone else. So you're constantly juggling _ and usually a lunch
in there somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   It's real work, albeit a far cry from working a cash register in
Freeport or waiting tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had an amazing summer,'' Vamvakias says. ``It's been
great. I've loved the work and I've been really excited to find out
there's something in the profession I've chosen for myself that I
really see myself doing for years upon years. I've made so many
great friends and had such a great time. It's been a lot more fun
than I think people would suppose about working at a law firm for
the summer.''

&HT;     TEXAS URGED TO SEEK RAIL IMPROVEMENTS ON AMTRAK ROUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SCOTT HUDDLESTON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Local officials hope the Texas portion of Amtrak's
popular Texas Eagle route will become one of 11 higher-speed rail
corridors nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The designation could help improve ridership on the Eagle, which
operates between San Antonio and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Texas submitted a corridor designation application, it
could apply for federal funding for projects to enhance train
speeds for its existing Amtrak Texas Eagle service,'' San Antonio
City Councilman Tim Bannwolf, chairman of the Metropolitan Planning
Organization, said in an Aug. 11 letter to the state Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the department to propose that the Texas portion of the
Amtrak route be nominated for a federal designation to improve
crossings and rail lines so trains can go faster.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Transportation, which has named eight
high-speed corridors nationally, is considering adding up to three
more. The only designated corridor in Texas is a portion of the
Gulf Coast Corridor, which runs from Houston to New Orleans, then
continues east.
</P>
<P>
   A program run by federal railroad and highway officials lets
states apply for funds to upgrade tracks and rail crossings to
improve passenger rail service on designated corridors.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here hope such a designation could improve movement of
the Texas Eagle, as well as freight.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, has asked cities to support
designation of the Texas portion of the Eagle route. The route
starts in San Antonio, then runs north through San Marcos, Austin,
Fort Worth, Dallas and Texarkana before continuing onto Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the improvements would increase speed along the
rails from 40 mph to 70 or 80 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine high-speed rail in Texas has not been seriously
discussed since 1994, when a French-American partnership hoping to
build an $8.4 billion system to provide 200-mph service to Houston,
Dallas and San Antonio failed to find financing.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's Eagle carried 18,676 passengers last month, about 44
percent more than the 12,960 passengers served in July 1999. July
ridership throughout Amtrak's 22,000-mile system rose 4.5 percent,
to a 10-year high for monthly ridership of just over 2 million
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amtrak is having its best summer ever, in part due to the
ongoing success of the Texas Eagle, our best performing
long-distance train,'' Amtrak President George D. Warrington said
in a recent statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Johnson, an Amtrak spokesman in Chicago, said there is no
time line for adding the proposed Aztec Eagle, which would run from
San Antonio through Laredo to Monterrey, Mexico, as the first
Amtrak route south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is under a congressional mandate to become financially
self-sufficient by 2003. Federal operating assistance for the
company decreased from $484 million in 1999 to $362 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The rail company was in deep red ink when it considered
eliminating the Texas Eagle in 1996. A congressional appropriation
of $22.5 million and a $5.6 million loan from the state kept the
line running.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak recently has set records with $102.3 million in ticket
revenue in June and $107.2 million in July.

TEXAS PLAN FOR COLLEGE DIVERSITY DRAWS FIRE

 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the ``compassionate conservative'' alternative to
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of picking minority students for Texas universities
based on their race, Governor George W. Bush signed a law in 1997
that guaranteed a spot for all students who graduated in the top 10
percent of their high school class.
</P>
<P>
   The idea had an immediate, egalitarian appeal: All applicants
would be judged strictly by their performance. And yet, at urban
schools where black or Hispanic students are predominant,
minorities would surely fill the top 10 percent as well, getting
into public campuses by virtue of their own pluck.
</P>
<P>
   But, rather than emerge as the national model some Texas
officials hoped for, the plan has run into a wall from
Massachusetts to Washington, where officials criticize the idea as
simplistic. Though Florida recently adopted a Texas-style policy,
officials in other states say the 10 percent rule allows the
admission of too many unqualified students and promotes diversity
only in states with highly segregated high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it solves anything,'' said Joseph Marshall, who
oversees enrollment management at the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst, which has scaled back affirmative action and rejected
the idea of basing admission on class rank. ``The results aren't an
across-the-board increase in diversity. It's a real shortsighted
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   A chief drawback, said Thomas J. Kane, a Harvard University
professor who has studied the plans, is that the policies will not
promote diversity in states that do not have heavily segregated
high schools. The policy wouldn't help in New England, where
relatively few schools are filled with minority students, and only
3 percent of seniors in the top tenth are black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the class-rank law has brought more minority students
to some elite campuses. But freshmen admitted under the policy have
lower Scholastic Assessment Test scores than past classes, partly
reflecting an influx of students from low-performing schools. Kane
said a disproportionate number of students admitted to college
under the new ruleswho have low test scores are black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Bush, said such criticisms
ignore the policy's appeal as a compromise between divisive racial
preferences and strict, merit-based standards.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Texas at Austin, the state's most elite
public school, the 10 percent policy has increased diversity in
enrollment. More black and Hispanic freshmen are enrolling now than
in 1996, the year a federal appeals court outlawed racial
preferences at public campuses. And those who were in the top 10
percent are more likely to become sophomores than other classmates.
</P>
<P>
   True, SAT scores among top students at Austin are down: About
250 had scores below 1,000 last year, compared with 133 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sullivan said, the class-rank policy ``rewards
achievement and provides access to students regardless of whether
they're from the Texas border or the Texas suburb, so long as they
study and work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has championed the policy as ``affirmative access,'' a way
of broadening opportunities for students without playing favorites.
His Democratic rival for the White House, Vice President Al Gore,
strongly supports the use of affirmative action to promote
diversity on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists said the best preparation for college is a
challenging high school curriculum. Class rank, on the other hand,
can be deceptive when students attend low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate over the Texas law, which Bush had modest
involvement with until he signed it, has centered more on the
problems with affirmative action than the right standards for
getting into college. And as a replacement for preferences,
officials in some states pan it as narrow and simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state officials weighed a policy similar to Texas's
after voters banned affirmative action in 1998. At the University
of Washington, black and Hispanic freshmen enrollments plummeted by
more than 30 percent after the ban took effect. More black freshmen
are expected this fall, but Hispanic numbers are expected to
decline again, to 106 out of about 4,900 fresmen. In 1998, 196 out
of 4,200 were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   But John Swiney, the university's associate director of
admissions, said most Washington schools are too integrated for
class rank to increase diversity. He added that the policy lacks
the nuance needed to draw students with a range of abilities and
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we read students' essays, it gives us a much better
insight into the qualities of the individual beyond the numbers,'
Swiney said. ``Not all students come from a level playing field,
and there are many barriers on the road to academic success.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the University of Michigan, whose affirmative
action policy is being challenged in federal court, said they also
have decided against adopting the Texas policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one-dimensional, and we want to consider the whole person
when making admissions decisions,'' said Liz Barry, an associate
vice president at the university.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to admit the top 15 percent to Pennsylvania colleges
was on a fast track earlier this year, but has been put off until
winter, officials said. According to an analysis by Harvard, about
46 percent of black students and 26 percent of Hispanics are in
largely segregated high schools in Pennsylvania, suggesting a Texas
style policy could boost minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's governor, Tom Ridge, a Republican and a close
ally of Bush, may push for the plan, state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Paul Cellucci, the governor of Massachusetts and a
Bush supporter, say the concept isn't on the drawing board for
colleges in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of high schools in Massachusetts that
frankly don't have class rank,'' said Michael Sentance, the
governor's education adviser. ``Those that have high standards have
done away with class rank. It may or may not be the best way of
looking at this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentance said a better alternative would be to recruit minority
students more aggressively. The governor, he hinted, might unveil
such an initiative this fall.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when schools nationwide are seeking to increase the
number of their graduates attending college, guidance counselors in
Boston said Texas's policy would help their students, but only if
it were expanded to open access for the top 20 percent to 25
percent of high school classes and provided scholarships.
California officials blanched at such a large percentage, saying it
would hurt academic quality.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen M. Khoury, coordinator of guidance for Lawrence, Mass.
schools, said one problem is that schools calculate class rank
differently. Some give special weight to honors courses, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have a kid taking a weaker academic program being in
the top part of your class,'' said Khoury, who also works in
Lawrence High School, where most of the students are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   But Penda D. Hair, a civil rights lawyer who used a Rockefeller
Foundation grant to study Texas's policy, said class rank reveals
the workhorses who won't give up, even if they feel unprepared at
first for a university education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Percent plans like Texas's do a better job of giving you
students who have grit, who have determination, and who can succeed
in the long run,'' Hair said.

MOYNIHAN, BY A FRIEND: WORTHY HISTORY LACKING IN SALT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MOONEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A biography 
By Godfrey Hodgson 
Houghton Mifflin 
452 pp., $38 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daniel Patrick Moynihan is one of this country's most intriguing
and redoubtable public figures, certainly deserving of a chronicle
of his life's work. As the senior senator from New York prepares to
retire, he is fortunate to have as his biographer Godfrey Hodgson,
a friend, admirer, and first-rate journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gentleman from New York'' is neither hagiography nor
apologia, however. Rather, Hodgson fashions what he calls ``a
biography of a mind.'' At times he sandpapers the rough patches of
Moynihan's life, but he succeeds in supporting his thesis, stated
at the outset, that ``no one in political life in the United
States, or anywhere else . . . has thought more penetratingly or
with deeper understanding into the problems of democracy'' than has
Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson is British. He has spent much time covering politics in
the United States. He knows this ground well, and he covers it
economically because there is much to describe in the life of a New
Yorker who served not only Democratic presidents John F. Kennedy
and Lyndon B. Johnson but also Republicans Richard M. Nixon and
Gerald R. Ford, who was ambassador to India and the United Nations,
who wrote numerous books and articles, who taught at Harvard, and
who served 24 years as senator.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Moynihan managed to inject himself into the
center of national and international debates with remarkable
prescience for the course of events.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson ascribes the ``meanderings of his political course'' to
the ``chance encounters and random walks'' of a paladin who married
his own rangy intellect, and to ``high ambition and low cunning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many see him as having sailed on a great circle from classic
liberalism, by way of neoconservatism, back to a contemporary
version of a traditional Democratic liberal position,'' the author
writes. ``Moynihan himself insists that it was not he who has
moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hodgson, for the most part, portrays his friend as an
anchored vessel buffeted by the storms of the 1960s, '70s, `80s,
and '90s. He was a friend, ally, adversary or enemy of most great
figures and thinkers of the times.
</P>
<P>
   Some will have a hard time swallowing Moynihan's profession of
political constancy. After all, this is a man who claims he was
``born a Democrat'' but worked for Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan was clearly anguished by the experience, however. In
retrospect, he rued his service, at least after the 1972 election,
by which time he knew, or at least suspected, the worst about the
administration. ``What do you call such a person?'' Moynihan says
of his failure to leave. ``A Moynihan, I suppose. A term suggestive
of moral and political failing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson mounts a stouter defense of some of his friend's other
noted stumblings. The most humbling was the searing public reaction
to the so-called Moynihan Report of 1965, which, using government
data, described for the first time the breakdown of
African-American families and urged ``national action'' to end the
poverty and unemployment at its root.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh response from liberals and black leaders devastated
Moynihan, who for years was branded by some as a racist, a charge
Hodgson painstakingly rejects.
</P>
<P>
   The biographer's account of Moynihan's ideas and bureaucratic
and ideological battles is dry history at times, but Hodgson
accomplishes his task. Welfare, tax, and Social Security reform?
They're all here. Moynihan's obsession with ethnicity, the poor,
the architecture of federal buildings? Well-documented, along with
his pioneering call for automobile safety, and his fights on behalf
of highway and mass transit systems and pork for his beloved New
York.
</P>
<P>
   What is lacking in ``The Gentleman from New York'' is the
personal and the colorful, perhaps a concession to the
Moynihan-Hodgson friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's pungent wit flashes but occasionally here, though
there is a illuminating anecdote about his gallant but futile 1975
fight at the United Nations to turn back a resolution that equated
Zionism with racism. After their defeat on the vote, Moynihan
embraced the Israeli representative, Chaim Herzog, and exclaimed:
``(Bleep) 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's the exception. Moynihan's mind, not his rich and
occasionally outrageous character, is the star of this work. Except
for the impact on Moynihan of the abandonment of his family by his
father, a drinker and gambler, when Moynihan was young, the book
offers little insight into his family life. Liz, his wife of 45
years, is generously portrayed, but plays less of a role in
Hodgson's book than she has as the guardrails of her husband's life
and career.
</P>
<P>
   Any reporter who has covered Moynihan at length has a story or
two about the senator's fondness of drink, but Hodgson, who has
hoisted a few with his chum, dispatches the issue in eight
paragraphs, deep into the book. Some stories are recounted, even a
suggestion that Moynihan's habits thwarted a run for president.
Hodgson, however, relies on his own experience. ``I have never seen
him, as the phrase goes, the worse for wear,'' he writes. Whatever
that means.
</P>
<P>
   But the few shortcomings of ``The Gentleman from New York'' are
more than offset by Hodgson's research, his insightful journalistic
compressions, and the enthusiasm with which he describes the rich
life, times, and ideas of his friend.

A CELEBRITY SPLIT WITH ADDED PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was about three years ago when, over a breakfast of coffee
and Camels, Anne Heche professed her love for Ellen DeGeneres.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one else I'd rather be a wife to,'' said Heche, who
was attending a New York press junket to promote her latest film,
``Wag the Dog.'' This was about seven months after DeGeneres and
Heche had made their relationship public on ``Oprah,'' and
DeGeneres appeared on the cover of Time with the headline, ``Yep,
I'm Gay,'' as her television character on the ABC comedy ``Ellen''
also came out, becoming the first openly-gay lead in TV history.
</P>
<P>
   Considering whether her relationship with DeGeneres would
undermine her burgeoning career, Heche said then, ``I think the
focus will start shifting again (to her acting). And if it doesn't,
there's nothing that's more of an honor or pleasure than to be
Ellen's wife. It's the greatest thing in the world to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the news that the much-discussed relationship has
ended.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, DeGeneres, 42, and Heche, 31, said,
``Unfortunately, we have decided to end our relationship. It is an
amicable parting, and we greatly value the 3 1/2 years we have
spent together.'' Both are said to be devastated by the break.
</P>
<P>
   In a certain sense, this is just another Hollywood relationship
come undone. Everyone knows that show-biz couples can go up in
flames faster than you can say ``Winona Ryder.'' But for those of
us in the lesbian and gay community, the news is especially sad.
For once they proclaimed their love, once they said their
relationship deserved to prosper in the light and not wither in the
shadows, DeGeneres and Heche became icons.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to singer Melissa Etheridge and her
longtime partner, filmmaker Julie Cypher, DeGeneres and Heche were
Hollywood's highest-profile same-sex couple. They quickly earned
the first names-only status of a Brad and Jennifer _ everyone knew
about Ellen and Anne, whether they wanted to or not. It was rare to
see one without the other, and they seemed to be one of the more
stable couples around.
</P>
<P>
   As if Hollywood coupledom isn't challenging enough _ heck, any
relationship anywhere can be tough _ DeGeneres and Heche shouldered
the added weight of becoming symbols of lesbian and gay America.
Yet they seemed to relish their roles. For every tony event where
they strolled the red carpet before the cameras and fans, they also
spoke against injustice and bigotry. They decried the senseless
murders of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr., both victims of
intolerance and ignorance in 1998. They talked about raising a
family, and championed the case for lesbian and gay marriage, even
saying they intended to get hitched legally once the law allowed
it.
</P>
<P>
   Back when their love was new, Heche shrugged off the notion that
her relationship with DeGeneres might derail her career _ the
inference being that no one would accept a lesbian actress playing
a romantic lead opposite a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so strange to me that someone would say I could have my
career taken away from me because I'm in love,'' said Heche, who
starred in ``Volcano,'' ``Walking and Talking,'' and ``Donnie
Brasco.'' ``When did careers and stardom become more important than
being in love with someone? Excuse me, but I get to go home, and
dance around my house holding hands every night, sitting in front
of a fire, and having a good meal. That's what I get, and I think
I'd rather have that than another job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people think we represent a love they've always wanted to
see represented,'' Heche marveled. ``Whoa!''
</P>
<P>
   This was a landscape without gravity since no one had ever done
what Heche was doing. When ``Six Days, Seven Nights,'' her film
with Harrison Ford, failed in 1998, some blamed Heche's sexuality,
although they seemed to ignore one aspect of the absurdity of Heche
and Ford as a couple was because he is old enough to be her father.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, Heche went from hot actress to ``the companion
of,'' better known for her personal life than her professional
abilities, and her career did seem to falter. She worked in small
films, and directed DeGeneres and Sharon Stone in a segment of ``If
These Walls Could Talk 2'' on HBO, as well as a documentary on
DeGeneres's return to stand-up comedy, but Heche's star had dimmed.
And once ``Ellen'' ended in 1998, DeGeneres's career stalled as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Whether their sidetracked careers had any bearing on their
decision to part, no one knows. I'm sure the details will spill out
in the weeks and days to come. But this I do know: In a nation
where lesbian and gay lives are still vilified, where famous folks
have been known to hold press conferences, appear on TV
newsmagazines, and buy full-page ads to proclaim their
heterosexuality, DeGeneres and Heche were our golden couple. It is
almost impossible to calculate how much these two women
accomplished simply by being themselves _ such a rarity in a town
built on pretense, and in a society which preciously guards its
lies.
</P>
<P>
   While we all know celebrities aren't better than the rest of us,
they do have a stage we don't enjoy. We think we know them, so
whether consciously or not, we're influenced by them, and I like to
think DeGeneres and Heche turned a few heads in a positive way.
Without question they were as important to furthering the cause of
gay and lesbian rights and visibility as Michael J. Fox has been in
bringing attention to Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Their love may have ended, but with their relationship, their
(itals)marriage,(unitals) DeGeneres and Heche blazed an indelible
trail, which said to the world what most gay and lesbian folks have
always recognized _ not only that our lives and relationships can
be beautiful, successful, and happy, but that they exist.

people who hold down full-time salaried positions, complete with

drones. The goal of an extreme telecommuter is to happily blur the
line between working and having an adventure, whether it is touring
Europe, scaling a mountain or pedaling a bike across the United
States. Such telecommuters are rare, of course. Still, some experts
suspect that the ranks of extreme telecommuters may slowly swell

`CONFLICT-FREE' DIAMONDS COULD BE A BOON TO CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ So you're ready to pop the question, but don't want
to present your sweetie with a diamond quarried from the killing
zones of Sierra Leone, Angola, or other blood-drenched corners of
Africa?
</P>
<P>
   Suitors trying to follow their consciences as much as their
hearts are having a tough time these days when it comes to
diamonds. In Africa, the precious stones have become a guerrilla's
best friend, with traffic in diamonds financing some of the
cruelest conflicts on that continent.
</P>
<P>
   An international controversy is building over the huge, illicit
trade, and _ as diamonds become increasingly linked in the public
mind to the hideous atrocities of rampaging rebels _ the sparkling
symbols of love might become as politically unacceptable as
slave-labor sneakers or whale soup.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing an opportunity as well as a potential problem, the
rapidly growing diamond mines of Canada's Northwest Territories
have responded with a first-of-a-kind program to guarantee to
consumers that a diamond has been mined, cut, and polished in the
only diamond-producing region of North America, and is thus
untainted by conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Microscopic polar bears and other northern symbols laser-etched
into the undersides of diamonds from the sparsely inhabited
territory, along with government certificates and a ``gem print''
as distinctive as a fingerprint, may soon mark that a Canadian
Arctic gem is not just pure crystalline carbon, but ethically pure
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to assure people that Northwest Territories diamonds
are genuine conflict-free diamonds. . . that no one got his arm
chopped off for these gems,'' said Resources Minister Joseph
Handley in an interview from Yellowknife, the territorial capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other region in the world has put such a program in
place,'' he said. ``But with (human) rights groups targeting
diamonds, this is the way all legitimate diamond producers will be
headed, putting out stones whose pedigree cannot be questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   A diamond is a diamond, its glory dependent on its size and the
skill with which it is cut and polished, not its place of origin.
Until recently, no one cared where a gem came from.
</P>
<P>
   But an international campaign against conflict gems, supported
by such high-profile human rights groups as Amnesty International,
is quickly building steam. The trade in illicit gems is fueling
bloody conflicts in at least six African nations.
</P>
<P>
   Such murderous insurgency movements as Sierra Leone's
Revolutionary United Front or Angola's Unita, or the United Nationa
Front for Total Independence of Angola, pay for hundreds of
millions of dollars worth of arms with diamonds mined in regions
under their control.
</P>
<P>
   Although highly trained geologists and diamond specialists can
usually tell the origin of rough diamonds, it is impossible for
consumers to know whether a cut and polished gem hails from Angola,
Australia, or anyplace else. Diamond buyers can count only on the
word of their jeweler, and as often as not, the jeweler has no clue
as to the true origin of a gemstone.
</P>
<P>
   DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd., which supplies more than 60
percent of the world's diamonds, is also considering ways of
certifying ``conflict free'' stones, but it is reluctant to brand
diamonds by place of origin because it mixes gems from Botswana,
South Africa, Russia, Australia, and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But the Northwest Territories, the new kid on the diamond block,
believes the world diamond industry needs to abandon the secrecy
with which it has traditionally done business and start guarding
its integrty with the same zeal it applies to protecting the value
of its gems. Annual world trade in rough diamonds is worth more
than $7 billion, while sales of finished diamonds total about $75
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new world out there, and we've seen entire industries _
Canada's 400-year-old fur industry is an example _ destroyed by
political activists,'' Handley said. ``Of course, most diamonds are
not blood diamonds. But the day is fast coming when the industry
will have to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials and diamond finishers in the territory also
see government certification of diamonds cut and polished in Canada
as a smart marketing move _ a way of promoting Northwest
Territories diamonds in the same way that Vermont certifies ``pure
Vermont'' maple syrup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to raise the profile of our Canadian Arctic diamonds.
We need to create a strong, special identity for Northwest
Territories stones,'' said Martin Irving, director of diamond
projects for the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The growing world controversy over so-called ``conflict gems''
is putting the spur to efforts of peaceable Canada to distinguish
its diamonds from those funneled into world markets by guerrilla
movements. The trade in so-called ``conflict gems'' is banned by
international law but very difficult to stamp out. By some
estimates, 10 percent of the 860 million diamonds cut and polished
every year are smuggled from African trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, we need a way to show consumers our diamonds are not
connected to any fighting and killing,'' said Frans Van Looy, vice
president of Alberta-based Deton'cho Diamonds, one of a handful of
Canadian companies that cut and polish gems from the Northwest
Territories.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Canada's diamond production was zero. Then in
1998 the giant Ekati diamond mine started operation, turning the
frigid Northwest Territories into a major diamond-producing region.
Ekati's annual yield is now more than 3.5 million carats of ``gem
quality'' (as opposed to industrial) diamonds. By 2004, when two
more mines are expected to open, the territory is expected to
produce 15 percent of the world's diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Ekati is already trying to project an image as a source of
uncontroversial gems. ``Dependable. Trustworthy. Pristine.
Natural,'' states an advertisement aimed at wholesalers. ``Ekati
Diamonds. A warm front just came in from Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the production flows as raw stones to Antwerp, Belgium,
center of the international diamond trade, but 10 percent of the
Canadian diamonds will be cut and polished by several small
companies in Yellowknife under an agreement forged between the
mine's corporate owners, the territory's aboriginal groups, and the
territorial government.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond producers in Canada say the mounting controversy makes
it imperative that gems from the Northwest Territories be certified
as to their origin. Tiny markings, visible only under a powerful
magnifying glass, are only part of the process; the government will
also provide a certificate and ``gemprint'' identification for each
gem under a program expected to be underway later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be able to show concerned buyers that our gems are
pure,'' said Van Looy. ``We hear all about diamonds from trouble
and turmoil. We hope to build an image of Canadian diamonds of
peace.''

&HT;     SAN FRANCISCO CLOSER TO IMPOSING `LIVING WAGE' LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ILENE LELCHUK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After two years of intense lobbying and delicate
negotiating, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors moved closer to
enacting a broad living wage law that would provide higher pay,
paid time off and _ eventually _ health benefits for more than
21,500 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time for me in about 20 years that I'll be
getting paid vacation and sick leave,'' home health care worker
Bruce Allison said Monday night after the supervisors' unanimous
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which must go before the board for a final,
largely procedural vote next week, requires city contractors,
nonprofit agencies and businesses at the San Francisco
International Airport, to pay workers at least $9 per hour when the
law takes effect _ possibly at the end of September. Wages will
jump to $10 per hour next year and be followed by 2.5 percent
raises for three more years.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives workers 12 paid days off for vacations and
holidays and allows them up to 10 unpaid days forfamily
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is a scaled-down version of the $11-per-hour rate
proposed by Supervisor Tom Ammiano two years ago and is the result
of a compromise negotiated by Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bittersweet thing,'' Ammiano said before the vote.
``Everyone knows it's not a living wage. It's still a minimum
wage.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Hermanson, the co-chairman of the Living Wage Coalition,
said the authors were careful not to call the plan a ``living
wage'' ordinance but a ``minimum compensation'' ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage in California is $5.75 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, San Francisco officials will draft a final
piece of the legislation that requires city contractors and
leaseholders to either give workers private health insurance, join
a city-run health insurance pool or pay the city an equivalent of
$1.25 per hour per employee, which will help fund the city's public
health system.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 20,000 workers who would benefit from the
higher wages, an estimated 10,000 to 14,000 do not have health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of political wrangling, Monday's victory was
anti-climactic. Only a couple of workers attended the board's
meeting and even the supervisors had little to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's been a difficult process and caught up in
politics and prolonged,'' said Ken Jacobs of the Living Wage
Coalition. ``We asked the mayor at the beginning of the year to
intervene and hammer out an agreement, but that was going slow.
Then we went out and collected signatures to put a measure ($11 per
hour) on the ballot, and in 2 1/2 weeks we collected 20,000
signatures. . . . Polling showed us that support for a living wage
was overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty other cities and counties have living wages laws that
generally apply to government employers and contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Under San Francisco's legislation, the city will help nonprofit
agencies cover the cost of increased wages through at least the
first year. Those agencies, provide services for the homeless and
mental health patients, will be exempt from the second-year raise
if the city cannot afford to help them without cutting other
services.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost of the plan to the city is highly uncertain,
although some estimates put it at $10 million per year.

   TIMBER _ NEWHILL, N.C. _ This southern corner of Wake County,
where suburban sprawl from nearby Raleigh and a local wood chip
mill are eliminating woodlands, illustrates the conclusion of a
controversial new study by timber management researchers. Rather
than solely blaming chip and pulp mills for depleting the South's
forests, the report from Duke and North Carolina State universities
said urban growth is also a significant cause of the shrinking
forests. On the eve of an industry conference Wednesday in Raleigh,
this finding heightens the sharp debate between the timber industry
and, on the other side, environmentalists and federal officials
concerned about the rapid acceleration of logging in the South. The
region is less regulated than the Pacific Northwest and, for the
first time, is harvesting soft woods such as pines faster than they
are being replaced. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

&HT;     ENVIRONMENTALISTS FEAR DEAL WOULD LEAD TO AIRPORT EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY and JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Powerful San Francisco politicians are
crafting legislation here and in Washington that would pay up to
$300 million to the Cargill Inc. to buy thousands of acres of
marshland in the San Francisco Bay, and possibly speed expansion of
San Francisco International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill is scaling back its salt operations to concentrate on
finer-grained salt used in drugs instead of food. As a result,
19,000 acres of valuable land are for sale, and the property could
become the one of largest environmental purchases in California
history.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are excited that the government is finally
moving to purchase and restore the huge salt ponds. But they do not
want the deal used as an excuse to rush approval of the airport
expansion, which could see more than 1,000 acres of the Bay filled
for new runways.
</P>
<P>
   For months, public officials have been floating the idea of a
possible purchase and restoration of salt ponds as mitigation for
any environmental damage the airport expansion might create.
</P>
<P>
   But state lawmakers deny the possible Cargill purchase is linked
to smoothing the way for the expansion. Nevertheless, a cadre of
San Francisco politicians has become keenly interested in the
government's purchase of the Cargill acreage near Newark and San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislature is considering spending $150 million to
buy the salt ponds, home to more than 70 species of waterfowl and a
staging area for migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is pursuing
another $150 million for Cargill _ but only if the state
legislature and Gov. Gray Davis approve California's half by the
end of next week, the final day of the 1999-2000 legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's airport representative, Stuart Sunshine, said the
city supported the legislation not because it might speed up the
airport expansion, but because ``it's an extraordinary opportunity
for the state of California to increase wetland habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings back to the Bay what was lost,'' Sunshine said.
``This is an opportunity to bring back up to 50 percent of the
habitat that supports wildlife in the Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Restoring the Cargill ponds for birds and wildlife and expanding
the San Francisco airport have been running on separate tracks for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, public officials have linked buying and
reinvigorating the Cargill property as a way to balance the
environmental damage created by enlarging the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The bill before the legislature, sponsored by Assemblywoman
Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, would clear the way for buying the
Cargill land but does not provide money to restore the area back to
its natural habitat for shorebirds. The bill, however, requires
restoration money to come from somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say they know where the money will come from:
The airport would provide more than $200 million it has available
for environmental restoration, offering the money in exchange for
damage done by dumping soil in the Bay for the new runways.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be viewed as one more step for approval to runway
expansion,'' said Bill Allayaud, state legislative director of the
Sierra Club. ``The worst that could happen is if the bill gets
amended to say the purchase would be mitigation for impacts from
SFO runway expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature, in fact, is paving the way for the airport to
restore the Cargill land _ if environmental officials decide that
is the best solution and if environmental laws are followed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Assembly approved a bill that gives legal clearance,
if needed, for the airport to pay for restoring the Cargill land to
make up for environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   The runway expansion would reduce the existing flight delays,
accommodate larger aircraft and the projected increase in passenger
and cargo traffic, and reduce noise, Sunshine said.

 CHRON  
 The Roving Feast: The Truth About Pesto   By Marlena Spieler  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 LONDON _  I found my sunglasses today just in time. Summer has
almost ended, and today is perhaps the second day my eyes have
needed shading. London has alternated between gray and rainy this
summer, although occasionally it's gotten really hot and muggy and
overcast before the rain begins again. It's disorienting to think
about which month, let alone which season, we are in.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those tortoise-shell, rather stylish sunglasses I bought in San
Francisco last spring haven't gotten the use I anticipated when I
rationalized the price of the purchase. True, I did manage to pull
them out for a sultry couple of days in Portofino but they've been
lying around since then.
</P>
<P>
   We were in Liguria taping material about pesto for the British
Broadcasting Co. when we got an invitation we couldn't refuse:
Would we like to stay a night at the Hotel Splendido?
</P>
<P>
   The Splendido is a hotel favored by the very famous and very
rich, although its history includes pillaging by pirates and
grazing by sheep. I love sheep. There are no sheep now, just lots
of designer labels. My sunglasses were right at home, though the
rest of me felt a bit shabby.
</P>
<P>
   Portofino is one of the most beautiful spots in the world,
recognizable by anyone who has ever glanced through a lifestyle
magazine that involves well-heeled travel, Italy or ``The Good
Life.'' The hotel is perched on a hill overlooking Portofino and
its bay. Little and not-so-little boats bob in the sea, and you can
look right down to its depths _ clear, emerald and azure.
</P>
<P>
   Splendido's swimming pool sits at the edge of the cliff, the
view of the sea at its horizon. It is like swimming in the sky. At
night, after cocktails on the terrace _ the Splendido's cocktail is
a version of the Bellini but with strawberries instead of peaches _
dinner outside afterward _ grilled vegetables, marinated fish,
pasta with pesto and green beans _ a little  &LR; de rigueur &LR;  checking
out of the nightlife, we go swimming again.
</P>
<P>
   One of our party _ I'm not naming names here _ went skinny
dipping. OK, it was my very dignified producer. I might have joined
in, but for that cellulite. I don't know . . . Portofino just does
something to a person.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Portofino is very friendly. I met a man responsible
for most of the pesto in Great Britain _ his basil fields lie east
of Portofino and he exports to almost every supermarket and deli in
Britain. In Italy, he handles most of the country's pickles and
pickled vegetables. He promises to send me some. He is charming and
warm. And I know from talking to him that we must have something in
common. ``Were you in Berkeley in the '70s?'' he asks. ``I went to
the university there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pesto is everywhere these days, so much so that it is hard to
remember when it wasn't. We're so used to cilantro pesto and wild
thyme pesto and sundried tomato pesto and green chile pesto that
it's easy to forget its origins: Liguria, and basil.
</P>
<P>
   And it's easy to forget just how wonderful traditional freshly
made pasta al pesto can be. If you haven't had the real thing
lately or _  &LR; mamma mia! &LR;  _ ever, it is a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Pasta al Pesto the Ligurian Way &LR;
</P>
<P>
   My first pesto was prepared under the guidance of a basil grower
at the Alemany Farmers' Market years ago. I've been making _ and
eating _ it ever since. Here are my secrets, refined in the basil
fields of Liguria, the restaurant kitchens of Portofino and Santa
Margarita, and the kitchen of olive grower Carlo Isnardi, who
prepares lunch for his staff every day, in between running an
empire.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Good basil. &LR;  Use basil with lots of flavor, preferably
Ligurian basil with its true basil flavor rather than the taste of
anise or mint. Some Genoans add a tablespoon or two of cooked
spinach, squeezed of its excess moisture. This gives color, but I
prefer a basil-only flavor for this speciality.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Don't toast the pine nuts. &LR;  The Italians don't and their
pesto can't be faulted in my opinion. If you like the flavor of
toasted pine nuts (I do!) sprinkle them over the dish afterward. In
some areas of Liguria, walnuts replace the pine nuts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Add a tablespoon or two of the pasta-cooking water. &LR;  This is
the magic ingredient for almost all pasta dishes. It connects the
pasta to the sauce and keeps everything succulent and moist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ The right pasta. &LR;  Traditional shapes for pesto include
trofie, or twists that taper out to the ends with a chubby part in
the middle. They can be either small or very small, and are chewy
and delicious and perfect for pesto. Trenette, tagliatelle and
other flat fettuccinelike noodles are traditional and delicious.
</P>
<P>
   I sometimes use wonton wrappers as they are silky and delicate;
just don't cook them more than a minute or two. Gnocchi also are
terrific with pesto.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Traditional cooking. &LR;  Whichever pasta you choose, prepare it
in the traditional way with a little chopped potato and a handful
of green beans in the cooking water.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Balance the basil with a little tuft of parsley. &LR;  Also, add a
bit of pecorino cheese to the Parmesan; it's sharper and sheepier
than Parmesan.  &LR; Pecora &LR;  means sheep; the cheese is made from ewe's
milk.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Don't listen to the Ligurians when it comes to garlic. &LR;  Some
Ligurians don't add garlic to their pesto. I've gone easy with the
garlic in today's recipe _ add more to suit yourself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Use Ligurian olive oil if you can. &LR;  It is amazing how using
an oil from a different region _ even a delicious oil that you love
for other purposes _ just takes over your pesto. A Ligurian oil
makes your pesto taste of the region in which it was born.
</P>
<P>
   The exception to this is nicoise oil _ it is light and flowery
and fragrant and quite good in pesto, as it is used in its cousin
basil sauce, the pistou of Nice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Don't worry about using a mortar and pestle. &LR;  While the pesto
will come out with a greater character and texture made by hand, it
is hard work, takes a lot longer, cannot really be made for a crowd
and will put off only the most dedicated of pestle pounders. Almost
everyone in Liguria uses a food processor these days, even the most
traditional of olive oil producers, basil growers, pesto makers and
chefs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ One last note. &LR;  Some people add a knob of butter or a bit of
crumbled Gorgonzola or goat cheese at the end. Delicious, but not
when I'm in a pesto-purity state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; PASTA WITH PESTO
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 medium potato, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   Big pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces pasta: trofie, trenette, tagliatelle, gnocchi or other
pasta
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 pound very thin green beans such as French haricots
verts, or thinly sliced Blue Lake or Kentucky Wonder beans
</P>
<P>
   Ligurian Pesto (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Parmesan cheese for grating, as desired
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large pot with water then add the potato and a generous
pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. The small potato
pieces should be nearly done. If they aren't, cook until they are.
</P>
<P>
   Add the pasta to the cooking water and boil until it is about
two thirds of the way to al dente. Add the green beans and cook
until the pasta is al dente and the beans are bright green and
crisp-tender. The cooking time depends on how big your pasta is, as
well as the size of the green beans.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the pasta and beans, reserving about 1/2 cup of the
cooking liquid. Stir this liquid into the pesto, then toss it all
together with the pasta and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Serve right away in soup bowls with cheese for grating at the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 &LR; LIGURIAN PESTO
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   3 cups (packed) basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   15 parsley sprigs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, preferably Ligurian
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup freshly grated pecorino cheese
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the garlic and pine nuts in a food processor and whirr
until the nuts are well broken up. Add half of the basil and
process until pureed. Add the remaining basil, the parsley and oil.
Process until the mixture turns into a thickish green sauce. If it
is too thin, add more basil or parsley; if too thick, add more oil.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the Parmesan and pecorino, then season with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Store in the refrigerator covered with a layer of olive oil for
up to 2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yields enough for 4 servings of pasta.

SPAGHETTINI WITH BACON, SPINACH &AMP; CHERRY TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   If you're not in the mood for pesto, here's a great alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces bacon (preferably unsmoked) or pancetta, diced
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil + olive oil to taste
</P>
<P>
   5 garlic cloves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 green onions (white and most of the green part), thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   16 cherry tomatoes, quartered or halved
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chicken stock, or vegetable or porcini stock (water
mixed with a not-too-salty bouillon cube is OK, too)
</P>
<P>
   Several handfuls of fresh spinach leaves, coarsely torn
</P>
<P>
   1 pound spaghettini
</P>
<P>
   Salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper, a generous amount
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Handful of fresh basil leaves, torn
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Brown the bacon in a heavy skillet over medium-low heat, cooking
it slowly to render the fat and crisp it up a bit. Using a slotted
spoon, transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain.
</P>
<P>
   Discard the bacon fat in the pan. Wipe out the pan if the bits
clinging to the bottom are overly browned; if they look crisp and
yummy, leave them in. Add the olive oil to the pan, then half the
garlic and half the green onions. Cook over high heat for a few
moments, then toss in the cherry tomatoes and cook, letting them
sizzle and saute for a few minutes. Pour in the wine and boil until
it reduces to about 2 tablespoons. Add the stock and cook a few
minutes longer, or until this cooks down to a lovely intensely
flavored sauce. Add the spinach, cover, and cook for 1 minute, then
toss together, cover again, and remove from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the spaghettini in a large pot of boiling salted water
until it is al dente, then drain, reserving the cooking water.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the drained pasta into the sauce, along with the remaining
garlic and green onions. Season with salt and pepper. Add a few
tablespoons of the hot cooking water and toss again. Top with the
cheese, basil and the reserved bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon into bowls and serve with extra olive oil for each person
to pour on as desired.

 Wine Potpourri: Colorado's Come a Long Way From Rocky Mountain 
 Kool Aid  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; In the 1970s, Colorado was an unusual outpost for
a wine writer. But there I was. Colorado had plenty of wine
drinkers then, even though ``Rocky Mountain Kool-Aid'' (Coors beer)
had a lock on the state beverage business. Wine lovers had a choice
of wine stores in Denver where prices for California wines were
better than in California.
<P>
   But there was only one winery in Colorado then, owned by an
overly confident orthodontist who was convinced that Coloradans
were ready for Colorado wine.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, in those days Ivancie Cellars wines were made from
California-grown grapes, shipped _ at great expense _ across two
mountain ranges in refrigerated trucks. Coloradans were curious
about Gerald Ivancie's wines, but not curious enough to pay more
than they would for California wines.
</P>
<P>
   Wine buffs also were interested in Colorado wines, so I wrote a
magazine story about Ivancie, which launched me from a part-time
general interest free-lance writer to a full-time career in wine
writing for magazines and the Rocky Mountain News.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Colorado's budding wine industry lurched forward
slowly, but now things are changing rapidly. Today, according to
the Colorado Wine Industry Development Board, the state boasts 27
active wineries, with two new ones soon to open. There also are
seven tasting rooms, many offering a range of Colorado wines.
</P>
<P>
   While you might think that Colorado is too cold to grow premium
wine grapes, popular varieties like Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon
and Merlot are grown. Most of the wine-grape acreage is in Grand
Valley and Delta-Montrose, two of the state's four wine regions.
Grand Valley is Colorado's only AVA (American Viticultural Area).
</P>
<P>
   In terms of wineries, the largest Colorado wine region is Grand
Valley, between Grand Junction and Glenwood Springs. The Front
Range, running along the eastern edge of the Rockies from Loveland
to Denver, is next, followed by Delta and Montrose counties in the
triangular region between Grand Junction, Aspen and Montrose.
</P>
<P>
   There also are wineries in the Central Rockies region, spread
out between Steamboat Springs and Aspen, and in the Southern
Rockies, mainly around Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest region is Four Corners, with one winery in Cortez
and one tasting room in Durango.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Colorado's wineries are small family-owned operations,
producing a range of grape wines and fruit wines such as cherry,
plum and peach. Colorado also has the Rocky Mountain Meadery,
offering a range of Meads, or honey wines.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado is a cool-climate growing area, so the grape wines are
closer in style to those of Washington than California. Chardonnays
are leaner, with refreshing crisp acidity, while the Merlots are
more robust and fruit-forward, similar in style to Washington
Merlot.
</P>
<P>
   For now, only Plum Creek Cellars and Canyon Wind Cellars ship to
the California market. For more information about Colorado wines
and a free Colorado Wine Country Tours brochure, call (720)
304-3406.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cognac Sales Up &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many wine drinkers shy away from the ``hard stuff,'' especially
grain spirits, but on occasion they enjoy grape spirits like
Cognac. Generally considered the most sophisticated grape spirit,
Cognac is popular with Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Cognac Bureau in New York reports that for the sixth
consecutive year, the United States is the No. 1 market for Cognac
worldwide. A peak of 35.8 million bottles in 1999 catapulted the
United States ahead of more traditional export markets like France
and the United Kingdom. The United States is even ahead of Japan, a
blossoming market for Cognac in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dewar's New Whisky &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here's an idea for early holiday shoppers with a Scotch drinker
on their list. Dewar's, the top-selling brand of Scotch in the
United States, will release Dewar's 12 Year Old, its first new
blended whisky in 40 years with an age statement. The new Dewar's
is a unique blend of 12-year-old single malt and grain whiskies,
which is mellowed in oak casks. It will be available in early
September for $30 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kiwi Wines Looking Good &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wine Institute of New Zealand reports in its annual Vintage
Survey that the 2000 harvest is the biggest ever for the New
Zealand wine industry. The 2000 harvest came in at 88,100 tons,
just a little more than the 87,700 tons from 1999. Chardonnay,
Pinot Noir, Merlot and Riesling all saw dramatic increases in yield
in 2000, while Sauvignon Blanc, the country's best-known wine, was
off 25 percent. Early signs indicate the quality of the 2000 wines
to be very high.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ever open a bottle of wine and notice tiny crystals sticking to
the bottom of the cork? Don't worry, these wine ``diamonds,'' as
they sometimes are called, are just tartaric acid that has
precipitated from the wine and hardened. Once thought by some to be
ground glass, these crystals, or tartrates, are harmless and
tasteless. Wipe any crystals from the opening of the bottle and
enjoy the wine. Tartaric deposits from winemaking are used to
produce cream of tartar.

 Cook's Books: Purdy Offers Advice and Strives to Demystify
Pie  Making  By Amber Thompson 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; ``Homemade pies of all flavors are on their way to
becoming a lost art,'' writes Susan G. Purdy in ``The Perfect
Pie.''
<P>
   In an attempt to avert such a national disaster, Purdy tries to
show that pie making can be fun and simple. In this revision of her
1985 out-of-print book, ``As Easy as Pie,'' Purdy offers more than
125 recipes that span the seasons and the pastry spectrum, from
pies to crisps to tarts. With easy-to-read recipes and time-saving
tips, Purdy strives to demystify pie crusts and prove that you can
bake mouth-watering pies just like grandma's.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy has been teaching pastry and pie-making classes for the
past 15 years. With exacting detail and helpful analogies, she
shows readers how to make the perfect All-Purpose Flaky Pastry. For
example, she instructs the baker to cut the butter into the flour
until ``the mixture resembles dry rice,'' and to stop adding water
when the dough feels ``pliable like clay.'' She also provides
helpful drawings that make it easy to execute tasks like rolling
the dough or fluting the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Though Purdy's basic pie crust recipe is a keeper, the
variations are hit and miss. The electric mixer method yielded a
crust that cracked when baked. An orange crust had a flavor so
subtle it was hardly worth the extra effort.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the addition of sharp cheddar cheese to the
Old-Fashioned Apple Pie crust was a success. The shredded cheese
melted into the dough to produce a puff-pastry-like crust that
paired well with the tart, cinnamon-sweet apples.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy's pie fillings, however, do not compare to grandma's best.
Of the four pies tested, only one, the Classic Apple Pie, met
expectations. The other pie flavors and fillings were off-balance,
either in sweetness, tartness or sheer height.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Lawrence's Blackberry Pie was overly sweet, though the
recipe did propose a clever tip for softening the seeds: cook the
blackberries in a little cider vinegar. Green Tomato Pie was too
acidic to pass for dessert and left a starchy aftertaste. And
though the custard in Purdy's Lemon Meringue Pie struck a nice
balance between sweet and tart, the recommended addition of coconut
in the cookie crust tipped the scales, making it too sweet.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the apple pie, Purdy's pie fillings were
minimal. Both the Blackberry and Green Tomato Pie baked flat.
Similarly, although Purdy's lemon meringue topping reached
phenomenal heights, there wasn't enough custard to give visual and
textural balance to the pie.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these flaws, Purdy's Old-Fashioned Apple Pie could rival
any county fair's gold-medal winner. The best part of this pie was
its height. Purdy instructs the pie maker to ``carefully arrange
the apple slices, building up a compact, neat dome.'' This method
prevents the formation of air pockets that can cause the top crust
to fall. Other helpful hints include brushing the bottom crust with
an egg wash and sprinkling it with cornflake crumbs. Both are
sure-fire tricks to preventing soggy crusts.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book, Purdy offers advice from her years of
baking and teaching. Recipes such as Blackberry Mascarpone Pie,
Cranberry Pecan Pie, and Reduced-Fat Mississippi Mud Pie all have
baking tips to encourage success. She also provides extensive
research on freezing pies so you can have a homemade dessert any
time.
</P>
<P>
   Though not all of Purdy's pies are perfect, this cookbook can
help you become an expert piecrust maker. So, next time you're in
the mood to bake, combine Purdy's crust with your grandma's
favorite filling and you just might have the perfect pie.

   1/2 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or white distilled vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 tablespoons ice water, or as needed
</P>
<P>
   Egg Glaze: 1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup plain cracker crumbs (optional)
</P>
<P>
   The Filling
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 large Granny Smith, Greening or other flavorful apples
(or a combination), peeled and sliced 1/8 inch thick (6 to 8 cups
slices)
</P>
<P>
   1/3 to 1/2 cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 large lemon
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 1 teaspoon nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 1 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut up (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Granulated sugar for topping
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; To make the crust:  &LR; Combine the flour, salt and optional
sugar in a large bowl and whisk to blend. Add the butter and
shortening. Working quickly and lightly, pinch and slide lumps of
dough between your fingertips until the mixture resembles dry rice.
</P>
<P>
   Add the cheese, egg yolk, lemon juice and the minimum amount of
ice water. Take care not to overwork the dough, lest you develop
its elasticity. Lightly toss the dough until it just begins to
cling together in clumps but has not begun to form a ball. Sprinkle
on a tiny bit more water if the dough looks too dry. The dough
should cling together and feel pliable like clay, but not be
sticky.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the dough out onto a sheet of wax paper. Lift the paper's
opposite corners and press them together, squeezing the dough into
a cohesive ball. Divide in half and flatten the dough into 2
six-inch disks. Wrap each disk in wax paper and refrigerate for at
least 30 minutes before rolling, but the longer the better _ up to
several hours or even overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate. Roll out half
of the dough to a 12-inch-diameter circle and place in the pie
plate. Trim a 1/2-inch pastry overhang. To moisture-proof the lower
crust, brush with egg glaze and/or sprinkle with crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble the pie:  &LR; Put the apples into a large bowl. Add the
sugar, lemon juice, flour and spices; toss well. Carefully arrange
the apples in the pastry-lined pan, building up a compact, neat
dome. Compress the dome to be sure it is stable. Dot with the
butter, if using. Brush egg glaze over the edge of the lower crust.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out the top crust and fit it over the fruit. Trim a
3/4-inch overhang. Fold the edge under the bottom crust and pinch
them together to seal, making a raised rim all around. Flute the
edge as desired. Cut vent holes in the top. Brush the top of the
pie with egg glaze and sprinkle with the topping sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Set the pie in the lower third of the preheated oven and bake
for 12 to 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees, raise the pie
to the center of the oven, and bake for an additional 40 to 45
minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the fruit is
tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. Check the pie halfway
through the baking time and cover with a foil frame if necessary to
prevent overbrowning. Cool the pie on a wire rack.
</P>
<P>
   Serve warm, accompanied by slices of sharp cheddar cheese or
vanilla ice cream, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8.

 Taster's Choice: Nabisco Nips the Rest in Cheese Cracker Test  By Robin Davis  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Summer parties require snacks, but when we don't
have time to make them, the snack aisle at the supermarket has
plenty of choices.
<P>
   Today's panel tasted nine different baked cheddar cheese snack
crackers. They all had their favorites, but preferences varied.
Some noted their kids would like certain crackers, while they
preferred others.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nabisco Cheese Nips &LR;  (13.5 ounces, $2.69 at Safeway) came in
first, though only one panelist picked it as his favorite,
describing the cheese flavor as the best of those tasted. Others
liked the salt and cheese balance, but one person felt the cheese
flavor was too mild. Three would buy it and two might.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Pepperidge Farms Goldfish &LR;  (6 ounces,
$1.79 at Andronico's). Two panelists picked these crackers as their
favorite. Most of the panelists liked the cute shape and
crunchiness, but two detected a burned bitter flavor. Three would
buy it, one might buy it and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nabisco Better Cheddars &LR;  (7 ounces, $2.99 at many supermarkets)
came in third. One taster described it as a good ``cocktail
cracker'' and others liked the cheese flavor and crunch. But two
panelists dissented, one saying it was greasy and the other writing
that it needed more ``bite.'' Two would buy it, one might buy it
and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nabisco Cheese Nips Air Crisps &LR;  (7 ounces, $2.99 at
Andronico's) took fourth place. One panelist loved the crunchy
thinness and the flavor, which she compared to macaroni and cheese.
But others thought the crackers were too bland, though most liked
the exceptional crispness. Two would buy it and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place was a tie between  &UR; Sunshine Cheeze-It &LR;  (10 ounces,
$2.79 at many supermarkets) and  &UR; Pepperidge Farms Xtra Cheddar &LR; 
 &UR; Goldfish &LR;  (8 ounces, $1.99 at Safeway). Both crackers scored just
two points lower than the Air Crisps.
</P>
<P>
   Two panelists thought the Cheeze-Its tasted too sharp and
burned. One of them also noted that the cracker was flaky but not
crisp. Others liked the flavor and thought the cracker had a decent
crunch. One would buy it, two might buy it and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Three panelists disliked the saltiness of the Xtra Cheddar
Goldfish, but some liked the flavor they described as ``zesty.''
One panelist thought the crackers tasted slightly spicy, but not
like cheese. One would buy it, two might buy it and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Keebler Munch 'ems, Safeway and Hain
Crispettes, but they scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Meryl Bennan, consultant and food writer; John P.
Carroll, cookbook author; Shelley Handler, consultant and food
writer; Roland Passot, chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and
Left Bank in Larkspur and Menlo Park; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner,
Cafe Kati, San Francisco. A perfect score for any prduct would be
100. All products are tasted blind.

casual stroll turns up culinary treasures. &HT;     
 Food Lovers' Walks: The Mission Changes But the Flavors Remain   By Tara Duggan  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Without a doubt, economic changes in the Mission
are pushing out many working-class people. And some in the
neighborhood worry that its traditional Latino culture could fade.
<P>
   Still, many parts of the district remain rich in the color and
culture that makes the Mission District one of the city's best
areas for food lovers to explore. For example, 24th Street is an
absolute mecca for lovers of Mexican and Central American foods but
remains undiscovered by many in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there are people like August &LR; i &LR; n Gayt &LR; a &LR; n to get the
word out. A chef and Mexican cooking instructor who was born in San
Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Gayt &LR; a &LR; n recently began offering the
culinary tours designed for his students to the public. Earlier
this month, I asked him to guide me through the neighborhood's
culinary haunts.
</P>
<P>
   Gayt &LR; a &LR; n's tour begins a few blocks away from San Francisco
General Hospital and heads west along 24th Street, ending at Treat
Street. The blocks near the walk's beginning house three of the
area's oldest establishments, evoking an era when the neighborhood
was home to immigrants from Ireland and Italy as well as Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; St. Francis Fountain &AMP; Candy Store &LR;  (established in 1918),
still serves homemade ice cream and sodas at beautiful old wooden
booths;  &UR; Roosevelt Tamale Parlor &LR;  has been steaming tamales since
it was founded by a Dutchman in 1922; and  &UR; Casa Sanchez &LR;  started as
a tortilla factory in 1924, but it now sells its fresh chips and
salsas in supermarkets around the Bay Area. For the past 35 years
it's also been a taqueria, and its sunny back patio is a great
place to eat burritos and sample chips and salsa.
</P>
<P>
   These are all popular stops, but Gayt &LR; a &LR; n's focus is on the
places that aren't as well known to people outside the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   His starting point is  &UR; La Palma Mexicatessen &LR; . One of the few
places that grinds its own corn to create fresh masa for its
delicious tortillas and tamales, La Palma is a true Bay Area gem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corn is as central to Mexican cuisine as meat is to European
cuisines,'' explains Gayt &LR; a &LR; n, striding past the back food counter
where employees keep rhythm with the slap-slap-slap of hands
forming thick, rough-edged tortillas. Gayt &LR; a &LR; n plucks one off the
 &LR; comal &LR;  (griddle) to try _ asking first, of course. It's so hot I
have to wait a few moments before biting into the grainy tortilla,
sweet with corn but smoky from the griddle.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop is  &UR; Casa Lucas Market &LR; , one of the Bay Area's best
sources for Latin-American food specialties. Inside, Gayt &LR; a &LR; n waves
a hand over a bounty of  &LR; limoncitas &LR;  _ tiny, sweet Mexican limes
that he recommends for margaritas. The wooden stalls are piled with
more hard-to-find produce _ yuca,  &LR; nopales &LR;  (prickly pear cactus
paddle) and fresh herbs like epazote (traditionally used to help in
bean digestion). Gayt &LR; a &LR; n crushes the herb in his fingers to point
out its unusual, kerosene-like scent.
</P>
<P>
   Just as impressive are the shelves of prepared products ranging
from delicacies like canned  &LR; cuitlacoche &LR;  (corn fungus), Mexican
sodas, frozen tropical fruit purees, and a rainbow of dried beans,
herbs and chiles. This is also the place to pick up cooking
equipment like tortilla presses and  &LR; molcajetes &LR;  (mortars used to
grind spices).
</P>
<P>
   Next stop is  &UR; La Gallinita Meat Market &LR; , tucked behind a small
food counter that Gayt &LR; a &LR; n says is especially popular on Sundays,
when patrons enjoy menudo at a long communal table. The market
offers Mexican cuts of meat like that for carne asada, which is
traditionally cut thinner and with the grain. It also carries
specialty items like  &LR; queso de puerco &LR;  (head cheese), Mexican
cheeses and aged, housemade sausages.
</P>
<P>
   Half a block west we take a break to wander though Balmy Alley,
lined almost end-to-end with colorful murals painted by local
artists. If you have the time, guided tours offered through
 &UR; Precita Eyes Mural Arts and Visitors Center &LR;  (around the corner on
24th Street), help explain the political messages behind the
powerful images.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while the bright paintings are interrupted by a
shock of fuchsia bougainvillea or a tall cactus poking its head
over a wooden fence. ``When people come on this tour,'' says
Gayt &LR; a &LR; n, ``they feel like they have visited another country.''
</P>
<P>
   When we sit down on the red vinyl seats at  &UR; Izalco &LR; , a small
Salvadorean restaurant with bright tropical fruit tablecloths, it's
time to eat. Soon come fruity aguas frescas and  &LR; pupusas &LR; , thick
tortilla-like cakes oozing with melted cheese and served alongside
marinated cabbage. Then comes fried yuca, textured and nutty, next
to large chunks of chicarron and a savory salsa. Crisp plantains
with refried beans and crema is a classic combination of sweet and
savory, and the sauteed shrimp are simple and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   As it nears time to leave, we hear bells ringing, and Gayt &LR; a &LR; n
guesses they must be from the newly renovated St. Peters church
across the street. A neighborhood fixture since 1885, the church
burned down in 1997. It is the first time Gayt &LR; a &LR; n has heard the
bells since the church reopened, and it's hard not imagine them as
a sign of very good things happening in the Mission.

 Secrets of Success: Culture-Bending Salad   By Michael Bauer 
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Few appetizers are as refreshing and delicious as
the melon salad at Ponzu.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a marvelous concoction created by John Beardsley. Chunks of
watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe are bathed in lemongrass
dressing made with lemon and lime juice, ginger and a secret
ingredient: Thai fish sauce. A contrasting crunch is added by a
sprinkling of peanuts and shavings of the watermelon rind.
</P>
<P>
   Many dishes at Ponzu have an equally creative twist. Beardsley
interprets the cuisines and techniques of several Asian countries
and combines them with the best of California ingredients. For
example, the menu might include: from Korea, grilled flatiron steak
dotted with sesame seeds; from Vietnam, paper-thin slices of raw
beef carpaccio accented with mint, cucumber and peanuts; from
China, sticky hoisin ribs, and from Japan, seared tuna.
</P>
<P>
   The interior, like the food, gently bends cultures. The
impressive curved bar near the entrance has fish aquariums built
into the back wall. A curved ramp rises gently to the main dining
area. The area in back, draped in shimmering fabric, helps to
dampen the sound and adds a cozy feel.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Ponzu, 401 Taylor St. (at O'Farrell), San Francisco; (415) &LR; 
 &LR; 775-7979. Open for breakfast weekdays; dinner 5-10 p.m. &LR; 
 &LR; Monday-Thursday, 5 p.m.-midnight Friday and Saturday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECRETS OF SUCCESS

<P>
   &UR; _ Thai fish sauce. &LR;  This background flavor gives the dressing a
complexity that balances the sweet fruit and tart citrus.

   &UR; _ Watermelon rind. &LR;  The shaved rind has a texture not unlike
fennel and adds a pleasant crunch to the salad.

<P>
   Grated zest of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   Leaves from 1/2 bunch Thai basil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped toasted peanuts
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Combine the sugar, water, ginger, lemongrass and lime leaves
in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the
sugar. Immediately remove from heat and let stand for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Strain through a fine sieve into a bowl. Add the lemon juice,
lime juice, fish sauce and chile; mix well. Let cool to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the salad:  &LR; Using a potato peeler or a sharp knife,
remove the green rind from the watermelon. Cut away the white flesh
and thinly slice it. Cut the red flesh into large dice (discard
seeds, if desired) and place in a large bowl, along with the slices
of white.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the cantaloupe and honeydew into large dice and add to the
watermelon. Add the lemon zest and basil leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle the dressing over the fruit and let stand for at least
10 minutes, but no longer than 2 hours. This resting time allows
the flavors to soak into the melon.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish with the peanuts just before serving.

<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; LONDON _  &LR; A number of years ago I had a brilliant idea: Let's go to
Europe for a year!
<P>
   So I packed up my daughter and moved to London for an adventure
_ sort of a grown-up exchange program. As life would have it, that
year turned into more than a decade _ so far _ and our lives became
bicontinental.
</P>
<P>
   Being based in London means that we can enjoy the varied
cultures of Europe, sometimes at a moment's notice because it's all
so close. A pilgrimage to Greece to bless the olives, to France for
truffle-hunting, Bulgaria for yogurt, Italy for anything, or to
Spain for a  &LR; matanza &LR;  (don't even ask, but it involves making
sausages and hams afterward).
</P>
<P>
   My passport is always ready; so are my knife and fork. And
everywhere I go, each person I meet, the meals I enjoy, I often
find a Bay Area connection.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, my Parisienne friend Paule teaches cooking and
leads food tours of Paris, largely filled with people from the Bay
Area who want to know the gastronomical secrets of the City of
Light. She e-mails me, ``You must meet my student _ she makes
cheese in Petaluma!'' Legendary baker Lionel Poilane walks me
through his bakery, then says: ``Ah, do you know Alice (Waters)?''
</P>
<P>
   My Genovese pesto and pickle king, Giuseppe, went to the
University of California at Berkeley _ we meet over truffled
pizzettas to discuss the Bay Area. Near Sienna a restaurateur tells
me, ``Last week I had a San Francisco doctor visiting _ I taught
him to make  &LR; malfatti &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In Liguria, the olive presser looks up from the pressing stone
being pulled by his lovely little donkey, Valentina. ``California?
Give my regards to Daryl Corti!''
</P>
<P>
   A fellow food writer in London tells me he once worked at
Berkeley's KPFA; and in a ceramics workshop in Umbria, the owner
points to a pallet of brightly colored pottery. ``For Francis Ford
Coppola _ good movies! Good wine!''
</P>
<P>
   At a Slow Food convivium in London we meet Greek olive oil guru
Sotiris Kitrilakis, a former Bay Area resident whose oil (and
roasted peppers) for many years were the flavors of my life. He now
lives in Thessaloniki and exports exquisite Greek cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   I see Asian cooking authority Ken Hom in P &LR; e &LR; rigueux, France.
He's moved there from Berkeley, stir-frying up great dishes of
traditional Chinese with his distinctive California touch _ citrus
added to pork, tomato sauce to his spring rolls, a nubbin of goat
cheese to his wontons. He confesses he misses Mexican food. I do,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the good people of P &LR; e &LR; rigueux want me to open a
restaurant serving Bay Area food. ``It's so much fun to eat in this
style, not stuffy!''
</P>
<P>
   Paris already has the trendy Cafe Marly _ close your eyes so you
can't see the Louvre to your left or the Eiffel Tower to your right
_ go by the menu and you'll think you are in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The food-loving world out there is populated with people who
have been to and fallen in love with the Bay Area, and eaten their
way around gleefully, happily, enthusiastically. They are as
enchanted with us as we are with them.
</P>
<P>
   We, of course, have long been influenced and inspired by Europe:
cheeses, olives, patisserie and wine. Chocolate, too _ when
Scharffen Berger launched its gorgeous chocolate, co-owner Dr.
Robert Steinberg went to France to train in the art of
chocolate-making.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area French chefs are innovative and classic; our food
writers/ teachers commute between California and Europe; and,
outside of Italy, could any place be more  &LR; Italiano &LR;  than North
Beach?
</P>
<P>
   Our shops are wildly varied, too _ Greek, Armenian, Moroccan,
Spanish, Portuguese, as well as our many Asian and Latin American
ones. And Indian flavors! Not only via India, but via Great
Britain, too. Not long ago I had an excellent  &LR; masala &LR;   &LR; dosa &LR;  in
Cupertino; the turbaned waiter was from my European neck of the
woods _ Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   This cosmopolitan flair is nothing new; our traditions go back
to the Gold Rush _ sourdough bread and wonderful Italian bakeries,
Italian and French grand dining, Basque boarding houses, Italian
and Spanish family-style restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Like Europeans, we in the Bay Area not only like to eat (and
drink) well, we like to talk about food, too. Before, during and
after.
</P>
<P>
   We give careful consideration to the subject. Where is the best
place for bread? Should the salad be served first or last? Do you
prefer black or white truffles?
</P>
<P>
   When I got into my first discussion about where to eat dinner in
Paris I felt right at home. My family can argue about (``discuss'')
where to go for dinner until it is time for breakfast the next day.
</P>
<P>
   I'm doing my best to help the British develop in this
department. Not long ago it was considered impolite to show too
much interest in what was being eaten. I'm told that even now the
Queen forbids two things at the table _ the first is mention of the
food and the second is garlic. I suspect that my invitation to
Buckingham Palace will be a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   But change is all around, even if it is taking a while to filter
down. The food revolution that gripped California several decades
ago has finally come to Britain, and people are paying attention _
sometimes quite a bit _ to what goes into their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived, no one was barbecuing vegetables. Now the
British grill vegetables and fish and chicken as quickly as they
once threw horrible ``beefburgers'' and scary sausages onto the
flames, although they often need to hold an umbrella over the
barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   While I have missed certain tastes from home _ Peet's and
Graffeo coffee, tamales, garlic-stuffed olives, House of Bagels
bagels, even a roll or two of Lifesavers (though we often tuck a
box of See's into our carry-on) _ I've come to appreciate many
foods here.
</P>
<P>
   One is Marmite, that brown sticky salty paste, which many claim
is an acquired taste. We acquired it pretty easily _ I'm such a
sucker for anything salty. Oatcakes are another slightly odd treat
_ rich crackers made from oats, to be eaten with good artisanal
cheese. There are chocolates filled with violet fondant, delicious
in a perfume-y sort of way, and no one, but no one makes fish and
chips like the British.
</P>
<P>
   The bacon here is amazing, and comes in a huge variety: streaky,
lean, sweet-smoked, unsmoked. The sausages are OK if you think of
them as something completely different than sausage made from meat.
It's bread _ and lots of it _ that gives it that distinctive taste
and texture.
</P>
<P>
   But don't talk to me about the black currant drink Ribena, salad
cream (revolting); mushy peas, smoothies served kind of warm,
tasteless baked goods and stodgy puddings, gravy that tastes only
of salt.
</P>
<P>
   Living in Britain I have discovered many things, some nice and
some not so. I noticed that unlike Americans, there was no bias in
Britain against the overweight. As a lifelong plump person, I found
this utterly delightful.
</P>
<P>
   Any bias against Americans doesn't extend to the table, at least
not after the first (sometimes skeptical) bite. Then they are
usually hooked. When British food writers and broadcasters gather
at my table I dazzle them with olive oil and salad leaves, crusty
bread, artichokes and crab, pastas and arugula, new wave sushi and
Pacific Rim pesto, big salads and stewy braises _ foods that have
traveled far and wide, ending up in California where they have
become intrinsically, distinctly and deliciously our own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't what I expected,'' they always say. ``Have some
more,'' I reply.
</P>
<P>
   In November, we have made expatriate Thanksgivings, inviting
both homesick Yanks and curious Brits. But for Fourth of July we
try to make it home, for fireworks and tomato season.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes for holidays we have headed off in a different
direction, such as the Christmas we went to Cyprus and baked
gingerbread men and women with frosting bathing suits, or the
Easter we spent in France's southwest, lazing by the Canal du Midi,
shopping and cooking and eating our way through the week.
</P>
<P>
   But you know, I'm never really far from California.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago I was visiting Melnick, Bulgaria, sampling
exquisite preserved figs in honey. The figs tasted floral,
delicate, enchanting. ``These would be delicious with goat
cheese,'' I exclaimed. ``And maybe a little tuft of arugula, mizuna
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   My fellow (British) journalists laughed, ``You can take the girl
out of California but you can't take California out of the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is. Wherever I go I see a little of the Bay Area in my
destination, and I take a little of the Bay Area along with me,
just in case.
</P>
<P>
   In this column, I hope to share my adventures in Britain, in
Europe, wherever I find myself. And you're all invited to come
along, and feast at my table.

   Six months ago a loose grouping of reformists, committed to the

election. The future looked uncertain but promising. Even though
the conservatives still controlled all the effective instruments of
state power _ the judiciary, the police, the army, the media _ it
was fair to hope they would feel obliged to pay heed to the
strength of the people's voice. So they did _ but only to shut it

   This week's reunion of divided Korean families was an

dismantling one of the last frontiers of the Cold War. All the hugs

Koreas are continuing to make progress towards unifying their
divided peninsula. Yet the small number who made the journey shows
just how wide the gulf still is.

   Was there ever an airplane so beautiful to look at? No wonder
the fate of Concorde, now indefinitely withdrawn from service by
both British Airways and Air France, inspires a twinge of regret
even in the sternest critic of this ludicrous airborne indulgence.
Alas, Concorde's commercial life is clearly drawing to a close;
even if flights eventually resume following the recent
crash-induced suspension, it will be difficult to rebuild lost
confidence among passengers. At the risk of saying, ``We told you
so,'' it is worth examining the lessons to be gleaned from the
remarkable airplane's history. &QL;

   MONCKS CORNER, S.C. _ Visitors who drive over the Wadboo Bridge,
30 miles from downtown Charleston, S.C., soon come upon a majestic
alley of ancient live oaks, the entrance to the monastery of our
Lady of Mepkin. Twenty-eight Trappist monks live at Mepkin Abbey,
following the simple Cistercian routine of prayer,
scripture-reading and manual labor that was laid sown 900 years ago
in France. To this serene abbey comes an increasingly steady stream
of visitors these days, men and women of all faiths exhausted by
the punishing pace of life and work in 21st-century America. &QL;

Norway, on Aug. 12. With more than 100 sailors, over half of them

leader of France's small farmers, targets McDonald's as the symbol
of the evils of globalization, the silver-haired Guibert has in his
sights a Californian wine giant, Robert Mondavi. In particular,
Guibert wants to block Mondavi's plan for a winery in the beautiful
garrigue, or wooded scrub, right next to his own vineyard. &QL;

   SYDNEY _ When Lorna Cubillo was seven, she and 15 other
aboriginal children were put into a truck by white officials at an
outback settlement in the Northern Territory. ``As the truck left
Phillip Creek, everyone was crying and screaming,'' she says. ``I
remember seeing the mothers chasing the truck. And then they
disappeared in the dust of the track.'' Peter Gunner had a similar
experience when he was six. Mrs. Cubillo is now 62 and Mr. Gunner
is 52. They are members of Australia's ``stolen generation'':
aboriginal people, estimated to number at least 55,000, who were
removed from their families as children and put in foster homes,
many run by churches. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ When the Johns Manville corporation agreed to be
acquired by a buyout firm and thus return to private ownership in
early July, a painful chapter in corporate history came to an end.
From the 1920s until the 1970s, Manville had been the largest
American producer of asbestos, a product belatedly discovered to be
extraordinarily dangerous. Ensuing claims led to a bankruptcy in
1982 that penalized existing shareholders in favor of a trust fund
for victims. Yet if Manville's time in purgatory is drawing to a
close, it looks likely that others will be forced down the same
path by increasingly virulent asbestos-related litigation. &QL;

   ALBUQUERQUE AND SANTA FE, N.M. _ The Rio Grande starts life
majestically, cutting deep through the volcanic canyons of the
Colorado plateau. But by the time it reaches the desert plains of
southern New Mexico it is a shade of its former self, depleted by
irrigation channels that feed the state's thirsty crops. Now the
river faces a new challenge: fast-growing cities increasingly
desperate for water. &QL;

   MONCKS CORNER, S.C. _ Visitors who drive over the Wadboo Bridge,
30 miles from downtown Charleston, S.C., soon come upon a majestic
alley of ancient live oaks, the entrance to the monastery of our
Lady of Mepkin. Twenty-eight Trappist monks live at Mepkin Abbey,
following the simple Cistercian routine of prayer,
scripture-reading and manual labor that was laid sown 900 years ago
in France. To this serene abbey comes an increasingly steady stream
of visitors these days, men and women of all faiths exhausted by
the punishing pace of life and work in 21st-century America. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ One can only imagine the profound embarrassment that
the Russian leadership, civilian and military, must be feeling over
the disaster which befell the Kursk, a nuclear-powered (though
apparently not nuclear-armed) submarine in the Barents Sea, near
Norway, on Aug. 12. With more than 100 sailors, over half of them
officers, trapped in a dark, bitter-cold, unventilated metal box on
the ocean floor, the navy found itself struggling _ and failing _
to cope not just with a human disaster but a public-relations
fiasco as well. &QL;

   ANIANE _ ``Jose Bove is my friend,'' declares Aime Guibert, the
75-year-old maker of Daumas Gassac wines, the finest of the
Languedoc region. And his role model? While Bove, the media-savvy
leader of France's small farmers, targets McDonald's as the symbol
of the evils of globalization, the silver-haired Guibert has in his
sights a Californian wine giant, Robert Mondavi. In particular,
Guibert wants to block Mondavi's plan for a winery in the beautiful
garrigue, or wooded scrub, right next to his own vineyard. &QL;

   SYDNEY _ When Lorna Cubillo was seven, she and 15 other
aboriginal children were put into a truck by white officials at an
outback settlement in the Northern Territory. ``As the truck left
Phillip Creek, everyone was crying and screaming,'' she says. ``I
remember seeing the mothers chasing the truck. And then they
disappeared in the dust of the track.'' Peter Gunner had a similar
experience when he was six. Mrs. Cubillo is now 62 and Mr. Gunner
is 52. They are members of Australia's ``stolen generation'':
aboriginal people, estimated to number at least 55,000, who were
removed from their families as children and put in foster homes,
many run by churches. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ When the Johns Manville corporation agreed to be
acquired by a buyout firm and thus return to private ownership in
early July, a painful chapter in corporate history came to an end.
From the 1920s until the 1970s, Manville had been the largest
American producer of asbestos, a product belatedly discovered to be
extraordinarily dangerous. Ensuing claims led to a bankruptcy in
1982 that penalized existing shareholders in favor of a trust fund
for victims. Yet if Manville's time in purgatory is drawing to a
close, it looks likely that others will be forced down the same
path by increasingly virulent asbestos-related litigation. &QL;

 &HT;    MICROSOFT OPPOSES DIRECT HIGH COURT REVIEW OF ANTITRUST CASE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. urged the U.S. Supreme Court on
Tuesday to derail a proposed ``fast track'' review of its antitrust
conviction and again accused the judge who tried the landmark case
of being biased against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   The company, entitled to the final word in a battle of the
briefs with the government, said ``the benefits of comprehensive
review by the court of appeals far outweigh whatever time, if any,
might be saved by direct review'' by the high tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   When the nine justices return from their summer break on Oct. 1,
they must decide whether to follow the three-stage legal course
favored by Microsoft or to bypass the middle layer, as advocated by
the government and U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denied as ``unfounded'' a charge by the Justice
Department and 17 state attorneys general that it wants to drag its
legal feet over the appeal, waiting for a possibly improved
political climate in Washington for its claims of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   But the company reserved its sharpest criticism for Jackson, who
in June ordered Microsoft split in two after ruling that it had
broken the nation's antitrust laws. In his decision, Jackson upheld
the government's claim that Microsoft had unfairly used a monopoly
choke hold on the Windows personal computer operating system to
stifle competition and harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings in this case are not the product of even one
level of impartial decision-making,'' Microsoft said, adding that
Jackson's ``extensive extrajudicial comments'' and his ``imposition
of draconian relief without holding a hearing ... cast serious
doubt on the reliability of the district court as finder of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft brief responded to a counter-filing by the
government last week which had argued that the case had ``immense
importance to our national economy,'' and therefore should be heard
directly. Since 1974, when the current ``fast track'' antitrust
exception was enacted, the top court has used it only twice.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two involved the breakup of the regulated Bell System
telephone monopoly under a consent degree. That was ``a very
different case'' which did not ``bear the 'close similarities' to
(this appeal),'' as the government contended.
</P>
<P>
   Legal opinion on how the justices will proceed remains divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the Supreme Court doesn't like to deal with lots of
messy issues,'' said Bill Kovacic, an impartial antitrust professor
at George Washington University School of Law who has followed the
case closely. ``The court prefers cases with just one or two issues
that are easily laid out,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   By an overwhelming margin, some 100 lawyers queried by Kovacic
who regularly practice before Supreme Court were of the view that
the high court would not handle the case directly.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Lande, an antitrust professor at University of Baltimore
Law School and a former Justice Department lawyer, said, ``I am now
convinced the Supreme Court will take this case at this time,''
noting that ``friend of the court'' briefs filed by high-tech trade
associations that favor the direct appeal had persuaded him.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A San Francisco bouncer with a discerning ear
made the bounce of a career, the police said, and in the process
may have halted a violent, coast-to-coast crime spree that in part
targeted patrons of gay bars.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Cuneo, 35, is a Golden Gate Transit bus driver by day, but
at 8:30 p.m. Saturday he was watching the door of The Cafe on
Market Street when two young men with Boston accents tried to enter
the bar without identification.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Monday, Cuneo said he recalled seeing a
police brochure in the bar's office warning of two men with thick
Boston accents suspected of beating and robbing a patron of another
San Francisco bar a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, Cuneo thought, matched a picture on the
brochure, which officers had distributed widely in gay bars. So he
calmly told the men to go elsewhere, then dialed 911 as they
strolled away down Market Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never let on that I knew who they were,'' said Cuneo, who
vacationed in Boston last year and remembered the accents. ``But I
also didn't want them in the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuneo's cool demeanor, the police said, led to the arrests two
blocks away of two Massachusetts fugitives _ John Lydon, 27, and
Paul Devlin, 28 _ each of whom has ``Irish Blood'' tattooed on his
chest. They were wanted by the U.S. Marshals Service.
</P>
<P>
   Their flight from the law, according to a published report,
included a taxicab ride away from the police at Tucson
International Airport on July 26. An alleged accomplice, Richard
McDougall, 29, was arrested that day while trying to board a plane
to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco police believe that Lydon and Devlin arrived
in the city the night of Aug. 12 aboard a Greyhound bus from
Fullerton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The men allegedly attacked Herbert Poteet, 63, of Fairfield, who
had agreed to give them a lift after meeting them over drinks.
Poteet told the police the men had claimed to be brothers who had
come to San Francisco after losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The men also are suspected of picking up a man in a gay bar in
Santa Monica on Aug. 7, then robbing his house and stabbing him
repeatedly. Officers found the victim outside his house, screaming
for help, said Santa Monica police Lt. Frank Fabrega. The man's car
was taken and later dumped in Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, Lydon, Devlin and McDougall are wanted in connection
with the armed robbery of $25,000 in cash and merchandise from a
jewelry store in York, the Portland Press Herald of Portland
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The three also are suspected of robbing a motor inn and
burglarizing a house in York, and robbing two outlet stores in
nearby Kittery, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Lydon and Devlin were being held at the San Francisco Hall of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Monday that Cuneo's involvement in the arrests
was an example of the best kind of public crime-fighting: not
taking physical action, but calmly guiding officers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, ethnic cleansing was reported in Kosovo. Serbs
employing executions, gang rape, and other techniques of terror
were driving ethnic Albanians from their homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The West, led by the United States, responded by launching an
air war against Serb forces in Kosovo and other parts of the former
Yugoslavia. The United States took in 14,000 Kosovars within a few
months. Only 4,000 of them have returned home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, genocide was reported in Rwanda, in central Africa,
where the Hutu majority went on a rampage against the Tutsi
minority, butchering, mutilating, and raping.
</P>
<P>
   The West did little to stop the violence, and less to help the
refugees. In contrast to the Balkans, where US officials actively
recruited in the refugee camps, there was no effort to open
America's doors to Rwandans. The United States accepted 88 Rwandans
in 1994 and 457 others in the years since.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between Kosovo and Rwanda sharply reflects
continuing trends in US admissions of refugees and immigrants. Such
patterns, advocates for refugees and other observers say, reflect
racism in US policy.
</P>
<P>
   US officials deny this, but they acknowledge that the legacy of
decades of blatant race-based bias and the political nature of
setting immigration quotas have tended to work against Africans in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics kept by the State Department and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service have found a preponderance of East Europeans
among recent refugees, and of East Asians among immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   While there are genuine needs in these regions, Deborah Anker, a
founder of the Immigration and Refugee Law Program at Harvard Law
School, said, ``The very large refugee flows are in Africa. Vast
numbers are in need of resettlement, and there are relatively low
admissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, their critics, and refugee advocates agree
that admissions often serve US foreign policy objectives, such as
defusing European tensions over the burden of accepting Balkan
refugees, rather than honor the ideals of the Statue of Liberty to
``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to
breathe free.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, 514,443 refugees, more than half of the total
admitted to the United States in the decade, came from Eastern
Europe, although ethnic and religious strife in much of the region
was generally easing. A third of the total came from Southeast
Asia, primarily Vietnam and Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Just 64,294 refugees were admitted from Africa in the same
period, a little over 6 percent of the total, as ethnic and
political persecutions in many African countries were growing
dramatically worse.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph W. Mutaboba, Rwandan ambassador to the United Nations,
said the small number of refugees coming from Africa reflected ``a
double standard, or just plain bias.''
</P>
<P>
   When genocide was afoot in Rwanda, US leaders ``knew but acted
as though they did not know,'' he said, noting that President
Clinton later acknowledged, and apologized, for this.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Frelick, policy director at the US Committee for Refugees,
a Washington-based advocacy group, said the Rwandan genocide was
``studiously ignored'' by the US government, but not out of blatant
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the US not wanting to put resources into humanitarian
lifesaving endeavors that did not offer any short-term payoff or
gain,'' he said. By contrast, the admission of tens of thousands of
Balkan refugees served to keep key countries, particularly Germany
and Macedonia, from breaking with US policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resettlement is an area that lends itself to bias because
resettlement is completely discretionary,'' Frelick said. ``Unlike
in a country of first asylum, where it is against international law
to force them back into peril, resettlement you do out of
generosity and humanity. It is susceptible to ethnic constituencies
and prejudices.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures for immigrants _ who unlike refugees do not have to
show they are being persecuted or are in danger _ clearly reflect
this susceptibility. Immigration quotas for each country are
established through negotiation between the INS and Congress, and
Asians and Latin Americans, as well as Europeans, are far more
likely to be admitted than Africans.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 through 1998, the most recent year for which
statistics are available, 30 percent of immigrants to the United
States were from Asia, particularly Vietnam and the Philippines; 29
percent were from Mexico; and 13 percent from Europe. Less than 4
percent were from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are core constituent groups out there who advocate for
people from their homelands,'' said Bill Strassberger, a spokesman
for the INS. ``We saw it when the Iron Curtain disappeared. There
were opportunities, and suddenly you had Polish-Americans lobbying
to ease conditions for Poles to come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument is made that one of the problems for Africans,''
he said, is that because of the history of slavery,
``African-Americans don't know which countries their forerunners
came from, so they don't know who to advocate for.''
</P>
<P>
   But even refugees from Liberia, a country with deep historic
links with the United States, do not get much sympathy here.
Liberia was established in 1822 as a homeland for former American
slaves; its government is patterned on the American model; and 12
of the men elected president before civil war erupted in 1989 were
US-born.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, US officials declared it safe for 10,000 to 15,000
people who fled that war to return to Liberia. About 3,000 of those
were from Massachusetts; 4,000 were from Rhode Island. The
government gave them 60 days to pack up and go _ despite the fact
that, after nine years, many had homes, careers, and children who
were born here and are, therefore, US citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberians got a one-year reprieve through a presidential
order, but face another departure deadline next month.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, said Torli Krua, executive director of Universal
Human Rights International in Roxbury, demonstrates prejudice
against Africans, since the Kosovo Albanian refugees allowed into
the country last year were given a status allowing them to stay
permanently, while the Liberians have been kept in a temporary
status for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say there was no bias _ that most of the Liberians
were in this country on visas for study or tourism when the civil
war broke out; they were given what the State Department calls
``temporary protected status'' and simply have no legal claim to
permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the actions of other countries have almost a
controlling influence on refugee policies of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Kreczko, deputy assistant secretary of state in charge of
the US bureau of population, refugees, and migration, pointed out
that countries of first asylum in Europe, particularly Germany and
Macedonia, were threatening to close their borders to fleeing
Kosovars, or even force people to return to the Balkans against
their will, unless other countries took in more refugees. Had they
made good on those threats, it would have dealt a severe blow to US
goals for the future of the Balkans. There was no such threat in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fair observation,'' Kreczko said, ``that our program
has definite humanitarian components but also serves foreign policy
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Although African countries are often willing to shelter refugees
from their neighbors, said Louise Bailey, a spokeswomen for the
Organization of African Unity's mission to the United Nations, ``it
is obviously not always in the best interests of the refugees to
remain in those countries,'' where they are sometimes easy targets
for murder and rape. ``The OAU is concerned at the lack of parity,
which was clearly demonstrated by the recent handling of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The order for Liberians to return home also may have been in the
service of policy objectives. When the order was made, the State
Department was asserting that western Africa had become safe and
stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that national security and other factors come into
play, and that because of this there will be disparities,'' said
Frelick of the US Committee for Refugees. ``But policy makers need
to question, and advocates and others need to examine, the extent
to which, when lives are in the balance, one human being is weighed
as worth more than another based on the color of skin.''

TEXAS PLAN FOR COLLEGE DIVERSITY DRAWS FIRE

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the ``compassionate conservative'' alternative to
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of picking minority students for Texas universities
based on their race, Governor George W. Bush signed a law in 1997
that guaranteed a spot for all students who graduated in the top 10
percent of their high school class.
</P>
<P>
   The idea had an immediate, egalitarian appeal: All applicants
would be judged strictly by their performance. And yet, at urban
schools where black or Hispanic students are predominant,
minorities would surely fill the top 10 percent as well, getting
into public campuses by virtue of their own pluck.
</P>
<P>
   But, rather than emerge as the national model some Texas
officials hoped for, the plan has run into a wall from
Massachusetts to Washington, where officials criticize the idea as
simplistic. Though Florida recently adopted a Texas-style policy,
officials in other states say the 10 percent rule allows the
admission of too many unqualified students and promotes diversity
only in states with highly segregated high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it solves anything,'' said Joseph Marshall, who
oversees enrollment management at the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst, which has scaled back affirmative action and rejected
the idea of basing admission on class rank. ``The results aren't an
across-the-board increase in diversity. It's a real shortsighted
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   A chief drawback, said Thomas J. Kane, a Harvard University
professor who has studied the plans, is that the policies will not
promote diversity in states that do not have heavily segregated
high schools. The policy wouldn't help in New England, where
relatively few schools are filled with minority students, and only
3 percent of seniors in the top tenth are black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the class-rank law has brought more minority students
to some elite campuses. But freshmen admitted under the policy have
lower Scholastic Assessment Test scores than past classes, partly
reflecting an influx of students from low-performing schools. Kane
said a disproportionate number of students admitted to college
under the new ruleswho have low test scores are black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Bush, said such criticisms
ignore the policy's appeal as a compromise between divisive racial
preferences and strict, merit-based standards.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Texas at Austin, the state's most elite
public school, the 10 percent policy has increased diversity in
enrollment. More black and Hispanic freshmen are enrolling now than
in 1996, the year a federal appeals court outlawed racial
preferences at public campuses. And those who were in the top 10
percent are more likely to become sophomores than other classmates.
</P>
<P>
   True, SAT scores among top students at Austin are down: About
250 had scores below 1,000 last year, compared with 133 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sullivan said, the class-rank policy ``rewards
achievement and provides access to students regardless of whether
they're from the Texas border or the Texas suburb, so long as they
study and work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has championed the policy as ``affirmative access,'' a way
of broadening opportunities for students without playing favorites.
His Democratic rival for the White House, Vice President Al Gore,
strongly supports the use of affirmative action to promote
diversity on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists said the best preparation for college is a
challenging high school curriculum. Class rank, on the other hand,
can be deceptive when students attend low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate over the Texas law, which Bush had modest
involvement with until he signed it, has centered more on the
problems with affirmative action than the right standards for
getting into college. And as a replacement for preferences,
officials in some states pan it as narrow and simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state officials weighed a policy similar to Texas's
after voters banned affirmative action in 1998. At the University
of Washington, black and Hispanic freshmen enrollments plummeted by
more than 30 percent after the ban took effect. More black freshmen
are expected this fall, but Hispanic numbers are expected to
decline again, to 106 out of about 4,900 fresmen. In 1998, 196 out
of 4,200 were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   But John Swiney, the university's associate director of
admissions, said most Washington schools are too integrated for
class rank to increase diversity. He added that the policy lacks
the nuance needed to draw students with a range of abilities and
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we read students' essays, it gives us a much better
insight into the qualities of the individual beyond the numbers,'
Swiney said. ``Not all students come from a level playing field,
and there are many barriers on the road to academic success.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the University of Michigan, whose affirmative
action policy is being challenged in federal court, said they also
have decided against adopting the Texas policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one-dimensional, and we want to consider the whole person
when making admissions decisions,'' said Liz Barry, an associate
vice president at the university.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to admit the top 15 percent to Pennsylvania colleges
was on a fast track earlier this year, but has been put off until
winter, officials said. According to an analysis by Harvard, about
46 percent of black students and 26 percent of Hispanics are in
largely segregated high schools in Pennsylvania, suggesting a Texas
style policy could boost minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's governor, Tom Ridge, a Republican and a close
ally of Bush, may push for the plan, state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Paul Cellucci, the governor of Massachusetts and a
Bush supporter, say the concept isn't on the drawing board for
colleges in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of high schools in Massachusetts that
frankly don't have class rank,'' said Michael Sentance, the
governor's education adviser. ``Those that have high standards have
done away with class rank. It may or may not be the best way of
looking at this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentance said a better alternative would be to recruit minority
students more aggressively. The governor, he hinted, might unveil
such an initiative this fall.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when schools nationwide are seeking to increase the
number of their graduates attending college, guidance counselors in
Boston said Texas's policy would help their students, but only if
it were expanded to open access for the top 20 percent to 25
percent of high school classes and provided scholarships.
California officials blanched at such a large percentage, saying it
would hurt academic quality.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen M. Khoury, coordinator of guidance for Lawrence, Mass.
schools, said one problem is that schools calculate class rank
differently. Some give special weight to honors courses, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have a kid taking a weaker academic program being in
the top part of your class,'' said Khoury, who also works in
Lawrence High School, where most of the students are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   But Penda D. Hair, a civil rights lawyer who used a Rockefeller
Foundation grant to study Texas's policy, said class rank reveals
the workhorses who won't give up, even if they feel unprepared at
first for a university education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Percent plans like Texas's do a better job of giving you
students who have grit, who have determination, and who can succeed
in the long run,'' Hair said.

PUTIN PREPARES TO MEET WITH FAMILY MEMBERS OF KURSK CREW 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday flew to the
headquarters of Russia's Northern Fleet to pay his last respects to
the 118 officers and sailors who perished aboard the
nuclear-powered submarine Kursk after it suffered a catastrophic
internal explosion in the Barents Sea on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader was also scheduled to meet with naval
commanders and the families of crew members. Before he left Moscow,
Putin declared a national day of mourning Wednesday and ordered
flags to fly at half staff. Russian officials said he would fly to
the deck of the cruiser Peter the Great to cast a memorial wreath
of flowers onto the Arctic waters where the twin-reactor submarine
went down.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling without his usual contingent of Russian news media,
Putin was due on Tuesday night and Wednesday to undertake the
sensitive and politically volatile task of meeting with
grief-stricken widows, mothers, fathers and other kin who have a
lot of questions about why the Russian government and its military
command were not able to assure the safety of their loved ones and
why it could not rescue them when tragedy struck.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Russian television reported that
representatives of the families had asked the navy to allow them to
leave Severomorsk, the closed military city where the fleet
headquarters is located, so they could make a public statement. For
Putin, avoiding a public or emotional confrontation with angry
family members is likely one of the major tasks of this trip.
</P>
<P>
   Though public opinion polls over the last several days have
showed that 60 percent of Russians in the Moscow region have not
changed their attitudes toward Putin for his handling of the
crisis, about 75 percent of respondents to polls have said they
either disagree or strongly disagree with Russia's four-day delay
in accepting Western assistance with the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin meets the families, the session will be tightly
controlled by Putin's advisers, who fear that emotional outbursts
and recriminations directed at Putin and broadcast to the nation
might prolong the sense of crisis and the raucous attacks in the
press that threaten to derail the president's busy economic and
political reform plans this fall.
</P>
<P>
   As Putin arrived in Severomorsk, Norwegian and British deep sea
divers abandoned their search and rescue work on the wrecked and
flooded hull, where the bodies of the crew remain in 350 feet of
water. They said they might return with different equipment if they
can conclude a contract with Russian officials. That contract would
cover the cost of penetrating the hull in a complex operation to
recover crew remains.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russian navy officials have offered to cut giant holes in the
hull of the Kursk in order to make entry to the vessel easier and
safer for divers involved in evacuating the victims' remains.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, the navy chief of staff, Adm. Viktor
Kravchenko, said the navy was committed to ``carrying out this
operation until the last seaman's body has been recovered from the
submarine's compartments.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Aleksei Kudrin said the Russian government
was prepared to finance the full cost of the crew recovery and a
complex and dangerous salvage operation whose estimated cost
already has ranged up to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an executive of the Norwegian firm, Stolt Offshore,
whose divers finally managed to open a rear hatch on the Kursk,
said in Oslo that the company would help the Russian navy study
options to raise the 490-foot vessel, which displaces 14,000 tons
of water on the surface and 25,000 tons submerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have agreed to help the Russians look at ways of recovering
the bodies and of salvaging the Kursk,'' Julian Thomson of Stolt
told reporters Tuesday. On the difficult task of raising a vessel
whose superstructure is severely damaged, he said, ``There are
dangers.'' He added that it would be very hazardous due to
unexploded munitions, internal damage and potential radiation
leaks. Planning was likely to take weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With winter approaching in the Arctic, there were conflicting
estimates of whether Russia would be able to accomplish the crew
recovery before fierce storms and ice flows set in.
</P>
<P>
   The on-going effort to solve the mystery of how the Kursk sank
also continued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Alexsander Rutskoi, Russia's former vice president and now
governor of the Kursk region, for which the submarine is named,
asserted Tuesday that the attack vessel was carrying an
experimental torpedo that was to be test-fired by the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk had on board a ``new torpedo and two civilian
engineers,'' said Rutskoi, who is a war hero and leader of a 1993
parliamentary uprising against former President Boris Yeltsin. ``It
is necessary to investigate this aspect, and if a new torpedo was
really being tested on the submarine, it is a crime,'' he
continued, arguing that test firings of new weapons should not be
conducted during crew training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of the Chechen rebellion in southern Russia
offered its own explanation Tuesday, suggesting that a ``kamikaze''
fighter from the Northern Caucasus was among the crew and had
triggered the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who is
heading the official investigation into the disaster, lashed out at
critics for their ``cynicism'' and for ``trying to make a cheap
sensation out of this common tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``the only truth today is that a powerful and
dynamic external blow'' remains the most likely explanation for the
sinking.

&HT;     FED REPORT HINTS AT WIDENING INCOMING DISPARITY IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Income for California families is declining
against average family incomes for the nation as a whole, according
to a report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited the lasting impact of the cutbacks in the
aerospace industry and a large influx of immigrant laborers who are
generally younger and less educated. It found that the economic
picture for Californians was not as rosy as it was typically
perceived, despite its newly minted dot-com millionaires, movie
moguls and real estate barons.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the report also adds to a growing body of work that
appears to show the income gap between rich and poor is growing
wider and more stark all the time, and may become a factor both as
an election-year issue and as a consideration in whether to raise
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislative Analysts Office, a think tank for the California
Legislature, issued a report last month finding that income for the
top 20 percent of the state's wage earners had risen while wages
for the bottom 80 percent had fallen, in real terms. And the Public
Policy Institute of California concluded last year that the growing
gap between rich and poor had increased at a rate faster in the
Golden State since the 1980s than it had in the nation at large.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Daly, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank, said
the purpose of the report was to add some context to the growing
debate over the increasing economic stratification.
</P>
<P>
   Though her report found that wages were increasing, in real
terms, for families in the 70th income percentile but declining for
those below that level, she maintained the report was more about
California compared to the rest of the nation, not the widening
distance between top and bottom earners in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't confirm that, but it explains to a certain extent
why we see this divergence,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   The news comes even as California's economy has grown at a rate
faster than the rest of the nation's over the last five years. The
report found a greater number of state residents lived in poverty,
the middle class was shrinking, and a majority of families had
incomes below the level of their counterparts nationwide. While
income growth for median families outside of California grew by
more than 8 percent between 1989 and 1998, median income inside the
state declined by 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the statistics show that California families had
higher incomes than families elsewhere in the United States until
the 1990s, but that relative gains outside the state began to
surpass those of residents inside the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first glance, the income statistics on California suggest
that seven years of economic expansion have left state residents
worse off than those residing elsewhere in the U.S.,'' the report
said.

 NFL's Felonious Off-Season Renews Debate over Role Modeling for
Kids

 ATTENTION EDITORS: With seven photos, of Mark Chmura (NNS1), Rae
Carruth (NNS2), Paul Krumberger (NNS3 and NNS4), Brett Favre
(NNS5), Antonio Freeman (NNS6) and Darrell Green (NNS7). 
 By MARK O'KEEFE  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Chmura wasn't just a Green Bay Packers tight end, outspoken
critic of Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct and United Way example
of what's supposed to be good and noble and true about the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura was a child's hero, riding 11-year-old Paul Krumberger's
bicycle between the Lambeau Field locker room and the Packers'
practice field.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Green Bay tradition for players to accept bike rides from
kids during summer training camp, and Paul got all the autographed
leather receiving gloves, signed them, and gave them to the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Paul returned this summer to offer rides to players, but his
former hero wasn't there to pedal. Subsequently cut by the Packers,
Chmura awaits trial on criminal charges in another blow to the
image of what has been dubbed the National Felony League.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, in Paul's words, ``did something really bad to a woman
when he was drunk.'' A district attorney deemed it third-degree
sexual assault, and since the woman was a 17-year-old girl, child
enticement. If convicted, Chmura could face up to 40 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of players in handcuffs and orange jail jumpsuits --
even players innocent until proven guilty -- have prompted concern
over a serious public relations injury to one of America's most
popular sports.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Paul, and thousands of children like him,
vulnerable to around-the-clock media hype of football players
marketed as mythic figures? If kids copy the on-the-field moves,
flamboyant celebrations and excessive trash talking of their Sunday
heroes, will they also imitate their off-the-field behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Many players dismiss the connection, saying they don't want to
be role models. But the league reluctantly acknowledges a
responsibility to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our players to be exemplary citizens,'' NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in an interview. ``We want them to
set high standards on the field as well as off the field. I think
the reality is that they are role models, whether we like it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chmura case is made richer by the former player's longtime
criticism of President Clinton. Chmura refused to attend the
traditional visit to the White House after the Packers won the
Super Bowl in 1997. After the Monica Lewinksky scandal, he
lambasted the president's morals and the message they sent to
children.
</P>
<P>
   But the charges against Chmura are only one pro football crime
story among several that have tarnished the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Others involve Rae Carruth, the former Carolina Panthers
receiver awaiting trial on first-degree murder charges in the
shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend, and Denver Broncos
linebacker Bill Romanowski, who faces felony charges in a
prescription drug case involving diet pills. The Baltimore Ravens'
Ray Lewis, the NFL's leading tackler last year, had murder charges
dropped in May in exchange for a guilty plea to obstruction of
justice in connection with a stabbing death after an Atlanta Super
Bowl party. The NFL subsequently fined Lewis $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists say there is little doubt that in this era of
around-the-clock sports coverage and slick marketing of stars, NFL
players have some effect on the millions of children who idolize
them. But the degree of influence is difficult to measure, and
varies from child to child, dependent in part on their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly in the power of modeling behavior. That's
been demonstrated for years,'' said Leonard Zaichkowsky, director
of sports psychology at Boston University and a past president of
the Association for Applied Sports Psychology for North America.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that he has seen no research establishing a
link between NFL and childhood behavior. Zaichkowsky said it's
similar to trying to prove that violent films make people violent.
The best evidence may be anecdotal.
</P>
<P>
   In Green Bay, child psychologist Bonnie Nussbaum said she hasn't
seen cases of post-Chmura trauma, but the story has been a
stressful undercurrent for many of the children she counsels. She
said it especially triggers old fears and responses of girls who
have been victims of sexual abuse and tells boys, if at a
subconscious level, that women are objects of domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids have the ego strength to resist that type of
behavior,'' Nussbaum said. ``But other kids are more vulnerable and
might follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Connor, a professor of psychology at California State
University in Long Beach, where he teaches a class on sport
behavior, said children will turn cynical as NFL players continue
to let them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could very easily turn kids against the entire sport, the
entire process and the NFL altogether,'' Connor said. ``The way
kids think, they will generalize. They'll say if Rae Carruth did
it, everyone has done it, they just haven't been caught yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my biggest concern is the disillusionment won't stop with
the football. Kids may think you bend the rules to do whatever you
can get away with in society as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Such cynicism was evident this summer in Green Bay, where
muscled behemoths have been riding the bicycles of children since
the 1960s. Ten boys sat on their bikes, waiting for the objects of
their football worship and rattling off the Packers' recent rap
sheet. In addition to Chmura, four other Packers have been arrested
since December, on charges of obstruction of justice (Antonio
Freeman and Rodney Artmore), drunken driving and speeding (Marco
Rivera) and possession of marijuana (De'Mond Parker).
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Chmura, Jason Wassenberg, 11, said, ``I think he's
sick. That's gross to do that. It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Chad Van DenLangenberg, 13: ``I'm glad he got under
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone,'' said 13-year-old Jacob Stalberger, ``gets in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason: ``That's because some players think they can get away
with anything because they're pro football players and big
namers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do get away with it,'' retorted Scott Wick, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob: ``Look at De'Mond Parker. He had 7 grams of marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the charges were dropped,'' said Luke Parlow, referring to
an arrangement that had Parker completing a court-approved drug
course. ``They shouldn't have been.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boys eagerly approached other players after practice,
asking for autographs and offering rides.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre downplayed his influence on
children. ``I don't think NFL players should be role models for
someone else's kids,'' Favre said. ``The parents should be their
own role models. It's not our responsibility. We try to live life
the right way, but nobody's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Freeman, ``My role models are my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   After the obstruction of justice charge in a December traffic
accident that injured a woman, Freeman was sentenced to a year's
probation, $1,000 fine and 50 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was a Wisconsin Department of Transportation spokesman
for wearing seat belts, his likeness on 15,000 posters with the
words, ``Football is a game. Your life is not. Buckle Up.'' Police
found that he wasn't wearing his seat belt in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his conduct has hurt children, Freeman said no.
``We all make mistakes,'' he said. ``We're human.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   To what extent NFL players make criminal mistakes is in dispute.
In their often-cited 1998 book, ``Pros and Cons, the Criminals Who
Play in the NFL,'' authors Jeff Benedict and Don Yaeger said their
study of 509 players -- about one-third of the active NFL roster at
the time -- showed ``an eye-popping 109 (21 percent) were found to
have been formally charged (arrested or indicted) with a serious
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But a year later in CHANCE, a magazine of the American
Statistical Association, Benedict joined another author in
re-evaluating NFL arrests. They studied FBI figures for the general
population -- in this case only for assaults -- and concluded that
``the NFL rates are less than half the general population rates.''
</P>
<P>
   For players critical of what they consider distorted media
coverage, that clarification is evidence that NFL players are
better people than they are portrayed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disturbing to me that there are only one or two
incidents they seem to focus on and they don't see the good that
we're doing as far as raising and generating money for different
organizations that help people less fortunate,'' said veteran
defensive end Bruce Smith of the Washington Redskins. ``They don't
see us being mentors for children and being positive role models.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Darrell Green is such a mentor. After a two-hour
summer practice in Ashburn, Va., \roMDRV\ &UR; -in 90-degree heat and
high humidity, Green stood on a plush, green practice field wearing
a sweat-soaked T-shirt and Redskins football pants, talking to 14
children involved with the Darrell Green Youth Life Foundation.
When the kids seemed restless, the defensive back called them to
attention with a firm, ``Stay with me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he retires, Green, 40, said he wants to set aside $10
million for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you take care of things they can't take away from
you,'' Green told the children. ``In sports, you can break a leg.
But no one can take your honesty away from you. No one can take
your integrity away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking to the locker room, Green said it is foolish to see Nike
spend millions of dollars on athlete endorsements to persuade
children to buy expensive shoes and not believe that NFL players
have a powerful influence on other types of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that thing called celebrity fame,'' Green said. ``I'm not
exploiting it from the standpoint of making dollars. But I'm
exploiting it from the standpoint of trying to access the hearts
and minds of youths and trying to turn them toward what is right,
what is honest and what is respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) \roMDUL\ &UR; - But for every moment of
attention from a Darrell Green, there seems to be a counter-moment
from a Plaxico Burress, first-round draft pick of the Pittsburgh
Steelers\roMDRV\ &UR; -, which gave him a $5.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   While children asked for autographs after a practice
\roMDRV\ &UR; -this summer in Latrobe, Pa., Burress ignored them and
walked to his new, shiny Hummer, the wide-bodied vehicle based on
the military's Humvee. He drove through a sea of kids without
establishing eye contact, leaving several holding pens with
confused looks on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Fasano, 19, a ``die-hard Steelers fan'' for as long as he
can remember, witnessed the scene, which fueled the distaste he
feels for what money has done to the NFL and the tradition
established by gritty, not greedy, players like Joe Greene and
Rocky Bleier, leaders of the ``Steel Curtain'' Steelers of the
1970s, a team that won four Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   \roMDRV\ &UR; -\roMDRV\ &UR; -``That's gaudy, flamboyant and out of touch
with the world,'' said Fasano, a University of Florida student.
``That Hummer was a microcosm of what I'm talking about. It didn't
even stop for the kids. It sped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fasano traces his distaste to when his favorite Steeler, Barry
Foster, held out for more money, teaching then 12-year-old Fasano
that ``the players don't give a damn about me. They just care about
their paychecks.'' He'd have been emotionally scarred, Fasano said,
if he'd seen his hero on national television as the subject of a
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Around the NFL, there seems to be a growing consensus that big
money in the hands of 20-something men with an adoring entourage
can be the root of some evil, sending a bad message to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I can browbeat the guys into doing the right
thing,'' said Nesby Glasgow, the Seattle Seahawks' director of
player programs, a full-time position every team is required to
have. ``But we do sit down and talk about goals and aspirations,
and I may tell these guys I don't see your behavior reflecting your
goals and aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also requires rookies to attend a symposium designed to
teach life skills. One of this year's speakers was Lewis, who in
the aftermath of his murder trial warned about carefully choosing
friends. The NFL says past statistics suggest that four rookies are
likely to be arrested this year, along with 12 second-year players.
</P>

   ``I've been in the league for eight years and the programs have
increased 500 percent,'' said Baltimore Ravens quarterback Trent
Dilfer. ``The hardest thing for me was that I was only 21 years old
when they handed me $4.5 million. I had great parents and good
people around me, but that amount of money is overwhelming. I still
made mistakes.''

   How can parents prevent the mistakes of millionaire athletes
from adversely affecting their children? When an incident hits the
news, they should talk to their sons and daughters about it, giving
them an opportunity to vent while discussing their family values,
psychologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Nussbaum, the Green Bay therapist, said it was unfortunate that
she had to discuss graphic aspects of the Chmura and Carruth
incidents with her young daughter. But that, she added, is what
life is about in our society -- not just the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter just couldn't comprehend someone shooting a woman
who was pregnant. Yuck,'' said Nussbaum. ``I mean, I don't really
want to be talking to my 7-year-old about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krumberger doesn't want to be talking about what Chmura may
have done, either. But like many well-adjusted children, he is
capable of realizing that good athletes can make bad decisions that
kids should avoid.
</P>
<P>
   When Paul plays football with his buddies, he no longer imagines
that he's No. 89 cutting across the end zone for a touchdown. He's
considering selling those once-cherished Chmura gloves, as if
someone would want them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good influence on me,'' said Paul, ``until he did
that.''

 ATTENTION EDITORS: With seven photos, of Mark Chmura (NNS1), Rae
Carruth (NNS2), Paul Krumberger (NNS3 and NNS4), Brett Favre
(NNS5), Antonio Freeman (NNS6) and Darrell Green (NNS7). 
 By MARK O'KEEFE  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Chmura wasn't just a Green Bay Packers tight end, outspoken
critic of Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct and United Way example
of what's supposed to be good and noble and true about the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura was a child's hero, riding 11-year-old Paul Krumberger's
bicycle between the Lambeau Field locker room and the Packers'
practice field.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Green Bay tradition for players to accept bike rides from
kids during summer training camp, and Paul got all the autographed
leather receiving gloves, signed them, and gave them to the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Paul returned this summer to offer rides to players, but his
former hero wasn't there to pedal. Subsequently cut by the Packers,
Chmura awaits trial on criminal charges in another blow to the
image of what has been dubbed the National Felony League.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, in Paul's words, ``did something really bad to a woman
when he was drunk.'' A district attorney deemed it third-degree
sexual assault, and since the woman was a 17-year-old girl, child
enticement. If convicted, Chmura could face up to 40 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of players in handcuffs and orange jail jumpsuits --
even players innocent until proven guilty -- have prompted concern
over a serious public relations injury to one of America's most
popular sports.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Paul, and thousands of children like him,
vulnerable to around-the-clock media hype of football players
marketed as mythic figures? If kids copy the on-the-field moves,
flamboyant celebrations and excessive trash talking of their Sunday
heroes, will they also imitate their off-the-field behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Many players dismiss the connection, saying they don't want to
be role models. But the league reluctantly acknowledges a
responsibility to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our players to be exemplary citizens,'' NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in an interview. ``We want them to
set high standards on the field as well as off the field. I think
the reality is that they are role models, whether we like it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chmura case is made richer by the former player's longtime
criticism of President Clinton. Chmura refused to attend the
traditional visit to the White House after the Packers won the
Super Bowl in 1997. After the Monica Lewinksky scandal, he
lambasted the president's morals and the message they sent to
children.
</P>
<P>
   But the charges against Chmura are only one pro football crime
story among several that have tarnished the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Others involve Rae Carruth, the former Carolina Panthers
receiver awaiting trial on first-degree murder charges in the
shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend, and Denver Broncos
linebacker Bill Romanowski, who faces felony charges in a
prescription drug case involving diet pills. The Baltimore Ravens'
Ray Lewis, the NFL's leading tackler last year, had murder charges
dropped in May in exchange for a guilty plea to obstruction of
justice in connection with a stabbing death after an Atlanta Super
Bowl party. The NFL subsequently fined Lewis $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists say there is little doubt that in this era of
around-the-clock sports coverage and slick marketing of stars, NFL
players have some effect on the millions of children who idolize
them. But the degree of influence is difficult to measure, and
varies from child to child, dependent in part on their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly in the power of modeling behavior. That's
been demonstrated for years,'' said Leonard Zaichkowsky, director
of sports psychology at Boston University and a past president of
the Association for Applied Sports Psychology for North America.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that he has seen no research establishing a
link between NFL and childhood behavior. Zaichkowsky said it's
similar to trying to prove that violent films make people violent.
The best evidence may be anecdotal.
</P>
<P>
   In Green Bay, child psychologist Bonnie Nussbaum said she hasn't
seen cases of post-Chmura trauma, but the story has been a
stressful undercurrent for many of the children she counsels. She
said it especially triggers old fears and responses of girls who
have been victims of sexual abuse and tells boys, if at a
subconscious level, that women are objects of domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids have the ego strength to resist that type of
behavior,'' Nussbaum said. ``But other kids are more vulnerable and
might follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Connor, a professor of psychology at California State
University in Long Beach, where he teaches a class on sport
behavior, said children will turn cynical as NFL players continue
to let them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could very easily turn kids against the entire sport, the
entire process and the NFL altogether,'' Connor said. ``The way
kids think, they will generalize. They'll say if Rae Carruth did
it, everyone has done it, they just haven't been caught yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my biggest concern is the disillusionment won't stop with
the football. Kids may think you bend the rules to do whatever you
can get away with in society as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Such cynicism was evident this summer in Green Bay, where
muscled behemoths have been riding the bicycles of children since
the 1960s. Ten boys sat on their bikes, waiting for the objects of
their football worship and rattling off the Packers' recent rap
sheet. In addition to Chmura, four other Packers have been arrested
since December, on charges of obstruction of justice (Antonio
Freeman and Rodney Artmore), drunken driving and speeding (Marco
Rivera) and possession of marijuana (De'Mond Parker).
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Chmura, Jason Wassenberg, 11, said, ``I think he's
sick. That's gross to do that. It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Chad Van DenLangenberg, 13: ``I'm glad he got under
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone,'' said 13-year-old Jacob Stalberger, ``gets in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason: ``That's because some players think they can get away
with anything because they're pro football players and big
namers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do get away with it,'' retorted Scott Wick, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob: ``Look at De'Mond Parker. He had 7 grams of marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the charges were dropped,'' said Luke Parlow, referring to
an arrangement that had Parker completing a court-approved drug
course. ``They shouldn't have been.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boys eagerly approached other players after practice,
asking for autographs and offering rides.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre downplayed his influence on
children. ``I don't think NFL players should be role models for
someone else's kids,'' Favre said. ``The parents should be their
own role models. It's not our responsibility. We try to live life
the right way, but nobody's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Freeman, ``My role models are my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   After the obstruction of justice charge in a December traffic
accident that injured a woman, Freeman was sentenced to a year's
probation, $1,000 fine and 50 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was a Wisconsin Department of Transportation spokesman
for wearing seat belts, his likeness on 15,000 posters with the
words, ``Football is a game. Your life is not. Buckle Up.'' Police
found that he wasn't wearing his seat belt in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his conduct has hurt children, Freeman said no.
``We all make mistakes,'' he said. ``We're human.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   To what extent NFL players make criminal mistakes is in dispute.
In their often-cited 1998 book, ``Pros and Cons, the Criminals Who
Play in the NFL,'' authors Jeff Benedict and Don Yaeger said their
study of 509 players -- about one-third of the active NFL roster at
the time -- showed ``an eye-popping 109 (21 percent) were found to
have been formally charged (arrested or indicted) with a serious
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But a year later in CHANCE, a magazine of the American
Statistical Association, Benedict joined another author in
re-evaluating NFL arrests. They studied FBI figures for the general
population -- in this case only for assaults -- and concluded that
``the NFL rates are less than half the general population rates.''
</P>
<P>
   For players critical of what they consider distorted media
coverage, that clarification is evidence that NFL players are
better people than they are portrayed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disturbing to me that there are only one or two
incidents they seem to focus on and they don't see the good that
we're doing as far as raising and generating money for different
organizations that help people less fortunate,'' said veteran
defensive end Bruce Smith of the Washington Redskins. ``They don't
see us being mentors for children and being positive role models.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Darrell Green is such a mentor. After a two-hour
summer practice in Ashburn, Va., \roMDRV\ &UR; -in 90-degree heat and
high humidity, Green stood on a plush, green practice field wearing
a sweat-soaked T-shirt and Redskins football pants, talking to 14
children involved with the Darrell Green Youth Life Foundation.
When the kids seemed restless, the defensive back called them to
attention with a firm, ``Stay with me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he retires, Green, 40, said he wants to set aside $10
million for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you take care of things they can't take away from
you,'' Green told the children. ``In sports, you can break a leg.
But no one can take your honesty away from you. No one can take
your integrity away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking to the locker room, Green said it is foolish to see Nike
spend millions of dollars on athlete endorsements to persuade
children to buy expensive shoes and not believe that NFL players
have a powerful influence on other types of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that thing called celebrity fame,'' Green said. ``I'm not
exploiting it from the standpoint of making dollars. But I'm
exploiting it from the standpoint of trying to access the hearts
and minds of youths and trying to turn them toward what is right,
what is honest and what is respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) \roMDUL\ &UR; - But for every moment of
attention from a Darrell Green, there seems to be a counter-moment
from a Plaxico Burress, first-round draft pick of the Pittsburgh
Steelers\roMDRV\ &UR; -, which gave him a $5.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   While children asked for autographs after a practice
\roMDRV\ &UR; -this summer in Latrobe, Pa., Burress ignored them and
walked to his new, shiny Hummer, the wide-bodied vehicle based on
the military's Humvee. He drove through a sea of kids without
establishing eye contact, leaving several holding pens with
confused looks on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Fasano, 19, a ``die-hard Steelers fan'' for as long as he
can remember, witnessed the scene, which fueled the distaste he
feels for what money has done to the NFL and the tradition
established by gritty, not greedy, players like Joe Greene and
Rocky Bleier, leaders of the ``Steel Curtain'' Steelers of the
1970s, a team that won four Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   \roMDRV\ &UR; -\roMDRV\ &UR; -``That's gaudy, flamboyant and out of touch
with the world,'' said Fasano, a University of Florida student.
``That Hummer was a microcosm of what I'm talking about. It didn't
even stop for the kids. It sped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fasano traces his distaste to when his favorite Steeler, Barry
Foster, held out for more money, teaching then 12-year-old Fasano
that ``the players don't give a damn about me. They just care about
their paychecks.'' He'd have been emotionally scarred, Fasano said,
if he'd seen his hero on national television as the subject of a
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Around the NFL, there seems to be a growing consensus that big
money in the hands of 20-something men with an adoring entourage
can be the root of some evil, sending a bad message to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I can browbeat the guys into doing the right
thing,'' said Nesby Glasgow, the Seattle Seahawks' director of
player programs, a full-time position every team is required to
have. ``But we do sit down and talk about goals and aspirations,
and I may tell these guys I don't see your behavior reflecting your
goals and aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also requires rookies to attend a symposium designed to
teach life skills. One of this year's speakers was Lewis, who in
the aftermath of his murder trial warned about carefully choosing
friends. The NFL says past statistics suggest that four rookies are
likely to be arrested this year, along with 12 second-year players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the league for eight years and the programs have
increased 500 percent,'' said Baltimore Ravens quarterback Trent
Dilfer. ``The hardest thing for me was that I was only 21 years old
when they handed me $4.5 million. I had great parents and good
people around me, but that amount of money is overwhelming. I still
made mistakes.''
</P>
<P>

 `Survivor' Addicts Wonder How They'll Spend Their Wednesday

<P>
   After this week, Wednesday nights will never be the same for
them.
</P>
<P>
   They are the addicts, the obsessed. They are not mere
``Survivor'' fans, they are sheer ``Survivor'' fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   They do things like videotape each episode so they can later
analyze minutiae they missed. They turn off the telephone,
reschedule dates, rush home in a frenzy just so they can have their
Wednesday night fix.
</P>
<P>
   All that for a CBS-TV show featuring a bunch of sweaty people on
an island backstabbing their way to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But to many ``Survivor'' addicts, the money isn't the point.
</P>
<P>
   For Enrique Rojas, a computer programmer in Toronto, it's the
sheer unpredictability. You never know who will betray whom, who
will suddenly strip naked, who will explode in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't know what to expect,'' said Rojas, 26. ``With
sitcoms and other shows, you pretty much know what's going to
happen. But with this, well, actors could try, scriptwriters could
try, even the proverbial million monkeys at typewriters could try,
but none of them could come close to creating `Survivor.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas recently auctioned off a charcoal portrait he sketched of
Colleen, a favorite contestant who recently departed the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``To whoever wins the auction please take care of her. The
drawing I mean,'' Rojas wrote to bidders on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   If ratings are any indication, Rojas is one of a massive number
of fans that has steadily grown through the summer's run. According
to A.C. Nielsen, last week's ``Survivor'' had 28.7 million viewers
-- more than the other five major networks combined (20.7 million).
And that number was up 670,000 viewers from the previous week. The
Daily Variety industry newspaper has dubbed it a ``summer smash.''
Industry analysts say that as many as 38 million may watch
Wednesday's finale.
</P>
<P>
   Lea Ann Martin of Topeka, Kan., finds ``Survivor'' so
enthralling that it has become a central part of her life. ``It's
sort of like watching a car wreck ,'' she said. ``You know it's
wrong to stare but you just can't help yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I set my schedule by it,'' added Martin, 30, who describes
herself as ``between jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My boyfriend works nights, and I wake him up to see it,'' she
said. ``It is the only thing he'll wake up for. I think it's a
super good thing. Everybody I know talks about the show. That's our
way to have a connection, through TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas has noticed the same phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the people who aren't fanatics have opinions and
theories, and know the characters,'' he said. ``Once at work I was
talking about it with a guy for 15 minutes, and he had never even
seen the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Radio personality Alpha Trivette, 46, regards the
program as a case study in human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this show will be used in future sociology and
archeology classes,'' he said from the studio of WBS. ``It has a
little of everything: The human instinct to survive by employing
all tactics, skills and treachery. There's sex, race relations,
conflict. Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Trivette and his wife, Kim, once rushed home from a restaurant
when they realized what time it was. ``We were saying, `10 minutes
to `Survivor,' 10 minutes to `Survivor,''' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should envy these addicts, said Robert Thompson,
professor of television, radio and film and at Syracuse University
in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know how when you really get into a book or TV show or
soap opera, nothing beats that feeling,'' said Thompson, director
of the university's Center for the Study of Popular Television.
``Maybe these people have an ability to go even deeper. I watch the
show all the time and tape it and go back over it, but I get paid
for it, it's my job. Here you've got people doing it for love.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who hasn't ``looked forward to a show this much since
`Twin Peaks,''' has his own theories as to why ``Survivor''
inspires such obsession: It is well-cast with strong, engaging
characters. And it's essentially a cliffhanger soap opera, ``with a
guarantee of the best soap-opera payoff each week: A character gets
killed off.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``Survivor'' does what the best miniseries can do, because
within its 13-episode run it has a definite beginning, middle and
end. ``Each time a character leaves, you've built up more emotional
equity,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Put all that together and you have potent and irresistible
television.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, fans hold little hope for ``Survivor II,''
which begins in September and will take place in the Australian
outback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it will be as good as the first one,'' Rojas
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was so intriguing about this one,'' Martin said, ``is it
was something super different. I'm not really interested in seeing
it again, just with new players.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Trivette, ``I don't know that it will have the same
draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson agreed. ``I'm not looking forward to the second one,''
he said. ``It's this particular group of people and all its
naivete, we got to see them learn the game. In the outback, that
group will know every intricacy of how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   So true ``Survivor'' addicts will resort to watching reruns and
reliving those 13 Wednesday nights in Internet chatrooms, around
office water coolers and on the telephone with friends.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no need for concern about their sanity, Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, a fan is someone who names their pets
Spock and Kirk,'' he said. ``Now if they name their KIDS Spock and
Kirk -- that's the time to consult a therapist.''

-- more than the other five major networks combined (20.7 million).
And that number was up 670,000 viewers from the previous week. The
Daily Variety industry newspaper has dubbed it a ``summer smash.''
Industry analysts say that as many as 38 million may watch
Wednesday's finale.
</P>
<P>
   Lea Ann Martin of Topeka, Kan., finds ``Survivor'' so
enthralling that it has become a central part of her life. ``It's
sort of like watching a car wreck ,'' she said. ``You know it's
wrong to stare but you just can't help yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I set my schedule by it,'' added Martin, 30, who describes
herself as ``between jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My boyfriend works nights, and I wake him up to see it,'' she
said. ``It is the only thing he'll wake up for. I think it's a
super good thing. Everybody I know talks about the show. That's our
way to have a connection, through TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas has noticed the same phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the people who aren't fanatics have opinions and
theories, and know the characters,'' he said. ``Once at work I was
talking about it with a guy for 15 minutes, and he had never even
seen the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Radio personality Alpha Trivette, 46, regards the
program as a case study in human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this show will be used in future sociology and
archeology classes,'' he said from the studio of WBS. ``It has a
little of everything: The human instinct to survive by employing
all tactics, skills and treachery. There's sex, race relations,
conflict. Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Trivette and his wife, Kim, once rushed home from a restaurant
when they realized what time it was. ``We were saying, `10 minutes
to `Survivor,' 10 minutes to `Survivor,''' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should envy these addicts, said Robert Thompson,
professor of television, radio and film and at Syracuse University
in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know how when you really get into a book or TV show or
soap opera, nothing beats that feeling,'' said Thompson, director
of the university's Center for the Study of Popular Television.
``Maybe these people have an ability to go even deeper. I watch the
show all the time and tape it and go back over it, but I get paid
for it, it's my job. Here you've got people doing it for love.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who hasn't ``looked forward to a show this much since
`Twin Peaks,''' has his own theories as to why ``Survivor''
inspires such obsession: It is well-cast with strong, engaging
characters. And it's essentially a cliffhanger soap opera, ``with a
guarantee of the best soap-opera payoff each week: A character gets
killed off.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``Survivor'' does what the best miniseries can do, because
within its 13-episode run it has a definite beginning, middle and
end. ``Each time a character leaves, you've built up more emotional
equity,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Put all that together and you have potent and irresistible
television.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, fans hold little hope for ``Survivor II,''
which begins in September and will take place in the Australian
outback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it will be as good as the first one,'' Rojas
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was so intriguing about this one,'' Martin said, ``is it
was something super different. I'm not really interested in seeing
it again, just with new players.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Trivette, ``I don't know that it will have the same
draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson agreed. ``I'm not looking forward to the second one,''
he said. ``It's this particular group of people and all its
naivete, we got to see them learn the game. In the outback, that
group will know every intricacy of how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   So true ``Survivor'' addicts will resort to watching reruns and
reliving those 13 Wednesday nights in Internet chatrooms, around
office water coolers and on the telephone with friends.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no need for concern about their sanity, Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, a fan is someone who names their pets
Spock and Kirk,'' he said. ``Now if they name their KIDS Spock and
Kirk -- that's the time to consult a therapist.''

DON'T TOSS OUT THE COBS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When corn is very young, you can eat it whole; the cob has as
much flavor as the kernels. But once it reaches four or five
inches, the cob is inedible. Still, all that flavor remains, and
it's a shame not to take advantage of it. The best way to do that
is to use the cobs as the base for a corn chowder.
</P>
<P>
   It's so easy that it should inspire you to move beyond the basic
soup and experiment with flavors from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   After stripping the kernels off a few ears, you can use the cobs
to make a quick stock. All it needs are something like potatoes to
add substance, seasonings and the corn.
</P>
<P>
   The entire process takes just about half an hour, and the result
is a thick, satisfying vegetable stew.
</P>
<P>
   At its simplest, chowder contains little more than corn, onion,
potatoes and milk; a couple of chopped tomatoes and a handful of
parsley add flavor and color (if you left out the milk, you might
think of this as Manhattan corn chowder). Starting with bacon and
finishing with cream makes a richer version of the dish.
</P>
<P>
   But leaving the traditional flavors behind is more fun.
</P>
<P>
   I add curry powder and ginger and finish the chowder with sour
cream and cilantro for a more exotic taste. When the potato is
replaced by rice and the cream with coconut milk, Southeast Asian
seasonings can be added to make a chowder that has little in common
with the original, yet still has intense corn flavor.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of chili powder, lime juice and cilantro, again
with sour cream, will give the chowder a Mexican character; you
might thicken it with corn tortilla chips.
</P>
<P>
   My technique for stripping the kernels from the cobs is simple:
after shucking the corn, stand the ears up in a shallow bowl, and
run a paring knife down the sides.
</P>
<P>
   For maximum efficiency, strip the corn and get the cobs
simmering in water first; then chop the onion while the oil is
heating, and peel and chop the potatoes as the onions are cooking.
At that point, almost all of the work is done.
</P>
<P>
   As long as your corn is young and tender, the kernels should be
held out until the chowder is just about ready, so they don't
overcook. But the new super-sweet hybrids, which will retain much
of their flavor for a few days, are not as tender, and their
kernels should be cooked for a few minutes at least. Just keep
tasting, and stop cooking when their texture seems right.
</P>
<P>
   BASIC CORN CHOWDER
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 to 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 ears of corn
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter or neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tomatoes, cored, seeded and chopped (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup whole or low-fat milk
</P>
<P>
   { cup chopped parsley (optional).
</P>
<P>
   1. Shuck corn, and use a paring knife to strip kernels into a
bowl. Put cobs in a pot with 4 cups water; bring to a boil, cover
and simmer while you continue. 2. Put butter or oil in a saucepan,
and turn heat to medium-high. When butter melts or oil is hot, add
onion and potatoes, along with a sprinkling of salt and pepper.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion softens, about 5 minutes;
add tomatoes and cook, stirring, for another minute or two.
</P>
<P>
   3. After corncobs have cooked at least 10 minutes, strain liquid
into onion-potato mixture; bring to a boil, then lower heat to a
simmer. When potatoes are tender, add corn kernels and milk, and
heat through. Taste, and adjust seasonings. Garnish with the
parsley, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variations: Corn chowder with bacon and cream: In Step 2,
substitute { cup chopped bacon for butter or oil; cook over medium
heat until it renders some of its fat, then add onion. In Step 3,
use heavy cream or half-and-half in place of milk.
</P>
<P>
   Curried corn chowder: In Step 2, use oil, and add 1 tablespoon
each curry powder and peeled and minced ginger to the onions. In
Step 3, use sour cream in place of milk; garnish with cilantro in
place of parsley.

   WHERE TO STASH SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT CASH
</P>
<P>
   SHORTTERM-INVEST-SMARTMONEY _ The market's gut-wrenching ride
this year should serve as a reminder to us all: Big investments in
stocks (tech or otherwise) simply aren't for people with short time
horizons. If you have near-term goals such as saving for a home, a
child's upcoming college education or a once-in-a-lifetime
vacation, you really should set up a separate portfolio that's
geared to protect your assets so they'll be there when you need
them. By Richard ten Wolde. (North American rights only.)
</P>
<P>
   BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALAN GREENSPAN
</P>
<P>
   GREENSPAN-SMARTMONEY _ Henry Johnsen, Hoyt Brown and Pete McDade
belong to a growing (and highly vocal) minority of individual
investors who truly detest Alan Greenspan. They don't understand
why the Federal Reserve Board chairman fears inflation; they think
he's overreacting to the so-called wealth effect caused by rising
asset prices; and most of all, they are furious about what his
latest interest-rate hikes have done to their tech-heavy stock
portfolios. By Landon Thomas Jr. (North American rights only.)

   FIVE SECRETS THE GAMING INDUSTRY WON'T TELL YOU
</P>
<P>
   GAMING-INDUSTRY-SMARTMONEY _ Everyone knows the house has an
advantage. But most casino patrons don't realize just how heavily
the odds are stacked against them. Games like keno give the house
an advantage of about 25 percent. Slot machines are popular, but
also the biggest moneymakers. Casinos play by design and market
heavily in ways the consumer never knew. By Brian O'Keefe. (North
American rights only.)

<P>
   1. YOU CAN'T WIN ...
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows the house has an advantage. But most casino
patrons don't realize just how heavily the odds are stacked against
them. Take keno, in which you pick a string of numbers, hoping to
match them to what the casino randomly generates. The house
advantage is at least 25 percent, increasing with the more numbers
you pick, says John Alcamo, author of ``Casino Gambling Behind the
Tables.'' The odds of hitting, say, the 10 spot _ a string of 10
numbers _ are 9 million to 1. Getting killed by fireworks is nine
times more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Slot machines are popular because they offer a shot at a big
jackpot for little investment. For example, $3 gets you a chance at
the Megabucks jackpot, which links slot machines in Nevada and
builds like a state lottery from a base of $5 million. The odds of
winning? Nearly 17 million to 1. You have a better chance of being
killed by an asteroid striking Earth.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe you won't win the jackpot in slots. But surely you have
a decent shot of walking out ahead of the game, right? Don't count
on it. ``Slot machines are the biggest moneymakers in the casino,''
Alcamo says. ``That should tell the players something.'' Experts
like him never play games that give the house more than a 2 percent
advantage, and quarter slots put the advantage at about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet? Blackjack. If you play perfect strategy, the
house advantage is less than 1 percent. And in craps, the pass and
come line bets give the house an advantage of less than 1.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   2. ... AND IF YOU DO, WE MIGHT NOT PAY YOU.
</P>
<P>
   While on vacation in Lake Tahoe, Cengiz Sengel stopped to show
his wife the lights of Reno, Nev. They walked into the Silver
Legacy casino, got a $20 bag of quarters and headed straight to one
of the slot machines. A few pulls later, three jackpot symbols
popped up in the windows. They had just won nearly $1.8 million. Or
so they thought. A supervisor, claiming the machine had
malfunctioned, denied the Sengels the payout. The couple appealed
all the way to the state Supreme Court, which this June ruled
against them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Effie Freeman put $3 into a slot machine at the
now-defunct Splash Casino in Tunica, Miss., and was stunned to see
red, white and blue ducks line up, signaling a $1.7 million
jackpot. But the state gaming commission ruled that it didn't count
because the machine had gone into ``tilt'' mode.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Westergard, a Nevada regulator, says that such decisions,
no matter how cruel they sound, are only fair. It's the computers
inside the machines, not what pops up in the window, that determine
winners, he says, and in the Sengels' case the computer connection
was disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   3. WE KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Harrah's Entertainment began gathering details on
players when it introduced its Total Gold frequent-gambler cards
(now called Total Rewards) and has built a database of 19 million
customers. Players insert the cards into slot machines or hand them
to casino supervisors when they play table games. The cards are
marketed as a prestige item that helps players accumulate comps
such as free rooms, meals and show tickets. But the real purpose is
to track the habits of each customer and tailor a marketing plan
that will keep players coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a good customer, they send down a hostess, she pats
you on your back and offers you dinner. She gets information on
you,'' says syndicated columnist Mark Pilarski, who spent 18 years
working at casinos. ``Next time you come in they ask about your
wife or dog by name. They know your anniversary. They'll definitely
send you a card for your birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   4. ADDICTS KEEP US IN BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   Does the gaming industry target addicts? ``It's like asking,
Does the vodka industry target alcoholics?'' says Henry Lesieur,
head of the Institute for Problem Gambling. ``Well, they target
heavy drinkers, and a certain percentage are alcoholics.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke professors Charles Clotfelter and Phillip Cook conducted a
study that found that 10 percent of lottery players account for 68
percent of lottery purchases. Similarly, University of Illinois
professor Earl Grinols estimates that one-third to one-half of
casino revenue comes from problem or pathological gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more disturbing are cases where casinos allow known
addicts to continue betting. After losing a million dollars,
Houston businessman Joe McNeely wrote several Louisiana casinos
asking that they not allow him to gamble. But that didn't prevent
him from losing another $2 million. McNeely then sued five casinos,
claiming they continued to market to him aggressively even after
they were aware of his addiction. Representatives of one casino, he
says, even showed up at his mother's funeral and invited him to
stop by. Though the casinos pointed out that McNeely hadn't
registered with the state police, which has a self-banning system
for addicts, they settled the suit last fall for an undisclosed
amount.
</P>
<P>
   5. WE TARGET YOUR CHILDREN ... AND YOUR PARENTS.
</P>
<P>
   More kids today gamble than are involved with drugs, smoking or
drinking, according to Jeff Derevensky, a psychology professor at
McGill University in Montreal. One reason: They are growing up with
a message that wagering is acceptable. ``Today's 10-year-old will
spend their entire life in a world in which gambling is sanctioned
and owned by the government,'' he says. To make matters worse,
Derevensky has found that the addiction rate among youths is two to
four times that of the population at large.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's illegal to play the lottery if you're under 18,
studies show that a high share of adolescents buy tickets _ 32
percent in Louisiana, 34 percent in Texas and 35 percent in
Connecticut. How? In some states, ticket sales aren't always
monitored. Twenty-nine states use automated machines in public
places such as airports and stores as one way of dispensing
instant-game tickets.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just lotteries that are accused of catering to kids.
Pete Earley, author of Super Casino, points to the new
family-friendly atmosphere promoted in Las Vegas. ``It's
calculated,'' he says. ``You're encouraging future generations to
come there, and reinforcing that gambling is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   After studying the effects of gambling on seniors, Dennis
McNeilly, a psychologist at a geriatric clinic in Omaha, Neb.,
found that casinos tailor their marketing to attract an older
crowd. The Station Casino in St. Charles, Mo., for instance, has a
Golden Opportunities Club for people 55-plus, in which they can
earn credits toward meals and gambling chips. The casino also
offers free valet parking and $1 lunches to seniors. Some casinos
run shuttle buses from retirement homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Looney, executive director of the Council on Compulsive
Gambling of New Jersey cites that in 1997, gamblers 60 and older
accounted for 65 percent of the $3.7 billion Atlantic City took in.
Says Looney, ``You have a right to market your product, but there's
a line you need to draw.''

<P>
   Andrew Malgieri got rich earlier this year. And for that he can
thank his stock options in an Internet company called NaviSite.
Malgieri, a 32-year-old network engineer, joined the Andover,
Mass., company this past December. NaviSite was an incredibly hot
company _ for a while. The options he got when coming on board
allowed him to purchase stock for $26; a week after he joined,
shares were already trading at $35. Then the stock skyrocketed,
reaching a high of $159 in April. Malgieri started dreaming of
early retirement, buying a house out West in Snowbird or maybe
Vermont, so he could ski in the winter. He told his buddies, ``I'll
be skiing while you guys are working.'' At the peak, Malgieri was
worth $35 million _ on paper, of course. It was a far cry from his
modest upbringing. His father is a guidance director at a public
high school; his mother is an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   He and two friends who joined NaviSite at the same time started
acting the role. One night the trio, on their way to a charity
ball, stopped at the posh Boston Harbor Hotel to celebrate their
options, which had now put them past the multimillion mark. The
three of them, dressed in black tie, toasted their most recent
milestone with champagne as they waited for a limo to pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stock was trading high, there was a three- or
four-week period where I was impervious to anything,'' he says. ``I
felt like I was flying on top of the world and nothing else
mattered. Nothing bad could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the stock started to fall and finally plummeted to $31. By
late June it had bounced back to $46, which means his options are
now worth about $500,000. Malgieri took to checking the share price
twice an hour _ sometimes every 15 minutes _ and recalculating the
impact on his stake.
</P>
<P>
   Today Malgieri is still living in Billerica, the same
blue-collar Boston suburb he called home before he joined NaviSite.
Now he's thinking about leaving the company altogether before his
first option share even vests.
</P>
<P>
   He's like a lot of people who chased dot-com dreams, tasted
fantastic riches and are now coming back down to earth with a thud.
For a brief, shining moment, options held the promise of limitless
affluence. Now, except for the lucky few who got in early with the
right companies, they seem like a macabre tease.
</P>
<P>
   According to the San Francisco Federal Reserve, Silicon Valley
IPOs created option wealth of some $68 billion, or $500,000 each
for roughly 134,000 employees, between 1997 and 1999. But then the
market capitalization of those companies declined one-third from
mid-February to early May, and some $22.7 billion of wealth
disappeared into the Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if you bought a lottery ticket and you have the
winning numbers, and then you take it to the store to cash it in
and they're like, 'Sorry, there were forgeries going around and you
got one,''' says Moira McGarvey Black, 39, vice president of ad
sales for the Seattle-based OnHealth Network, who held thousands of
options with a strike price as low as $4. She watched the shares go
as high as $21 last year _ ``I would say I was close to being a
millionaire'' before they went underwater this spring.
</P>
<P>
   At least some relished their 15 minutes. Dan Hurwitz's options
may be underwater, but he'd already lived it up after the stock of
his online media company, whose name he requested not be published,
peaked at $106 in January: He installed a pool in his Long Island,
N.Y., home and bought a new two-seater Mercedes. He also stashed
some money away for his kids' education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' the 35-year-old sales executive recalls. ``Your
attitude changes. You're like, 'I'm worth X amount, and I'm so
proud. 'Everyone started treating me differently. I would go out to
dinner and when the check came, friends would say, 'Give it to Dan,
Mr. Money Bags. He's the rich guy.' In my own head, I'm like, 'Wow,
I'm on top of the world.' You can't not like the attention.'' But
the attention vanished when the stock tumbled 83 percent and stayed
there.
</P>
<P>
   Impossible dreams die hard, but die they will. The romance of
working for startups _ the 80-hour weeks, the fast-food diets and,
above all, the chance to strike it rich _ has begun to sour. If
anything, there's a sense of bitterness in the air. ``No one wants
to hear another story about the 23-year-old who started the company
from his dorm room and is now worth $10 million,'' says Bill
Lessard, 34, a New York startup veteran and founder of the gripe
site NetSlaves.com.
</P>
<P>
   Lessard gave up chasing options after a couple of bad stints.
One example is when he joined AirMedia, a wireless media company,
when he had only $3,000 in his bank account and was desperate not
only to make some money, but to make a lot of money. ``I'd be lying
if I said I didn't want to strike it rich,'' he says. ``You get to
the point where you think, 'There must be something wrong with me.
How come everyone's rich but me? What am I doing wrong?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hired as a manager for AirMedia's Web site in 1996, Lessard says
he was lured not by the $50,000 salary, but by the options. ``They
said they were going to go public and that I was going to get a lot
of options and be rich. They also said that when I finished with
their site, there would be plenty more for me to do, lots of
opportunities. They said that I would have my own department and
that I would have all these responsibilities. All this
entrepreneurial bullshit.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, after wrapping up just one project for the
company, Lessard was fired.
</P>
<P>
   For all the disappointments, though, there are still a few
headstrong souls who are sure that their big break is right around
the corner. Michael Perhaes, 40, who lives in Manhattan's trendy
Chelsea district, is one. He turned down a job offer (with 15,000
options) from America Online in 1997 for one reason: He didn't want
to work in ``the middle of nowhere,'' he says. ``AOL is located at
the Dulles airport. Literally. It's a groovy space, but I mean the
employees go to like the Wal-Mart cafeteria for lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a grave mistake. ``I figure if I took the 15,000 shares
at the 1997 price, which was like eight splits ago, I'd be totally
vested and I'd be worth well over $1.5 million today. We would be
having this conversation in Bermuda. Or Tahiti, where I'd be
drinking heavily and bragging about how rich I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaes erred again when he left digital information provider
Wave Systems, where he was creative director, that same year.
Again, he didn't like the location: Lee, Mass. Plus, he thought the
company was going to go under. ``A couple of years later, the stock
came around,'' he laments. ``Went up to like $50, and now it's
about $15. I had a $2.75 strike price _ about a million bucks of
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he refuses to give up. Now Perhaes is placing all bets on
digital broadcaster Wavexpress, which plans to go public in about a
year. (Ironically, it's co-owned by Wave Systems.) Perhaes has a
huge number of options, and while the strike price hasn't been set,
he's exhilarated. ``This is the last job I am ever going to have.
It is,'' he says. ``I am just not going to strike out a third
time.''

<P>
   For a while there, Robert Lipsky was feeling pretty cocky. Back
in October 1999, the Vancouver, Wash., bank consultant and his
wife, Angeline, had put a good portion of the money they were
saving for a new home into the H&AMP;Q IPO &AMP; Emerging Company fund. The
tech-laden portfolio shot up 100 percent in the three months after
they bought it, and suddenly it looked as if the Lipskys would be
able to afford a lot more property than they'd imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Then came this spring, when tech stocks went into their free
fall. The H&AMP;Q fund was among the hardest hit. Its wipeout was so
severe that the Lipskys' investment is now worth 20 percent less
than when they started last fall. ``When the bottom dropped out, I
felt like I had just won a couple of grand in Vegas and lost it all
again,'' Lipsky says. ``I'm now very skeptical of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Rightly so. Indeed, the market's gut-wrenching ride this year
should serve as a reminder to us all: Big investments in stocks
(tech or otherwise) simply aren't for people with short time
horizons. If you have near-term goals such as saving for a home, a
child's upcoming college education or a once-in-a-lifetime
vacation, you really should set up a separate portfolio that's
geared to protect your assets so they'll be there when you need
them.
</P>
<P>
   Being cautious, however, doesn't mean you have to sacrifice
growth entirely. With a little effort, you can produce much bigger
returns than you'd get from your basic money market fund. ``You
don't want to bet the farm,'' says Andrew Keeler, a financial
planner in Columbus, Ohio, ``but if you're too conservative, you'll
fall short of your goal _ and that's the ultimate risk.''
</P>
<P>
   So where should you put your cash? Following are three sample
portfolios for short-term investors, from conservative to fairly
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERSAFE
</P>
<P>
   You have only a year or so before you need to spend your cash,
and you can't stomach the idea of losing any of your principal. CDs
are going to look awfully tempting, with one-year rates reaching as
high as 7.5 percent. The downside of CDs: Your money is locked up
in the investment for a fixed time, unless you're willing to pay a
penalty to take it out. You also have to pay state and federal tax
on the income. Which is why you might be happier with Treasury
notes. They're free from state and local taxes and are highly
liquid. If you're in a state with a high income tax, you might be
able to get a better after-tax return than with CDs. Plus, should
an emergency arise, or you find your dream home quicker than you
anticipated, cashing out of Treasuries isn't a problem. Recently,
two-year notes were paying 6.5 percent. You can buy them through
most brokerage firms or go directly to the government
(www.publicdebt.treas.gov) and avoid transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   MODERATELY RISKY
</P>
<P>
   Your time frame is a little longer _ 18 months to two years,
perhaps _ so you can afford a touch of volatility in return for
bigger gains. While keeping 30 percent of your short-term savings
in Treasuries, consider putting the remaining 70 percent in a
prime-rate fund (also known as a loan-participation fund).
</P>
<P>
   These portfolios invest in loans to companies with less than
perfect credit ratings. If one of these companies goes belly up,
the fund is one of the first lenders to be repaid, unlike junk-bond
funds. Managers also diversify their risk by investing in hundreds
of loans. In fact, compared with ultrashort-term bond funds, these
portfolios deliver some of the least volatile returns. Eaton Vance
Prime Rate Reserves is one of the oldest and steadiest performers,
gaining about 6.8 percent a year in the past five years. Talk about
stability: It hasn't finished a quarter with a negative return
since it opened in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of gain can you expect? A portfolio split 30/70
between Treasury notes and a prime-rate fund should return about
6.9 percent a year. Just remember that prime-rate funds aren't
government-backed.
</P>
<P>
   AGGRESSIVE
</P>
<P>
   Once your time horizon stretches three years or beyond, you can
safely own a bond fund and maybe even a stock fund or two. A
reasonable three-year portfolio looks like this: 35 percent in a
conservative stock fund, 30 percent in a loan-participation fund,
10 percent in a taxable-bond fund and 25 percent in Treasuries.
SmartMoney's computer model shows this portfolio has historically
earned as much as 13.4 percent a year, with standard deviation of
3.5 percent. (That means two-thirds of the time the actual returns
should be within 3.5 percentage points of the estimate.)
</P>
<P>
   Two good bond funds: Strong Advantage and Sit U.S. Government
Securities. Strong Advantage does dabble in junk bonds. But with
245 holdings, the managers have been able to dilute the risk. In
the past five years, even during a tough interest-rate environment,
the fund gained 6 percent annually, compared with 5.6 percent for
its average peer. The Sit fund, a more traditional portfolio, buys
government bonds ranging from Treasuries to GNMAs. It's gained 5.8
percent annually in the past five years. But beware: If interest
rates continue to rise, this fund could get bitten.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the highest tax brackets should consider
substituting a low-expense muni bond fund. The Vanguard
Limited-Term Tax-Exempt and USAA Tax-Exempt Short-Term funds are
two of the safest, and both are solid performers.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the stock funds. If you're willing to take on some risk,
take a look at Vanguard Growth &AMP; Income, which has actually beaten
the S&AMP;P over the past three-, five- and 10-year periods. The
managers use computer models to look for companies that are
relatively underpriced and show signs of increased earnings.
</P>
<P>
   T. Rowe Price Growth Stock, meanwhile, has beaten the S&AMP;P during
the past five years. The manager looks for companies that are
underpriced relative to their free cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a real slow cooker _ one that won't come anywhere
near a bull market's returns but won't cause you to lose sleep _
Invesco Equity Income is your fund. It has low volatility but has
gained 16.8 percent annually over the past five years. The managers
curb risk by investing in dividend-paying stocks and a smattering
of bonds. This year it's up 4.1 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Johnsen is a retired college professor living in Dunedin,
Fla. Hoyt Brown is an ex-General Electric factory worker who day
trades stocks from his Armuchee, Ga., home. Pete McDade is a
Florida aerospace engineer. Although a diverse group, the three
have a couple of things they share. They've all lost money in the
market this year. And they all know exactly who's to blame: Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a dream wrecker, that Greenspan,'' Johnsen snarls. ``He
wants us all to work at McDonald's until we are 72.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is full of it,'' Brown complains.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a putz,'' says McDade. ``A wrinkled-up prune of a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan _ whose official response to that kind of criticism is
a polite ``no comment'' _ can take comfort in the fact that most
people think he's doing a good job. Yet Johnsen, Brown and McDade
belong to a growing (and highly vocal) minority of individual
investors who truly detest him. They don't understand why Greenspan
fears inflation; they think he's overreacting to the so-called
wealth effect caused by rising asset prices; and most of all, they
are furious about what his latest interest-rate hikes have done to
their tech-heavy stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the kind of thing most Americans have gotten themselves
so worked up about in the past. As recently as the Fed's last
string of rate hikes in November 1994, the debate was very much
limited to Wall Street strategists. But this is a new era _ a time
when the once arcane and rarefied process of trading stocks has
been truly democratized. Now it seems as if everyone has a stake in
the argument. Forty-nine percent of Americans have some exposure,
direct or indirect, to the stock market. More important, though, is
the extent to which people have been buying stocks on their own.
Nineteen percent of American households own stock, up from 15
percent in 1995, all of them trying to grab a slice of the American
dream.
</P>
<P>
   For this new breed of investor, the latest rate hikes smack of a
hand that is all too visible. Henry Johnsen says he has phoned
Greenspan's office at least 50 times in search of an explanation.
The U.S. economy may have been growing at a rate of 7 percent a
year, but there is a second industrial revolution under way. ``I
want some answers. What is it he wants? A worldwide depression? Is
it in the Fed's charter to manufacture recessions? They talk about
a free market. Baloney. This market is controlled and manipulated
by Alan Greenspan.''
</P>
<P>
   At Greenspan's unofficial fan club Web site, GetExuberant.com,
chief groupie and site founder David Gallivan had to clear the
message board after a recent flood of anti-Greenspan chatter.
``There were just too many of them,'' he says. ``And they were
getting personal. Our members were getting intimidated.''
Long-standing Fed-basher Larry Kudlow, an economist with ING
Barings, reports a surge in support as well. Nine months ago he
would get 150 or so e-mails a week; now after one of his regular
appearances on CNBC, he gets as many as 800 in a week _ with nine
out of 10 written in support of his Alan-just-does-not-get-it
commentary. ``As far as the Alan Greenspan cult goes,'' Kudlow
says, ``the bloom is definitely off the rose.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaving through many stories of anti-Greenspan rage and
frustration is a clear us-versus-them mentality _ a pungent whiff
of class antagonism. There is no doubt that the stock market boom
of the '90s has made a lot of people very wealthy, but a good
two-thirds of that wealth remains in the hands of only 10 percent
of the population. The other 90 percent have been playing catch-up,
many with their life savings and retirement money. And now
Greenspan is taking it away from them. They feel violated. This is
not money they can afford to lose. Besides, they haven't lost
before; their only experience is with a bull market. ``I lose half
my net worth and there Greenspan is on TV talking about the wealth
effect,'' says Hoyt Brown, who has watched his retirement savings
of $88,000 dwindle to less than $30,000 this year. ``I'd like him
to tell me where that wealth effect is. ... I just don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is more than a little cynical, too. ``Let me tell you, if you
don't think those guys at the Fed took advantage of these rate
hikes and made a little bit on the side, and told their
brother-in-law too, well, then you've just fallen off the turnip
truck,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's response? Equanimity. Indeed, in light of recent
soft economic data, the growing consensus is that for the time
being at least, Greenspan's work is all but done. ``It wouldn't be
the first time he got it right. Remember, this is the same man that
engineered the soft landing in 1994,'' says Lehman Brothers
economist Stephen Slifer, pointing to weak retail sales numbers as
a signal that the economy is now on the wane. ``There is no
evidence that we are going to go over a cliff'' and into a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   If Slifer is right, this groundswell of antagonism will probably
ease. After all, most investors loved Greenspan when their
portfolios enjoyed double-digit gains. But should the markets turn
genuinely bearish long enough to erode retirement savings, the
whiff of class warfare could become a stench. A generation of new
investors who have begun to look to the markets as the source of a
guaranteed annuity for their golden years will suddenly discover
this basic rule of investing: sometimes you win, sometimes you
lose.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the scapegoat for their disappointment was
Greenspan, against whom their rage is pretty much impotent. Next
time, they could just as easily turn their ire on a target who can
be hurt at the polls, someone who could be in a position to appoint
the next Greenspan. And if Social Security dollars wind up in the
market, there's no telling what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   For people like LaJuana Gilmore of Houston, the issue is far
from academic. A 61-year-old newly retired administrative
assistant, she is relying on her IRA to sustain her. Every day she
logs on to track the progress of her Putnam funds. So on March 25,
when the Nasdaq fell, she knew to a penny how much money she had
lost: $12,000, or 15 percent of her IRA _ about half of what she
needs to get by in a year. How could it be? And who was this Alan
Greenspan guy, anyway? ``Before this year, I'd never had any real
feelings about the man,'' she recounts. ``But then he started
raising rates, and my funds just went crazy. I mean, who does he
think he is? God?''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore searched the Internet for Greenspan's e-mail address but
couldn't find it. What she did find, though, was a site _ Alan
Greenspan's Dreambook _ where posters could display whatever
messages they might have for the chairman. She wasn't sure if her
note would get to him, but she figured she had nothing to lose.
``Mr. Greenspan,'' she wrote. ``Inflation is not killing me, but
your messing with the interest rates is. Maybe you need to retire
and turn the reins over to someone who understands that we need our
retirement money to grow. A worried person on disability, LaJuana
Gilmore.''

<P>
   Q: How can I contact the Commission on Presidential Debates to
register my opinion about including third-party candidates in the
debates?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.T., Ocean City, Md.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Executive Director Janet Brown, Commission on
Presidential Debates, 1200 New Hampshire Ave. N.W., Box 445,
Washington, DC 20036 or call (202) 872-1020.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates, a not-for-profit group
formed in 1987 to produce and sponsor presidential and vice
presidential debates, determines which candidates are eligible to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible this election year, a candidate must average at
least 15 percent support in five polls: ABC News/Washington Post,
CBS News/New York Times, NBC News/Wall Street Journal, CNN/USA
Today/Gallup and Fox News/Opinion Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Under current polling totals, only Vice President Al Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush would be invited to the presidential debate.
Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan, the third-party candidates included
most often in polls, average less than 5 percent support each.

   Q: I enjoy the computer versions of mah jongg. Where can I buy a
real tile set?
</P>
<P>
   _ V.K., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: The retailer Mah Jongg Maven in Augusta, Ga., sells sets,
tiles, racks and jewelry devoted to the game.
</P>
<P>
   For a free brochure about the company's products, call (888)
860-1981 or write to Mah Jongg Maven, 404 Fifth St., Suite 100,
Augusta, GA 30901. You can also shop online at
www.mahjonggmaven.com.
</P>
<P>
   One thing to note when buying a set is the number of tiles it
contains. ``If you want to play American rules, you need an
American-style mah jongg set: 152 tiles,'' recommends Tom Sloper,
developer of Activision's ``Shanghai'' mah jongg game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the standard 136 suit tiles and dragons and
winds, you need eight Flowers/seasons and eight jokers, four racks,
and chips.'' Activision publishes a Web site for players at

HOUSTON AREA FARM SHARES ITS HARVEST WITH THE NEEDY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ART CHAPMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of Texas farmers are in a tough spot this year _ there
hasn't been enough rain to settle the dust, let alone raise a crop
_ but on one small pasture in southeast Texas enough surplus food
is being produced to help feed the needy throughout the state and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just sent a half-a-truck-load to Fort Worth,'' said Becky
Finch of Share The Harvest in Brazoria County. ``That's about
22,500 pounds of rice. We also sent some to Austin and San Antonio.
That's what we try to do: Take care of people in our area first,
then the rest of Texas. If we've got some left, we reach out as far
as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the 58-acre rice pasture southeast of Houston near
Danbury will produce about 350,000 pounds of rice to be distributed
to food banks all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The pasture is donated, the cultivation is donated, and so is
the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Share The Harvest, a foundation established by Garret
Farms _ the local company that provides much of the volunteer labor
and equipment for the pasture _ said they joined with other local
farmers last year to donate ]one and a half million pounds of rice.
</P>
<P>
   Finch, the office manager at Garrett Farms, and Share The
Harvest, said that about 60 percent of the donated rice crop is
going to the Houston Food Bank, the surplus will reach as far as
Africa and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Brazoria County farms have joined in the harvest
again this year. Mowery Farms of Rosharon is among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just for a great cause,'' owner Curt Mowery told The
Facts, a Brazoria County newspaper. ``We've been pretty fortunate
the past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mowery couldn't participate last year, he didn't get his own
harvest finished in time, but this year he arrived early and
brought some neighboring farmers with him.
</P>
<P>
   Jacko Garrett, who owns Garrett Farms, has always donated a part
of his harvest to charity, Finch said, but Share The Harvest has
made collection and distribution more organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was Jacko's idea from a long time ago,'' she said. ``Now
we're trying to come up with some other ideas as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other ideas is a plan to swap some of the surplus rice
for other crops. ``We'd like to get together with farmers around
the country and maybe swap a truck load of rice for a truck load of
pinto beans,'' Finch said. ``You can feed a lot of people with rice
and beans. We just need to get the word out.''
</P>
<P>
   Finch said she is certain that Texas has enough caring people to
help feed the needy. Farmers throughout Texas have responded,
despite their difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you mention the donations to them, they ask what
they can do,'' she said. ``We've even had some high school kids get
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Finch said that several local high school students were working
for Garrett Farms. They were helping with the rice harvests in
other fields.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to harvest in the donated field, however, they
all punched out on their time cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us they saw everyone else donating their time and
equipment to harvest in that one field,'' Finch said. ``They said
they wanted to do something, too. So they punched out and went off
the clock before they started working in the pasture.''
</P>
<P>
   Finch said that several corporate donors have been involved in
the program. Chemical companies have provided the fertilizer and a
local trucker has furnished transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to deliver the crop off of this 58-acre
pasture to the food banks with little or no charge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some costs involved. Bags, palettes and the
milling process takes money, and Finch said Share The Harvest is
hoping that people who are not farmers, will get involved by
offering cash donations.
</P>

 ATTENTION EDITORS: With seven photos, of Mark Chmura (NNS1), Rae
Carruth (NNS2), Paul Krumberger (NNS3 and NNS4), Brett Favre
(NNS5), Antonio Freeman (NNS6) and Darrell Green (NNS7). 
 By MARK O'KEEFE  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Chmura wasn't just a Green Bay Packers tight end, outspoken
critic of Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct and United Way example
of what's supposed to be good and noble and true about the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura was a child's hero, riding 11-year-old Paul Krumberger's
bicycle between the Lambeau Field locker room and the Packers'
practice field.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Green Bay tradition for players to accept bike rides from
kids during summer training camp, and Paul got all the autographed
leather receiving gloves, signed them, and gave them to the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Paul returned this summer to offer rides to players, but his
former hero wasn't there to pedal. Subsequently cut by the Packers,
Chmura awaits trial on criminal charges in another blow to the
image of what has been dubbed the National Felony League.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, in Paul's words, ``did something really bad to a woman
when he was drunk.'' A district attorney deemed it third-degree
sexual assault, and since the woman was a 17-year-old girl, child
enticement. If convicted, Chmura could face up to 40 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of players in handcuffs and orange jail jumpsuits _
even players innocent until proven guilty _ have prompted concern
over a serious public relations injury to one of America's most
popular sports.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Paul, and thousands of children like him,
vulnerable to around-the-clock media hype of football players
marketed as mythic figures? If kids copy the on-the-field moves,
flamboyant celebrations and excessive trash talking of their Sunday
heroes, will they also imitate their off-the-field behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Many players dismiss the connection, saying they don't want to
be role models. But the league reluctantly acknowledges a
responsibility to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our players to be exemplary citizens,'' NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in an interview. ``We want them to
set high standards on the field as well as off the field. I think
the reality is that they are role models, whether we like it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chmura case is made richer by the former player's longtime
criticism of President Clinton. Chmura refused to attend the
traditional visit to the White House after the Packers won the
Super Bowl in 1997. After the Monica Lewinksky scandal, he
lambasted the president's morals and the message they sent to
children.
</P>
<P>
   But the charges against Chmura are only one pro football crime
story among several that have tarnished the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Others involve Rae Carruth, the former Carolina Panthers
receiver awaiting trial on first-degree murder charges in the
shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend, and Denver Broncos
linebacker Bill Romanowski, who faces felony charges in a
prescription drug case involving diet pills. The Baltimore Ravens'
Ray Lewis, the NFL's leading tackler last year, had murder charges
dropped in May in exchange for a guilty plea to obstruction of
justice in connection with a stabbing death after an Atlanta Super
Bowl party. The NFL subsequently fined Lewis $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists say there is little doubt that in this era of
around-the-clock sports coverage and slick marketing of stars, NFL
players have some effect on the millions of children who idolize
them. But the degree of influence is difficult to measure, and
varies from child to child, dependent in part on their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly in the power of modeling behavior. That's
been demonstrated for years,'' said Leonard Zaichkowsky, director
of sports psychology at Boston University and a past president of
the Association for Applied Sports Psychology for North America.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that he has seen no research establishing a
link between NFL and childhood behavior. Zaichkowsky said it's
similar to trying to prove that violent films make people violent.
The best evidence may be anecdotal.
</P>
<P>
   In Green Bay, child psychologist Bonnie Nussbaum said she hasn't
seen cases of post-Chmura trauma, but the story has been a
stressful undercurrent for many of the children she counsels. She
said it especially triggers old fears and responses of girls who
have been victims of sexual abuse and tells boys, if at a
subconscious level, that women are objects of domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids have the ego strength to resist that type of
behavior,'' Nussbaum said. ``But other kids are more vulnerable and
might follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Connor, a professor of psychology at California State
University in Long Beach, where he teaches a class on sport
behavior, said children will turn cynical as NFL players continue
to let them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could very easily turn kids against the entire sport, the
entire process and the NFL altogether,'' Connor said. ``The way
kids think, they will generalize. They'll say if Rae Carruth did
it, everyone has done it, they just haven't been caught yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my biggest concern is the disillusionment won't stop with
the football. Kids may think you bend the rules to do whatever you
can get away with in society as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Such cynicism was evident this summer in Green Bay, where
muscled behemoths have been riding the bicycles of children since
the 1960s. Ten boys sat on their bikes, waiting for the objects of
their football worship and rattling off the Packers' recent rap
sheet. In addition to Chmura, four other Packers have been arrested
since December, on charges of obstruction of justice (Antonio
Freeman and Rodney Artmore), drunken driving and speeding (Marco
Rivera) and possession of marijuana (De'Mond Parker).
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Chmura, Jason Wassenberg, 11, said, ``I think he's
sick. That's gross to do that. It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Chad Van DenLangenberg, 13: ``I'm glad he got under
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone,'' said 13-year-old Jacob Stalberger, ``gets in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason: ``That's because some players think they can get away
with anything because they're pro football players and big
namers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do get away with it,'' retorted Scott Wick, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob: ``Look at De'Mond Parker. He had 7 grams of marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the charges were dropped,'' said Luke Parlow, referring to
an arrangement that had Parker completing a court-approved drug
course. ``They shouldn't have been.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boys eagerly approached other players after practice,
asking for autographs and offering rides.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre downplayed his influence on
children. ``I don't think NFL players should be role models for
someone else's kids,'' Favre said. ``The parents should be their
own role models. It's not our responsibility. We try to live life
the right way, but nobody's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Freeman, ``My role models are my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   After the obstruction of justice charge in a December traffic
accident that injured a woman, Freeman was sentenced to a year's
probation, $1,000 fine and 50 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was a Wisconsin Department of Transportation spokesman
for wearing seat belts, his likeness on 15,000 posters with the
words, ``Football is a game. Your life is not. Buckle Up.'' Police
found that he wasn't wearing his seat belt in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his conduct has hurt children, Freeman said no.
``We all make mistakes,'' he said. ``We're human.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   To what extent NFL players make criminal mistakes is in dispute.
In their often-cited 1998 book, ``Pros and Cons, the Criminals Who
Play in the NFL,'' authors Jeff Benedict and Don Yaeger said their
study of 509 players _ about one-third of the active NFL roster at
the time _ showed ``an eye-popping 109 (21 percent) were found to
have been formally charged (arrested or indicted) with a serious
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But a year later in CHANCE, a magazine of the American
Statistical Association, Benedict joined another author in
re-evaluating NFL arrests. They studied FBI figures for the general
population _ in this case only for assaults _ and concluded that
``the NFL rates are less than half the general population rates.''
</P>
<P>
   For players critical of what they consider distorted media
coverage, that clarification is evidence that NFL players are
better people than they are portrayed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disturbing to me that there are only one or two
incidents they seem to focus on and they don't see the good that
we're doing as far as raising and generating money for different
organizations that help people less fortunate,'' said veteran
defensive end Bruce Smith of the Washington Redskins. ``They don't
see us being mentors for children and being positive role models.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Darrell Green is such a mentor. After a two-hour
summer practice in Ashburn, Va., in 90-degree heat and high
humidity, Green stood on a plush, green practice field wearing a
sweat-soaked T-shirt and Redskins football pants, talking to 14
children involved with the Darrell Green Youth Life Foundation.
When the kids seemed restless, the defensive back called them to
attention with a firm, ``Stay with me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he retires, Green, 40, said he wants to set aside $10
million for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you take care of things they can't take away from
you,'' Green told the children. ``In sports, you can break a leg.
But no one can take your honesty away from you. No one can take
your integrity away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking to the locker room, Green said it is foolish to see Nike
spend millions of dollars on athlete endorsements to persuade
children to buy expensive shoes and not believe that NFL players
have a powerful influence on other types of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that thing called celebrity fame,'' Green said. ``I'm not
exploiting it from the standpoint of making dollars. But I'm
exploiting it from the standpoint of trying to access the hearts
and minds of youths and trying to turn them toward what is right,
what is honest and what is respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) \roMDUL\ &UR; - But for every moment of
attention from a Darrell Green, there seems to be a counter-moment
from a Plaxico Burress, first-round draft pick of the Pittsburgh
Steelers, which gave him a $5.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   While children asked for autographs after a practice this summer
in Latrobe, Pa., Burress ignored them and walked to his new, shiny
Hummer, the wide-bodied vehicle based on the military's Humvee. He
drove through a sea of kids without establishing eye contact,
leaving several holding pens with confused looks on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Fasano, 19, a ``die-hard Steelers fan'' for as long as he
can remember, witnessed the scene, which fueled the distaste he
feels for what money has done to the NFL and the tradition
established by gritty, not greedy, players like Joe Greene and
Rocky Bleier, leaders of the ``Steel Curtain'' Steelers of the
1970s, a team that won four Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gaudy, flamboyant and out of touch with the world,''
said Fasano, a University of Florida student. ``That Hummer was a
microcosm of what I'm talking about. It didn't even stop for the
kids. It sped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fasano traces his distaste to when his favorite Steeler, Barry
Foster, held out for more money, teaching then 12-year-old Fasano
that ``the players don't give a damn about me. They just care about
their paychecks.'' He'd have been emotionally scarred, Fasano said,
if he'd seen his hero on national television as the subject of a
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Around the NFL, there seems to be a growing consensus that big
money in the hands of 20-something men with an adoring entourage
can be the root of some evil, sending a bad message to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I can browbeat the guys into doing the right
thing,'' said Nesby Glasgow, the Seattle Seahawks' director of
player programs, a full-time position every team is required to
have. ``But we do sit down and talk about goals and aspirations,
and I may tell these guys I don't see your behavior reflecting your
goals and aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also requires rookies to attend a symposium designed to
teach life skills. One of this year's speakers was Lewis, who in
the aftermath of his murder trial warned about carefully choosing
friends. The NFL says past statistics suggest that four rookies are
likely to be arrested this year, along with 12 second-year players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the league for eight years and the programs have
increased 500 percent,'' said Baltimore Ravens quarterback Trent
Dilfer. ``The hardest thing for me was that I was only 21 years old
when they handed me $4.5 million. I had great parents and good
people around me, but that amount of money is overwhelming. I still
made mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   How can parents prevent the mistakes of millionaire athletes
from adversely affecting their children? When an incident hits the
news, they should talk to their sons and daughters about it, giving
them an opportunity to vent while discussing their family values,
psychologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Nussbaum, the Green Bay therapist, said it was unfortunate that
she had to discuss graphic aspects of the Chmura and Carruth
incidents with her young daughter. But that, she added, is what
life is about in our society _ not just the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter just couldn't comprehend someone shooting a woman
who was pregnant. Yuck,'' said Nussbaum. ``I mean, I don't really
want to be talking to my 7-year-old about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krumberger doesn't want to be talking about what Chmura may
have done, either. But like many well-adjusted children, he is
capable of realizing that good athletes can make bad decisions that
kids should avoid.
</P>
<P>
   When Paul plays football with his buddies, he no longer imagines
that he's No. 89 cutting across the end zone for a touchdown. He's
considering selling those once-cherished Chmura gloves, as if
someone would want them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good influence on me,'' said Paul, ``until he did
that.''

   ``It could very easily turn kids against the entire sport, the
entire process and the NFL altogether,'' Connor said. ``The way
kids think, they will generalize. They'll say if Rae Carruth did
it, everyone has done it, they just haven't been caught yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my biggest concern is the disillusionment won't stop with
the football. Kids may think you bend the rules to do whatever you
can get away with in society as a whole.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Such cynicism was evident this summer in Green Bay, where
muscled behemoths have been riding the bicycles of children since
the 1960s. Ten boys sat on their bikes, waiting for the objects of
their football worship and rattling off the Packers' recent rap
sheet. In addition to Chmura, four other Packers have been arrested
since December, on charges of obstruction of justice (Antonio
Freeman and Rodney Artmore), drunken driving and speeding (Marco
Rivera) and possession of marijuana (De'Mond Parker).
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Chmura, Jason Wassenberg, 11, said, ``I think he's
sick. That's gross to do that. It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Chad Van DenLangenberg, 13: ``I'm glad he got under
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone,'' said 13-year-old Jacob Stalberger, ``gets in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason: ``That's because some players think they can get away
with anything because they're pro football players and big
namers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do get away with it,'' retorted Scott Wick, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob: ``Look at De'Mond Parker. He had 7 grams of marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the charges were dropped,'' said Luke Parlow, referring to
an arrangement that had Parker completing a court-approved drug
course. ``They shouldn't have been.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boys eagerly approached other players after practice,
asking for autographs and offering rides.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre downplayed his influence on
children. ``I don't think NFL players should be role models for
someone else's kids,'' Favre said. ``The parents should be their
own role models. It's not our responsibility. We try to live life
the right way, but nobody's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Freeman, ``My role models are my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   After the obstruction of justice charge in a December traffic
accident that injured a woman, Freeman was sentenced to a year's
probation, $1,000 fine and 50 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was a Wisconsin Department of Transportation spokesman
for wearing seat belts, his likeness on 15,000 posters with the
words, ``Football is a game. Your life is not. Buckle Up.'' Police
found that he wasn't wearing his seat belt in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his conduct has hurt children, Freeman said no.
``We all make mistakes,'' he said. ``We're human.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   To what extent NFL players make criminal mistakes is in dispute.
In their often-cited 1998 book, ``Pros and Cons, the Criminals Who
Play in the NFL,'' authors Jeff Benedict and Don Yaeger said their
study of 509 players _ about one-third of the active NFL roster at
the time _ showed ``an eye-popping 109 (21 percent) were found to
have been formally charged (arrested or indicted) with a serious
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But a year later in CHANCE, a magazine of the American
Statistical Association, Benedict joined another author in
re-evaluating NFL arrests. They studied FBI figures for the general
population _ in this case only for assaults _ and concluded that
``the NFL rates are less than half the general population rates.''
</P>
<P>
   For players critical of what they consider distorted media
coverage, that clarification is evidence that NFL players are
better people than they are portrayed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disturbing to me that there are only one or two
incidents they seem to focus on and they don't see the good that
we're doing as far as raising and generating money for different
organizations that help people less fortunate,'' said veteran
defensive end Bruce Smith of the Washington Redskins. ``They don't
see us being mentors for children and being positive role models.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Darrell Green is such a mentor. After a two-hour
summer practice in Ashburn, Va., in 90-degree heat and high
humidity, Green stood on a plush, green practice field wearing a
sweat-soaked T-shirt and Redskins football pants, talking to 14
children involved with the Darrell Green Youth Life Foundation.
When the kids seemed restless, the defensive back called them to
attention with a firm, ``Stay with me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he retires, Green, 40, said he wants to set aside $10
million for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you take care of things they can't take away from
you,'' Green told the children. ``In sports, you can break a leg.
But no one can take your honesty away from you. No one can take
your integrity away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking to the locker room, Green said it is foolish to see Nike
spend millions of dollars on athlete endorsements to persuade
children to buy expensive shoes and not believe that NFL players
have a powerful influence on other types of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that thing called celebrity fame,'' Green said. ``I'm not
exploiting it from the standpoint of making dollars. But I'm
exploiting it from the standpoint of trying to access the hearts
and minds of youths and trying to turn them toward what is right,
what is honest and what is respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) \roMDUL\ &UR; - But for every moment of
attention from a Darrell Green, there seems to be a counter-moment
from a Plaxico Burress, first-round draft pick of the Pittsburgh
Steelers, which gave him a $5.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   While children asked for autographs after a practice this summer
in Latrobe, Pa., Burress ignored them and walked to his new, shiny
Hummer, the wide-bodied vehicle based on the military's Humvee. He
drove through a sea of kids without establishing eye contact,
leaving several holding pens with confused looks on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Fasano, 19, a ``die-hard Steelers fan'' for as long as he
can remember, witnessed the scene, which fueled the distaste he
feels for what money has done to the NFL and the tradition
established by gritty, not greedy, players like Joe Greene and
Rocky Bleier, leaders of the ``Steel Curtain'' Steelers of the
1970s, a team that won four Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gaudy, flamboyant and out of touch with the world,''
said Fasano, a University of Florida student. ``That Hummer was a
microcosm of what I'm talking about. It didn't even stop for the
kids. It sped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fasano traces his distaste to when his favorite Steeler, Barry
Foster, held out for more money, teaching then 12-year-old Fasano
that ``the players don't give a damn about me. They just care about
their paychecks.'' He'd have been emotionally scarred, Fasano said,
if he'd seen his hero on national television as the subject of a
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Around the NFL, there seems to be a growing consensus that big
money in the hands of 20-something men with an adoring entourage
can be the root of some evil, sending a bad message to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I can browbeat the guys into doing the right
thing,'' said Nesby Glasgow, the Seattle Seahawks' director of
player programs, a full-time position every team is required to
have. ``But we do sit down and talk about goals and aspirations,
and I may tell these guys I don't see your behavior reflecting your
goals and aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also requires rookies to attend a symposium designed to
teach life skills. One of this year's speakers was Lewis, who in
the aftermath of his murder trial warned about carefully choosing
friends. The NFL says past statistics suggest that four rookies are
likely to be arrested this year, along with 12 second-year players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the league for eight years and the programs have
increased 500 percent,'' said Baltimore Ravens quarterback Trent
Dilfer. ``The hardest thing for me was that I was only 21 years old
when they handed me $4.5 million. I had great parents and good
people around me, but that amount of money is overwhelming. I still
made mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   How can parents prevent the mistakes of millionaire athletes
from adversely affecting their children? When an incident hits the
news, they should talk to their sons and daughters about it, giving
them an opportunity to vent while discussing their family values,
psychologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Nussbaum, the Green Bay therapist, said it was unfortunate that
she had to discuss graphic aspects of the Chmura and Carruth
incidents with her young daughter. But that, she added, is what
life is about in our society _ not just the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter just couldn't comprehend someone shooting a woman
who was pregnant. Yuck,'' said Nussbaum. ``I mean, I don't really
want to be talking to my 7-year-old about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krumberger doesn't want to be talking about what Chmura may
have done, either. But like many well-adjusted children, he is
capable of realizing that good athletes can make bad decisions that
kids should avoid.
</P>
<P>
   When Paul plays football with his buddies, he no longer imagines
that he's No. 89 cutting across the end zone for a touchdown. He's
considering selling those once-cherished Chmura gloves, as if
someone would want them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good influence on me,'' said Paul, ``until he did
that.''

GORE THE UNHAPPY WARRIOR FINALLY FINDS A SHTICK THAT STICKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore was down so far in the polls that his campaign resembled
one of those media vigils for a tot that tumbled down a well. Now
he beats George W. Bush to a thin red film on the floor in every
poll. How did this happen, exactly?
</P>
<P>
   Was it the convention that no one watched? Perhaps it was his
famous ``I will not let you down'' speech, which certainly set him
apart from those pols who promise to thwart your trust at every
opportunity. Maybe it was the big smooch he dealt the Tipper -- aw,
the big lug loves her! Let's give him control of domestic policy
and our nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the news, leaked on Gore's night of triumph, that
the reanimated corpse of Ken Starr had clawed its way from the
grave and announced it might indict Clinton. Everyone was outraged.
Outraged! Have the Republicans no shame? Politics as usual!
Partisanship! Sex-crazed vindictive hypocritical
work-of-the-American-people-thwarting lunatic zealots!
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was a Democrat-appointed judge who made the leak,
but that amplification appeared on page 28Z in most papers, next to
the kindergarten kickball tourney scores. Damage was done: Elect
Bush, and people might actually get indicted for wrongdoing. Can't
have that.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's bump might be due to all of this. None of it. Maybe the
bounce is exaggerated. Perhaps it's underestimated. What's clear is
that Gore has found his voice, his style, a shtick that sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonesque-But-Moral-Gore didn't work. Cyber-Gore didn't work.
Eco-Gore still horrifies most -- there's residual suspicion that
Gore would shed the suitcoat, smear himself with peat and spend his
term squatting over a fire roasting gourds and praying for the
Earth Goddess to forgive her hairless parasites.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's now the Unhappy Warrior, railing against the Corporations
and Special Interests. He slam Big Drugs for big profits. He
fastens his jaws on the glutes of Big Oil, which has the fabulous
gall to pass along the cost of government mandates. Big Tobacco,
Big Media, Big Liquor -- Gore demonizes them until the CEOs
themselves expect to see cloven hooves when they take off their
shoes. Why? Because they all make Obscene Profits.
</P>
<P>
   Odd: Let Big Government overtax you and rack up Obscene
Surpluses, and it's cause for a parade.
</P>
<P>
   Those surpluses, however, need spending, and Gore's the man to
do it. Bush, too. No matter who's elected, we'll have a
prescription drug benefit. It's hard to oppose the thing now
without sounding as if you favor seniors keeling over into their
evening mush. Opponents of the prescription-drug benefit program
call it the ``Viagra for Larry King'' concept. They figure that the
image of a capering priapic King wearing naught but suspenders,
glasses and a wanton grin is enough to make people vote no. If not
put out their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But most people will vote yes on drugs for seniors, because
everyone envisions a kindly Grandma with a cat on her lap and a pie
on the sill, impoverished by Pfitzer's usurious pricing strategy
for their anti-lumbago pills. Can't we spend a little of the
surplus on Grandma?
</P>
<P>
   It's odd: We can spend the surplus on drugs for the old. We can
spend it on Medicare, and Social Security, and smaller class sizes,
and alternative energy credits, and targeted tax cuts to provide
gas subsidies for gay former Scout leaders with smoking-related
illnesses who drive pregnant teens to the Planned Parenthood
clinic. We can spend the entire surplus nine times over, and
nothing bad will happen. But pass George Bush's tax cuts, and the
economy collapses into the Dark Ages and everyone gets paid in
piglets and seed corn.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work for Gore? Well, it gets the crowd excited. You can
sense Gore's righteous wrath when he's slamming the HMOs. It galls
him that people's access to medical care should be denied by some
HMO bean-counter.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting access and denying care should be the job of a
GOVERNMENT bean-counter.

HARD FACTS ABOUT REFERENCE SOFTWARE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ALYSON WARD 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that school has started, there's no doubt there is a
five-paragraph paper about Davy Crockett in your future. Or a
spelling bee. Or a presentation about how thermometers work.
</P>
<P>
   You need resources. You need them now. And you need them to be
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Because a set of print encyclopedias can cost as much as $1,250
these days, software is the way to go; you can get a good
encyclopedia on CD-ROM for as little as $20 or $30.
</P>
<P>
   But which one? We were overwhelmed by the options we found on
store shelves, so we asked for advice from library specialists in
the Irving, Texas, school district. These people know what they're
talking about _ Irving ISD won the 2000 National School Library
Media Program of the Year award, which the American Association of
School Librarians presents to schools with outstanding library
media programs.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kienzle is the district's director of library and media
services. Kienzle, along with library systems administrator Walter
Betts, named some educational software they deem worth the
investment:
</P>
<P>
   For older students:
</P>
<P>
   A CD-ROM encyclopedia is useful for students in the upper
elementary grades through high school.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1. World Book Millennium 2000 edition ($39.99-$85,99, depending
on whether you buy the Standard, Deluxe or Premiere edition)
</P>
<P>
   This encyclopedia offers clear explanations and well-organized
information. Articles are enhanced by videos, maps, pictures and
sounds, and a ``Surf the Millennium'' disk provides a simulated Web
site for each century of the past 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``World Book is the bedrock,'' Kienzle says. ``It's kind of the
generic encyclopedia; you can always find what you need.'' The
authority is good and the integrity is solid, she says _ you'll
never have to question World Book information.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   2. Encarta Reference Suite 2001 (Microsoft, $75-$100)
</P>
<P>
   The Encarta encyclopedia series is a pro at reference software.
Encarta was never a set of heavy books _ this company started out
in the electronic medium, but it has established itself as a major
player, comparable to the companies that have published book sets
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of multimedia attractions make the Encarta Reference Suite
a good choice, Kienzle says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encarta is very visual,'' she says. This is where you go, she
says, when you need a picture of Martin Luther King Jr., or you
need to know what the Eiffel Tower looks like.
</P>
<P>
   The Suite includes a multimedia atlas with fantastic graphics
and loads of easily accessible information, including facts about
indigenous animals and regional music.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   3. Britannica CD 2000 Deluxe (Broderbund/Mindscape, $79.99)
</P>
<P>
   This is software designed for older students: Britannica
software is solid and complete, but the material is more difficult
to digest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is by far probably the best reference, but it's not
designed for a fifth-grader'' Kienzle says. ``It's really at a very
academic level.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   For younger students:
</P>
<P>
   Reference guides aren't as useful for the very young, Betts
says; they need software that is more general.
</P>
<P>
   ``For younger children _ preschool to second grade _ software is
designed to teach them how to use a computer to get the information
they need,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Below, his software suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   4. MacMillan Dictionary for Children (MacMillan Publishing USA,
$19.99)
</P>
<P>
   This multimedia dictionary is a strong choice for younger
students, Betts says. It has 12,000 word entries accompanied by
pronunciations (it's a talking dictionary), pictures, sound effects
and word histories. The CD-ROM also features an interactive
character named Zack and educational games, including the
ever-popular hangman, that allow kids to quiz themselves. For very
young children, it's a good literacy tool, Betts says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   5. Reader Rabbit series (The Learning Company, $19.99)
</P>
<P>
   The Reader Rabbit software series is something young students _
pre-kindergarten through second grade _ might use at school, Betts
says. The programs help kids learn math and reading (as well as
basic academic and interpersonal skills) by playing with Reader
Rabbit and his friends. Games, silly songs, lovable characters and
interactive stories keep kids interested in the activity.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   6. Millie's Math House, Sammy's Science House, Bailey's Book
House (Edmark, each $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   This series is for kids in preschool through second grade, Betts
says. The programs use games and question-and-answer activities to
teach the basics. The math program teaches counting, size and
shape, basic addition and subtraction, for example, and the science
program teaches kids about weather and plants.

   BUSH (St. Louis, Ill.) _ Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday moved to
defend his sweeping tax cut proposal as both responsible and easily
affordable in light of federal surplus projections, tossing around
figures to show that his budget plan would not require any slashing
of government spending. ``I've got to do a better job of making it
clear,'' Bush told reporters in a surprising admission aboard his
campaign plane. The remark came just one day after Vice President
Al Gore, suddenly resurgent in the polls, detailed his own

based on defects found in 88,000 cars and trucks, adding to a
recall of 532,000 vehicles announced last month. The recalls
include 50,000 vehicles exported to the United States. By Miki

   RAUSCHENBERG-ART (Captiva, Fla.) - For his high school
graduation present, Robert Rauschenberg wanted a ready-made shirt,
his first. A decade or so later he made history with assemblages of
junk; sculptures and music boxes made of packing crates, rocks and
rope, and red paintings like ``Yoicks'' sewn from fabric strips.

   BRAZIL-TELENOVELLAS (Rio de Janeiro) _ When a television serial
about an 18th-century courtesan went off the air here two years
ago, few at the struggling network that had produced the drama,
called ``Xica da Silva,'' expected it to have much of an afterlife.
But then 150 episodes were dubbed into Spanish and sold to a dozen
other countries in Latin America, where the series quickly went on
to become a ratings phenomenon everywhere it was broadcast. Now the
United States, or at least the growing portion of it that watches
Spanish-language television, has succumbed to the same spell. By

apparently boundless fascination with the legendary Polish-Russian
dancer-choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, whose brief career
(1907-1917) ended at 29 with mental illness that gripped him the
rest of his 61 years. The most comprehensive Nijinsky exhibition
ever assembled began touring European museums in March,
Nijinsky-themed stage plays ran this winter and spring in Tokyo,
London and Scottsdale, Ariz., and in May, for the first time, the
Royal Ballet performed ``L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune,'' his 1912 debut
work, and a controversial re-creation of his 1913 ``Jeux.'' The

joins a fast-growing breed of fully loaded special editions that
stand stacked up like jumbo jets on fall and winter release
schedules. As demand increases, studios are taking more care to
rummage their archives and, as is the case with ``Superman,''
putting a level of effort into producing their major DVD's that in
some ways emulates the kind of attention directors themselves give

   TAVERNIER-FILM (Paris) _ Bertrand Tavernier's latest film did
not begin with the ``big idea'' of denouncing poverty and
unemployment hidden behind France's stolidly bourgeois facade.
Rather, its genesis was an anecdote heard one evening over dinner
with his 33-year-old daughter, Tiffany, and her husband, a poet who
had taught in public schools in run-down communities. ``Dominique
told the story of a woman who couldn't afford the monthly
contribution to her children's school because she needed the 30
francs'' _ $4.50 _ ``for food,'' Tavernier, 59, recalled. ``From
this conversation, then, was born ``Ca Commence Aujourd'hui,'' or

Ralph had an idea. ``Someone should be making a film about this
stuff,'' he said. Marc Singer still finds it hard to believe that
an idle remark inspired such an odyssey that led a 20-year-old who
had never picked up a camera to live underground himself, enlist
his fellow outcasts as his crew and put together ``Dark Days,'' a

galvanized composers in the avant-garde and in academic circles. No
one, including Boulez, could have thought it would reach outside to
mainstream audiences. So it must have been deeply satisfying for
Boulez when, at the conclusion of the third of four recent concerts
at the Salzburg Festival in honor of his 75th birthday, an audience

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: IN PANTHEON OF ACTORS, ONE ACTOR LESS FAMILIAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By MEL GUSSOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who was the greatest actor in the English-speaking world? The
question arises with the death this year of two of the primary
candidates for that title, John Gielgud and Alec Guinness. Along
with Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, they were the great
knights of the English theater.
</P>
<P>
   For many, Gielgud and Olivier were opposites, Gielgud with his
eloquent voice, an instrument for the ages (of man and of
Shakespeare), Olivier with his impassioned sense of the dramatic,
physical as well as emotional. The truth is somewhat reversible.
While Olivier customarily approached a role from the outside,
choosing a walk and a look _ specifically a false nose _ for his
character, Gielgud, the presumed intellectual, was more intuitive.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, it might be said that Richardson and Guinness had
similarities, especially in their gift for playing eccentric, often
comic characters. But in his transformations, Richardson retained a
glimmer of himself, so that one did not always know if he was
acting or being. Guinness abandoned all sense of self and was
totally immersed within a character and often unrecognizable from
one role to another.
</P>
<P>
   Within the quartet there was mutual admiration and, at least
between Olivier and Gielgud, an edge of rivalry. Guinness, as
self-effacing in print as he was in performance, wrote in his
autobiography, ``Blessings in Disguise,'' that he was well aware
that he was not in the same class as the ``greats.'' He added that
his ``pleasure is in putting little bits of things together, as if
playing with a jigsaw puzzle.'' Of the four, Guinness was the one
who had the most substantial and successful film career.
</P>
<P>
   All were marked by their daring and the surprise they could
bring to a performance, qualities that separate the talented from
the unforgettable, as was also true of Edith Evans and Peggy
Ashcroft. Among living actors, Michael Gambon, Anthony Hopkins and
Ian McKellen _ all of them knighted _ have demonstrated their
eligibility for that pantheon, as have Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and
Eileen Atkins. In the United States the contemporary candidates are
fewer, partly as a result of the limited access that American
actors have to classics.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Meyer, the translator and biographer who died recently,
was unequivocal in his choice, and it was none of the above. In his
memoir, ``Words Through a Windowpane,'' he said that the greatest
actor he had seen was Frederick Valk.
</P>
<P>
   Valk, he explained, was a German Jew who was firmly established
as an actor by the time Hitler came to power. In 1933 he moved to
Prague and became a leader of the German theater there. In 1939,
with only days to spare, he escaped from the Nazis and emigrated to
England. He had already played a diverse gallery of great classical
roles. With apparent ease he made the transition to the British
stage.
</P>
<P>
   In quick succession he triumphed in Shakespeare and Ibsen and
also proved to be a master of comedy. Valk had only a minor career
in movies, appearing in supporting roles and often playing prison
camp commandants. He died in 1956 at 61, just before he was
scheduled to make his Broadway debut in Peter Ustinov's ``Romanoff
and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest he came to the United States was to play Shylock for
Tyrone Guthrie at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario.
Guthrie considered him ``a genial, gentle giant,'' whose voice
matched his physique: ``a warm and velvety baritone with an upper
register of extraordinary brilliance and power.'' He said that
Valk's career was somewhat limited by his accent.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer made it clear that he was not alone in his critical
judgment and said that two of the most important British critics of
the 20th century, James Agate and Kenneth Tynan, shared his
enthusiasm. The excitement of watching Valk seemed to provoke
critics to soar into the linguistic stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   When Valk played Othello to Donald Wolfit's Iago, Agate wrote,
``If Valk is not a great Othello, and if the duel with Wolfit is
not magnificent throughout, then let me retire.'' After seeing the
same production, Tynan, then an undergraduate at Oxford, wrote, ``I
have lived through three hours on the red brink of a volcano, and
the crust of lava still crumbles at my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as a professional critic, Tynan continued to extol Valk
and to have the color red on his mind when describing him.
Reviewing ``The Master Builder,'' he said that ``his Solness has
made his star blaze red across all this continent, and other lights
are tapers.'' He switched metaphors in mid-theme: ``He seemed an
Alp, and when he fell from his crazy tower, the very fall of the
House of Usher seemed like crackling match wood. Valk rules our
stages.'' He was, he said, ``the best actor in England.''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography Guinness recalled Valk in Guinness'
adaptation of ``The Brothers Karamazov'' as ``a bull of a man,
simple and endearing.'' Meyer was most impressed by Valk's
``explosive power'' in Shakespeare. He added, ``No one, I think,
was quite prepared for the equal mastery which he then showed in
three Ibsen roles: Solness in `The Master Builder,' Pastor Manders
in `Ghosts' and John Gabriel Borkman. All three are deeply
inhibited men whose passion can find no satisfactory outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 Meyer was having lunch with Richardson, several years
after he had given exceptional performances in ``Borkman'' and
``The Wild Duck.'' Richardson suddenly asked Meyer to name the
greatest actor he had seen. Meyer hesitated, out of deference to
the other man at the table. After a pause, Richardson said,
``Valk?'' And both men agreed.

OFFICIALS RULE OUT SABOTAGE IN TWA FLIGHT 800 CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to discredit the conspiracy theorists who
say a bomb or missile brought down TWA Flight 800 four years ago,
government investigators said Tuesday that the crash that killed
230 people was nothing more or less than a terrible accident.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup of the Boeing 747 off the coast of Long Island, New
York, on the evening of July 17, 1996, was caused by an explosion
of fuel vapors in the center wing tank, most likely because of an
electrical short, National Transportation Safety Board officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion, reiterated Tuesday at the start of a two-day
session as the safety agency prepares its final report on the
tragedy, was anticlimactic and totally expected. Investigators have
been saying much the same thing for more than three years, since
the original theories of sabotage began to fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that our investigation confirmed that the
fuel-air vapor in the center wing tank was flammable at the time of
the accident,'' Bernard Loeb, director of aviation safety for the
safety board, said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that an explosion in that center tank _ a space roughly
the size of a two-car garage _ was ``more than capable of
generating the pressure'' needed to break up the enormous aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The board chairman, Jim Hall, said the crash ``graphically
demonstrated that, even in one of the safest transportation systems
in the world, things can go horribly wrong.'' He added, ``It should
stand as a reminder to us all of the need for diligence and
aggressive action in identifying and eliminating potential safety
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the crash, a number of measures to reduce the chance of
electrical shorts have been put into effect, the officials said,
and still more will be tried. Detailed findings of the Flight 800
investigation are available on the agency's Web site: www.ntsb.gov
</P>
<P>
   Hall said it was perfectly understandable that many people
initially thought a bomb or missile had knocked the jet from the
sky. That summer there was a bomb explosion at the Olympic Games in
Atlanta, and trials of those accused in the 1993 World Trade Center
bombing were under way.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation worked with the
safety board for more than a year before concluding in November
1997 that there was no evidence of a criminal act.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The remains of all 230 victims were recovered, as was more than
95 percent of the aircraft, Hall noted. Examination of the bodies
and of the aircraft parts showed no telltale signs of a bomb or
missile, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses reported seeing a ``streak of light'' in the sky
shortly before 9 p.m. the night of the crash, prompting some people
to wonder if a missile had been shot toward the 747. There was
speculation later that the streak might have been fuel burning as
the plane broke apart.
</P>
<P>
   Hall asserted that the most irresponsible conspiracy theorists
have ``their own agendas'' and that they ``do a disservice to us
all _ but most especially to you, the TWA 800 families, who have
suffered so much in this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   He tacitly acknowledged that theories of various kinds will
persist and that his agency has been urged to look for criminals.
``Our people are aviators, engineers and scientists, some of the
very best in the world,'' he said. ``They are not criminal
investigators.''

A JACQUES OF ALL TRADES 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sauvignon blanc, the most versatile of white wines, comes in
many guises. It can be an aperitif, light, sharp and refreshing; it
can be a dinner wine with good body and lovely texture. It can be a
magnificent, naturally sweet dessert wine, either on its own or, as
it is in Sauternes, artfully blended with grapes like semillon and
muscadelle.
</P>
<P>
   A self-effacing grape, it often hides under other names. All
Bordeaux white wines, both dry and sweet, use some sauvignon blanc;
the rare Pavillon Blanc of Chateau Margaux is 100 percent sauvignon
blanc, and the white of Chateau Haut-Brion is usually two-thirds
semillon and a third sauvignon blanc.
</P>
<P>
   In the Graves region of Bordeaux, sauvignon blanc is the
predominant white grape. Once it was routinely blended with
semillon, a grape that makes a softer, honeyed style of wine, a
style that was ignored by most of the world's wine markets. In
recent years, sauvignon blanc has become more dominant in the
Graves; the wines are fresher and more vibrant, and they have
restored Bordeaux's reputation for good white wines.
</P>
<P>
   In the Loire Valley, along with chenin blanc, melon de Bourgogne
(which is the grape of Muscadet) and gros plant, sauvignon blanc
produces some of the world's best-known white wines. Sancerre is
entirely sauvignon blanc, as are Pouilly-Fume and a host of wines
from smaller communities like Quincy.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Cloudy Bay in the early 1990s, sauvignon blanc
has become New Zealand's best-known wine. South Africa, too, has
begun to produce top sauvignon blancs, beginning with Mulderbosch
and Neil Ellis' Groenkloof Sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, sauvignon blanc has followed two paths. The
most successful American sauvignon blancs are, to me anyway,
fashioned in the Bordeaux style _ the older Bordeaux style, which
emphasizes softness and fullness and plays down the more acidic,
vegetal style of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fume.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known American sauvignon blanc goes under a different
name. Robert Mondavi makes it and it's called fume blanc. One of
Mondavi's signal achievements was the revival of sauvignon blanc in
California. In the mid-1960s, he took what had been a sugary, bland
wine with no varietal character, fermented it completely until it
was dry, aged it in oak and then gave it its new name. A name, by
the way, that he never registered, so that anyone could use it.
When he started working with the grape, there were about 700 acres
of it in California; now there are well over 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the Mondavi sauvignon blanc line is the Reserve Fume
Blanc made from grapes from his most famous vineyard, To-Kalon in
Oakville, Calif. All sauvignon blanc except for about 6 percent
semillon, the wine is barrel-fermented and aged for about a year in
French oak. The result is a complex wine with intense flavors and a
rich texture, full-bodied for a sauvignon blanc and with a long
finish.
</P>
<P>
   It is a beautiful wine, diametrically opposed to what I like in
a sauvignon blanc, which is lightness, no oak and plenty of vibrant
acidity. I recently tasted six Mondavi sauvignon blancs, including
three from California and three from Chile. Tasted blind, it turned
out that my favorite was from the Mondavi ``Coastal'' group because
it had at least some of the herbaceous characteristics of the wines
from the Loire, New Zealand and South Africa but from hardly anyone
in California.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a question of right and wrong, or of good and bad. Two
distinct styles of sauvignon blanc have emerged and each has its
passionate advocates. To me, the lighter, herbaceous style is
perfect with broiled fish and oysters, while the fuller California
style is best savored as a sipping wine on a warm summer afternoon.
But others prefer the more acidic style as an aperitif and the
heavier, oakier style with food.
</P>
<P>
   The oaked versions, like Mondavi's fume blanc, Caymus Vineyards'
Conundrum and Dry Creek Vineyards fume blanc, match well with
almost any dish that normally calls for chardonnay. The more acidic
versions, like the French and New Zealand wines, will enhance most
kinds of seafood and make perfect companions for a variety of
cheeses. Red wine and cheese is the traditional combination. But
many red wines are overwhelmed by sharp or pungent cheeses. Not so
sauvignon blanc, particularly when matched with goat cheese. Loire
goat cheeses like crottin de Chavignol seem to have been invented
to go with the local white wines.
</P>
<P>
   Sancerre and Pouilly-Fume are easy to find in the United States,
but domestic sauvignon blancs with the same mineral, herbaceous
elements are in short supply. Even so, there are sauvignon blancs
out there that display good varietal character. Philip Togni, in
the Napa Valley, makes a bone-dry version; others to look for
include J. Rochioli, in the Russian River area of Sonoma; Matanzas
Creek in Sonoma; Brander Vineyard in Los Olivos; St. Supery in the
Napa Valley; and Navarro Vineyards, in the Anderson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In California, there are as many interpretations of the
sauvignon blanc theme as there are wineries producing it. The trick
is to find one you like. If nothing suits your fancy, do join me in
the Loire Valley.

CALIFORNIA'S ITALIAN ACCENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The triumph of French grapes in California has been
so complete that cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and the rest seem
as integral to the state as San Francisco fog and Malibu mud. When
California winemakers want to turn to exotica, they experiment with
Italian grapes, like sangiovese or barbera.
</P>
<P>
   By historical standards, at least, the French grapes should have
been the interlopers. Italian immigrants started many of
California's early winemaking dynasties, and their names live on
today: Martini, Gallo, Mondavi, Foppiano and Pedroncelli, to
mention a few. Yet, when the industry came of age its focus was
almost wholly on French grapes, perhaps because Italian wines were
held in such low critical esteem.
</P>
<P>
   But appreciation for Italian wines has risen in the last 25
years, around the world and in California. Barbera, the most widely
planted grape in the Piedmont, has most often been used in
California as an anonymous blending grape. Now it is being grown
more seriously and bottled on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Sangiovese, the prime grape of Chianti, took up only 186 acres
in the whole state in 1990. By 1997, though, that figure had risen
to almost 2,500 acres, the highest rate of increase of any red
grape in that period, according to ``California Wine,'' by James
Laube (Wine Spectator Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Just because Californians have planted sangiovese grapes it
doesn't mean they are producing Chianti. Most of the vines are
young and will need years before they can produce top-quality
grapes. Just as it has taken Californians decades to figure out how
and where to grow pinot noir, it may take some time to learn how to
treat sangiovese.
</P>
<P>
   While California sangioveses can vary widely, from soft, fruity
mouthfuls to oaky blasts of tannin, I found many to be enjoyable,
though overpriced, and very good with food. Some of the best
versions are made in small quantities. Bruno d'Alfonso, the
winemaker for Sanford Winery in Santa Barbara County, makes the
excellent Di Bruno as a side project. It is sold in a few stores,
but is more likely to turn up in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Italians have been experimenting with nontraditional
blends of grapes to create the wines known as super-Tuscans, so
have the Californians. Brewer-Clifton, which makes fine pinot noirs
and chardonnays, makes a super-concentrated blend of sangiovese and
merlot under the Palmina label, while La Famiglia, Robert Mondavi's
label for Italian varietals, recently released its 1997 Colmera, 80
percent sangiovese blended with five other grapes. It, too, is
impressive, and will be even more so after it ages a few years. &QL;

FOR EXTREME TELECOMMUTERS, THE OFFICE CAN BE FOUND ON THE OPEN
ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Sid and Kristanne Heaton, ``manifest destiny'' first called
in spring 1997. Recently engaged, the couple discovered that they
had an entire unplanned summer before she was to begin a master's
program at the University of Washington. Hoping to see more of the
United States and Canada, the couple hopped into their Volkswagen
camper for three months of touring, all while he telecommuted full
time as a technical writer for a California software company.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six states, two provinces and a wedding later, the couple
took their lust for working-while-traveling to Europe, in March
1999, after she was accepted in an art history program in Rome.
Over the next 12 months, Heaton continued to telecommute for his
employer. But the Heatons also managed to live in five countries,
see seven others and post their travels online at
www.officeodyssey.com.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of the extreme telecommuter, a term that
Heaton says he coined to describe people like himself who hold down
full-time salaried positions, complete with benefits, and yet are
no ordinary 9-to-5, cubicle-inhabiting drones. The goal of an
extreme telecommuter, he says, is to happily blur the line between
working and having an adventure, whether it is touring Europe,
scaling a mountain or pedaling a recumbent bike across the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme telecommuters are not bleary-eyed corporate road
warriors nor are they garden-variety telecommuters who work from
home. Nevertheless, they maintain they are no less dedicated to
their jobs. Heaton, for example, said that he had managed to get
bonuses and raises as an extreme telecommuter.
</P>
<P>
   Such telecommuters are still rare. According to workplace
experts, few jobs _ let alone employers _ lend themselves to such
potentially chaotic mobility. Still, some experts suspect that the
ranks of extreme telecommuters may slowly swell the next few years,
especially if the labor market remains tight and mobile computing
and wireless technology continue to bolt along.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of thing that so many people go through life
saying _ if only I had followed my wanderlust,'' said Gil Gordon of
Monmouth Junction, N.J., a telecommuting consultant who counsels
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Fuchs is certainly following his impulse to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs, a former Time Warner executive, is now the chairman of
Autobytel.com, an online auto retailer based in Irvine, Calif. But
he is also the interim chief executive of MyTurn.com, an e-commerce
products and services company in Alameda, Calif. Fuchs has an
office in New York but often works elsewhere _ Brazil, New Guinea
or, every February, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travel is a real passion,'' he said. ``I was at Time for 20
years, and when I left, I told myself I would have a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments do not surprise Tom Miller, vice president for
Internet strategies at Cyber Dialogue, a technology research firm
in Manhattan. ``When we first studied telecommuting in 1984, it was
a pretty structured thing,'' Miller said. ``But telecommuting has
unfolded in much more of a guerrilla warfare fashion, driven more
by individual, rather than corporate, needs.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is one company that says it is becoming increasingly open
to variations on traditional telecommuting. ``The shift we're
seeing is one where work becomes much more integrated into the
fabric of your life, but in a way that's manageable,'' said Brad
Allenby, who oversees the company's so-called telework efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Allenby said that 25 percent of his company's managers worked
from outside the office one or more times a week, and 10 percent
worked from virtual offices, at home or elsewhere. ``I've got a
manager who reports directly to me _ she's in a virtual office in
Ohio _ but she has family in Las Vegas,'' he said. ``Do I care if
she's in a cafe in Paris? No, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Berg appreciates that kind of latitude and has adopted
what could be considered a subset of extreme telecommuting. She
lives in Bethesda, Md., but works as a computer programmer and data
processor for a public opinion polling company in Colorado. Every
six weeks, Berg hits the road for a week with her
four-and-a-half-pound notebook computer and cell phone to visit a
large network of college friends who live as far away as
California.
</P>
<P>
   Still, extreme telecommuting is not always one happy road trip.
Phil Montero, an independent consultant in North Andover, Mass.,
who trains mobile workers (his Web site is
www.youcanworkfromanywhere.com), estimates that only about a third
of employers give their mobile telecommuters any training to work
outside of the office, and that only half of those workers have
thorough training in the technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Gail Martin, executive director of the International
Telework Association and Council, says extreme telecommuting can
also raise potentially confounding liability issues. What happens,
she asks, if a telecommuter falls while mountain climbing or bike
riding? Also, who is responsible for the equipment and the security
of information?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drawbacks, extreme telecommuters are thrilled with
their choices.
</P>
<P>
   The Heatons, for example, estimate that in their two
telecommuting sojourns they managed to do more traveling than they
would have in 15 years of conventional vacations, even though it
also meant that Heaton had to endure hardships like sending early
morning e-mails from Polish truck stops and having teleconference
calls from a piazza in Rome. He is now telecommuting from Nevada
City, Calif., a tiny town in the Sierra Nevada foothills. But the
Heatons are thinking of spending the winter in Hawaii. ``We don't
want having a career to get in the way of having a life,'' he said
in an e-mail message.

CONFESSIONS OF A `SURVIVOR' FAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can you imagine? A recent supplicant on ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire'' had no idea that the Tagi and Pagong tribes on
``Survivor'' had merged and become the Rattana tribe. True, Rattana
sounds like something from the Martha Stewart Designer Fescue
Collection, but how could someone not know? Was she (A) a part-time
hermit, (B) a cloistered nun, (C) a pop-culture illiterate or (D) a
complete doofus?
</P>
<P>
   None of the above. Turns out she has a life and doesn't watch
``Survivor.'' Such a charming concept.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a life that cost her some serious cash on
``Millionaire.'' Cash that the rest of us nimrods could have put to
good use on, say, a big-screen, plasma-screen, you-screen,
I-screen, we-all-screen home entertainment system _ something to
lend proper gravitas to Wednesday night's mother of all tribal
councils: the season finale of ``Survivor,'' the Borneo chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Or we could have cornered the market on presto logs and built
one honkin' bonfire. As Jeff Probst, the king of khaki, the caliph
of the camp shirt, likes to say, fire represents life on the
island. I figure as long as there's a Duraflame going in my Weber,
I have a life.
</P>
<P>
   What? You were expecting rational thought?
</P>
<P>
   'Scuse me, but I've been listening to Richard Hatch's
pseudo-intellectual bushwa for 12 weeks. I came this close to
offering up novenas so Susan Hawk might be banished from this
planet (and the ones to our immediate left and right, just to be
safe). I considered hiring a few Cuban-Americans still hopped up
over the Elian Gonzalez thing to stage a little insurrection and
have Gretchen Cordy installed as queen of Pulau Tiga.
</P>
<P>
   So don't expect a logical argument, Bunky. My name is John, and
I'm a ``Survivor'' fan. The logic chromosome went tapioca about the
same time the Tagis decided they could do without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' has been the greatest escape since Steve McQueen's
motorcycle ride through the German countryside. And tonight's
finale, likely to be watched by more than 30 million Americans with
nothing better to do, is the millennium's first entry in the ``Who
Shot J.R.?'' collection of don't-miss episodes. It's got fire. It's
got suspense. It's got the big payoff.
</P>
<P>
   It's also got wacky characters. People we sorta like, people we
sorta don't, people we'd like Tony Soprano to whack.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, right. We're not in Borneo anymore, Toto. This whole thing
was filmed months ago, and the ultimate survivor has probably
already spent his/her million dollars at Sylvan Delearning Center,
trying to unremember Richard's naked avoirdupois.
</P>
<P>
   What makes me think Richard isn't the big winner, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. It just can't be. Sure, oil rises to the top, but
come on! Richard seems like the standard slab of USDA Slime who
becomes a consultant because he's a good blatherskite and not much
else. OK, he can catch slimy things on the ocean floor. Whaddya
expect? Slime knows slime.
</P>
<P>
   As for Susan, well, don't get me started. Just because she's a
self-proclaimed redneck doesn't give her permission to be a boor.
And don't give me this twaddle about her being feisty and
independent. She's Richard's lap dog. She gives rednecks a bad
name. And remember: They both lied to Mr. Probst, the fuehrer of
the flame, the bailiff of the ballots, when he asked if there was a
voting alliance in place.
</P>
<P>
   Do we want a toad or his toady taking a chunk of CBS's millions?
(A 30-second commercial on tonight's finale cost $600,000.) Do we
want to reward duplicitous behavior? (Sonja Christopher, the first
person voted off the island, says this is her biggest fear.)
</P>
<P>
   I say nay! Let's give it to Rudy Boesch, the ex-Navy guy. He's
not someone I'd want to spend 39 days with, or even 39 minutes. But
at least he's honest. And his laconic performance in last week's
immunity challenge _ ``I dunno, I dunno, I dunno'' _ was the
highlight of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if Rudy wins, CBS will be able to say it hasn't
abandoned its core audience of viewers older than 50 who are a tad
uncomfortable among homosexuals. What a coup that would be. While
celebrating the victory of a homophobic septuagenarian, the network
would have a whole new bloc of younger viewers absolutely atingle,
practicing for ``Survivor II'' by noshing on the flora and fauna in
their crisper drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the next ``Survivor,'' which will take place in
the Australia bush and debut after the Super Bowl on Jan. 28, may
not be as much fun as the first, or even as much fun as
Australian-rules football. You can bet your last Sacajawea that
everyone will be forming factions from the get-go, which should
make ``Survivor II'' seem pretty much like another day at the
office. At least tonight's final four has one semilikable person in
it: the waffly Kelly Wigglesworth. Come next winter, the final four
will look like everyone you never liked in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Nosirree, Bob. There may never be anything to match the
unbridled goofiness of this first ``Survivor.'' It was new. It was
different. And if you'll allow me to go all existential on you
here, it was the perfect exercise in determining what's right and
what's wrong in a universe with no rules. It was a soap opera with
people who don't look like soap stars. They didn't even have soap.
And don't think for a minute that producer Mark Burnett, the new
golden boy of television, hasn't been manipulating us like a bunch
of soap fans by carefully choosing which footage to use on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, ``Survivor'' is like good junk food, the stuff you
know you shouldn't eat but still consume on special occasions: the
milkshakes at Dick's, the french fries at McDonald's, the hot dogs
at Costco. They won't kill you if you only eat them now and then.
Like, say, once a week.
</P>
<P>
   That's where ABC went wrong with ``Millioniare,'' and CBS with
``Big Brother.'' They're on way too often. That sort of diet will
inevitably take you down. Indeed, Wednesday's two-hour finale of
``Survivor'' plus an hourlong ``town meeting'' with Bryant Gumbel
and the complete cast at 10, could cause some serious bloating.
</P>
<P>
   But we ``Survivor'' survivors can handle it. Just toss a few
more larvae on the barbie, would you?

CROSS A JUICY PLUM WITH A SWEET APRICOT AND YOU GET A JUICY, SWEET
PLUOT

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first ones to arrive in stores were labeled Dinosaur or
Dinosaur Egg. Pluot sounds just as strange, but none of those names
captures the luscious sweetness and complexity of the new hybrid
plum that seems bound to take over the market.
</P>
<P>
   Pluot, the trademark for a cross between plums and apricots, has
the rich, juicy flesh of a plum but more sweetness thanks to the
apricot's naturally higher sugar content. There's none of the
pucker that can sabotage the most delicious of plums. Instead,
there's an astonishing interplay of flavors and aroma _ vanilla,
honey, melon _ almost like a glass of dessert wine.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs love them for the glorious color, texture and flavor they
bring to tarts and other desserts. Growers love them too _ they
think of them as a better plum, sweeter and sturdier. Plums, with
their thick skins, have always stood up well on the road, and
Pluots are no different, but they ripen beautifully and more
consistently than most plums. In the next few years, the industry
predicts that they could account for a fourth to half the plum
supply.
</P>
<P>
   The original cross, 50-50 plum and apricot, was called a plumcot
and can be traced to the famous botanist Luther Burbank more than
100 years ago. Pluots evolved out of that early hybrid but most are
about three-fifths plum to two-fifths apricot.
</P>
<P>
   The Pluot was developed and named by Zaiger's Genetics, a plant
breeder near Modesto, Calif. Leith Zaiger, the company's general
manager, said that Zaiger's had been developing Pluots for 35 years
but that only in the last year or two had there been enough
successful commercial planting to supply the domestic and export
markets on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   The Pluot has taken off because ``California growers are always
interested in growing better fruit,'' said Bob Maxwell, the
director of special projects for Kingsburg Apple Sales in
Kingsburg, Calif., which packs and distributes its own Pluots and
those grown by others.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit started turning up in produce stands in July and
should be available until the end of September. Dinosaur and
Dinosaur Egg are trademark brand names established several years
ago for Pluots grown by one California grower, Jackson Family Farm.
They bear a tiny sticker showing a brontosaurus but even without
the label the fruit is easily recognizable. It is a hefty fistful
with pinkish-red skin dappled in gray and deep reddish flesh
sometimes fading to ivory. As appealing as the color is, the flavor
is better: deliciously sweet and meaty with the merest hint of
tartness.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are other Pluots available, just as large but in
other colors, Dinosaurs appear to be chefs' favorites in New York.
Tadashi Ono, at Sono in Midtown, uses them to make a compote to
serve with foie gras because, he says, they have a denser, more
peachlike texture than plums because of the apricot genes.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Oland, the pastry chef at Balthazar Bakery in SoHo, uses
Dinosaur Eggs, often with green Kelsey plums, on a galette with
puff pastry and frangipani.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, traditional plums dominate the market. Dale
Janzen, a field agent with the California Fruit Commission,
estimated a total of 3 million boxes of Pluots, or 87 million
pounds, will be sold this year, compared with 17 million boxes (476
million pounds) of plums.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 varieties of plums are grown in California. Most are
in season for just a couple of weeks. But the consumer is rarely
aware: most shops tend not to label them except by color, although
you may spot names like Simka, Fortune, Friar or Catalina.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Hearts are easier to spot. They are fat like Dinosaur
Eggs but are actually plums. They're slightly pointy with brownish
skins, bright scarlet flesh and a richly concentrated, jammy
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, some locally grown plums are making their debut in
the Greenmarkets and also in some stores. Shiros are most visible.
They are bright golden plums about the size of golf balls. Highly
perishable and extremely juicy, they have a taste something like
sweet lemonade. Maury Rubin, the owner of City Bakery near Union
Square, prefers Shiros for his almond tartlets. ``I'm hooked on
local plums,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Plums were first cultivated in China about 2,000 years ago. They
are classified as drupe fruits, with a single large stone, like
peaches, nectarines and cherries. There are several families of
plums, some of which have been crossbred for hundreds of years, so
sorting them out is a challenge. To put it simply, most big plums
were developed from Japanese plums brought to America in the 1880s
by Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   European plums include prune plums, like the Italian freestone
or the French pruneau d'Agen, which are often used in cooking or
baking and, as their name indicates, for drying as prunes. In
addition, there are small plums like damsons and mirabelles, which
are extremely tart and best cooked with ample sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The skin is no clue to the taste or flesh. Some red plums, like
the Simca, are tart and salmon-colored inside, while others, like
the big Fortunes are winey tasting and golden inside. Black plums
seem to be even more varied, with flesh that can be reddish to
ivory pink and a taste that varies from delicately sugared in the
Catalina to tart-sweet in the lush Black Diamond and almost bland
in the Friar, a popular late-season plum.
</P>
<P>
   The heart-shaped and green-skinned Kelsey is distinctive enough
that it is usually labeled with its proper name. A prized European
green plum, the Greengage, is known in France as the Reine Claude,
a venerable variety.
</P>
<P>
   Because plums and Pluots have jewel-like color and often
excellent flavor, there is every reason to use then in the kitchen
and not just in the fruit bowl. The pits are sometimes tenacious
but are usually small and can be extracted with little waste. Even
though plum and Pluot skins are relatively thick, they don't have
to be peeled for most recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Pluots can be used in recipes calling for most plums except the
small Italian prune plums or other cooking plums. But to replace
Pluots with plums, always choose larger, meatier, sweeter varieties
like Black Diamonds, Elephant Hearts, large Kelseys and Fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Plums _ and now Pluots _ are a wonderfully reliable fruit
because they are not as prone to bruising like peaches and
nectarines. Stored in a brown paper bag at room temperature, they
ripen well.
</P>
<P>
   Like tomatoes, plums and Pluots are ready to eat when they yield
to light pressure without feeling soft. Then they can be
refrigerated for several days. Plums and especially Pluots rarely
suffer from the dry mealiness that can affect poorly stored
peaches, nectarines and apricots.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder California growers have started selling prunes with a
more appetizing name, dried plums.

&HT;     COURT GIVES BASEBALL STAR A BREAK ON PREMARITAL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Barry Bonds' wife-to-be didn't need a lawyer to
understand what she was doing when she signed a premarital
agreement in 1988 giving up her right to half his baseball salary,
the California Supreme Court says.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's unanimous ruling was a strong statement in favor of the
binding nature of prenuptial agreements, which have become
increasingly common as divorce rates rise and prospective spouses
look for a way to protect the property they bring into a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A state Court of Appeal had cast doubt on thousands of such
agreements in California by ruling in the Bonds case that judges
must take a close look at the possibility of coercion in any
premarital agreement in which only one party was represented by an
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's high court said the absence of a lawyer was
``only one of several factors'' to consider in deciding whether the
agreement was voluntary, along with such things as the parties'
understanding of their rights, disclosure of assets and the
pressure placed on each by time and circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of state law, said Chief Justice Ronald George, is ``to
enhance the enforceability of premarital agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he said, before Barry and Sun Bonds married in
1988, she was told by his lawyers that she had the right to her own
attorney. She replied that she didn't need one and showed she knew
that she was waiving her right to community property during the
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   There was substantial evidence to support a San Mateo County
judge's findings that the agreement was voluntary, George said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ``treats people like adults as opposed to little
children,'' said Robert Nachshin, a lawyer for the San Francisco
Giants' star outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   But Sun Bonds' lawyer, Paige Wickland, said the court had
brushed aside the pressures that could be brought to bear on an
unsophisticated spouse-to-be with little awareness of her rights _
for example, giving Sun Bonds a draft of the agreement only a day
before the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ruling, ``we will have more agreements enforced,''
Wickland said. ``Many will be unfair, but this opinion will allow
that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A law professor who has written some of California's family law
statutes was troubled by what the court did not say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was plenty of room for them to interpret the term
`voluntary' to make sure you were not improperly cajoled, persuaded
or ensnared,'' said Professor Carol Bruch of the University of
California at Davis. ``They missed that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, the court should have declared that
prospective spouses have a legal obligation to treat each other
fairly, a duty that already applies to husbands and wives. Also,
she said, the lawyer for one prospective spouse should be required
to tell the other party, in writing, that their interests may
conflict and that both sides should have their own attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The case illustrates California's ``dreadful law on premarital
agreements,'' which offers fewer protections than unmarried
cohabitants get under case law, Bruch said.
</P>
<P>
   The court also bolstered the validity of premarital agreements
in a second case Monday, ruling 6-1 that couples could agree before
marriage to forgo the right to claim alimony if they divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have traditionally struck down such agreements on the
grounds that they encourage divorce, reasoning adopted by
California's high court as recently as 1973. But a majority, led by
Justice Marvin Baxter, called those rulings out of step with modern
views of marriage, the changing roles of women and the reality that
divorce was frequent.
</P>
<P>
   The cases were the court's first look in many years at
prenuptial agreements. The Bonds case represents the typical
agreement, in which the spouses-to-be forgo the right to community
property _ the equal division of all earnings during the marriage _
and promise to claim only their own separate property at divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds was a young outfielder with the Pittsburgh Pirates
in 1987, making $106,000 a year, when he met his future wife, a
Swedish immigrant who was studying to be a beautician. Both were
23.
</P>
<P>
   The prenuptial agreement was signed the day before their wedding
in February 1988. Barry had two attorneys and a financial adviser;
Sun, whose English was limited, was attended by a Swedish friend.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bond's attorneys said later that they had told Sun Bonds
that they represented their client's interests, that she had the
right to her own lawyer and that the agreement would eliminate her
right to share in his earnings during marriage. Sun Bonds testified
that she had understood none of those things and that she had
signed because Barry Bond's financial adviser told her the wedding
would be canceled if she refused.
</P>
<P>
   When the couple divorced in 1994, Barry Bonds was making $8
million a year with the Giants. Sun Bonds was awarded $10,000 a
month in support for each of their two children and $10,000 a month
in alimony through the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But she also sought to invalidate the prenuptial agreement and
claim a share of his salary.
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Judith Kozloski upheld the
agreement after a non-jury trial.

IN THE FORMER EAST GERMANY, A MURDER TRIAL TAKES ON POLITICAL
IMPORTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLE, Germany _ The German widow of an African man killed by
neo-Nazis broke down Tuesday after silently facing the three young
men accused of his murder on the opening day of their trial.
</P>
<P>
   The widow, Angelika Adriano, 43, was ushered from the courtroom
in visible distress after sitting opposite the generally impassive
men for about an hour and hearing a prosecutor charge that they
``assumed that Alberto Adriano could die from their attack, but
their hatred of foreigners made them indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Adriano, a 39-year-old Mozambican, in the eastern
town of Dessau has become a powerful symbol of the virulence of
rightist, anti-immigrant sentiment, particularly among youths in
the former East Germany where unemployment is at twice the level of
the west of the country.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the trial has assumed a particular political
importance. Germany's chief prosecutor, Kay Nehm, who usually
handles cases of terrorism, has taken a leading role, and Manfred
Puchel, the interior minister of the state of Saxony Anhalt,
Tuesday took the unusual step of issuing a statement calling for
severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without wishing to put the independence of the judiciary into
question, the culprits must feel the full force of the law,''
Puchel said, describing the killing as a ``sad and repugnant
example of what xenophobic views can lead to.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Richter and Frank Miethbauer, both 16, and Enrico
Hilprecht, 24, have been charged with the murder of Adriano, a
meatpacker who had been in Germany for 12 years. They have admitted
attacking Adriano on June 11 and leaving his body in the city park.
He died three days later.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its Nazi past, and the importance it has attached to
a post-war commitment to providing asylum for anyone threatened
because of their race or beliefs, Germany is particularly sensitive
to anti-immigrant violence.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has come under growing
pressure to stop racist provocation and murder. The issue has
abruptly cast a cloud over an administration that had appeared
serene with the opposition Christian Democrats in disarray and
economic reforms giving business a boost.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder embarked this week on a 10-day tour of the east,
urging ``civic courage against rightist extremism.'' But his visit,
after almost two years in office, is widely viewed as belated, and
the weekly Der Spiegel mockingly portrayed the chancellor on its
cover setting out in a safari hat for the unknown desert around
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after unification, the formerly communist part of
Germany still bears deep scars that even more than $400 billion in
federal investments has been unable to heal. Schroeder, having
promised to be the chancellor who made German unity a reality,
appears to have realized that his vow looks empty for now.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp swing away from the Christian Democrats that partly
benefited Schroeder's Social Democrats helped the chancellor get
elected in 1998. With one fifth of the German population, the area
has the power to damage his prospects at the next federal election
in 2002 if nothing changes.
</P>
<P>
   The tour has something of the air of a publicity stunt, but
Schroeder has proved shrewd in gauging the mood of Germans and his
demonstration of concern may bear fruit. He also knows that more
racist violence could cause serious international demage to
Germany's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Schroeder sees himself as the head of a corporation called
Germany that is competing internationally for the best minds,''
commented the Tageszeitung. ``The problem is that certain of those
best minds can only enter the eastern door of the corporation at
high personal risk.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That risk was on display in court Tuesday in the form of three
young men in t-shirts from the region around Dessau where the
collapse of the East German chemical industry has caused
unemployment of over 20 percent. They showed no sign of remorse for
the killing, although Richter appeared ill at ease and occasionally
smiled awkwardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three showed absolutely no contrition,'' said Ronald
Reimann, a lawyer representing Mrs. Adriano. ``That was so shocking
to me and my client that she had to leave the courtroom early.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Adriano, dressed in black, declined to make any comment as
she walked out shortly after the judge ruled that the press and
public, who were initially admitted, should be barred from the
court because two minors are involved.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under Germany's juvenile law, Richter and Miethbauer face a
maximum of 10 years imprisonment. Hilprecht could be imprisoned for
life. The death sentence does not exist in Germany.

INTEREST RATES TO REMAIN STEADY, FEDERAL RESERVE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reassured by evidence that wage and price increases
remain under control despite robust economic growth, the Federal
Reserve voted Tuesday to leave interest rates unchanged, but warned
that it could resume tightening monetary policy later in the year
if inflation creeps up.
</P>
<P>
   The decision seemed intended to give the Fed more time to assess
whether its campaign of rate increases over the last year is
slowing the economy to a rate that will keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate
demand is moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of
the economy's potential to produce,'' the Federal Open Market
Committee said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the policy-making committee said, ``the risks
continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate
heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision meant that the Fed was likely to remain on the
sidelines for the duration of the presidential campaign. The
committee will meet again on Oct. 3, but the Fed has historically
tried to avoid taking any action on interest rates in the weeks
leading up to Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the meeting had been widely expected by analysts
and investors.
</P>
<P>
   The decision left the Fed's benchmark federal funds target rate
on overnight loans between banks at 6.5 percent, where it has been
since May, when the central bank raised the rate by half a
percentage point. The Fed held rates steady at its subsequent
meeting in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also left unchanged, at 6 percent, its discount rate on
loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has pushed the federal funds rate up by 1.75
percentage points since June 1999 in an effort to tamp down
inflation pressures without snuffing out what earlier this year
became the longest business expansion on record.
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew at a 5.2 percent annual rate in the second
quarter after expanding at a 4.8 percent rate in the first three
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures were well above what most economists believe can
be sustained over the long run without igniting a destabilizing
upward spiral in wages and prices. Yet inflation has edged up only
slightly from very low levels, in large part because the strong
economic growth has been accompanied by a surge in business
efficiency, or productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Even as companies are forced to pay more to attract workers in a
labor market where unemployment is at just 4 percent, or to pay
more for raw materials or equipment, they are managing to cut costs
in other areas or improve efficiency by investing in new
technology.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Within the Fed, there is a long-running debate about whether
productivity improvements can continue to outrun inflation
pressures. In keeping rates unchanged Tuesday, the Fed seemed to be
deferring the issue rather than settling it.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the open market committee noted that economic
indicators are showing ``that more rapid advances in productivity''
have been forcing economists to revise upward their estimates of
how fast the economy can grow without igniting inflation. At the
same time, the committee said, productivity improvements have been
``containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   But the committee suggested that productivity improvements were
not a panacea, and that the combination of very low unemployment
and strong growth still had to be viewed as an inflationary
tinderbox, especially to the degree that strong demand for goods
and services outstripped the economy's ability to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, the statement said, ``remains concerned about the
risk of a continuing gap between the growth of demand and potential
supply at a time when the utilization of the pool of available
workers remains at an unusually high level.''

   El Sitio, another Internet service provider with millions of
Spanish and Portugese-speaking users in Latin America, also raised
money by selling shares on the Nasdaq. But El Sitio is not traded
on any stock exchange in the region where it does most of its
business.
</P>
<P>
   And when Yupi Internet Inc. raised start-up money, it too
bypassed local financial markets in the Latin American countries it
serves, seeking investors in the United States instead. Yupi's
plans for further expansion through a stock offering were postponed
in April when the Nasdaq nosedived, but the company intends to sell
shares to the public only in the United States, not Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet revolution has definitely come to Latin America.
But whether the businesses and jobs spawned by that revolution have
helped the region begin to wean itself from economic dependence on
the United States and other outsiders is considered a matter of
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This keeps us more dependent on outsiders all the time, but
the fault is ours,'' said Paul Singer, a professor of macroenomics
at the University of Sao Paolo. ``It is a deficiency which should
be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Starmedia and El Sitio contend they are not only
truly Latin American but also helping create a pan-Latin market
because Latin America's 500 million people are their main audience.
These companies also say they would not even exist if they had
sought to raise start-up money in the countries where their
customers live and work.
</P>
<P>
   But critics contend that these companies have unwittingly helped
create a kind of cyber colonialism in which the major architects of
the region's Internet access are foreigners, backed by foreign
funds, with offices in foreign lands, just like in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread agreement that the remote-control companies
and off-shore financing that made them possible underscores the
persistent weakness of Latin America's financial world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we do have a dependency on the more sophisticated foreign
equity markets,'' said Jorge Errazuriz a partner in Celfin, one of
Chile's largest investment banks, and a member of the board of the
Santiago Stock Exchange. This ``inferior position,'' he said, means
that ``the real initial impulse for developing fiber optics,
telecommunications and the Internet will have to come from the
equity markets up north.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just startup companies that are diverting strength
from the domestic stock exchanges and extending dependency. When an
aggressive international corporation like Telefonica of Spain
purchases phone systems in Argentina, Brazil and Peru, it deprives
local exchanges of some of their biggest companies. After such
acquisitions, the local companies are removed from the domestic
stock exchanges, while Telefonica stock is listed only in Spain and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin American exchanges have been hit hard. Over the last
decade, for example, the number of listed domestic companies on
Brazil's main exchange dropped by about 18 percent, from 581 to
478. In Argentina the decline was even steeper, nearly 30 percent,
with local companies on the exchange dipping to 129 from 179.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very troubling to see these markets, which are already
weak, get weakened further,'' said Roger S. Leeds, director of the
Center for International Business and Public Policy at the Paul H.
Nitzke Center for International Studies at Johns Hopkins
University. ``And I don't think that's at all healthy for the
development of the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   From Mexico to Argentina, political leaders in the new Latin
America have promised to improve the standards of living in their
countries by unleashing private enterprise and completely engaging
in the global economy. But while the biggest Latin companies
already have access on either the local or international markets to
the money they need to expand, for small and startup companies _
which generate most new jobs _ the search for funds is often an
impossible dream.
</P>
<P>
   Even when local money is available, taking a company public on a
Latin America exchange can be more trouble than it's worth,
considering that most local exchanges lack the pool of capital and
investors willing to take the kind of risks a big regional Internet
company needs to start up. Besides, some require years of operating
experience before a company's stock can be publicly traded, and in
some instances they must show real profits, which few Internet
startups are able to do.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's economic development has always depended heavily
on outsiders. Big corporations _ many of them American _ set up
branch plants in Central and South America that provided jobs and
some growth. But they did little to develop a financial and
economic self sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The newest Latin American companies operate, in effect, the same
way, critics such as Leeds contend. ``There are benefits to the
local economy in terms of jobs and investment,'' he said. ``But the
benefits to the local financial sector are zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming to the United States to raise money is not unique to
Latin America, not even for Internet companies. Jesse E. Reyes,
vice president of global product management for Venture Economics,
a private equity research firm, said that Israeli and French
Internet and software companies have raised generous amounts of
capital on Wall Street lately.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, he said, is that they enter the U.S. market not
just to raise money but to sell their products and services here.
Their growth then translates into profit that is repatriated and
re-invested in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin companies that raise money here, by contrast, are not
doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it from the Latin American businessman's point
of view, if they can take American money and get in on the ground
floor of a terrific opportunity, then so what does it matter?''
Reyes said. ``But the sociologists might say, `Isn't this just
another example of American colonialism?'''

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The companies that have successfully crossed borders to raise
funds certainly do not see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our inability to raise capital in Latin America says is
that you cannot shift 500 years of monopoly control and monopoly
orientation all at one time,'' said Fernando Espuelas, chairman of
Starmedia. ``Until very recently, if you wanted to finance a
company in Latin America you got a bank loan, at 30 percent
interest, and for a very short term. Obviously, you'd never be able
to finance an Internet company that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Uruguay and raised in Connecticut, Espuelas realized
early on that Latin American investors, especially wary of risk,
would not support his dream of creating a regional Internet
company.
</P>
<P>
   Basing his company in New York reinforced its identity as truly
regional, Espuelas said, and giving it an English name helped win
over American investors. He knocked on the doors of nearly 50
American venture capitalists. Even hearing a sophisticated New York
financier refer to Latin America as ``that blob there below the Rio
Grande'' did not dissuade him.
</P>
<P>
   With flawless English and a cool confidence, he won over big
backers, including Chase Capital Partners, and raised nearly $100
million in private capital.
</P>
<P>
   Then in May 1999, Starmedia issued its initial public offering
on the Nasdaq, raising $110 million. A subsequent offering in
October raised another $200 million. Starmedia stock, which first
sold for $15, escalated to more than $60 at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   The American investors who bought in early and sold at the peak
enjoyed the kinds of gains that would have gone to Latin investors
had it been possible for Starmedia to go public in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Espuelas said he was aware of the drawbacks but felt the region
could eventually overcome the cycle of dependency.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm already re-investing money into companies in Latin
America,'' he said, though he declined to name his investments.
``Our success is demonstrative of what can happen but also of the
challenges and the road that remains to be travelled.''
</P>
<P>
   While small local companies will continue to struggle,
StarMedia's early success set loose a herd of regional Latin
companies that beat a similar path to the doors of American venture
capitalists
</P>
<P>
   El Sitio, based in Buenos Aires, raised $130 million in its
public offering in December. Impsat Fiber Networks, an Argentine
telecommunciations firm in Wilton Manors, Fla., went public on the
Nasdaq with a $195 million offering in February.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Jofre, chief financial officer of Impsat, said the
lack of adequate financing is one of the most severe limitations
Latin America faces. ``Right now there's simply no significant
amount of local financing available in Latin America,'' Jofre said.
``And this presents a big handicap when compared to most other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But the global marketplace for capital has its drawbacks too.
Yupi Internet Inc., a Latin American Internet service company in
Miami, planned to go public in the United States last spring. Then
the Nasdaq crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filed our initial public offering in January and we were
completing our road show on April 14, the day of the debacle,''
said Oscar Coen, president of Yupi. That day the Nasdaq lost 355
points, its worst ever session to end its worst ever week. Yupi may
have been in some trouble anyway because it was comparatively late
to a market already served by Starmedia, El Sitio and others. But
when the Nasdaq went into a tailspin, the company's executives and
backers changed plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that it was in the best interest of the company to
postpone the IPO until there was a more favorable environment,''
Coen said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other companies, both American and foreign, Yupi's IPO
remains postponed. The delay has meant that Yupi has not expanded
as rapidly as originally planned, Coen said. Yupi won't open shop
in Paraguay or Uruguay, while Chile, he said, ``is borderline.''
Yupi has also pared back its advertising budget.
</P>
<P>
   AOL.Latin America, a spinoff of the original AOL, is also
finding it tough to raise money in the United States. The Latin
venture between AOL and the Cisneros Group of Venezuela originally
filed its initial public offering in January but has been waiting
for the right moment to move ahead. With both Internet companies
and Latin stocks out of fashion right now, few investors have shown
an interest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a long line of Latin American startups is waiting to make
the trip to the United States. ``That is clearly the final
objective for most of us,'' said Marcos E. Galperin, president of
Mercado Libre, an Internet auction site in Latin America. He
launched his company less than a year ago, with American backing.
One of his earliest investors was an American financier who
addressed Galperin's M.B.A. class at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``From day minus one on this project I knew we wanted to get
funding in the U.S.,'' Galperin said. ``For us, it's a big stamp of
approval.''

 AUTHOR TOM CLANCY ON CELEBRITY, PLOTLINES AND RUNNING FOR (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JEFF GUINN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixteen years after Ronald Reagan's offhand endorsement to
reporters brought attention to his first novel, ``The Hunt for Red
October,'' Tom Clancy remains one of America's most popular
writers.
</P>
<P>
   His 19th book, ``The Bear and the Dragon,'' debuts this week at
the top of every national bestseller list. The latest adventures of
Clancy alter ego Jack Ryan are both lengthy (1,028 pages) and
convoluted (too many subplots to count), in keeping with Clancy's
traditional writing style.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram by phone, Clancy, 53,
had lots to say between bites of breakfast, offering rare
reflections on his career and his strengths and weaknesses as a
writer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As ``The Bear and the Dragon'' proves again, you're a master
of complex themes and subplots that somehow all come together in
the end. How do you manage it?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't remember. It's true. I write books and forget about
how I wrote them. I never use outlines. I just start writing. At
some point in each book, I panic. How is all this ever going to
work? It's like having a baby. It's painful, but somehow in the end
it all works out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You spend endless pages in every book explaining things, how
a missile works or a virus spreads. Doesn't each book require
months of research?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I have a big library, and friends in different fields
who can tell me about things. There is no pattern to what I do,
except that for each book I get money and have an agreed-on
delivery date with my publisher. When I do write, I write fast.
``The Bear and the Dragon'' took about six months.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You make it sound painless.
</P>
<P>
   A: It isn't. It's the hardest work I know. People think every
time out the muse kisses me on the ear. I've never met the muse.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some portion of each book seems to be a lecture, about
economics or national defense or what your characters, at least,
see as the interfering, ill-informed media. Is it your goal as an
author to educate readers as well as entertain them?
</P>
<P>
   A: I try to take readers into worlds most readers don't know,
and let them see what those worlds are like in a realistic way. I
believe what I'm telling them is right. About government, the
economy, the media and the way they present the news.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You, as an individual, make the news almost as much as your
books. You recently changed agents and there was a big story in The
New York Times about it. Would you rather not be a celebrity
yourself, and have any press attention confined to what you write?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, as a matter of fact. I don't see why anything I do is
newsworthy. I mean, People magazine ... the trouble with People
magazine is, it's the National Enquirer on good paper. It's what
you read in a doctor's office while you're waiting to have blood
drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think whatever you have to say is reflected in your
books? Are you Jack Ryan?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jack Ryan is me. No doubt. When President Ryan says
something, that's what I'd say.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As president yourself? Are you thinking of running for
office?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Choking, possibly spewing coffee): Dear God, I hope not! I'm
not the least bit politically correct. I have a tendency to trip
over my own tongue. And I've got a big enough ego already. I don't
want it getting any bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Well, critics bash you frequently, for writing too long and
offering too many personal, conservative opinions in your novels.
Does that help keep your ego under control?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read the reviews. I'm so successful that people often envy
me and try to gain status by attacking me. That's human nature. As
a practical matter, when a reviewer reads a book, he or she likes
it or doesn't like it. Then the reviewer selectively picks out
passages to back up that opinion. True objectivity is hard to
accomplish for anyone, including me. But I'm not going to let
reviews affect me. I know what I'm trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In your own opinion, how well do you do it?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have a good narrative sense. My characters are improving. I
don't have much trouble with editors at my publisher, because I
turn in pretty clean work. My weakness is that I work so fast, I
don't use language as elegantly as I'd like. I could write better.
But my style isn't to take a lot of time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In your opinion, which are the best books you've written and
which are the weakest?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Without Remorse'' is my favorite. It's not my best book,
though. I think ``Executive Orders'' is my best. Now, I frequently
look at the books I've written and see how they could have been
better. ``The Cardinal of the Kremlin'' was my first long-term No.
1 bestseller, but it's really my least favorite. I compacted the
plot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What book do you have coming next?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know yet. I haven't made a deal for my next book, but
it will be some kind of departure from the usual style. I don't
have any additional ambition _ I enjoy the life I have now. I do
work for which I'm very well compensated. I know I'm a successful
writer. Whether I'm one of the most popular writers in America, I
don't know. I don't think in those terms. What I do think about is
that real people pay real money to buy my books, and I want to give
them their money's worth. Could I get tired of writing and the
media attention and just stop doing what I do? Possibly _ but not
for a while yet.

HOW MANY NEW YORKERS CAN DESIGNERS FIT ON THE HEAD OF A PIN? 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's that special something that makes dining in New
York City unlike dining in any other place.
</P>
<P>
   Some call it energy. Some call it buzz.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers call it crowding.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just their imagination. With real estate at a premium
and an economy that's enabling more people to eat out more often,
many restaurants have begun to feel like subway cars at rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   A liberal building code hasn't helped. Nor have an army of
designers and restaurant managers who have finessed the art of
squeezing more people into their seating plans. Now, strange as it
seems, New York City restaurant crowding has become a brand of its
own, sought after by restaurateurs in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the public spaces in a restaurant must allow 12 square
feet per person, including diners and staff. Maximum occupancy is
calculated depending on the square footage, the number of fire
exits, their location and their width.
</P>
<P>
   This seems fairly generous until you compare it with cities like
San Francisco and Atlanta, where the limit is 15 square feet per
person, or even Philadelphia, where it's 13 square feet per person.
Bar areas are much tighter. In Philadelphia, a bar must allow 9
square feet per person; in Atlanta, it's 7. In New York, the space
is measured by counter length: 18 inches of it per person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of restaurants out of state,'' said Warren
Ashworth, a partner in Bogdanow Partners Architects, a Manhattan
design firm, ``and I never see a place that's packed the way some
places are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramped restaurants have long been a signature of New York
dining. The ``21'' Club, which opened in 1929, has always had its
back wall of banquettes. Lining walls with banquettes increases the
number of tables that can fit in a room. What's remarkable about
the tables at ``21'', though, is how closely they are arranged. In
order for diners against the wall to get up from the table, a
waiter must come by and pull the table out into the room. Now it
seems every bistro in town has the same plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers are much more sophisticated, much more tolerant,
and docile actually,'' said Jeffrey Beers, a Manhattan architect
who designed China Grill and Calle Ocho. ``They don't mind being
bumped around a little bit; in fact, they enjoy it.'' That jab to
the back of the head when you're taking a bite of your crab cakes
might even be a sign of warmth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason you're not eating at home, where you have all
the privacy you need,'' said David Rockwell, a partner in the
Rockwell Group, whose designs include Nobu, the Monkey Bar and
Vong. ``You're eating out as much for the social experience as for
a dining experience.''
</P>
<P>
   New York diners are also sensitive and, as Rockwell added,
designers are constantly struggling to find that elusive place
between ``sardines and Siberia.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs spend a lot of time searching for it, too. In the
process, walkways get narrower, corners are maximized, and
breathing room is kept at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   A dining room laid out too generously can feel dead. If the
tables are six or seven feet apart, Beers said, ``It's difficult to
get a buzz going. It yields a quiet sit-up-straight kind of
restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy in a restaurant has become a kind of commodity. Many New
York designers working in other cities have been asked to come up
with a ``New York feel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They associate that with a slightly tighter table spacing than
you might get if you were following an industry standard,'' said
Paul Bentel, a partner at Bentel &AMP; Bentel Architects/Planners in
Locust Valley, N.Y. By industry standards, Bentel said, tables for
four may be spaced five or six feet apart. In New York, he would
reduce that to as little as 24 inches, ``to get the kind of energy
they associate with a New York restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, though, these same designers are not trying to
crunch space down to the limit of 12 square feet per person. If a
room is too tight, people will feel uncomfortable and won't want to
come back, Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockwell Group and Bogdanow Partners both said their
restaurants average 16 to 18 square feet per person. The industry
standard, Bentel said, is 20 to 22 square feet per person.
</P>
<P>
   The bar area is more of a wild card _ and a tighter squeeze. The
trouble with many new designs is the mingling of bar areas with
eating areas. Often, they collide.
</P>
<P>
   New York City building codes dictate that smoking areas at the
bar can be just six feet from dining tables. Which is why in many
restaurants, like Bottino and Babbo, you often feel as if you are
eating in the bar and getting bumped by all the traffic flowing
through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, you would have to say it's unavoidable in some
cases,'' Ashworth said. But design can play a part. At Verbena, the
bar has just five seats and is set into a dark area with a low
ceiling. It sends out a clear message that it is just for waiting
for your table, not for lingering.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bar any larger would have probably affected the restaurant
dining experience,'' said Glenn Forley, a partner in Fizer Forley,
which designed the restaurant, ``because you would have had more of
an overlap. Now the bar is pretty much separate from the tables.''
The same is accomplished at Eleven Madison Park, where the bar is
set off to the side in a small dim room with low ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid crowds forming in more open restaurants, designers have
taken to adding communal tables in the bar area, which break up
crowds and form boundaries. ``By definition,'' Rockwell said, ``it
doesn't allow the bar to become too much of a bar.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Rosa Mexicano immediately attracted a big bar crowd,
making it impossible to navigate at times. Rockwell, whose company
designed the restaurant, has recently added bar-height tables. ``It
felt just too open,'' Rockwell said, ``and there's a lot of people
and making them a little more comfortable made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the long and narrow restaurants with bars up front that
have the most difficulty with traffic jams. At Town, a restaurant
under construction in Midtown, the bar itself and the equipment
behind it are very shallow. A small lounge is positioned at the end
of the bar, so people will be drawn through the area rather than
encouraged to linger in it. Other designers add features like a
carpet or a rail to signal which areas are for circulation.
</P>
<P>
   But there is only so much that can be done by a designer. The
rest is up to the management to control. If crowds get out of
control, as they do in many restaurant bars, it's the neighbors who
step in. The New York City Department of Buildings does not have a
task force out enforcing occupancy compliance. Most complaints are
filed by residents to the Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Fire Department will send an officer to take a head
count at the restaurant, said Brian Dixon, a department spokesman.
(For occupancies over 75 or restaurants with more than 750 square
feet, a sign must be posted and there is an annual inspection,
including a review of the seating plan.) If the occupancy limit is
exceeded, diners will be asked to leave until it is met. The
restaurant can be fined a maximum of $2,500. The unlucky, randomly
chosen diners go home hungry.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York this series of events is rare. So rare that when
the Fire Department was asked, it could not dig up a single case.

   BUS PASS
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the bus the other day, I glanced at the woman next to me.
She was working on a special-education student's evaluation form,
showing the child's name, the school's name and all of the child's
problems and diagnoses. She should not have been doing confidential
work in a public place. Should I call the school and tell them
without mentioning the therapist's name or chalk it up to a
momentary lapse in professional judgment?
</P>
<P>
   _ C. Cohen, Forest Hills, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: Alas, I think the lapse is yours for the (admittedly minor)
offense of snooping. A ``glance,'' as you call it, would not have
revealed as much information as you took in. Give this poor,
hard-working special-ed teacher a break; let her catch up on her
work on the bus. It seems very unlikely that any misuse of the
information could come from her fellow passengers. And with all due
respect, for civil society to be possible, there are times when we
must mind our own business. (If, however, you'd like to do some
glancing on that commuter spy bus that runs through Los Alamos, you
might qualify for a part-time job with the FBI.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Standing in the supermarket checkout line, I left briefly to
get a drink at the nearby fountain. When I returned, my cart had
been pushed aside and my place had been taken. I said to the
offending lady, ``I believe I was ahead of you.'' She replied,
``You left.'' I then proceeded to push her cart aside and tell her
that I do not go for that garbage. What is your opinion?
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott Bodin, Suffern, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: My opinion is that if you try this sort of thing with, say, a
couple of burly guys at a junkyard instead of with a woman at a
supermarket _ well, I hope your health insurance is paid up. This
sounds more like a matter of social custom than ethics, and as I
understand the folkways of the supermarket, that lady you bullied
was in the right: Unattended carts may be moved. It's not a bad
rule; she had no idea how long you'd be gone or if you'd be back at
all. Without it, shoppers would be tempted to reserve a place in
line with a half-filled cart while they strolled through the
produce department, inconveniencing all. While that woman would
have been generous to let you back in line, she was not obliged to.
And if everyone responds to such small slights as belligerently as
you did, picking up a little broccoli will become a lot riskier _
and the inspiration for a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had dinner at the home of one of my neighbors, and he said
grace in a way that seemed appallingly sexist. Should I have voiced
my dissent or kept quiet and allowed for the possibility that he
feels differently than I do?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous, Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   A: Silently bowing your head is not a declaration of belief;
after all, if a Christian dances at a Jewish wedding, no one
assumes he's converted. When one travels up the Amazon, he joins in
tribal customs, not to endorse them but to learn. And sometimes the
most alien culture of all is that of the house next door. If your
host's devotions included stoning an infidel or sacrificing a
particularly cute animal, you'd have been obliged to intervene to
prevent harm. But as no one was being hurt, you were right to sit
quietly and marvel at the variegated _ and sometimes idiotic _
beliefs of humanity. There is no obligation to inform your host of
your spiritual views between the cocktails and the cognac.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is also no obligation to remain silent. If you
could raise the matter tactfully, particularly when all were
mellowed by the cognac, that would have been even better. And
besides, a lively conversation helps settle the stomach.

 &HT;    A new cream called Vaniqa suppresses growth of unwanted facial
hair
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Unwanted facial hair is a condition that
is rarely spoken about, even among women who suffer from it.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, women tweeze and wax and pluck unwanted whiskers, but
the growths on the chin and upper lip that affect more than 20
million American women are nearly impossible to destroy
permanently. Like men, women must be vigilant about removing
unwanted hair or it just grows back.
</P>
<P>
   And this can lead to discomfort in social situations, making
women ashamed of their appearances and driving them into spending
loads of time

 &HT;    BUSINESS TORN BETWEEN EMBRACING, RESTRICTING OTHER LANGUAGES
 &HT;    With BILINGUAL-BOX. Moving in (a) national and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Aug. 27.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ ``Bienvenidos. Se Habla Espanol.'' The sign welcoming
customers to a hair salon in a suburban shopping mall assured them
Spanish was spoken there.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, the sign disappeared from the shop
window. Soon after, according to Hispanic former employees,
managers of the Regis Hairstylist Salon in North Riverside, Ill.,
ordered them to speak only English, even on their breaks and to
Spanish-speaking customers.
</P>
<P>
   Several hairstylists allege that they lost their jobs in 1997
for defying the rule and speaking their native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has made
a federal case out of it, filing a class-action discrimination
lawsuit last year against Minneapolis-based Regis Corp., which
operates salons in malls across America.
</P>
<P>
   As immigrants from non-English-speaking countries flow into the
United States, businesses and institutions increasingly face a
foreign-language test: How best to cope with new workers and new
customers whose first language is not English?
</P>
<P>
   The question is laden with obstacles and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of English as the sole language of American business
and political life is being challenged, swamped by new demographic
and market realities. More than 16 million legal immigrants have
entered America since 1980. One in five children in America is
either an immigrant or the U.S.-born son or daughter of an
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   The largest group, native Spanish speakers, represents an
important labor pool and a rapidly expanding economic force, with a
buying power last year of $383 billion, up 84 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller in numbers, but more affluent, Asian-Americans saw their
buying power leap 102 percent in the decade, to $228.6 billion,
according to estimates from the Selig Center for Economic Growth at
the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``At issue here isn't just a legal question. It is: How does
American business manage a diverse work force? How do you balance
new realities and historic assumptions, many of them unflattering,
about immigrants?'' said Christopher Ho, a senior staff attorney at
the San Francisco-based Employment Law Center, a national worker
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. efforts to penetrate the global marketplace, and keep pace
with the new diversity in America, have companies big and small
scrambling to hire bilingual employees.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal police forces, hospitals, congressional offices and
other government organizations also seek out bilingual employees or
provide language training for existing workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sense that we need it more to succeed in the economy than
we did before,'' said Pat DiCerbo of the National Clearinghouse for
Bilingual Education at George Washington University in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the work place diversifies and the need for bilingualism
grows, so too has the imposition of English-only rules by companies
claiming that the restrictions are necessary for workplace safety
and rapport.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Gomez, 39, a Mexican native and one of the Chicago
hairstylists who claims she was forced from her job, speaks English
at home with her three American-born children. But she felt it only
natural to speak Spanish at work with clients from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seemed silly to me, because we're in a free country and
my clients speak Spanish, too. It just doesn't make sense,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Regis, which operates 5,000 salons in the U.S.,
Canada and the United Kingdom, declined to comment on the case when
reached by telephone at their corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law does not prohibit employers from requiring their
workers to speak only English. But EEOC regulations can require
companies to demonstrate that the English-only policy is necessary
for conducting business or maintaining safety and that it does not
discriminate. Courts have ruled that an employer's language policy
must be reasonable and justifiable, and not a blanket policy that
extends to off-work activities.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, English-only is acceptable among air traffic
controllers or in a hospital, and perhaps even in a business
setting to maintain continuity, but not to prevent workers from
chatting in their native language at the water cooler.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC only began tracking complaints about English-only rules
in 1996 and has seen them rise. In 1996, the agency filed 77
English-only charges, compared to 253 last year. Likewise, cases
involving discrimination based on national origin have increased as
employers take advantage of workers' unfamiliarity of the U.S.
workplace and ignorance of their legal rights. Allegations of
harassment have risen tenfold between 1986 and 1999, according to
the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has grown significantly,'' said David Grinberg, a spokesman
at the EEOC's Washington, D.C., headquarters. ``The trend we see
are immigrants in low-wage jobs who become the target of egregious
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho believes many employers enact English-only rules in the
mistaken belief that they are sanctioned by the wave of largely
symbolic English-only resolutions. About two dozen states,
including Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and Colorado, have
passed measures or ballot initiatives making English the official
language over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 259-169 to make
English the nation's official language. But the measure has failed
to advance to a vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as English-only efforts persist, corporate marketing
efforts in Spanish and other languages are at an all-time high,
according to Raoul Lopez, senior vice president of Strategy
Research Corp. in Miami. The marketing research firm founded in
1971 is having its best year ever supplying data on Hispanic buying
trends to Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, $1.7 billion was spent on Spanish-language
advertising in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable. It's the fastest-growing minority group in
the United States with enormous buying power,'' said Lopez. ``There
is a growing momentum in the market for companies to expand their
efforts under an umbrella of the top three minority groups _
Hispanics, African Americans and Asian-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Prudential Atlanta/Georgia Realty opened a
bilingual office to serve suburban Hall County's booming Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, the consumer products giant, last fall
launched a multicultural marketing effort including a magazine
called Avanzando con tu Familia (Advancing With Your Family).
Debuted last fall, it is distributed free to 4.5 million Hispanic
households and includes a blend of advertising and helpful tips for
mothers and homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which also spends heavily on Spanish-language radio
and television, is testing similar grassroots efforts to build
relationships with Asian American and African-American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, as the demographics of our customers change, we
want to change with them,'' said Maria Molina of Procter &AMP; Gamble's
multicultural marketing division. ``It's the right thing to do, and
it makes business sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In large cities like Los Angeles, Houston and Miami, native
Spanish speakers can live their everyday lives without the need for
English.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all ATM cash machines in the United States offer
English or Spanish options as the first selection of any
transaction. This year, in an effort to count everyone in America,
the Census Bureau offered questionnaires in six languages: English,
Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Tagalog.
</P>
<P>
   Yet polls show that a majority of immigrants consider learning
English or improving their English skills is a top priority to get
ahead in America. Census figures show that more than 60 percent of
Spanish-speaking immigrants are fluent in English.
</P>
<P>
   Market studies show that the rate of assimilation among
Hispanics is accelerating as their affluence is growing. About 75
percent of Hispanic households in the United States are classified
as middle or upper class, according to market researchers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a market study by Strategy Research Corp. showed that
for every Hispanic adult identifying more with the general U.S.
population, seven were aligned more with the Hispanic culture and
market. By this year, the ratio had dropped to 1 to 3, with
substantially more Hispanics were moving toward the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   If history is a guide, immigrants will assimilate over time. But
will employers ease up on English-only rules?
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is always tough,'' said Ho, the worker-rights advocate.
``But as we're faced with the reality that we need these people to
fuel the current economy, perhaps it will propel employers to
rethink these kinds of rules.''

workplace battles.

 &HT;    BUSINESS TORN BETWEEN EMBRACING, RESTRICTING OTHER LANGUAGES
 &HT;    With BILINGUAL-BOX. Moving in (a) national and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Aug. 27.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ ``Bienvenidos. Se Habla Espanol.'' The sign welcoming
customers to a hair salon in a suburban shopping mall assured them
Spanish was spoken there.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, the sign disappeared from the shop
window. Soon after, according to Hispanic former employees,
managers of the Regis Hairstylist Salon in North Riverside, Ill.,
ordered them to speak only English, even on their breaks and to
Spanish-speaking customers.
</P>
<P>
   Several hairstylists allege that they lost their jobs in 1997
for defying the rule and speaking their native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has made
a federal case out of it, filing a class-action discrimination
lawsuit last year against Minneapolis-based Regis Corp., which
operates salons in malls across America.
</P>
<P>
   As immigrants from non-English-speaking countries flow into the
United States, businesses and institutions increasingly face a
foreign-language test: How best to cope with new workers and new
customers whose first language is not English?
</P>
<P>
   The question is laden with obstacles and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of English as the sole language of American business
and political life is being challenged, swamped by new demographic
and market realities. More than 16 million legal immigrants have
entered America since 1980. One in five children in America is
either an immigrant or the U.S.-born son or daughter of an
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   The largest group, native Spanish speakers, represents an
important labor pool and a rapidly expanding economic force, with a
buying power last year of $383 billion, up 84 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller in numbers, but more affluent, Asian-Americans saw their
buying power leap 102 percent in the decade, to $228.6 billion,
according to estimates from the Selig Center for Economic Growth at
the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``At issue here isn't just a legal question. It is: How does
American business manage a diverse work force? How do you balance
new realities and historic assumptions, many of them unflattering,
about immigrants?'' said Christopher Ho, a senior staff attorney at
the San Francisco-based Employment Law Center, a national worker
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. efforts to penetrate the global marketplace, and keep pace
with the new diversity in America, have companies big and small
scrambling to hire bilingual employees.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal police forces, hospitals, congressional offices and
other government organizations also seek out bilingual employees or
provide language training for existing workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sense that we need it more to succeed in the economy than
we did before,'' said Pat DiCerbo of the National Clearinghouse for
Bilingual Education at George Washington University in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the work place diversifies and the need for bilingualism
grows, so too has the imposition of English-only rules by companies
claiming that the restrictions are necessary for workplace safety
and rapport.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Gomez, 39, a Mexican native and one of the Chicago
hairstylists who claims she was forced from her job, speaks English
at home with her three American-born children. But she felt it only
natural to speak Spanish at work with clients from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seemed silly to me, because we're in a free country and
my clients speak Spanish, too. It just doesn't make sense,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Regis, which operates 5,000 salons in the U.S.,
Canada and the United Kingdom, declined to comment on the case when
reached by telephone at their corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law does not prohibit employers from requiring their
workers to speak only English. But EEOC regulations can require
companies to demonstrate that the English-only policy is necessary
for conducting business or maintaining safety and that it does not
discriminate. Courts have ruled that an employer's language policy
must be reasonable and justifiable, and not a blanket policy that
extends to off-work activities.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, English-only is acceptable among air traffic
controllers or in a hospital, and perhaps even in a business
setting to maintain continuity, but not to prevent workers from
chatting in their native language at the water cooler.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC only began tracking complaints about English-only rules
in 1996 and has seen them rise. In 1996, the agency filed 77
English-only charges, compared to 253 last year. Likewise, cases
involving discrimination based on national origin have increased as
employers take advantage of workers' unfamiliarity of the U.S.
workplace and ignorance of their legal rights. Allegations of
harassment have risen tenfold between 1986 and 1999, according to
the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has grown significantly,'' said David Grinberg, a spokesman
at the EEOC's Washington, D.C., headquarters. ``The trend we see
are immigrants in low-wage jobs who become the target of egregious
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho believes many employers enact English-only rules in the
mistaken belief that they are sanctioned by the wave of largely
symbolic English-only resolutions. About two dozen states,
including Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and Colorado, have
passed measures or ballot initiatives making English the official
language over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 259-169 to make
English the nation's official language. But the measure has failed
to advance to a vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as English-only efforts persist, corporate marketing
efforts in Spanish and other languages are at an all-time high,
according to Raoul Lopez, senior vice president of Strategy
Research Corp. in Miami. The marketing research firm founded in
1971 is having its best year ever supplying data on Hispanic buying
trends to Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, $1.7 billion was spent on Spanish-language
advertising in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable. It's the fastest-growing minority group in
the United States with enormous buying power,'' said Lopez. ``There
is a growing momentum in the market for companies to expand their
efforts under an umbrella of the top three minority groups _
Hispanics, African Americans and Asian-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Prudential Atlanta/Georgia Realty opened a
bilingual office to serve suburban Hall County's booming Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, the consumer products giant, last fall
launched a multicultural marketing effort including a magazine
called Avanzando con tu Familia (Advancing With Your Family).
Debuted last fall, it is distributed free to 4.5 million Hispanic
households and includes a blend of advertising and helpful tips for
mothers and homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which also spends heavily on Spanish-language radio
and television, is testing similar grassroots efforts to build
relationships with Asian American and African-American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, as the demographics of our customers change, we
want to change with them,'' said Maria Molina of Procter &AMP; Gamble's
multicultural marketing division. ``It's the right thing to do, and
it makes business sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In large cities like Los Angeles, Houston and Miami, native
Spanish speakers can live their everyday lives without the need for
English.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all ATM cash machines in the United States offer
English or Spanish options as the first selection of any
transaction. This year, in an effort to count everyone in America,
the Census Bureau offered questionnaires in six languages: English,
Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Tagalog.
</P>
<P>
   Yet polls show that a majority of immigrants consider learning
English or improving their English skills is a top priority to get
ahead in America. Census figures show that more than 60 percent of
Spanish-speaking immigrants are fluent in English.
</P>
<P>
   Market studies show that the rate of assimilation among
Hispanics is accelerating as their affluence is growing. About 75
percent of Hispanic households in the United StatesGUAL-AMERICA.

   IF YOU'VE GOT THE CAP, WEAR IT
</P>
<P>
   War veterans embraced Al Gore as one of their own Tuesday as he
swatted back at George W. Bush's assertion that America's military
is in decline. Emphasizing his military and foreign affairs
experience _ in the Army in Vietnam, and service on intelligence
and armed services committees in Congress _ Gore told the Veterans
of Foreign Wars convention in Milwaukee that his is no election
year conversion. Wearing his cap from VFW Post 5021 in Carthage,
Tenn., Gore said it ``makes me so concerned when others try to run
down America's military for political advantage in an election.''
His $127 billion in military proposals include higher pay,
equipment modernization and more money for veterans hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   GOING NATIONAL WITH TEXAS READING PLAN
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush was completing a two-day tour through the Midwest
by pushing a $5 billion program _ copied from one he started three
years ago in Texas _ that would encourage states to teach children
to read by third grade. ``Reading is the building block, and it
must be the foundation, for education reform,'' was the message he
was delivering in visits to schools in Peoria, Ill., and
Chesterfield, Mo. States that use this fund, Bush said, would be
required to establish a reading test for students to determine who
needs extra help, a curriculum and teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE . . . THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Telling his life story with millions of dollars in TV spots, Al
Gore returned to the airwaves Tuesday, trying to capitalize on
momentum from last week's convention. Almost state for state and
dollar for dollar, the effort matches rival George W. Bush's ads on
education and making tough choices, which began running Monday. The
Gore ad, playing in 17 battleground states, begins the story with
his decision to enlist in the Army despite deep misgivings about
the Vietnam War and goes on to chronicle Gore's entry into
politics, his accomplishments in Congress and as vice president,
and his main policy goals. Democrats estimate that the Bush
campaign is spending nearly $5.5 million this week, with Gore
spending about the same.
</P>
<P>
   LEAD REVERSAL IN ANOTHER POLL
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has climbed to a narrow lead following the Democratic
convention by easing doubts about his leadership ability and
personal style while establishing himself with voters as the
candidate best able to deal with the economy, education and health
care reform, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. Gore
currently holds a 50-45 percent advantage over George W. Bush among
registered voters _ the first time he has clearly led in a Post-ABC
News poll. Bush led Gore by 9 percentage points less than two weeks
ago. The poll has a 3.5 percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   OK, START CONVINCING
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush acknowledged Tuesday he hasn't convinced voters
that the nation can afford his $1.3 trillion tax cut plan after
shoring up Social Security. ``I have got to do a better job of
making it clear'' that expected budget surpluses in the next 10
years will allow for the tax cuts, even after Social Security is
rescued, Bush said. He was responding to new criticism from Al Gore
alleging his plan would squander the surplus. Bush said he was
standing by his proposals: ``I am not changing my opinion. I think
it is the absolute right thing to do for America.''
</P>
<P>
   DOING WHAT HE'S REALLY GOOD AT
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was attending a pair of lavish fund-raisers in
suburban Detroit private homes, the latest effort to boost the
Senate campaign coffers of Rep. Debbie Stabenow. She trails her
opponent in dollars raised, but appears to be in a dead heat with
Republican Sen. Spence Abraham. Clinton was guest of honor at a
$1,000-a-person reception in Bingham Farms and a $10,000-a-person
dinner in Bloomfield Hills. Money from the events _ organizers hope
to raise $500,000 _ will be split between the Democratic National
Committee and Stabenow's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSIVE
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Defense Department has done its best to defend
its capabilities, while not appearing to take sides in a political
spat. ``We're still the finest force in the world today,'' said
Defense Secretary William Cohen, a Republican. Cohen admitted,
however, that one area in need of improvement is compensation and
benefits _ a major issue of contention between George W. Bush and
Al Gore. ``We've had the largest pay raise in a generation,'' Cohen
said. ``Can we always do more? Sure . . . I think there's always
room for criticism.'' But Cohen denied Bush's assertion that, if
elected, Bush would inherit a military ``in decline.''
</P>
<P>
   AN ARMY TRAVELS ON ITS STOMACH
</P>
<P>
   The quality of life for military families was popularized as a
campaign issue by Arizona Sen. John McCain, whose failed
presidential campaign called attention to the fact that thousands
of service members are on food stamps. But some military analysts
don't necessarily think that's a bad thing, regarding food stamps
as just another military benefit. But it has become a mark of
shame, and both Al Gore and George W. Bush say conditions must be
improved. Gore says the number of active service members receiving
the coupons has dwindled by two-thirds in a decade, to about 6,000,
and reminds everyone that food stamps in the military date back
well before the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   BIG ELECTION, BIG MONEY
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush raised seven times more money than Al Gore in
July, according to monthly filings with the Federal Elections
Commission. While Gore raised $771,000 from individuals, Bush
reported receipts of $5.4 million, including contributions from
political action committees. With both party conventions over, the
candidates no longer can accept campaign contributions. Instead,
both will receive a $67.56 million federal subsidy. Both political
parties, however, can still raise unlimited amounts in ``soft
money'' donations.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER FATHER-SON COMBO?
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said he thinks his eldest son,
HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, will run for governor of New York in
2002. But the elder Cuomo said that ``unless Andrew is lying to
me,'' his son has not yet completely committed to running.
Nonetheless, Mario Cuomo said, ``We're doing everything possible to
get him ready for when he says it. I'm talking to people about
money, and that's coming fairly well. . . . We're doing that kind
of thing and he's moving around.'' The father lost the job in 1994
to Republican George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   POPULIST PITCH PUMMELED
</P>
<P>
   Green Party candidate Ralph Nader challenged Al Gore's populist
credentials and urged him to reject campaign money from industries
he criticized during his address to the Democratic convention last
week. ``He challenged and criticized the giant drug companies, the
oil companies, the pharmaceutical industry, the HMOs. . . . He
talked populist, but buys into corporate power,'' Nader said in Los
Angeles. ``Give the money back, Mr. Gore, or stand condemned of
deceiving and misleading the American people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BUT SHE'LL LET THEM ENDORSE HER, THOUGH
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton declined to offer her backing for Rep. Eliot
Engel, a five-term Bronx Democrat facing a September primary
challenge. Black and Hispanic leaders have thrown their support
behind a black state senator, Larry Seabrook. ``I am not getting
involved in that campaign,'' Clinton said in Yonkers as Engel, who
is Jewish, stood stiff and expressionless at her side. ``This is a
local situation. I'm not going to have anything to say about
that,'' she said. Clinton has generally steered clear of taking
sides in any primaries, even those involving incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   PEPPER SPRAY PEPPERS CLINTON RALLY
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service agents removed Hillary Clinton from a community
center in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., after a supporter accidentally
released pepper spray into the meeting hall. Clinton apparently was
unaffected by the incident, which occurred as she was posing for
photos with children. But dozens of others left the hall and went
outside coughing. ``I was putting something in my bag and I must
have knocked the safety off,'' said an embarrassed Ka'ttie Coleman,
a Clinton supporter, pulling out the small black canister attached
to her keychain. ``I feel very, very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   THIS TIME'S MANAGEMENT'S THE ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   In a municipal election in Selma, Ala., longtime Mayor Joe
Smitherman, a white ex-segregationist who was in office during the
civil rights violence of 1965, faced challenges from three black
candidates. Smitherman, 70, barely won re-election in 1996. During
his first term, the city became infamous for the armed response to
the Selma voting rights march. Later, he welcomed blacks into his
government and has won nine consecutive elections in a city that is
now 65 percent black. Most opponents _ including businessman James
Perkins, who nearly beat him four years ago _ criticize him for his
management of the city.

NAVIGATING THE BAR WHEN IT'S THREE DRINKERS DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How a concerned drinker might ask, is a person
supposed to get a margarita at the new Rosa Mexicano on Columbus
Avenue? The place is huge: two floors across from Lincoln Center.
The bar, for some reason, occupies approximately 0.01 percent of
this vast space. It's like a trading post on the floor of the New
York Stock Exchange, everybody shouting and waving their arms
about, frantically trying to place orders. Drop in there after
work, and witness the sad sight of two attractive women shuffling
back and forth on the periphery of the crowd, trying to get the
bartender's attention.
</P>
<P>
   A terrible spectacle, but not an unusual one. Manhattan's
restaurants are the most congested in the country _ and seem to be
getting more so by the minute. Going out has become a battle of
inches, from securing the edge of a bar stool to steeling yourself
against the jostling of waiters, busboys and fellow diners in
restaurants prized for having 13 tables. Even for hardened night
life decathletes, walking into the new now place induces a
fight-or-flight response.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I subjected myself to a week of heat-seeking
throngs. My hope was to learn how to navigate Manhattan's most
mobbed bar scenes, where restaurant congestion reaches critical
mass.
</P>
<P>
   For the first outing, last Tuesday, I brought my friend Doug, a
writer and photographer who does not exaggerate when he says he
spends every night of his life in a bar. Our first venue:
Balthazar.
</P>
<P>
   The bar was bustling. A phalanx of skinny young things and the
men who prey on them blocked access to a tantalizing wall of wine
and liquor. We saw two empty stools, but a man sporting a
blazer-T-shirt look was standing proprietorily over one of them.
Doug, not a shy person, asked the fellow if he would mind moving to
another vacant stool, further down the bar, so we could have his.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sit here, but I'm not giving up my position,'' the
fellow said, leaning into a conversation between two young women on
the other side of him.
</P>
<P>
   So Doug sat and I stood. We immediately asked for drinks and a
menu. Ordering food is an excellent way to claim a beachhead: the
moment the cutlery and napkin arrive, you've doubled your real
estate. By the time the steak frites came, we'd squeezed our friend
out and over to a second-row spot facing the two women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done this guy a major favor,'' Doug said, going on to
offer a few recommendations for prompt bar service, in order of
advisability:
</P>
<P>
   --Seek out the shortest people and get behind them _ same
strategy as at a rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   --Wave a large wad of cash _ crass but it still works in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   --Do the one-finger slam dunk, as if tipping a basketball in
with the index finger, making yourself as tall as possible and
gesturing at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   --Say: ``My wife's pregnant. She needs a Guinness.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Dechais, one of the women sitting next to us, revealed
that she works on weekends as a bartender in Queens. Her advice?
``Anyone who leans over the bar and aggressively tries to get my
attention will be the last person I will serve,'' she said. ``The
best way is to be polite, like, `I know you're really busy but when
you have a moment ... .'''
</P>
<P>
   I tried out her technique the following night at Rue 57, the
57th Street version of Balthazar. I arrived, alone, at 7 o'clock. I
sidled up to a stool occupied by a purse and shopping bag that
belonged to a nearby quartet of French-speaking women. I hovered by
the stool, adopting a sideways stance and planting one hand on the
edge of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The bartender, who seemed older than his bottle-blond hair and
gold hoop earring would indicate, was deep in conversation with two
female patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Married is single in my world!'' he said in a Down Under
accent, clasping one of their ringed fingers in his hand. I
considered asking him if this was something Bryan Brown had said in
``Cocktail.'' Then I remembered the polite approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me. ... When you get a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. I sensed I was not a member of his favorite gender. I
locked onto the more approachable-looking bartender, resolved not
to take my eyes off him till they made contact. (If a bartender
looks at you and you're not looking back, prepare to wait another
20 minutes.) I'd been Hoovering edamame from a bowl on the bar, so
I used this as my witty ice-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are good!'' I said, furiously popping the soy beans into
my mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said. ``Can't stop eating them.''
</P>
<P>
   Connection made! It got me a beer and a menu. I was then free to
focus on how others around me did it. One guy tried shouting over
the row of people in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like a chardonnay!'' he declared, as if to indicate
confident familiarity with the grape.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind?'' my bartender asked with what sounded like a hint
of irritation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you like.''
</P>
<P>
   Another bartender would later tell me that her pet peeve is
people who don't know what they want.
</P>
<P>
   I was then treated to the opposite approach, aggressive
hostility. A short dark-haired woman charged the bar with such
violence that my hand slipped on my pint glass, splashing her with
a few droplets of beer foam. She shot me a death glare and fanned
theatrically at the cigarette smoke coming from the woman on the
other side of her. (Lighting up is a surefire way to expand your
perimeter.) But I couldn't help but admire how fast she managed to
get a menu in one hand, a fistful of edamame in the other and a
round of drinks for her friends. This is New York. Sometimes,
bartenders have also told me, pushy works.
</P>
<P>
   Being Canadian, I can't do pushy. Canadians are personal-space
fanatics (we invented the white line on the highway), but we're too
deferential to do much about it but fume and call it patience. This
paid off when the French foursome finally left. I took their
bag-storage stool and ordered a plate of oysters and littleneck
clams. From my perch I could now watch a poor sap in a powder blue
polo shirt, who'd been there as long as I had, wander aimlessly
around a crowd that was now three deep. After a while, Powder Blue
Man slammed his empty glass down in front of me and stalked out, as
if I had somehow stolen his rightful place.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I was getting the hang of this. Thursday night would be
the true test. The TGIT crowd, out in force. I'd heard that when
Guastavino's first opened under the 59th Street Bridge, people were
turned away from the bar on Thursday nights unless they had dinner
reservations. That was where I brought my friend Tad, a producer
and program host on the Metro Channel.
</P>
<P>
   We were not denied. The bar was filled with very short, very tan
patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo, Rich! When ya get a chance.'' This was the voice in my ear
mocking our own futile stabs at getting a drink. Knowing the
bartender, or at least able to address him by name, is the ultimate
weapon. It doubles, maybe triples, your range. You could be 20 feet
from the bar and still get an order through with a ``Yo, Rich!'' in
your arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   A friend and saloon scholar from Chicago had e-mailed me to this
effect. ``Curry the favor of all bartenders in the joints you
frequent,'' he advised. ``The key is to be well known for tipping
generously and thus establish yourself as a beloved regular who
knows a thing or two about the server. This limits your power to
all but a handful of hangouts _ but I find it's always better to be
treated with deference in your favorite haunts than to explore new
ones and be made to feel like a loser all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tad likes to go for ``the pocket,'' the spot at the end of the
bar under the television often left vacant by people who like to
watch. No good here, as there is no TV. His other tactic is to scan
the bar like a parking lot, looking for the equivalent of a brake
light: anyone who looks as if he or she is settling up. We found
one such opening, a narrow one, which I tried to enlarge by
sticking out my chest and elbows. (A friend calls this maneuver
``fatting.'') After one beer and too many chicken wings, we left
for more challenging territory.

NEW YORK: challenging territory.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We found it at Red Rock West. This West Chelsea theme dive _
Hogs 'n' Heifers meets Coyote Ugly _ makes no delineation between
bar and nonbar space, just an alcoholic mosh pit. In short, not an
easy place to get a drink.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you happen to be 6-foot-6 and built like a professional
wrestler. This was ``Land of the Giants'' territory, and we, a
couple of average-size media guys, had made the mistake of bringing
our womenfolk. Tad knows one of the Red Rock bartenders, Anne, who
if she doesn't like the way someone asks for a drink will use the
bar microphone to publicly abuse that person. (What sets her off is
people who address her as ``Hello-o-o!'') Anne wasn't working that
night, making Tad just another loser trying to get a round of
tequila shots.
</P>
<P>
   We were one layer away from the bar when I became aware of a
huge forearm reaching over my head and a voice growling, ``Get me
an Amstel Light and a vodka-tonic.'' A curt nod and it was done.
The drinks were passed back over my head and handed to our dates.
</P>
<P>
   Things could have gotten ugly _ I might have had to rough some
dudes up _ but it was at this moment that my date discovered that
her ankle was bleeding. Enough bottles and glasses explode here _
on the floor, over someone's head _ that you write it off as
background noise. Ambience. But she'd caught enough shards that we
had to leave to assess the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a place for mules,'' she observed as we fought our
way upstream toward the door.
</P>
<P>
   Our shots had just arrived. &QL;

EDITORIAL: STOP ARGUING AND START DEBATING 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 22:
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican and Democratic conventions completed, the
next potentially decisive event in the presidential campaign will
be the debates between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W.
Bush. Both camps have begun arguing over the format and number of
debates. Bush's team wants to consider options other than the
nationally televised one-on-one format sponsored since the late
1980s by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The obvious public
interest is for Gore and Bush to have a chance to face and
challenge each other directly, with questions coming from
journalists or an audience of citizens. There should be at least
three such debates on nationwide television in prime time,
beginning as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In some years the presidential debate commission, a nonpartisan
group, has excluded third- and fourth-party candidates so that the
Democratic and Republican nominees can hold a more focused exchange
of their views. In 1996 this page questioned the commission's
decision to exclude Ross Perot. We argued that since Perot had run
a strong race in 1992 and still had a broad national standing four
years later, he had the right to debate President Clinton and Sen.
Bob Dole. This year, however, neither Ralph Nader nor Patrick
Buchanan has yet reached the status of a candidate with
demonstrated national support. Should that change as the campaign
progresses, the commission can respond accordingly. For now, the
public deserves to see Bush and Gore lay out the substantial
differences between them, without interference from third- or
fourth-party candidates who have not built solid constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Democrats met in Los Angeles last week, the political
news for Gore has looked more favorable, and it is understandable
that he would want more debates rather than fewer. Not only have
the polls improved for the vice president, but they also show that
the public is more inclined to favor him on the economy, Social
Security, education and health. It stands to reason in Gore's camp
that a debate might underscore these and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, has developed into a forceful and
articulate candidate with what many voters believe are appealing
leadership qualities. His confident manner could easily make up for
any inability to recite facts and legislation as Gore has shown he
can do. In one of those paradoxes of the so-called expectations
game, the Bush team has already begun talking up Gore's well-known
debating skills. Karen Hughes, the Texas governor's communications
director, said over the weekend that ``we want to make sure it's
not a yelling contest or something undignified.'' But her criterion
should not become an excuse for the Bush camp to insist on an
informal disorganized discussion in place of a a focused
examination of issues, broadcast on all the television networks and
allowing for plenty of time for rebuttals on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Though the political conventions did not draw as many viewers as
they have in the past, the abrupt changes in opinion ratings show
that when television devotes at least some time to the campaign,
the public starts to pay attention. That is why an early start on
debates, shortly after Labor Day, would be good for all candidates.
Aides to Gore and Bush should meet right away with the presidential
commission and agree on a format.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no objection to the candidates' accepting other
formats sponsored by other news organizations, with discussions
that include minor party candidates. But since the differences
between the Republican and Democratic nominees are becoming clearer
by the day, a series of universally televised debates in prime time
would best educate voters, spur public interest and force the
candidates to articulate why they should be elected.

   Sabina Steinmetz of Burbank is planning a ``Survivor'' party
with tapioca treats, immunity challenges for her guests and a
tiki-themed jungle decor that would do Elvis Presley proud. She's
even serving up her own variation of rat-on-a-stick, with barbecued
chicken standing in for the rodent.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Rhodes of Studio City has an even more elaborate soiree
planned _ partygoers will be divided into teams and be allowed
different qualities and quantities of snacks, much as the Tagi
tribe went hungry as the Pagongs feasted after winning goofy
challenges on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have normal stuff _ rice, tapioca, fish, rats, grub
(actually gummi) worms,'' Rhodes promises. ``After the first
challenge on the show, everyone's gonna draw numbers out of a hat.
We'll have sushi and sake and nice food for the winning group;
everyone else eats rice with sand in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Partygoers will be dressed as their favorite survivors _ ``I'll
have failed if at least one guy isn't naked,'' he says. ``I'm
coming as Colleen. I've had parasites in my legs for the past four
days so the scarring will be authentic,'' he jokes. At least, we're
pretty sure he's joking.
</P>
<P>
   Both Steinmetz and Rhodes also know who they're rooting for to
take home the million-dollar prize with their tattered apparel:
Rudy, the 72-year-old former Navy SEAL who couldn't start a fire
and couldn't catch a fish, but still seems more worthy of winning
than the other finalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I think everybody pretty much despises the rest
of them,'' Steinmetz says. ``I thought Kelly would've been gone
several episodes ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes concurs: ``Anyone who eats at the Olive Garden, even if
she's using someone else's credit card'' _ as Kelly is accused of
doing by North Carolina authorities _ ``doesn't deserve anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinmetz continues, ``I don't despise Sue _ she's up-front
about things, but crude in a way. I think Richard has a shot in the
final two, but then it becomes a matter of who the castaways hate
less, and the others really resent his manipulations in getting
that far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants want to see Snidely Whiplash win,'' Rhodes
echoes.
</P>
<P>
   And Steinmetz is already looking ahead _ albeit a smidgen
reluctantly _ to the Australian sequel, scheduled to debut in
January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Says Steinmetz, ``I'll watch the next one, but there'll never be
another like this.'' &QL;

FINAL 4 COUNTDOWN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After two more ``Survivor'' castaways are whittled away in
immunity challenges in tonight's episode, a jury of seven
contestants eliminated over the past few weeks will decide who wins
the million-dollar prize. Handicapping the Final Four:
</P>
<P>
   Richard: After one episode, he had already established himself
as the guy folks would love to hate. Now that he's engineered the
demise of virtually everyone in the jury of castaways who will
decide the winner, do you honestly think they'd vote him the money?
Unless, of course, he manages one last breathtakingly slimy act
before the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly: Alas, her defining moment _ for viewers, at least, if not
for North Carolina authorities _ was losing the canoe race against
greenhorn Gervase, after bragging that her river-rafting job
ensured that her victory was a done deal. Her win would _ well,
it'd just be wrong. Unless she's up against Richard in the final
round.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Unless Sue pulls off a mask revealing she's Tom Cruise from
``M:I-2'' in disguise and has just been playing a dumb redneck all
along to lull the competition into a sense of complacency, she,
too, seems an unlikely champion _ with, obviously, the same Richard
caveat.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy: This old cuss is the most palatable of the Final Four _ at
least he has a reason for his grouchiness, which most observers
believe will be significantly diminished after tonight's finale. &QL;

  Finale finally milks show dry

<P>
   If Richard _ the snaky, corpulent nudist whose hobbies include
spearing fish and back-stabbing his colleagues _ does win the
million-dollar prize tonight on ``Survivor,'' the show will
immediately emerge as the most subversive mainstream TV series in
history. Its inevitable lesson, already familiar in Hollywood, will
be a great one for the kids: Merit systems are for wusses.
Duplicity is the work ethic of the 21st century. Nice guys finish
last.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, that's the message anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Survivor'' crew has begun cashing in on its cheap + easy &QC;
</P>
<P>
   cheesy 15 minutes. Whiny attorney Stacey and grumpy old man B.B.
did a shoe commercial; proud papa and prouder sloth Gervase will
guest-star in a UPN sitcom; concerned single mother Jenna is
``baring all'' for a ``gentleman's'' magazine. Of the bunch,
however, only Richard nailed representation with a high-powered
Hollywood agency, William Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the chances for Richard _ who's already bagged a
radio talk show _ actually being declared the winner tonight are
virtually nil. After all, the folks who are still smarting after
having yanked out the knives he plunged into their backs are the
same ones who will be electing who gets to be a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's much-vaunted, two-hour finale finds the 16 original
contestants whittled down to four _ Richard, of course, and Rudy,
the cantankerous old Navy SEAL; Kelly, the cantankerous young
river-rafter and fugitive from North Carolina justice; and Susan,
the cantankerous redneck and spelling-bee reject.
</P>
<P>
   There will be two challenges tonight. First, the four remaining
survivors will answer questions about the 12 castaways who have
preceded them off Pulau Tiga. Given the epic levels of
self-absorption among this bunch, knowing anything about anyone
else may be the toughest task to date. Secondly, the finalists will
literally walk through fire, or a fair TV approximation thereof. In
the end, ``Survivor'' becomes a legal thriller as the two plead to
the previous seven ejectees why they deserve the suitcase full of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think ``Survivor'' ends with the winner counting his
money and the losers counting their chigger bites, you
underestimate CBS' ability to milk this puppy. Following the
program will be a live (on the East Coast) ``town-hall meeting''
moderated by a guy as chilly as Richard's manipulations, Bryant
Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor: The Reunion'' (taking place a whole minute after we
last saw them!) will feature all 16 contestants reminiscing before
a studio audience about the 39 days which shook a country. After
that, ``Late Show with David Letterman'' will reassemble the
castaways (after only 35 minutes apart!) for Dave's Top-10 list and
feature an interview with the winner.
</P>
<P>
   While Gloria warbles and Dave chortles, pundits will be
injecting their last pet theories: What transformed ``Survivor''
into a pop-culture event? We thought ``reality TV'' really just
meant this was the year of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and
``Survivor,'' with a lot of other pretenders surfacing before
promptly dropping from sight. That a lot more are in the pipeline
may be more a function of impending strikes by actors and writers
than it is the long-term viability of the format.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers, weary of traditional genre television, particularly
sitcoms, sought something different last season. And a group of
disgruntled and desperate island castaways coping with limited
rations and one another and transforming coconuts into telephones
hadn't been on network airwaves since Gilligan plonked one on the
Skipper's noggin.
</P>
<P>
   Massive kudos must be accorded executive producer Mark Burnett,
who assembled some entertaining characters, which, as ``Big
Brother'' proved, is a lot harder than it looks. (It's still hard
to believe that ``Big Brother's'' Brittany isn't just some
performance artist's parody of twentysomethings' morbidly pathetic
self-absorption.) Where the trailer- park trash in the ``Big
Brother'' house seem to think the show's about maintaining comfort
levels and getting along, ``Survivor's'' tough guys and gals
understood that succeeding in TV is considerably more cutthroat.
</P>
<P>
   Richard assumed the role of villain with a laudably gleeful
zeal, sending fans across America running to dictionaries to look
up the word ``Machiavellian.'' Rudy and B.B. were both sterling and
crusty examples of the Generation Gap, crabbily taking
responsibility for everything that those damn no-good flaky kids
(Sean, Greg, Dirk, etc.) wouldn't get off their miserable butts to
accomplish, while Gervase laughingly played the Gen-X slacker
prototype.
</P>
<P>
   And just when you thought all the women were whiny ditzes, there
was heroic, humble Gretchen, a mom who had taught survival tactics
to the Air Force elite, the island's sole beacon of decency and
rationality, the woman the smart money thought would win. Until,
naturally, Richard flexed his flaccid pecs and started throwing his
considerable uncovered weight around.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, those ``immunity challenges'' were hokey beyond belief
(and sloppily edited) but the ``tribal councils'' were even more
hokey, with goofball host Jeff Probst's chumpy lectures on fire and
symbolism and extinguishing torches. Probst's name alone is enough
to inspire campy sniggering. But at least there was a pronounced
narrative oomph to the proceedings (``Big Brother,'' take note) and
as a bonus, ``Survivors'' castaways mulled things over beyond the
details of their own navels (``Big Brother,'' ditto).
</P>
<P>
   Most crucially, ``Survivor'' was immeasurably aided by the
season's somnambulant news cycle. In terms of other diversions, our
planet could only muster a repeat of last year's astonishing Lance
Armstrong victory in some bike thing that happened over there in
Europe somewhere, the spectacles of tedium that were the political
conventions, and the misadventures of a Russian sub, where Mark
Burnett could base his next reality series. Hollywood conspired by
serving up the lamest summer flicks in recent memory (and that's
saying something). Not one major film could prompt a discussion
beyond ``Cool effects, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, denizens of the water cooler (or the Internet chat
room) had only the meretricious chicanery of Richard, the
orneriness of Rudy, the cuteness of Colleen and the loopiness of
Gervase, Greg, Sean and Dirk to deconstruct over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother'' have inspired
some truly inspired prose _ not to mention haiku _ on the Internet.
Survivorsucks.com and Salon.com's ``Big Brother'' episode recaps
are invariably 10 times more entertaining than the programs they
describe. These Web sites make relentless fun of their subjects,
but their entertainment value spilled over, helping the shows. You
had to watch the show to get the jokes, and the jokes were
definitely worth getting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the castaways are parlaying their celebrity into
bigger paydays _ despite the chances being slim that we're
interested in seeing them in any other context _ and Burnett is
scouting the Australian outback for ``Survivor 2,'' which will
debut next January after the Super Bowl. While it's a safe bet that
the sequel will lack the novelty of the original _ unless Burnett
gets really lax on the psychological profiling of its participants
_ we'll always have fond memories of the summer of ``Survivor's''
grueling personal drama, hype's media event of the year. At least
until the Olympics. &QL;

   FIRESTONE _ The Firestone tire models voluntarily recalled Aug.
9 are also failing on sport utility vehicles other than the Ford
Explorer, but when an Explorer loses its tire tread it is six times
as likely to roll over and kill someone, federal accident data
shows. An analysis of the of 642 Firestone and Explorer-related
accident reports that the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration has collected since early this year shows that the
rate at which tire treads are coming apart are comparable whether
the Firestone tires are on Ford's popular Explorer or on other
sport utility vehicles. However, the analysis indicates that what
happens after the tread peals away is strikingly different. The
results of the analysis, which was performed by the American
Statesman, appeared to support the allegations of lawyers and
safety advocates who have claimed that the Explorer has played a
role in the catastophic tire failures being reported nationwide.

   TIMBER _ NEWHILL, N.C. _ This southern corner of Wake County,
where suburban sprawl from nearby Raleigh and a local wood chip
mill are eliminating woodlands, illustrates the conclusion of a
controversial new study by timber management researchers. Rather
than solely blaming chip and pulp mills for depleting the South's
forests, the report from Duke and North Carolina State universities
said urban growth is also a significant cause of the shrinking
forests. On the eve of an industry conference Wednesday in Raleigh,
this finding heightens the sharp debate between the timber industry
and, on the other side, environmentalists and federal officials
concerned about the rapid acceleration of logging in the South. The
region is less regulated than the Pacific Northwest and, for the
first time, is harvesting soft woods such as pines faster than they
are being replaced. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ If Bill Clinton is indicted and faces potential
prison time after he leaves the presidency for lying under oath
about going too far with Monica Lewinsky, so be it. After all, the
president got himself into this fix and there is no reason why an
ex-president should be cut any legal slack the rest of us wouldn't
get. And that is precisely why Clinton shouldn't be charged. Almost
no one else would be in the same circumstances.(Teepen, Cox News

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ With summer's end, the pace in Pelee Island,
Ontario slackens as ferries from the Canadian and U.S. mainlands
cut back their shuttles to a sparse winter schedule that lasts
until the lake freezes over. Life on the island slows to a pleasant
walk. I know because I've been reading all about it in some back
issues of the local newspaper - The Grapevine. (Schuett, Cox News

</P>
<P>
   BOOKMAN-COLUMN _ While the GOP may officially oppose what it
calls ``quotas,'' there's no question that party leaders wanted a
certain number of minority faces broadcast on the nation's TV
screens from the convention in Philadelphia, and that those faces
were far out of proportion to their actual number and influence in
the party. Rather than an expression of hypocrisy, however, perhaps
it's best to look at that radiant picture of diversity from
Philadelphia as the stating of a goal. (Bookman, Atlanta

   INTEL _ SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Maybe Intel Corp. should change its

refocus itself on providing chips for everything Internet-related,

RATS! WHAT TO SERVE FOR A `SURVIVOR' PARTY?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sabina Steinmetz of Burbank is planning a ``Survivor'' party
with tapioca treats, immunity challenges for her guests and a
tiki-themed jungle decor that would do Elvis Presley proud. She's
even serving up her own variation of rat-on-a-stick, with barbecued
chicken standing in for the rodent.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Rhodes of Studio City has an even more elaborate soiree
planned _ partygoers will be divided into teams and be allowed
different qualities and quantities of snacks, much as the Tagi
tribe went hungry as the Pagongs feasted after winning goofy
challenges on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have normal stuff _ rice, tapioca, fish, rats, grub
(actually gummi) worms,'' Rhodes promises. ``After the first
challenge on the show, everyone's gonna draw numbers out of a hat.
We'll have sushi and sake and nice food for the winning group;
everyone else eats rice with sand in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Partygoers will be dressed as their favorite survivors _ ``I'll
have failed if at least one guy isn't naked,'' he says. ``I'm
coming as Colleen. I've had parasites in my legs for the past four
days so the scarring will be authentic,'' he jokes. At least, we're
pretty sure he's joking.
</P>
<P>
   Both Steinmetz and Rhodes also know who they're rooting for to
take home the million-dollar prize with their tattered apparel:
Rudy, the 72-year-old former Navy SEAL who couldn't start a fire
and couldn't catch a fish, but still seems more worthy of winning
than the other finalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I think everybody pretty much despises the rest
of them,'' Steinmetz says. ``I thought Kelly would've been gone
several episodes ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes concurs: ``Anyone who eats at the Olive Garden, even if
she's using someone else's credit card'' _ as Kelly is accused of
doing by North Carolina authorities _ ``doesn't deserve anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinmetz continues, ``I don't despise Sue _ she's up-front
about things, but crude in a way. I think Richard has a shot in the
final two, but then it becomes a matter of who the castaways hate
less, and the others really resent his manipulations in getting
that far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants want to see Snidely Whiplash win,'' Rhodes
echoes.
</P>
<P>
   And Steinmetz is already looking ahead _ albeit a smidgen
reluctantly _ to the Australian sequel, scheduled to debut in
January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Says Steinmetz, ``I'll watch the next one, but there'll never be
another like this.'' &QL;

BRIOCHE PEACH TART 
</HEADLINE>
  This is the second of several columns by Eberhard Mueller, the
executive chef and an owner of Lutece. They are being written with
Jack Bishop. 
 By EBERHARD MUELLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing up, I lived above my parents' bakery in the Black Forest
region of Germany. Out back, was an orchard where we grew pears,
apples, apricots, plums and peaches for use in the family business.
The weather in southwestern Germany isn't ideal for fruit trees,
and at the end of the summer we often had a lot of peaches that
were ripe but still firm. They weren't great for eating out of
hand, but they were perfect for tarts.
</P>
<P>
   In that part of Germany, fruit tarts are made with brioche, a
buttery yeast dough, rather than the shortbread pastry used in
French and American baking. The difference is enormous. In the
oven, the brioche dough develops a crunchy, well-browned crust
while the inside remains tender and springy. Brioche also does a
much better job of absorbing fruit juices than a crumbly
shortbread-style crust, and because the dough isn't terribly sweet,
the fruit _ in this case, peaches _ really shines.
</P>
<P>
   Soft, sweet peaches make a delicious tart, of course, but not
such a pretty one; they lose their shape and exude a lot of juice
when they are baked. That's why I prefer peaches that are firm but
ripe, with no green spots. When they are baked, their flavor
improves and their texture becomes creamy, but they still hold
their shape.
</P>
<P>
   I don't complicate this tart _ it's more or less my parents'
recipe: just brioche, a light sprinkle of ground almonds and bread
crumbs to absorb excess juices, and fruit. Don't think of it as the
typical elegant dessert; this tart is a much more rustic affair,
almost like a deep-dish pizza. In fact, in Germany, it's a
midafternoon snack.
</P>
<P>
   For my parents, making brioche was a laborious process that
could take up to eight hours. At home, I never have that kind of
time. But modern inventions like the standing mixer and rapid-rise
yeast have made this tart easy enough: the hands-on work takes only
about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Brioche tart dough works well with other summer fruits, too,
especially plums and apricots. With plums, which I don't peel, I
sprinkle the tart shell with ground hazelnuts, bread crumbs, sugar
and cinnamon. Apricots already have a strong almond flavor, so I
just use bread crumbs and sugar. When I have both plums and
peaches, I arrange them into a single tart. The acidity of the
plums heightens the sweetness of the peaches. The combination is
brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Brioche tastes best warm, so I time the tart so that it comes
out of the oven just as we're sitting down to dinner. Although the
tart can stand on its own, I like to add a dollop of creme fraiche
or ice cream. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRIOCHE PEACH TART
</P>
<P>
   Time: 3 hours
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups all-purpose flour plus extra for dusting work surface
</P>
<P>
   \ cup plus 2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 packet (\ ounce) rapid-rise active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   [ teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   \ cup milk, slightly warmed
</P>
<P>
   9 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, diced
</P>
<P>
   4 ripe but firm peaches
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely ground almonds
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon bread crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   1. For the brioche dough: Place flour, \ cup sugar, yeast, salt,
eggs and milk in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough
hook. Beat on medium speed, scraping down sides of bowl once or
twice, until dough is smooth, about 10 minutes. Add 8 tablespoons
of the butter, and continue beating and scraping down sides of bowl
until the butter is completely incorporated and dough is smooth
again, about 5 minutes. Dust top of dough lightly with flour, cover
the bowl with a damp towel, and let dough rise in a warm place
until almost doubled, 1{ to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Punch down dough, and divide in
half. (Wrap one piece and hold for another use: refrigerate for
several days or freeze for several weeks.) Roll the other half out
on a heavily floured work surface into an 11-inch circle, dusting
frequently with flour to prevent sticking. Lay dough over a rolling
pin, and transfer it to a 9-inch fluted tart pan with removable
bottom. Press dough into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess with
a sharp knife. Let rise until slightly puffed, 15 to 20 minutes.
Lightly prick with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   3. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a simmer. Add
peaches for 30 seconds, then remove with a slotted spoon to a large
bowl of cold water. Soak peaches just until cool, about 30 seconds.
Drain and peel. Halve, pit and cut each peach into 8 wedges.
</P>
<P>
   4. Mix almonds, bread crumbs and sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle
all but 2 teaspoons of the almond mixture over the dough. Arrange
peach slices on dough so that they overlap. Sprinkle with remaining
almond mixture. Dot peaches with remaining butter, and place pan on
rimmed baking sheet.
</P>
<P>
   5. Place on bottom rack of oven, and bake 10 minutes. Reduce
oven setting to 350 degrees, and bake until tart is golden brown on
top, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from pan immediately (the crust will
steam and soften if left in pan), and transfer to wire rack. Cool
briefly, and serve warm.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

MONITORING JUDGES' CAMPAIGNS FOR HONESTY STIRS FREE SPEECH DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Fla., Ga., Nev., Mich., Ohio S.D., Ill.)  (Eds: Also moving in `a' news file.) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in its history, Alabama's judicial discipline
panel has filed charges against an incumbent justice of the state
Supreme Court. The panel charges that he falsely said in television
advertisements during the campaign for a primary in June that his
opponent ``let convicted drug dealers off'' at least 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   In Pensacola, Fla., a trial judge is facing the possibility of
removal on charges that among other things, she misrepresented an
election opponent when she called him ``Judge Let 'em Go Green.''
</P>
<P>
   When a candidate for a seat on the Georgia Supreme Court ran an
advertisement that said the incumbent ``has called the electric
chair silly,'' disciplinary officials responded by calling the
accusation ``intentionally deceptive.'' The incumbent was actually
a death penalty supporter who had said the electric chair was silly
solely because it was an outmoded and inhumane method of execution.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, judges are being fined, censured and even
threatened with removal for practicing that venerable political
art: exaggerating or outright lying during a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although many applaud the development as a needed antidote to
dishonesty, it is not without its opponents, who say it places
disturbing limitations on the First Amendment's free-speech
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial conduct codes in many states have long required
candidates for the bench to avoid making false or misleading
statements. But those codes were only sporadically applied in the
days when judicial campaigns consisted mostly of polite promises of
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Now judicial campaigns in quite a few of the 40 states that
elect judges have recently become mudslinging matches, complete
with attack advertising. As a result, judicial disciplinary panels
are regularly trying to do something unique in American politics:
forcing candidates to stop calling each other lazy, corrupt or soft
on crime, unless they can prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judicial conduct commissions in every state are more
vigilant about these things than they have been in the past, if for
no other reason than that these horror stories about judicial
elections are hitting the newspapers,'' said James J. Alfini, an
expert on judicial discipline at Northern Illinois University
School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the truthfulness campaigns say that the very
nature of the courts means that they must be more trustworthy than
the other branches of government, and that judicial candidates must
therefore be more principled than candidates for other elected
office.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the integrity drive say it not only limits
candidates' First Amendment right to political expression but also,
in placing boundaries on the character of campaign give-and-take,
threatens to curtail the information that voters need to make
informed choices.
</P>
<P>
   The critics are particularly alarmed because concerns about
judicial campaign abuses have inspired at least six states since
1996 _ Alabama, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio and South Dakota _
to create organizations to monitor judicial elections. Some of
these new bodies are authorized to issue statements during
campaigns informing voters when judicial candidates make false or
misleading claims.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, an older panel, the Judicial Inquiry Commission,
which more typically concerns itself with matters like corruption
on the bench, said last month that before the primary for chief
justice in June, an incumbent on the state Supreme Court, Harold F.
See Jr., falsely accused his opponent, Judge Roy S. Moore, of
leniency toward drug dealers. See, the commission said, ran the
advertisement that carried that accusation ``knowing it would be
deceiving or misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   See, who lost the primary and now faces the possibility of
disqualification from office before the end of his term as an
associate justice, has said he did nothing improper. He is
challenging the constitutionality of Alabama's disciplinary rules
in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Courts in several other states are also considering First
Amendment challenges to the enforcement efforts, and lawyers say
that ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court will most likely be asked to
decide the extent to which states can regulate the speech of
judicial candidates.
</P>
<P>
   One such free-speech case involves the actions of Georgia's new
monitoring panel and the electric-chair-is-silly accusation. A few
days before a 1998 election, the panel issued a statement that said
the accusation, in a television advertisement for George M. Weaver,
a candidate for a seat on the state Supreme Court, was ``unethical,
unfair, false and intentionally deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   The election was won by the incumbent, Leah J. Sears, and Weaver
filed suit against the monitoring body, maintaining that its
members had intentionally ruined his chances.
</P>
<P>
   But Sears said in an interview that it was important that
someone review the claims of judicial candidates, because, she
said, the target of false accusations in a race for the bench
cannot fully respond to them: In addition to the rules forbidding
candidates to mislead voters, Georgia, like most states, has rules
that bar judicial candidates from discussing how they would vote on
issues that might come before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could pretty much say anything,'' Sears said of Weaver,
``and I could not answer. As a judge, I am stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver denied in an interview that he had been trying to trick
voters. He said that his advertisement was true and that in
referring to Sears' calling the electric chair silly, its intent
had been to show that she was an activist willing to comment on
legislative policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the main purpose of his suit, he said, was to establish that
aggressive advertising like his are as much fair game in judicial
politics as in campaigns for other offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't expect that voters are so stupid,'' he said, ``that
they need the government's help to decide what is true or false
political speech.''

</P>
<P>
   About a dozen recent cases around the country suggest that in
many judicial races, few inhibitions remain.
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan judge is facing disciplinary proceedings for implying
that his opponent was fighting a charge of unwanted sexual contact
with a court employee. A disciplinary panel found that the opponent
had never faced that charge.
</P>
<P>
   A Nevada judge ran a television advertisement urging voters to
``re-elect'' him. But as a disciplinary panel noted, he had never
held a seat on the court for which he was campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Such cases involving judges often become pitched battles that
draw in much of the local legal establishment. In Bradenton, Fla.,
a trial judge, Matthew E. McMillan, is in a fight against
disciplinary officials that has become a hometown spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign challenging an incumbent in 1998, McMillan
referred to his opponent, a 16-year veteran, as a part-time judge
in a full-time job, asserting that he had worked in court only 12
hours a week and in one year had taken 86 days off, excluding
weekends and holidays.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan won the election but has been fighting many
disciplinary charges ever since, including a claim by the state's
Judicial Qualifications Commission that he deliberately
misrepresented the hours and days his opponent worked.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan said in an interview that his statements were true and
that his legal problems were punishment by the courthouse
establishment for his defeating an incumbent. Still, on the eve of
a disciplinary trial this winter, he signed an agreement with the
commission that would have entailed a six-month suspension from
office.
</P>
<P>
   In June, however, the Florida Supreme Court rejected the
agreement, sending the case back for a full trial, which could
result in McMillan's outright removal.
</P>
<P>
   Because the trial had initially been scheduled for a time when
his lawyer could not appear, McMillan said during a recent
interview that he had been forced into conceding false claims in
the settlement, which read in part, ``Judge McMillan acknowledged
that he made inaccurate and misleading statements during his
judicial campaign, including specifically statements regarding the
work ethic and sentencing practices of the incumbent judge.''

   WASHINGTON _ Hot on the campaign trail, presidential candidates
George W. Bush and Al Gore are trading accusations and boasts about
U.S. military readiness. So far, at least, what passes for a debate
on this critical issue is more likely to confuse than to inform.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon analysts and defense experts dismiss much of the
rhetoric so far as empty political blather.
</P>
<P>
   It glosses over very real problems inside the military, they
say, and fails to address the central issue of readiness: ready for
what?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an issue neither side has really explored because,
quite frankly, it's not something you can get into in 10 seconds or
less,'' said Andrew Krepinevich, executive director of the
nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Monday to the annual convention of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars, Bush, the Texas governor and Republican nominee, said
that the armed services' recruiting difficulties, spare parts
shortages and other problems ``are signs of a military in decline
and we must do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Vice President Gore returned fire, telling those
attending the convention in Milwaukee that it is ``wrong ... when
others try to run down America's military for political
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who claimed the Democratic nomination last week, told the
VFW convention that ``our military is the strongest and the best in
the entire world. ... I pledge to keep it that way with whatever it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   In common with most analysts, Krepinevich, a retired Army
lieutenant colonel, said the basic strength of U.S. forces is
sound, and that many of the arguments over readiness amount to
fussing over the fine print, ``tiny red flags'' that could signal
significant readiness problems in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin C. Spinney, a senior Pentagon analyst, said the
candidates are ignoring deeper problems than the military's
day-to-day readiness.
</P>
<P>
   One such problem, he said, is that the Pentagon's financial
books are in such disarray that ``we don't have the information to
sort things out.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Spinney said in an interview Tuesday, ``This thing
has become totally politicized. Neither (candidate) has a clue what
to do because the basic information isn't there ... and if they
just throw more money at it, that will make things worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States already spends roughly $300 billion a year on
its military. Adjusted for inflation, that's about what it was
spending at the height of the Cold War in 1980 when U.S. forces
were prepared to fight a global war against the 5 million-man
Soviet armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   That $300 billion a year also is more than the next 10 largest
military powers spend combined, including Russia, China and the
NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that sizable budget goes to a military significantly
smaller than the force that Bush's father commanded a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year, candidate Bush has accused Democrats of squandering
U.S. military power. He has charged that in sheer numbers of
soldiers, jet fighters, combat ships and tank divisions, U.S.
military power has slipped seriously in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   But these reductions were set in motion in 1990 by
then-President Bush and his defense secretary, Dick Cheney, the
younger Bush's running mate. Their rationale is applicable today:
With the Cold War over and the Soviet military shrunken to a shadow
of its one-time power, there is no need for the United States to
maintain a large, standing combat-ready force.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that the U.S. would realize savings from
developments in Europe was popularly referred to as the ``Peace
Dividend.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1990 State of the Union speech, a few months after the
Berlin Wall was torn down, President Bush proposed deep cuts in
U.S. troops based in Europe. Cheney went on to press Congress to
authorize a 25 percent across-the-board cut in U.S. military
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Army Gen. Colin Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff at the time, said the cuts were not only justified because of
the vastly reduced global threat, but were necessary because
Congress would cut even deeper if the administration didn't hold
the line at 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is still no sizable conventional military threat to
the United States, according to recent assessments by the Central
Intelligence Agency and such independent groups as the U.S.
Commission on National Security in the 21st Century, a
Pentagon-chartered panel set up by former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For the immediate future, at least, threats to the United States
will be terrorism, political destabilization, small regional
conflicts such as Kosovo, and perhaps missile attacks against U.S.
or friendly forces and facilities abroad.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, it is difficult to see why the U.S. Army should
maintain at high combat readiness the five tank brigades currently
stationed at Fort Riley, Kan., and Fort Carson, Colo., for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Should war break out in the Persian Gulf region or Korea, these
tanks would eventually arrive by ship, a process that would take
months. Rather than paying to keep these 580 tanks constantly
manned, gassed up and loaded with combat ammo, it might make more
sense for the Army to keep them clean and oiled but idle. It could
afford to take a week to bring them up to full combat readiness.
Meantime that money could be used for other purposes _ say,
research on a new generation of tanks.
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of readiness trade-off, however, might leave the
Army open to criticism that all its tanks are not ``combat ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for example, cited the reported non-readiness of two Army
divisions as one example of what he says is an alarming decline in
military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are signs of a military in decline and we must do
something about it,'' he told the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the Army did report that two of its 10 combat
divisions were not, by Army standards, combat ready. The two
divisions in question, the 10th Mountain Division and the First
Infantry Division, each had one of its three brigades deployed
overseas on peacekeeping missions in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Every unit in those two divisions, down to nine-man squads, was
in fact ready for combat, division officers said. Had war broken
out somewhere, they were ready to go. But Army regulations require
any division with units deployed away from home be reported as not
combat ready.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush vowed that as president he would boost
military spending significantly, including a $1 billion military
pay increase. Previously, Bush has called for increases in spending
on military research and development and investment in a new
generation of high-tech weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   But defense budget analysts believe that anything short of
massive new funding could backfire and actually make readiness
worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the per-unit cost of weapons systems has risen as
fast as or faster than defense budgets. Congress might fund 100
airplanes, for instance, but get only 60 for the money initially
appropriated.
</P>
<P>
   This means that today's weapons cannot be replaced as they wear
out. As a result, Spinney said, the arsenal is getting older and
smaller at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for example, the average Air Force jet fighter is already
14 years old. Many of the F-15s based at Langley Air Force Base in
Virginia, for example, are battered and patched and increasingly
difficult to maintain in flight status.
</P>
<P>
   The F-15, which costs $58.3 million, is due to be replaced by
the F-22, which costs $254.6 million, according to the most recent
Pentagon estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the F-22 program proceeds without any cost overruns or
schedule disruptions _ unlikely, given recent history _ the Air
Force will be unable to replace each F-15 with an F-22. In the
meantime, existing squadrons of F-15s and other fighters will wear
out.
</P>
<P>
   Without enormous increases in the budget for aircraft, or huge
cuts in the size of the tactical fighter force, the average age of
fighters will rise to 20 years in the latter part of this decade,
Spinney said. That means the Air Force may eventually have to keep
some of its fighters in service as long as 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like buying a Spad in 1918 and retiring it in 1960,''
Spinney said. ``This is the worst case, but it is a general pattern
for virtually all our weapons systems. And that's not giving our
boys the best.''
</P>
<P>
   And the cycle can't be broken without a level of defense funding
that would be politically unacceptable _ even to Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's Inspector General's office identified a
compounding problem this spring: the Defense Department's books are
in a mess.
</P>
<P>
   In a report dated February 25, the inspector general said it had
identified a total of $6.9 trillion in data entries in the Pentagon
budget bookkeeping system. Of those, it found $2.3 trillion were
``unsupportable,'' meaning the auditors could find no link between
what Congress authorized and what was actually spent.
</P>
<P>
   The reported said that financial statements for the general
funds of the Army, Navy and Air Force ``were unauditable'' because
of fiscal irregularities and lack of supporting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this boils down to is, Job One is we gotta get better
books,'' said Spinney. ``We just don't have the detailed
information we need to sort out the real choices in readiness.''

   WASHINGTON _ Hot on the campaign trail, presidential candidates
George W. Bush and Al Gore are trading accusations and boasts about
U.S. military readiness. So far, at least, what passes for a debate
on this critical issue is more likely to confuse than to inform.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon analysts and defense experts dismiss much of the
rhetoric so far as empty political blather.
</P>
<P>
   It glosses over very real problems inside the military, they
say, and fails to address the central issue of readiness: ready for
what?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an issue neither side has really explored because,
quite frankly, it's not something you can get into in 10 seconds or
less,'' said Andrew Krepinevich, executive director of the
nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Monday to the annual convention of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars, Bush, the Texas governor and Republican nominee, said
that the armed services' recruiting difficulties, spare parts
shortages and other problems ``are signs of a military in decline
and we must do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Vice President Gore returned fire, telling those
attending the convention in Milwaukee that it is ``wrong ... when
others try to run down America's military for political
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who claimed the Democratic nomination last week, told the
VFW convention that ``our military is the strongest and the best in
the entire world. ... I pledge to keep it that way with whatever it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   In common with most analysts, Krepinevich, a retired Army
lieutenant colonel, said the basic strength of U.S. forces is
sound, and that many of the arguments over readiness amount to
fussing over the fine print, ``tiny red flags'' that could signal
significant readiness problems in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin C. Spinney, a senior Pentagon analyst, said the
candidates are ignoring deeper problems than the military's
day-to-day readiness.
</P>
<P>
   One such problem, he said, is that the Pentagon's financial
books are in such disarray that ``we don't have the information to
sort things out.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Spinney said in an interview Tuesday, ``This thing
has become totally politicized. Neither (candidate) has a clue what
to do because the basic information isn't there ... and if they
just throw more money at it, that will make things worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States already spends roughly $300 billion a year on
its military. Adjusted for inflation, that's about what it was
spending at the height of the Cold War in 1980 when U.S. forces

 &HT;    Georgia town still wrestling with lynching of 85 years ago
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick

<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. - The story of Leo Frank has come home to
Marietta, the town where the Jewish factory superintendent was
lynched 85 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta's Theatre in the Square is producing ``The Lynching of
Leo Frank'' less than two miles from the spot where a mob,
organized and egged on by
</P>
<P>
   many of the town's leading citizens, strung up Frank.
</P>
<P>
   The play, a retelling by Atlantan Robert Myers, ran in Chicago
two years ago to rave
</P>
<P>
   reviews and earlier this year off-off-Broadway, where it did
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mariettans would rather not see the town's most notorious
incident depicted yet again. Despite their protests, however, the
play is more than
</P>
<P>
   an irrelevant rehash, because its exploration of violent
prejudice comes at a time when overt anti-Semitism has resurfaced
in Marietta, again
</P>
<P>
   directed at a local business figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynching'' will play in Marietta through Sept. 24, a date that
won't come too soon for some Mariettans, who would rather not have
the world
</P>
<P>
   reminded that the only lynching of a Jew in U.S. history took
place in their town.
</P>
<P>
   No one was ever charged with Frank's murder, but the ancestors
of
</P>
<P>
   some ''OMs'' - Old Mariettans - are found on lists of suspects
that have been circulating secretly for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see it just go away,'' Charles Brown, an OM who
acknowledges that his grandfather's name, ex-Gov. Joseph Brown,
appears on some of the
</P>
<P>
   lists, says of the play. ``I'm not going to worry about it, as
long as I don't have to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a subject I talk about,'' says Tom Browning, a lawyer
and chairman of the city's Historic Board of Review. ``This was the
past. Is this
</P>
<P>
   blood on the hands of people in Marietta today? No, and it
shouldn't be. It's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson Brown, another Marietta lawyer, is angry that the
Frank case won't die. He blames the press, Hollywood and
``careless'' playwrights for
</P>
<P>
   keeping the story alive.
</P>
<P>
   In brief, that story goes like this: Frank, a Northern Jew, was
convicted on questionable evidence of murdering Mary Phagan, a
13-year-old Mariettan
</P>
<P>
   who worked in the pencil factory he supervised. He was condemned
to die, but Georgia's governor, swayed by protesters who said Frank
had been
</P>
<P>
   railroaded, commuted the sentence to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   many accounts for whipping up anti-Semitism that helped lead to
the lynching.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, counter to most historians' account, maintains that Frank
was killed not because of his ``religious persuasion,'' but because
Jews bribed the sitting
</P>
<P>
   governor to commute Frank's death sentence, an act that outraged
the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The playwright has apparently put out a largely non-factual
presentation of the case,'' he says of ``Lynching,'' not having
seen the play.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how many residents share those feelings, but
obviously not everyone in Marietta or surrounding Cobb County,
which today has a large
</P>
<P>
   Jewish community, is put off by the play. ``Lynching'' opened
last week to a house packed with Theatre subscribers, most of whom
live in the immediate
</P>
<P>
   area.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Lynching'' hasn't generated the overt controversy seen in
the early '90s when the Theatre mounted ``M. Butterfly,'' a play
with gay themes,
</P>
<P>
   and ``Lips Together, Teeth Apart,'' which deals with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Those productions prompted the Cobb County Commission to adopt a
resolution condemning homosexuality. That resolution, never
rescinded, led the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games to pull
planned events of the 1996 Games out of Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynching,'' though, does come at a time when prejudice has
become an issue again in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Cox, a former city councilman and current director of the
Marietta History Museum, fears the play could stir up lingering
anti-Jewish
</P>
<P>
   sentiment, which he contends ``is just a little beneath the
surface anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see anti-Semitism rearing its head today,'' Cox says.
``We make progress, but then this anti-Semitism comes to the fore
again. It's always
</P>
<P>
   been a black eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox cites a controversy involving Philip Goldstein, a Jewish
city councilman and businessman, who has angered some Mariettans
with his plan to
</P>
<P>
   build a condo/office high-rise near the square. At a recent
Historic Board of Review meeting, several people made anti-Semitic
remarks, shouted and
</P>
<P>
   stomped their feet. One man turned to Goldstein's sister and
snarled ``Remember what happened to Leo Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, himself an OM, says ``anti-Semitism is more sophisticated
than it used to be, but it is still here. Phil Goldstein won't talk
about it, but he
</P>
<P>
   gets hate mail. I painted over a swastika in his parking lot
recently. Another was put on his building. I'm appalled by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, whose family owns much of the real estate around the
square, won't comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most buildings in the square are owned by Jews, especially the
Goldsteins,'' Cox says. ``That family came to town basically
selling rags. They have
</P>
<P>
   lived the American dream by hard work. But there's always been a
certain amount of resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Jim Stark is one of Goldstein's fiercest foes on
the high-rise proposal. But, like Cox, he worries that recent
developments are
</P>
<P>
   feeding prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This play and the controversy over Mr. Goldstein are bringing
it all out again, the anti-Semitism,'' Stark says. ``It still
exists. It's like a
</P>
<P>
   genetic code of silence. That's why these people haven't talked
about it all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Months before the play opened, Mariettans were forced to talk
about it, because one list of suspects was published on the
Internet by Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   historian Stephen Goldfarb (leofranklynchers.com). The list
generated headlines around the country and reignited discussions
about Frank in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Stark recently wrote a letter to the Marietta Daily Journal
suggesting that the city and all OMs whose ancestors were involved
in the Frank
</P>
<P>
   lynching apologize publicly.
</P>
<P>
   His letter produced a flurry of replies, some so anti-Semitic
the newspaper wouldn't print them. Some of those published insisted
that Frank was
</P>
<P>
   guilty of murder, despite the view of most historians. One,
signed by Mariettan Justin Trew, asked: ``Which was the greater
crime ? Frank's illegal
</P>
<P>
   execution or his murder of Mary Phagan?''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kirby, editor of the Marietta paper's editorial page, said
only one or two letter writers agreed that the city or the
descendants of lynchers,
</P>
<P>
   should apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta Mayor Ansley Meaders did not return repeated phone
calls seeking comment on the proposal. Brown, Tom Watson's
descendant, says: ``Maybe
</P>
<P>
   the Frank people should apologize for bribing the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Clay, a local lawyer and head of the state Republican
Party, says that modern Mariettans shouldn't have to apologize for
their forebears'
</P>
<P>
   actions, but he does see value in ``Lynching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a fascinating study of character and society,'' he
says. ``The play may be looking at a tragedy unique to this
community, but there is
</P>
<P>
   still a universality about it. We ought never take for granted
that we've conquered this monster of prejudice. To try to keep
alive lessons learned is
</P>
<P>
   important.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer Wells, producing director of Theatre in the Square, says
such sentiments are behind the production of ``Lynching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People see it as an important piece of theater that really can
allow them to look in the mirror and say, 'This shouldn't happen.'
We can benefit
</P>
<P>
   from the message that these injustices and prejudices existed.''
</P>
<P>
   That remembrance is welcomed by many in Cobb's Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you speak of anti-Semitism in the South, Leo Frank comes
up,'' says Eliot Arnovitz, president of the Jewish Federation of
Greater Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of events are never far from our psyches, our
remembrances, just like the Holocaust. We can never forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Steven Lebow, spiritual leader of Temple Kol Emeth in East
Cobb, several years ago helped erect a plaque to Frank on the
ground where the
</P>
<P>
   lynching occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memory is the key to redemption, as one of the great rabbis
said,'' Lebow says. ``It's a religious obligation to remember.''

 &HT;    Fiberworks to announce $60 million equipment purchase
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Powered with local investor cash and riding an
ambitious plan to connect office buildings with high-speed lines,
Fiberworks today will announce a $60 million deal to buy the Nortel
equipment needed to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   That deal, the purchase of optical networking equipment from the
telecom giant, is aimed at a potentially huge part of the market:
the so-called last mile to user desktops.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with metro Atlanta, where Fiberworks plans to install
about 400 miles of lines, the company means to provide ``last
mile'' service in scores of cities.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-employee, Lawrenceville-based company _ which plans to
move its corporate headquarters to Alpharetta _ has been installing
fiber lines around the Southeast, selling their use to a host of
carriers. Fiberworks has seen 100 percent-a-year growth _ from near
zero five years ago to about $6 million now.
</P>
<P>
   Among customers are Enron, Allied Riser Corp. and Urban Media
which, in turn, sell high-speed access to businesses and Internet
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the company looked at studies showing that 70 percent
of the data traffic going in and out of metro Atlanta was generated
by just 10 percent of the area's 19,000 office buildings.
Fiberworks is embarking on a five-year plan to hook fiber to
another thousand of those buildings, which average 75,000 square
feet and 300 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Fiberworks is operating in a crowded field, but Don Smith,
president of Optical Internet at Nortel Networks, dismissed the
industry buzz about a ``bandwidth glut.'' Conventional wisdom has
it that the demand for high-speed services can't keep pace with the
scores of providers installing thousands of miles of high-capacity
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been very rapid ramping increases, massive growth,
year after year,'' said Smith. ``And at the end of the day, it's
about bandwidth _ how much is needed? How much will be used?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the supply of high-speed connections has soared.
</P>
<P>
   Entrenched phone companies like BellSouth, in addition to using
copper wires for digital subscriber lines, have also installed
thousands of miles of fiber, especially in new neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Others like WorldCom, Qwest Communications, Williams and Level 3
are pushing ``the fat pipes,'' fiber that can handle huge amounts
of data. And companies like Winstar and Teligent are selling a
high-speed wireless solution. Meanwhile, cable companies like
Comcast and AT&AMP;T-owned MediaOne are upgrading their networks to
handle high-speed transmissions of phone, data and video.
</P>
<P>
   Fiberworks doesn't share Wall Street nervousness about a crowded
field, said Scott P. Burkholder, president and chief executive
officer of the 5-year-old company. ``The demand for services is
insatiable right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, in the fight for the last mile, fiber is way behind.
Copper goes into every building. Wireless can be quickly deployed.
But while thousands of miles of fiber have been installed through
metro Atlanta and around the United States, most of it is between
cities or through the heart of business districts. Connections
still must pass that last mile over copper. Maximum data rates on
copper are about 1.5 mbps (the installations that are later bought
or leased and resold by big names like Qwest or WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   All those builders and carriers lease to each other even as they
compete. In the cities of the Southeast, the biggest purveyor of
fiber is BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   The company has put down about 68,000 miles of fiber in metro
Atlanta, said Bill Carver, spokesman for BellSouth. While much of
that is ``backbone'' down main streets and through densely
populated areas, more of it all the time connects to customers, he
said. ``There is fiber run into some buildings, and we expect
continued growth in the number of buildings we build fiber to.''
</P>
<P>
   Small fish often feel they can outmaneuver the big ones, of
course. Burkholder acknowledged that BellSouth's resources dwarf
those of the minnows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to wiring, we think of buildings. They think of
states.''

   WEB-CONFERENCING-HARVARD-NEWSLETTERS _ There used to be two
choices when it came to getting people together to discuss or
disseminate information: Send them by plane, train or automobile to
meet in person, or set up an audio conference. Now there's an
alternative: Web conferencing. It's essentially an audio conference
with visuals, and a growing number of companies are finding it a
useful way of holding a meeting. 700 words. By the editorial staff

CONFESSIONS OF A `SURVIVOR' FAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Eds: Minor editing throughout)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can you imagine? A recent supplicant on ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire'' had no idea that the Tagi and Pagong tribes on
``Survivor'' had merged and become the Rattana tribe. True, Rattana
sounds like something from the Martha Stewart Designer Fescue
Collection, but how could someone not know? Was she (A) a part-time
hermit, (B) a cloistered nun, (C) a pop-culture illiterate or (D) a
complete doofus?
</P>
<P>
   None of the above. Turns out she has a life and doesn't watch
``Survivor.'' Such a charming concept.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a life that cost her some serious cash on
``Millionaire.'' Cash that the rest of us nimrods could have put to
good use on, say, a big-screen, plasma-screen, you-screen,
I-screen, we-all-screen home entertainment system _ something to
lend proper gravitas to Wednesday night's mother of all tribal
councils: the season finale of ``Survivor,'' the Borneo chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Or we could have cornered the market on presto logs and built
one honkin' bonfire. As Jeff Probst, the king of khaki, the caliph
of the camp shirt, likes to say, fire represents life on the
island. I figure as long as there's a Duraflame going in my Weber,
I have a life.
</P>
<P>
   What? You were expecting rational thought?
</P>
<P>
   'Scuse me, but I've been listening to Richard Hatch's
pseudo-intellectual bushwa for 12 weeks. I came this close to
offering up novenas so Susan Hawk might be banished from this
planet (and the ones to our immediate left and right, just to be
safe). I considered hiring a few Cuban-Americans still hopped up
over the Elian Gonzalez thing to stage a little insurrection and
have Gretchen Cordy installed as queen of Pulau Tiga.
</P>
<P>
   So don't expect a logical argument, Bunky. My name is John, and
I'm a ``Survivor'' fan. The logic chromosome went tapioca about the
same time the Tagis decided they could do without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' has been the greatest escape since Steve McQueen's
motorcycle ride through the German countryside. And Wednesday's
finale, likely to be watched by more than 30 million Americans with
nothing better to do, is the millennium's first entry in the ``Who
Shot J.R.?'' collection of don't-miss episodes. It's got fire. It's
got suspense. It's got the big payoff.
</P>
<P>
   It's also got wacky characters. People we sorta like, people we
sorta don't, people we'd like Tony Soprano to whack if he's ever
vacationing in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, right. We're not in Borneo anymore, Toto. This whole thing
was filmed months ago, and the ultimate survivor has probably
already spent his/her million dollars at Sylvan Delearning Center,
trying to unremember Richard's naked avoirdupois.
</P>
<P>
   What makes me think Richard isn't the big winner, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. It just can't be. Sure, oil rises to the top, but
come on! Richard seems like the standard slab of USDA Slime who
becomes a consultant because he's a good blatherskite and not much
else. OK, he can catch slimy things on the ocean floor. Whaddya
expect? Slime knows slime.
</P>
<P>
   As for Susan, well, don't get me started. Just because she's a
self-proclaimed redneck doesn't give her permission to be a boor.
And don't give me this twaddle about her being feisty and
independent. She's Richard's lap dog. She gives rednecks a bad
name. And remember: They both lied to Mr. Probst, the fuehrer of
the flame, the bailiff of the ballots, when he asked if there was a
voting alliance in place.
</P>
<P>
   Do we want a toad or his toady taking a chunk of CBS's millions?
(A 30-second commercial on Wednesday's finale cost $600,000.) Do we
want to reward duplicitous behavior? (Sonja Christopher, the first
person voted off the island, says this is her biggest fear.)
</P>
<P>
   I say nay! Let's give it to Rudy Boesch, the ex-Navy guy. He's
not someone I'd want to spend 39 days with, or even 39 minutes. But
at least he's honest. And his laconic performance in last week's
immunity challenge _ ``I dunno, I dunno, I dunno'' _ was the
highlight of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if Rudy wins, CBS will be able to say it hasn't
abandoned its core audience of viewers older than 50 who are a tad
uncomfortable among homosexuals. What a coup that would be. While
celebrating the victory of a homophobic septuagenarian, the network
would have a whole new bloc of younger viewers absolutely atingle,
practicing for ``Survivor II'' by noshing on the flora and fauna in
their crisper drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the next ``Survivor,'' which will take place in
the Australia bush and debut after the Super Bowl on Jan. 28, may
not be as much fun as the first, or even as much fun as
Australian-rules football. You can bet your last Sacajawea that
everyone will be forming factions from the get-go, which should
make ``Survivor II'' seem pretty much like another day at the
office. At least Wednesday night's final four has one semilikable
person in it: the waffly Kelly Wiglesworth. Come next winter, the
final four will look like everyone you never liked in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Nosirree, Bob. There may never be anything to match the
unbridled goofiness of this first ``Survivor.'' It was new. It was
different. And if you'll allow me to go all existential on you
here, it was the perfect exercise in determining what's right and
what's wrong in a universe with no rules. It was a soap opera with
people who don't look like soap stars. They didn't even have soap.
And don't think for a minute that producer Mark Burnett, the new
golden boy of television, hasn't been manipulating us like a bunch
of soap fans by carefully choosing which footage to use on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, ``Survivor'' is like good junk food, the stuff you
know you shouldn't eat but still consume on special occasions: the
milkshakes at Dick's, the french fries at McDonald's, the hot dogs
at Costco. They won't kill you if you only eat them now and then.
Like, say, once a week.
</P>
<P>
   That's where ABC went wrong with ``Millioniare,'' and CBS with
``Big Brother.'' They're on way too often. That sort of diet will
inevitably take you down. Indeed, Wednesday's two-hour finale of
``Survivor'' plus an hourlong ``town meeting'' with Bryant Gumbel
and the complete cast at 10, could cause some serious bloating.
</P>
<P>
   But we ``Survivor'' survivors can handle it. Just toss a few
more larvae on the barbie, would you?

<P>
   Managers used to have only two choices when it came to getting
employees from distant locations together to discuss information:
Send them by plane, train or automobile to meet in person, or set
up an audio conference.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's another alternative. A Web conference _ essentially
an audio conference with visuals _ enables managers to communicate
visual information to a group and yet never ask them to leave their
offices.
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS
</P>
<P>
   To launch a Web conference, the manager who's organizing it just
asks interested parties to log onto a URL. at the same time,
participants dial into an audio conference. (Putting out both audio
and visual information simultaneously on computers is possible but
still considerably more primitive and unreliable.)
</P>
<P>
   What the participants see is a screen that the meeting
coordinator controls. He or she can present visual information in
any format, from streaming video to PowerPoint slides to notes in
Word. Other optional features include chat lines, group white
boards and note-taking devices.
</P>
<P>
   As with any relatively new technology, there are glitches. First
is the Web itself. It can go down at the user end, be maddeningly
slow or annoy users with its sometimes sophomoric interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Web conferencing technology is still imperfect. The more
complicated the visuals, the slower and jerkier they can appear.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, to be successful in this new genre, the meeting
organizer must coordinate the smooth delivery of the visuals with a
successful audio conference. Either one of these tasks can be
daunting for the average stressed-out businessperson. Doing both at
once may be beyond the grasp of many.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these hazards, the use of Web conferencing is
spreading rapidly. For example, brokerage houses are beginning to
use it to hold analysts' briefings.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a quarterly basis, they used to do a teleconference and now
they'll do a Web-based meeting. The presenter will send out a slide
show and the audio to maybe 300 to 400 analysts and investors
around the country,'' says Mike Archer, president of PresentPLUS, a
Web conferencing company based in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those people will not interact very much,'' Archer adds.
``They won't use any of the interactive tools that are available
even in a Java (Web) format. It's one-way communication.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other companies are beginning to do training with
smaller groups of employees using Web conferencing with interactive
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Web conferencing is so inexpensive,'' Archer says,
``Hewlett-Packard and Rockwell Automation both do training shows
twice a month. That way, even though the information is not
terribly critical, they can get it out quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Reed Hoke III, publisher of Direct Marketing, identifies
another use for Web conferencing: ``The small businesses that I
deal with belong to direct marketing clubs that sponsor regional
meetings with phenomenal speakers,'' he says. ``But people can't
get there. This technology is going to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales presentations similarly become much more cost-effective
when delivered over the Web, if only because salespeople can reach
many more customers without leaving the office. It remains an open
question as to how many new customers can be brought in using the
relatively impersonal Web format, but the Web can be used to
communicate regularly with well-established customers.
</P>
<P>
   The economics are often compelling. For somewhere around $5,000
per site per hour-long event, companies can set up fully
interactive rooms for their employees to hear the latest strategic
thinking or fiscal year plans.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive Web conferencing may never completely replace the
dynamics of a face-to-face meeting. The technology is still in its
adolescence and has its awkward moments. Links go down, screens are
small, the video can be blurry depending on the available bandwidth
and the quality of the equipment. Moreover, we humans are animals,
and we learn to trust each other by getting physically close
together.
</P>
<P>
   But after contemplating the time or expense involved in yet
another round of travel to distant places for a meeting with work
colleagues, remember that there is an alternative to the meeting
... and it's virtual.

<TEXT>
<P>
   At most companies, giving or getting a performance appraisal has
all the appeal of a trip to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers often loathe doing appraisals. If they thought they
could get away with it, they'd skip the repulsive chore entirely,''
observes a new study of best-practice performance management by the
American Productivity &AMP; Quality Center, or APQC, in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies are finding ways to abolish formal these
unpopular evaluations. Even so, most organizations grit their teeth
and plow ahead, if only because they feel a need for some way of
assessing employees' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants the results and outputs that a reliable
performance appraisal system can deliver,'' APQC says.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is changing on the appraisal front. In the past,
performance appraisals were often treated as a charade in which
employees, like the children of Lake Wobegon, were all rated above
average.
</P>
<P>
   No more. According to the APQC, best-practice companies now
believe that ``too few employees are terminated each year for poor
performance,'' and so are focusing their performance-management
systems specifically on weeding out noncontributors. These
companies are also beginning to single out star performers for pay
increases and other rewards not available to the majority of
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, performance-appraisal systems are now likely to
have teeth _ and employees are increasingly likely to be graded and
ranked like students in high school.
</P>
<P>
   This development presents managers with a dilemma, and not just
because assessing job performance is harder than grading answers on
a math test. The most successful work environments are those in
which people feel a sense of teamwork _ ``we're all in this
together'' _ and do whatever is required at the moment rather than
sticking to rigid job descriptions. Stratification and rankings
don't exactly encourage this collaborative attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the fear of losing your job because you're rated in
the bottom tenth. If politics creeps into the rankings _ and it may
_ the resentment will fester like mold on last week's vanilla
pudding.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a manager to do? One solution is to work with the
company's human resources department to ensure that the appraisal
system is perceived as fair.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the APQC says, many companies actively solicit
employee involvement in shaping the system, and then make a point
of surveying employees to assess its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A second solution: Make sure the employees' performance reviews
focus on variables within their control. People are responsible for
their attitudes and work habits. They can't be held accountable for
performance problems caused by poor training, inadequate equipment
or conflicting instructions from management.
</P>
<P>
   Putting teeth in performance appraisals won't necessarily make
them more popular. So long as they're perceived as fair, though, it
may make them more effective.

 FROM: HARVARD MANAGEMENT UPDATE  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At most companies, giving or getting a performance appraisal has
all the appeal of a trip to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers often loathe doing appraisals. If they thought they
could get away with it, they'd skip the repulsive chore entirely,''
observes a new study of best-practice performance management by the
American Productivity &AMP; Quality Center, or APQC, in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies are finding ways to abolish formal these
unpopular evaluations. Even so, most organizations grit their teeth
and plow ahead, if only because they feel a need for some way of
assessing employees' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants the results and outputs that a reliable
performance appraisal system can deliver,'' APQC says.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is changing on the appraisal front. In the past,
performance appraisals were often treated as a charade in which
employees, like the children of Lake Wobegon, were all rated above
average.
</P>
<P>
   No more. According to the APQC, best-practice companies now
believe that ``too few employees are terminated each year for poor
performance,'' and so are focusing their performance-management
systems specifically on weeding out noncontributors. These
companies are also beginning to single out star performers for pay
increases and other rewards not available to the majority of
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, performance-appraisal systems are now likely to
have teeth _ and employees are increasingly likely to be graded and
ranked like students in high school.
</P>
<P>
   This development presents managers with a dilemma, and not just
because assessing job performance is harder than grading answers on
a math test. The most successful work environments are those in
which people feel a sense of teamwork _ ``we're all in this
together'' _ and do whatever is required at the moment rather than
sticking to rigid job descriptions. Stratification and rankings
don't exactly encourage this collaborative attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the fear of losing your job because you're rated in
the bottom tenth. If politics creeps into the rankings _ and it may
_ the resentment will fester like mold on last week's vanilla
pudding.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a manager to do? One solution is to work with the
company's human resources department to ensure that the appraisal
system is perceived as fair.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the APQC says, many companies actively solicit
employee involvement in shaping the system, and then make a point
of surveying employees to assess its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A second solution: Make sure the employees' performance reviews
focus on variables within their control. People are responsible for
their attitudes and work habits. They can't be held accountable for
performance problems caused by poor training, inadequate equipment
or conflicting instructions from management.
</P>
<P>
   Putting teeth in performance appraisals won't necessarily make
them more popular. So long as they're perceived as fair, though, it
may make them more effective.

   LATIN-AMERICA-INTERNET (Undated) _ Starmedia, one of the biggest
and most successful Internet companies in Latin America, has branch
offices in seven countries and millions of subscribers throughout
the region. But its headquarters are in New York. Its $450 million
in funding came from investors in the United States. Its stock is
listed on the Nasdaq but not on any exchange in Latin America. The
Internet revolution has definitely come to Latin America. But
whether the businesses and jobs spawned by that revolution have
helped the region begin to wean itself from economic dependence on
the United States and other outsiders is considered a matter of
debate. By Anthony DePalma.

tight and wireless technology continue to expand. By Sana Siwolop.

   BUSH (St. Louis, Ill.) _ Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday moved to
defend his sweeping tax cut proposal as both responsible and easily
affordable in light of federal surplus projections, tossing around
figures to show that his budget plan would not require any slashing
of government spending. ``I've got to do a better job of making it
clear,'' Bush told reporters in a surprising admission aboard his
campaign plane. The remark came just one day after Vice President
Al Gore, suddenly resurgent in the polls, detailed his own
suggested tax cuts, which were less than half the size of the Texas
governor's. By Frank Bruni.

   CAMPAIGN-MILITARY (Washington) _ Ever since President Clinton
appointed him in 1996 as the only Republican in a Democratic
Cabinet, Secretary of Defense William Cohen has often claimed he
represents the bipartisanship needed to manage matters of national
security. Now Cohen is at the center of a highly partisan debate
over the state of the American military. And the debate has left
him in a highly unusual position: defending the administration, on
one hand, while at least indirectly underscoring some of the
Republican criticisms leveled against it. By Steven Lee Myers.

   JUDGES-CAMPAIGNS (Undated) _ Alabama's judicial discipline panel
has filed charges against an incumbent justice of the state Supreme
Court, charging he falsely said in TV ads during the primary
campaign that his opponent ``let convicted drug dealers off'' at
least 40 times. Judicial campaigns in quite a few of the 40 states
that elect judges have recently become mudslinging matches. As a
result, judicial disciplinary panels are regularly trying to do
something unique in American politics: forcing candidates to stop
calling each other lazy, corrupt or soft on crime, unless they can
prove it. Across the country, judges are being fined, censured and
even threatened with removal for practicing that venerable
political art: exaggerating or outright lying during a campaign. By
William Glaberson.

   MITSUBISHI-SAFETY (Tokyo) _ The Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
acknowledged that it had systematically concealed customer
complaints about tens of thousands of defective automobiles over
the last three decades. The admission by Mitsubishi, Japan's No. 4
automaker, came a month after its top executive had denied
allegations that it had covered up repeated instances of problems
that included faulty gas tanks, gas caps, clutches, crankshafts and
brakes. As part of the admission, the company announced recalls
based on defects found in 88,000 cars and trucks, adding to a
recall of 532,000 vehicles announced last month. The recalls
include 50,000 vehicles exported to the United States. By Miki
Tanikawa.

<P>
   NY-CHARTER-SCHOOL (New York) _ While most political debate over
education involves tweaking existing programs, charter schools
present a chance for teachers, parents, management companies and
bright young idealists to sit around a blank blackboard and imagine
a school from scratch. Charter schools, which get public funds but
are run without regulation from the local school district, have
been embraced by conservatives and liberals alike as an outlet for
innovation, what many see as the most dynamic and important
education reform movement in decades. Times reporter Jodi Wilgoren
looks at the opening of one such school in New York, Bronx
Preparatory, one of 380 new charter schools opening across the
country this fall. (1500 words)

TAKING THE TEST NYC TEACHERS MUST TAKE _ AND PASS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was pouring rain and I was seriously sleep-deprived the
morning I took the Liberal Arts and Sciences Test, New York state's
main certification exam for teachers. I had signed up for the
four-hour test on a whim, but when my alarm clock blared at 6:45
a.m. on July 15 _ a Saturday, no less _ I rued my bright idea.
</P>
<P>
   I was not looking to switch careers. As an education reporter
covering New York City schools, I had grown curious about the test,
which I had written about several times in my first year on the
beat. In one front-page story, I had reported that nearly a third
of the city's teachers had failed the certification exam at least
once. Yet several experienced teachers had told me the test was
ridiculously easy.
</P>
<P>
   I yearned for the truth. So on that rain-soaked morning, I
dragged myself to Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn to see
for myself. For the record, I had not taken a standardized test
since 1986, as a high school senior hoping to boost my College
Board scores.
</P>
<P>
   At Murrow, I waited in line behind hundreds of other New Yorkers
anxious to prove they were fit to teach. Some, I knew from my
reporting, had failed the test repeatedly yet were still working as
uncertified teachers, the kind the state is pressuring the city to
get rid of.
</P>
<P>
   But at least they came prepared. Everybody but me, it seemed,
had a fistful of sharpened No. 2 pencils. I had just one, which I
unearthed in a frantic search of my apartment the night before.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only way I was poorly prepared. While others
spent weeks poring over test prep manuals, I took a single practice
exam. The questions had rattled me. You needed to remember the five
pillars of Islam, understand osmosis and know whether barbed wire
was invented before the telephone, to name a few. The math was so
beyond me that I skipped five questions altogether; it harked back
to trigonometry class, which I had not thought about since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Arts and Sciences Test is the most general of three
exams that teacher candidates have to pass to get a state teaching
license. It supposedly measures your knowledge of basic math and
science, history and the arts and humanities. It also asks you to
read and answer questions about literary passages and newspaper
articles, makes sure your grammar is correct and tests your writing
skills with an essay assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. As it turned out, though, the real thing was
considerably less taxing than my practice test. The exam was
tedious and long, with 80 multiple-choice questions plus the essay,
and more than a little frustrating. I can't reveal the actual
questions, because the state asked me not to. But I will say that
some questions _ especially those that asked me to interpret works
of art or literary passages _ seemed to have more than one right
answer. On others, I was convinced that none of the supplied
answers was right.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the math was much more manageable than I expected.
You basically had to know how to multiply, divide, read graphs and
do simple algebra equations. Determining the original price of a
sale item given the rate of discount, for example. Or calculating
someone's wages based on a sales commission.
</P>
<P>
   I also breezed through the section testing communications
skills. Analyzing newspaper excerpts, weighing objectivity,
interpreting figurative language and identifying grammatical and
structural errors came easily. But by the time I got to the essay
section, I was thoroughly burned out and my pencil was worn to the
nub. Moreover, the assignment _ to opine on whether the rich should
be taxed at a higher rate than the poor _ made my eyes glaze over.
</P>
<P>
   I ignored the test booklet's instructions to carefully outline
my essay on scrap paper first. I just started writing, breathlessly
making the case for a higher tax rate as if I was dashing off a
newspaper article on a crushing deadline. Afterward I sped home for
a long nap, and put the rather dismal experience out of my head
until my scores arrived in the mail this week.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: I passed, with a scaled score of 284 out of a
possible 300. (You need at least a 220.) But on closer examination,
my results made little sense. I got a perfect score, 300, on the
science and math section _ bizarre, considering that I failed out
of pre-calculus in high school and never took another science
course after 10th-grade chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I am mortified to report that my worst score _ a 260
_ was on the essay.
</P>
<P>
   What all this says about the state certification exam, I'm not
sure. If my experience is any indication, it's not the best measure
of someone's academic strengths and weaknesses. And, as with all
standardized tests, your performance might depend more on your
state of mind the day you take it than on your intellectual
prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not a bad idea to make sure teachers can figure
percentages, form a scientific hypothesis, recognize symbolism in a
a short story and, yes, write a well-organized essay. If I were in
charge of the test, I'd probably make it a little tougher _ there's
just no excuse for someone like me to get a perfect score in math.
</P>
<P>
   But that could prove disastrous. Of the 4,315 people who took
the exam on July 15 in New York City, a whopping 41 percent failed,
according to the state. That compares with a 26 percent failure
rate for the 3,170 people who took the test elsewhere in the state.
Although it is not perfect, the exam seems a necessary gatekeeping
device for a profession whose purpose, after all, is imparting
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   I approve, and hope that I never have to take it again.

COMMENTARY: COUNTING CHICKENS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick quiz: How big is the federal budget surplus? I don't mean
those projections of a surplus of $2 trillion or more over the next
decade _ projections that have turned the election into a
referendum on what to do with the windfall. How big is this year's
budget surplus?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guess what _ it's not very big. The ``on-budget'' surplus for
fiscal 2000, which excludes Social Security (as both parties agree
we should), will be about $60 billion. Most of that $60 billion,
however, shouldn't be on-budget, because it represents the
surpluses of the Medicare and federal pension trust funds _ both of
which are, like Social Security, accumulating reserves for our
geriatric future. The true surplus right now is around $20
billion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So our political debate is based on projections saying that in
the years ahead the federal government will run average annual
surpluses about 10 times as big as this year's actual surplus.
Doesn't that sound a bit like counting your chickens before they've
hatched? Wouldn't you at least want to take a very careful look at
the eggs? A new analysis by Alan Auerbach and William Gale (of
Berkeley and Brookings respectively) does just that. And its
conclusion _ that those projections are unreasonable, that the huge
future surpluses we've been taking for granted are figments of our
imagination _ is already ruffling feathers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their first point is that if you put Medicare and federal
pensions into the ``lock box'' along with Social Security _ and
what politician would admit that he plans to raid those funds? _
you immediately slice $800 billion off those future surpluses.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That still leaves a pretty big projected surplus. What drives
that projection, however, is the assumption by the Congressional
Budget Office that ``discretionary'' spending _ spending that,
unlike Social Security, Medicare, or interest on the debt, is not
mandated by existing law - will stay at current levels for the next
decade. If spending stays constant while a growing economy
increases tax receipts, the eventual result will indeed be a big
budget surplus.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But while congressional budgeters are obliged to pretend to
believe what congressmen say, the truth is that demands for
government services grow with the economy: more air traffic to
control, more homes to protect from forest fires. I know, I know _
you're going to insist that the government is too big as is. Let's
roll back discretionary spending, now a bloated 6 percent of GDP,
back to what it was in 1960, when it was only ... actually, it was
about 12 percent of GDP. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   True, most of that was defense spending. In fact, half of
discretionary spending still goes for defense. That means that
given the clamor for a stronger military, it will be all the harder
to hold overall spending constant. By the way, non-military
discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP is now at its lowest
level since 1962. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So the realistic projection is that discretionary spending will
grow at least as fast as GDP. Indeed, if we're going to have a
military buildup, keeping discretionary spending from growing
faster than GDP will require substantial cuts in government
services.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that discretionary spending does grow with the economy,
the Auerbach-Gale paper projects a surplus over the next decade of
only around $350 billion _ not even enough to make room for Al
Gore's tax cuts, let alone Bush's. (Bush's cuts would produce a
trillion-dollar deficit.) And that's assuming that nothing goes
wrong _ no recession, no military emergency. They go on to argue
that if you take account of the demands on federal funds that will
come when baby boomers retire, we are actually in long-term
deficit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Press the advocates of huge tax cuts about all this, and it
turns out they have another argument up their sleeves: that the
U.S. economy is going to grow even faster than the Congressional
Budget Office projects, so there will be another couple of trillion
dollars to play with. Maybe _ but now we're counting chickens
before the eggs have even been laid.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most likely prospect is that those big surpluses won't
materialize. And when the chickens that didn't hatch come home to
roost, we will rue the days when, misled by sloppy accounting and
rosy scenarios, we gave away the national nest egg.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday will be more humid than recent days in the Northeast
as breezes from the southwest increase ahead of a cold front.
Sunshine will fade behind increasing afternoon clouds in coastal
areas. Clouds and a broken band of showers and thunderstorms will
prevail from northern New England to the Ohio Valley. The showers
will shift to the Northeast and Middle Atlantic coasts Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Hot weather will linger from the southern and central Plains to
the interior Southeast. Scattered thunderstorms will erupt near the
coast of the Gulf of Mexico, especially from northeastern Texas to
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West will be hot. Moist air at 10,000 feet will
promote numerous afternoon thundershowers from southeastern
California to the central and southern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SUPER STORM
</P>
<P>
   Super Typhoon Bilis hit the southeast coast of Taiwan on
Wednesday with central winds estimated at 160 mph. Typhoon is the
name given to hurricanes that form over the western Pacific, where
the warm waters typically produce more frequent and powerful storms
than than their Atlantic counterparts. A typhoon or hurricane is
called ``super'' once its wind speeds exceed 150 mph. In the
Atlantic, Hurricane Debby is expected to stay off the north coast
of Hispaniola Wednesday as it moves west-northwest.

CZECH PRESIDENT ASKS DEVELOPMENT GROUPS TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ President Vaclav Havel of the Czech
Republic, the host next month of the annual autumn meeting of the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund, said Tuesday that
international development organizations ``should listen more to the
voices of the people'' for whom they fashion programs, showing more
respect for local cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Issues of poverty and housing ``must be solved taking into
account the human dimension, and not just the interests of
investors,'' Havel said in an interview with a small group of
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, too, he said, ``should do everything to make
people see it as their own organization, representing everyone, not
as some sort of club of governments and diplomats.''
</P>
<P>
   Havel will travel to the United States to attend the millennial
summit meeting of the United Nations early next month. As an
institution, he said, ``it should have more power and a smaller
bureaucracy.'' Then he laughed. ``Anyone with experience of power
knows one of Parkinson's famous laws,'' he added, ``and when two
people on my staff say they need a third, soon there's a fourth and
a fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund and bank meetings here, from Sept. 19 to Sept. 28, have
become a target for groups opposed to globalization and
multinational capital.
</P>
<P>
   Havel said he welcomes the debate, but hopes it can be a
philosophical and substantive one, without violence in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization by itself is ``morally neutral,'' Havel said. ``It
can be good or bad, depending on the kind of content we give to
it.'' He cited the spread of information about human rights as a
good use of globalization. As a negative, he cited ``the spread of
silly sitcoms or even more stupid commercials,'' which give a false
picture of human life.
</P>
<P>
   ``These commercials say a lot,'' he said. ``A handsome man with
a great tan and strong muscles is running on a beautiful beach with
blue sky in the background. A beautiful girl is running toward him
and they are happy because they just ate some vitamin or drank some
beverage. The stupidity of this world, which is offered to us as
human happiness, should be analyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   Casually dressed in tan jeans and an open shirt, Havel, 63,
looked fit after a vacation in Portugal, where he bought a summer
residence where he will spend time after he leaves office in 2003.
An hour before the interview, sirens went off throughout Prague in
memory of the 72 people who died when the Soviet Union invaded
Czechoslovakia 32 years ago on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Havel urged the news media to pay more attention to the
substance of the debate about the fund and the bank and less to
security aspects of the meeting. And he urged his countrymen to
have a more worldly and sophisticated vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great privilege for this country to have the meeting
here,'' he said. It is a chance for the Czech Republic to show
itself to others, 11 years after the fall of communism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   People ``often forget what it looked like here before the fall
of communism,'' he said. ``How gray life was, how gray streets
were, how the sign for a fruit shop was the same all over the
country.'' But now, ``every little shop has a different facade, and
we are renewing a lot of local tradition.'' That, he said, was also
a kind of answer to globalization and to ``this unifying pressure
of the dictatorship of consumption and commercials and those
supermarkets that are destroying the city suburbs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Havel addressed a local controversy that has had
international attention. Last month, Pavel Dostal, the Czech
culture minister, wrote an article that appeared to ridicule the
concerns of Orthodox Jews over a 13th-century Jewish cemetery
discovered in downtown Prague during excavations to rebuild an
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   With local Jewish leaders, the government worked out a plan to
encase the remnants of the cemetery in concrete, while allowing the
company to build both below and above it. But the plan has been
criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know why the Prague Jews imagine dance or theater
must be specifically excluded above the skeletal remains that their
ancestors sold,'' Dostal's article said. ``But even if so, it is
strange that it did not bother the Prague Jewish community for 522
years that such things happened above the destroyed cemetery _ not
until now. It's like the doctor showing up after the funeral, after
the funeral more than half a millennium ago.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Havel said: ``Of course I cannot bear responsibility
for all the clever or pseudo-clever comments of any of the
individual ministers. The important thing for me is that this
government has the will to seek a solution.'' Asked if he expects
demonstrations in New York on the cemetery issue, Havel said he
would not mind. ``On the contrary, I would personally approach the
demonstrators and ask them what it is they want or in what way they
consider the Czech Republic's approach unsatisfactory.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NEW DEAL, SOME DEAL, ANY DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Madison Square Garden is rocking for the finals. The
plucky old warrior leads the team onto the court, pumping a fist,
making eye contact with the fans, letting everybody know, hey,
we're in this together. This time we go all the way! It's a
veritable lovefest.
</P>
<P>
   That's Teresa Weatherspoon we're talking about, doctor. You were
thinking maybe Patrick Ewing?
</P>
<P>
   It is definitely hoops time. The Liberty take on the Comets
Thursday night, and maybe Spoon will unleash one from halfcourt,
the way she did last year in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting caught up in the Liberty's quest for a
championship, however, New York is obsessing upon the melancholy
saga of Patrick Ewing. The Knicks cannot keep him. It has gone too
far. The complicated four-way deal collapsed for reasons that
should not preclude another deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons got cold feet about looking like scavengers at a
yard sale? It does seem rather larcenous to charge National
Basketball Association prices for a collection of anonymities, but
that's how things are done these days.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will keep the Knicks from cutting Patrick loose,
and vice versa. You could hear the frenzy Tuesday, like a million
beavers chomping on a million logs, as Dave Checketts and Scott
Layden tried to cook up a new deal. It would be even sadder if
there were real regret on either side, but Patrick never much
warmed up to New York, and New York never much warmed up to
Patrick. That is to say, he was no Melvin Mora.
</P>
<P>
   The nice people in New York are the ones saying kind things
about Patrick, how hard he sweated, how many points he scored, how
close he came. They are good fans, good people, may their numbers
increase.
</P>
<P>
   They stuck with Ewing when the ball popped out of his undersized
hands. They cheered him when he missed a foul shot in the final
minute. They shrugged off his lack of imagination on and off the
court. They remember the hundreds of great nights when he won big
games for them, and the joint was rocking.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to win a championship here. That stuff is
overdone. Lots of great players _ and great people _ don't win
championships. Don Mattingly went down slashing in his one and only
playoff series in 1995. So what? Ernie Banks and Sammy Sosa have
zero World Series between them. So what?
</P>
<P>
   For Ewing, the dissatisfaction had nothing to do with rings. He
was aloof when he came to New York and he is leaving aloof.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to Ewing, he had been through a lot before he ever
got to New York. He was an immigrant from Jamaica who heard ugly
jibes when he started playing in Boston, and at Georgetown he could
not miss the racism in banners that said ``Ewing You Can't Read
This'' when he played at other Big East schools.
</P>
<P>
   He was fortunate to have a father figure in John Thompson, but
he may have held on to the Paranoia for Freshmen much longer than
even Thompson would have wanted. Ewing usually reacted as if the
world was against him, which is perfectly understandable, but he
could never master the graceful gesture. Too many people have told
stories about Ewing refusing to sign autographs in hospitals or at
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never sign on game day,'' he would say _ a charming way to
be remembered by people who had random encounters with him.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said athletes must be grateful, but they do run the risk
of being judged. Ewing was given a whopping new contract a few
years ago. He was a poor choice to lead the players during the
labor troubles. He couldn't keep in shape during the lockout. In
the executive suites at the Garden they were bad-mouthing him
big-time, and it never got better.
</P>
<P>
   There is a debate about whether Ewing held back the Knicks, but
that is splitting hairs. When he asked for another extension of his
contract, all of a sudden you could hear the Garden people saying,
``Do we have to keep him? For what?'' That's just the way it works.
John Thompson surely explained it to him many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers need not beat themselves up over chasing Ewing away.
(Did you really think New Yorkers would beat themselves up over
anything?) Too many cool people, young and old, have come to New
York and gotten it, including, most recently, Teresa Weatherspoon.
Check out the energy when Spoon leads the Liberty onto the court
Thursday night. It was that way in Patrick Ewing's seasons, but now
it will never happen again for him, at least in this town.

 &HT;    Japanese Internet phone technology a fit with the U.S.?
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Japan could be the future of wireless, or then again,
maybe it's just an interesting sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic and consumer culture that mass-marketed Pokemon,
Walkman and the videocassette recorder to the world has also
embraced some things _ minidisc players, high-definition
television, bullet trains _ that have not exactly caught fire in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So what to make of how Japan has taken to the i-mode Internet
phone from NTT DoCoMo? What are the chances of metro Atlanta seeing
something like it _ and would it become as universally loved here
as it is in Japan?
</P>
<P>
   NTT DoCoMo certainly seems to want to bring its technology
stateside _ it is reportedly in talks to make a major investment in
a joint wireless venture being formed by BellSouth and SBC.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Net phones have not taken America by storm.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless Net service offered by phone carriers in the United
States is generally slow, limited and costly _ a sad experience
compared to the Internet experienced by users from their desktops.
Wireless in this country is at least a year behind Europe, which is
as far behind Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But in Japan, where i-mode is king, 10 million users have signed
up since early last year. They send e-mail. They check train
schedules, the weather forecast and movie listings. They read
newspapers, play games, make airplane reservations, transact
banking business and have their fortunes told.
</P>
<P>
   And they are paying billions of dollars to NTT DoCoMo for the
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, unlike in the United States, home computers are
not common in Japan, where only about 13 percent of homes are wired
to the Internet via a desktop machine. For most people there, the
i-mode offered their first e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   For another, it's remarkably easy to use the i-mode from a
financial point of view. A user may pay a Web site a subscription
fee _ say $1 a month to have access to weather predictions or for
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Those fees appear on the user's monthly bill from NTT DoCoMo, as
do bills for purchases from Web sites that have deals with NTT
DoCoMo.
</P>
<P>
   NTT DoCoMo takes a cut _ 9 percent _ from all those transactions
and charges the user based on how many packets of data he or she
transmits.
</P>
<P>
   NTT DoCoMo has deals with scores of Web sites whose names appear
on the phone screen. Using the list, a user need only punch a
button to be connected. You can get to other sites, but it's not so
easy. And fees from those sites are billed separately.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that's the key. When the Americans mimic that
model, there will be similar enthusiasm, they say.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., however, there are other ways to weave the wireless
Net into consumer lives, such as the Palm Pilot, and the nearly
ubiquitous desktop.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in countries may mean that the i-mode culture
won't translate across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Without desktop monitors to compare it to, the Japanese do not
find viewing the Internet on a tiny screen so inherently
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   And Japan also has a longstanding culture of Gameboys and other
hand-held computer games. It has long workdays and long commutes in
which employees strain to find a way to use their time _ and the
stylishly designed i-mode fits right in.
</P>
<P>
   And Japanese have also long suffered with a sluggish banking
system. The i-mode made transactions possible anytime from
anywhere. Hundreds of the DoCoMo-approved sites are banks.
</P>
<P>
   The people might have ended up playing games and hitting the
Web, but they started off paying their bills, said Carlton Hill,
director of Internet initiatives for BellSouth Wireless. ``I
believe they bought the i-mode to answer a true practical need in
their lives. That is something that is unique to Japan,'' he said.

FED STANDS PAT ON INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board, showing greater confidence that the
economy has begun to slow, have decided not to raise interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   After a yearlong campaign in which rates were boosted by a total
1.75 percent in an attempt to cool an overheated economy and
prevent a spiraling in inflation, Fed members voted Tuesday to
stand pat, instead letting their prior rate hikes do their work and
letting the economy run its course.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second meeting at which the Fed left the federal
funds rate unchanged at 6.5 percent, a level first set in May.
</P>
<P>
   Fed watchers said the board's statement, which accompanies each
decision, was more upbeat about the prospects for a slowdown than
was its last statement, after its June 28 meeting. The Fed said
that growth ``is moderating'' toward a more reasonable pace. In
June, the Fed had said growth ``may be moderating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The message (sent by the Fed) is we're headed in the right
direction _ toward an end to the tightening,'' said Allen Sinai,
president of Primark Decision Economics in Boston. ``But we're not
quite there.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, there was no use of the word ``slowdown,'' and
board members remained concerned about the potential for inflation
if the economic growth were to resume its torrid, early-year pace.
The Fed said the ``risks'' of inflation have not been removed yet,
and they adopted a bias toward future rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed is not expected to raise rates at its next meeting,
scheduled for Oct. 3, analysts said. Some economists, looking to
the presidential election in November, said the central bankers
would not take any action that would open them to charges of being
political. Others argued the Fed would abstain because it would not
yet have enough new data by then to make an informed decision.
</P>
<P>
   David Kresge, senior vice president of PrimeStreet.com, a Boston
company that matches small businesses to lenders, said the inaction
confirmed that Fed policy over the past year appears to be a
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are moderating about as well as the Fed could've
hoped,'' Kresge said, ``yet the economy isn't tightening up
abruptly'' and falling into recession, which often is a risk of
aggressive Fed interest-rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's decision was no surprise to those familiar with the
testimony given by Alan Greenspan in a July 20 speech to Congress.
The Fed chairman said he was encouraged by a possible
``acceleration'' in worker productivity, which tends to temper
inflationary pressures. He also said a ``flattening in equity
prices'' and a rise in consumer debt were dampening consumer
spending and a fall in housing starts would cut into demand for
such manufactured products as kitchen appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's inaction also comes days after a report that the
consumer price index in July rose only 0.2 percent _ and 3.5
percent during the past year. There have been spotty signs of
slower growth in the data, particularly in industries sensitive to
interest rates, such as housing construction and car sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate
demand is moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of
the economy's potential to produce,'' the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite positive signs, Fed members said in a boilerplate
sentence similar to those in prior statements that they remained
``concerned about the risk of a continuing gap between the growth
of demand and potential supply at a time when the utilization of
the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level.''
In other words, they are concerned that rising wages would spark
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But Glen Migliozzi, who heads the bond group for Fleet
Investment Advisors, saw a subtle but important shift in the Fed's
thinking about the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been raising rates all along to be preemptive about
inflation picking up,'' Migliozzi said. ``Now, I believe they will
shift to being reactive,'' raising rates once inflation becomes a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan's Fed watcher in New York, Mark Wanshel, said the
Fed's inaction ``was no surprise in any respect. There was very
little reaction in the markets to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose only 59.34 points, to 11,139.15, though the Blue
Chip index's slight gain continued the rally that has occurred in
recent days. The Nasdaq index of technology stocks rose just 5.06
points, to 3958.21.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Fed give any clues to its course of action to a Wall
Street that has watched every move. The Fed's comments, Wanshel
said, ``were not strong enough to give the market any new
information about the probabilities for Fed action down the road.''

 &HT;    Japanese phone giant NTT looking at U.S. market
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - It took longer than expected, but the world's largest
telecom wallflower has finally started to dance.
</P>
<P>
   And that shuffle by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan and
its wireless subsidiary NTT DoCoMo could lead them to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are reportedly under way on a major investment by the
Japanese firms in the company being created by combining the
wireless units of SBC Communications and BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials all around decline comment.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's intent seems clear, said Perry Walter, analyst
with Robinson Humphrey. ``They have been very vocal about their
interest in the United States. They consider the U.S. a strategic
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover the technology used by NTT DoCoMo to connect wireless
users to the Internet is far better than what is offered in the
United States, he said. ``I think people would find it easier to
use, more graphically appealing and more feature-rich.''
</P>
<P>
   NTT DoCoMo is in talks aimed at arranging purchase of a 10 to 15
percent stake in the still-unnamed company, according to the
Financial Times. Injection of that cash _ probably between $5
billion and $10 billion _ would help SBC and BellSouth buy licenses
or companies needed to fill out the national footprint of the new
unit. The joint venture would be the second largest wireless
company in the U.S., behind only Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more intriguing is the implication that the
arrangement might include use of i-mode _ the wildly successful NTT
DoCoMo technology.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the SBC-BellSouth unit will have nearly 18 million
subscribers. But the future is not just voice. No one can say with
certainty exactly what wireless will look like in a few years, but
clearly the technology and the economics are driving the market
toward using wireless devices for a variety of jobs, including
Internet access and transactions. Neither BellSouth nor SBC has
done much yet in the consumer market with wireless Net access.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where i-mode shines.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of NTT DoCoMo's i-mode can send e-mail, check train
schedules and movie listings, read newspapers and are expected soon
to be able to download music off the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers generally consider the United States to be
far behind Japan in wireless Internet use. Since its launch in
early 1999, the i-mode has amassed more than 10 million users in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But success in Japan is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications is moving toward a world dominated by a
handful of global companies. The largest companies are supposed to
lead that trend and get ever-larger. In Europe, France Telecom,
British Telecom, Telefonica and Deutsche Telekom have been actively
expanding. In the U.S., AT&AMP;T has poured more than $100 billion into
buying cable networks, while WorldCom bought MCI and a host of
others before being stymied by regulators in its bid for Sprint.
SBC Communications now extends from the Pacific to its Northeast
border with the turf of Verizon, itself an amalgam of Bell
Atlantic, Nynex and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   NTT DoCoMo needs to spread its influence _ and its investments.
And the company has the deep pockets to play catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a dramatic stock slide since the spring, NTT DoCoMo
shares are worth about a quarter of a trillion dollars _ more than
four times the stock value of BellSouth. The company has revenues
of $25.9 billion and earnings of $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, NTT has made investments in Europe and Asia, bid for
one U.S. company and is reportedly in talks aimed at taking a stake
in another.
</P>
<P>
   In its U.S. bid, NTT DoCoMo has been interested in buying a
piece of VoiceStream only to be shut out when Deutsche Telekom
agreed to pay $56 billion for the whole thing. That defeat could
work to its advantage _ if the Germans take all the heat during a
politically touchy moment.
</P>
<P>
   A group of U.S. Senators led by Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) is on
record as opposing the Deutsche Telekom bid. Moreover, NTT DoCoMo
is apparently only shooting for an investment in BellSouth-SBC, not
a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   And the relationship would not be built from scratch. NTT DoCoMo
already has a 15 percent stake in KPN Mobile. The wireless unit of
KPN Telecom has been BellSouth's partner, and the three companies
last week were one of the winning bidders for a license to provide
new wireless services in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the arrival of the Japanese on the U.S. wireless scene
could change the dynamics at BellSouth and SBC where there have
been no foreign investors. It would also potentially challenge the
technology being used by other U.S. providers for Net connections.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. carriers insist their technology is the equal of i-mode and
that DoCoMo's advantage has more to do with enlisting hundreds of
Web sites to tailor their offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The most creative advance is in putting Web use and various
services all on the same i-mode bill, said Paul Reddick, vice
president for product management development at Sprint. ``That is
one thing they've done that is unique in Japan. But that is not
specific to i-mode, and just because it's not happening with U.S.
carriers doesn't mean that it can't happen.''

WORKPLACE: MY JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (Marek Ponichtera is a building superintendent in New York City;
this was written with Marchin Skomial)  
 By MAREK PONICHTERA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I set out for America 10 years ago with my new wife
and $500 that I had borrowed from friends.
</P>
<P>
   My wife's uncle picked us up at Kennedy Airport. He was the only
person we knew in this country _ and he was unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   My wife soon got a part-time job as a cleaning lady for a family
in Brooklyn. I couldn't find work, so I helped her out. I did
whatever I was told to do: sweeping the walk, washing windows,
changing bulbs. As payment, we received free room and board, but no
money. The family didn't speak Polish, but somehow we were able to
communicate through sign language and an English-Polish dictionary
that I always carried with me.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a year later, I got a job as a mason's helper at a
construction site. I carried 50-pound loads of bricks around _ not
easy, as I weigh about 140 pounds _ and I put in 10 hours to 12
hours a day, six days a week. My poor English was a worse
disadvantage than ever. Once, a worker asked me to bring him a
hammer. I nodded and fetched a screwdriver. He burst out laughing.
</P>
<P>
   It was about then that I enrolled in a class to learn English. I
also picked up other trade skills, and in 1992 I got a job doing
carpentry, electrical work and painting.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, I was hired as superintendent of a residential
building on West 85th Street. The pay and free housing seemed like
a good deal, but I quickly realized I had my work cut out for me. I
was responsible for the whole building, and anyone who needed
something done in his apartment called me to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Once, on a Sunday evening when I was getting ready to go out to
a movie with my wife, my intercom started ringing. Someone had a
leak in his apartment and the water had dripped into the apartment
underneath. It took me two hours to solve that problem, and when I
got back to our apartment, my wife handed me a sheet of paper with
two other assignments: In both cases, a toilets had gotten clogged
and the tenant was in desperate need of a plunger.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, my boss asked me to supervise the renovation of
apartments at a much larger building he owned on West 90th Street.
Although my title was still superintendent, I no longer had to deal
with leaks and clogged toilets. I hired a porter to take care of
those chores, while I sat in my office in the basement, ordering
paint and sheetrock and hiring workers, mostly newly arrived Poles
who couldn't speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Once, my boss started shouting at a group of them _ unloading
steel pipes from a truck _ to work faster. They ignored him. When I
saw what was happening, I hurried to explain to him that none of
them understood a word he was saying.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, I am surprised at how rude people can be. Perfect
strangers will make disdainful comments about my work clothes,
which are often spattered with paint, for example.
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday, when my porter was off duty, a lady asked me to come
to her apartment immediately to fix her air conditioner, While I
was working, she asked me about my family and background. At some
point, she started to express dissatisfaction with my Polish accent
and the fact that I came from a formerly Communist country. It
didn't seem to matter to her that she herself came from Romania _
and had a Romanian accent.

RUSH TO REPLACE SUV TIRES DEFLATES DEALERS' SUPPLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Firestore's voluntary recall is gobbling up so many sport
utility vehicle tires that dealers say their supplies are nearly
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   The tire shortage not only means more scrambling for owners of
Ford Explorers covered by the Firestore recall, but also means
anyone with an SUV using the same-size tire is going to have a hard
time finding replacements. The shortage is driving up the cost of
tires as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have virtually nothing left,'' said Benjamin Kravetz,
president of Summit Tire of Massachusetts, a major tire wholesaler
in the state. ``There are literally millions of these tires on back
order.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bird, the owner of Marshfield (Mass.) Tire, said he's out of
name-brand sport utility tires and his suppliers are telling him he
could have a long wait before he gets new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like running an ice cream stand without ice cream,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage began developing shortly after Aug. 9, when
Firestone voluntarily recalled 6.5 million 15-inch ATX, ATX II, and
Wilderness AT tires. The tires, most of them sold as original
equipment on Ford Motor Co.'s best-selling Explorer SUV and the
Ford Ranger light truck, were linked to accidents, many involving
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone initially tried to phase in the recall, focusing on
southern states first. But it then allowed customers across the
country to pull into Firestone tire centers and have replacement
tires from Firestone and other manufacturers put on at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone subsequently allowed customers to purchase
similar-size tires directly from any tire dealer and be reimbursed
up to $100 per tire, including mounting, balancing, and taxes.
Local dealers say the $100 doesn't always cover the entire
replacement cost, particularly for more expensive tires such as
Michelins.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for tires has been so strong many dealers say they
are running out of the type of tires that go on most midsize SUVs
and light trucks. The size is identified as P235/75R15.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone and other tire manufacturers are ramping up production
of the SUV tires, but officials say it may be a while, possibly
many months, before the shortage begins to subside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making and shipping tires as fast as we can, but we
can't keep up with demand,'' said Chuck Sinclair, a spokesman for
Goodyear Tire in Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear's Web site (www.goodyear.com) offers information on
replacement tires and suggests consumers call their local dealer
and place an order.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sinclair at Goodyear said the company isn't raising its
prices, dealers locally say most tire prices are going up. Several
dealers said the prices they are paying for tires have increased at
least 5 percent, a hike that is being passed along to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are getting very upset,'' said Nicky Cerundolo,
manager of Arlington (Mass.) Tire and Auto Center.
</P>
<P>
   Cerundolo said he has sold more than 200 replacement tires since
Firestone announced its recall Aug. 9. He was down to his last four
Uniroyals Tuesday and doesn't know when he'll get more in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to consumers is to move quick,'' he said. ``Nobody
has them in stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Kravetz said he believes the heavy emphasis by manufacturers on
the production of SUV tires will eventually result in shortages of
tires in other sizes. ``There's going to be shortages of other tire
sizes in a couple months,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Tire industry officials say many consumers affected by the
recall are demanding tires of similar quality, but with the
shortage many who want new tires immediately are being forced to
consider non-brand name tires or tires not designed specifically
for SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to come to a point where people are going to say,
`I don't care what it is, put it on,' '' said Bob Laroche,
wholesale manager at Maynard and Lessieur in Nashua, N.H.

KENNEDY CENTER HONORS 5 PERFORMERS, 3 OF WHOM ARE FOREIGN-BORN 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
announced the recipients of its annual honors for outstanding
American performers Tuesday, and for the first time since the
awards were established 22 years ago, most of the recipients are
foreign-born.
</P>
<P>
   They are the dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, born in Riga, Latvia;
the tenor Placido Domingo, born in Madrid; and the actress Angela
Lansbury, whose London roots are probably little known to millions
of television viewers who remember her mainly as an all-American
amateur detective in ``Murder, She Wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   They are to receive their awards in December with two recipients
born in the United States: the rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry,
born in St. Louis, and the actor and director Clint Eastwood, born
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   When the abundance of foreign-born recipients was mentioned to
Baryshnikov, he said: ``Isn't that the tradition of this country?
It is so wonderful to immigrants, and I am one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by telephone in the Dominican Republic, where he is
vacationing, he added: ``I am very excited and honored, but
accepting this award makes me uncomfortable because so many artists
I have worked with in the past 25 years deserve this recognition
more than me. I will hold a place in line for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Baryshnikov, now 52, defected in 1974 from the Soviet Union,
where he had been a member of the Kirov Ballet, and joined American
Ballet Theater in New York. He shifted to the New York City Ballet
in 1978 to work with George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins, who have
also been honored by the Kennedy Center. He rejoined American
Ballet Theater in 1980 as principal dancer and artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo, 59, has sung 115 roles in the works of Verdi, Wagner,
Puccini and others. He has also conducted widely and has taken on
administrative roles at the Washington and Los Angeles Operas.
</P>
<P>
   Lansbury, 74, has had several distinct chapters in her career,
including her early roles in Hollywood movies like ``National
Velvet'' with Elizabeth Taylor and ``The Long Hot Summer'' with
Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   At 22 she played a woman in her 40s who tries to come between
Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracey in a classic Washington
political movie, Frank Capra's ``State of the Union.'' Then she
shifted to the Broadway stage, where her performances included the
roles of the eccentric aunt in Jerry Herman's ``Mame'' and the
barber's murderous accomplice in Stephen Sondheim's ``Sweeney
Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   She then turned to television detective work, solving a killing
every week for 12 years and finding an entirely new audience on
``Murder, She Wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry, 73, the singer-songwriter and guitarist regarded as an
originator of rock 'n' roll, has been cited as an influence by the
Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and
countless others. John Lennon once said, ``If you tried to give
rock 'n' roll another name, you might call it `Chuck Berry.'''
</P>
<P>
   His first recording, ``Maybelline,'' was a hit in 1955. Other
big sellers include ``Roll Over Beethoven,'' ``School Days'' and
``Johnny B. Goode.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry is the first Kennedy Center honors recipient to have
served time in prison; in 1959 he received a two-year sentence on a
morals case that involved a teen-age girl in his St. Louis club.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, 70, appeared in a string of B-movies in the 1950s
before landing a role on the long-running television series
``Rawhide.'' He went from there to the spaghetti westerns directed
in Europe by Sergio Leone that made Eastwood a star: ``A Fistful of
Dollars,'' ``For a Few Dollars More'' and ``The Good, the Bad and
the Ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the United States and played many tough-guy
roles, becoming the leading box office draw by 1969, and following
up with ``Dirty Harry'' in 1971, his most popular role. Eastwood
has directed many films, including ``Bridges of Madison County.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign-born performers have received many Kennedy Center Honors
in the past, and in 1986 three of the six recipients were from
abroad. They are being cited, in the words of James A. Johnson,
chairman of the Kennedy Center, ``for the unique and extremely
valuable contributions they have made to the cultural life of our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The winners are to be honored on Dec. 3 at the Kennedy Center
Opera House in a gala performance that is the center's principal
fund-raising event of the year. The program will be taped and
broadcast on CBS later in December.

BUSH FOG INDEX RISES IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ George W. Bush is fond of saying, ``There's
something in the air here,'' as he campaigns from state to state
and expresses optimism about his electoral chances.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Iowa, though, there may be something in the
water.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this year, the Republican presidential
candidate came to this Midwest state and gave a stump speech that
mystified his listeners, as he mangled some of his phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing 2,100 people at a fund-raiser for the Iowa Republican
Party on Monday, the Texas governor boasted, ``We're talking about
issues in a way that the American people can understand.''
</P>
<P>
   His speech put that declaration to the test.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking about the federal budget surplus and tax cuts, Bush
said: ``My attitude about the surplus is this: It doesn't exist
because of the ingenuity and hard work of government; the surplus
exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American
people. Between now and the next 10 years, our budget's going to
grow from roughly $1.9 billion to an additional spending, of $1.9
trillion, to an additional spending of $3.3 trillion. That's before
we even account for the surplus. We will spend $3.3 trillion over
the next 10 years on top of $1.9 trillion. We've still got
trillions left in the surplus, and surely we can send some of that
money back to the people who will pay the bills, surely, surely, we
can share the hard work with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also took a populist approach, saying his 10-year, $1.3
trillion tax cut proposal would benefit not just the wealthy, as
Democrats have charged, but poorer workers trying to get into the
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign not only hears the voices of the entrepreneurs
and the farmers and the entrepreneurs, we hear the voices of those
struggling to get ahead,'' he said, his double reference to
entrepreneurs drawing some chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the issue of military readiness, Bush pledged to
rebuild the armed forces to prevent an outbreak of war, rejecting
suggestions that America ignore most international problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will refuse to let this nation withdraw within our borders.
We're not an isolationist nation. We're a nation based on the
principle of freedom, and we cannot let terrorists and rogue
nations hold this nation hostile or hold our allies hostile,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The speech harkened back to Jan. 21, when at the end of a long
day of campaigning, Bush tied some verbal knots as he spoke in
Council Bluffs about international threats.
</P>
<P>
   Noting how the end of the Cold War had blurred the lines between
hostile and friendly nations, Bush declared: ``When I was young and
coming up, it was a dangerous world, and we knew exactly who the
`they' were. It was `us' versus `them' and it was clear who the
`them' was. Today, we're not so sure who the `they' are, but we
know they're there.''

`THE SHARK NET': MURDER AND OTHER GROWING PAINS IN PERTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perth _ the most isolated city in the world, or so they like to
say there out there on the western coast of Australia _ sits facing
the Indian Ocean, which stretches endlessly to Africa. Robert
Drewe, the Australian novelist and playwright who grew up there,
makes the place sound a bit like Albert Camus' North Africa,
blinding in its brightness and dominated by the maritime elements:
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing in the straight white coastline to give your
eyes a rest _ no bays, few trees to break the line and the glare
and the shuddering mirages. Often on hot days the smell of
something dead rose from the dunes and filled your head. ... You
became dizzy and got a headache if you looked toward Africa too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that smell of something dead that is the suggestive
element in ``The Shark Net,'' Drewe's spiced and savory memoir of
his boyhood years in Perth, when the rampages of a serial killer
mingled with the more normal events of a young life, making them
all seem like threads of the same tableau. Or perhaps these other
events are not so normal after all. They only seem that way in
comparison with the murders committed by one Eric Cooke, a possibly
insane man who shot or stabbed eight strangers to death in Perth
between 1959 and 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Drewe treats all of this, normal and not, with a kind of
quizzical power of observation that gives his book a whiff of
mystery and plenty of charm.
</P>
<P>
   He begins with a description of the light in the courtroom in
which Cooke was convicted of murder: ``harsher, dustier, more
ancient looking'' than normal light. He lets us know early on that
the trial, somehow, would be an instrument in the transformation of
his own life. He was on the scene as a reporter for The West
Australian, the newspaper that Drewe, still only 19, had begun
working for shortly before. But he soon lets us know that the
trial, taking place amid the ordinary artifacts of conventional
suburban life, was affecting him deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The murders had stopped,'' he writes. ``Life would go on. But
it was clear that my life wouldn't continue as normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Drewe's memoir in a sense explains why this was so,
though he doesn't provide a full explanation until he returns to
Cooke's trial near the end of the book. In the meantime he provides
a chronicle of growing up in a normatively dysfunctional family in
sun-stroked, sea-dazzled Perth, a chronicle wherein the mature man
attains a kind of bemused control over the eager foolishness of his
earlier self.
</P>
<P>
   Drewe's father was a state manager for Dunlop, the rubber
company, in which he invested emotions that he did not bestow on
his family. His mother suffered quietly and yearned for more, which
Drewe, the oldest of her three children, discovered when he went
with her to hear a speech by the evangelist Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   The series of murders that terrified Perth during Drewe's
teen-age years were personal to him because he knew one of the
victims _ a boy named John Sturkey, shot in the head while he slept
on the porch of his rooming house _ and he knew Cooke. Drewe
provides telling glimpses of Cooke as a misfit who was ridiculed
growing up because of a harelip and a speech impediment. He
remembers him lurking at Saturday night parties and approaching
young women, who spurned him, even as his wife and seven children
stayed at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shark Net'' is not what you would call a true crime story;
its purpose is not to delve deeply into the minds of a killer and
the police officers who caught him. But as Drewe recounts his young
man's wonderment at the criminal and the evil he wrought, he does
cast some doubt on a legal system that, first, convicted two other
men of two of the crimes that Cooke committed and gave only the
most passing consideration to the possibility that he was insane.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Drewe was growing up, forced to do so quickly when his
girlfriend got pregnant and, not long after that, his mother died
of a cerebral aneurysm. Drewe marvelously evokes the residual
Victorian primness of his childhood in a conversation he had with
his family's doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've probably been wondering whether you killed her,'' the
good doctor begins, referring to the shock Drewe's mother
experienced when she learned that he had a girlfriend (of a
different religion no less) and that she was pregnant. It is not
certain, the doctor goes on. Then, prescribing phenobarbital to the
young Robert, he reduces this searing moral question to a handy
piece of arithmetic: ``I think we're looking at a 60-40
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Drewe, though young, is happy in his marriage and with the son
who soon comes along. He works hard as a reporter, hoping, as he
looks for stories of shark attacks along the Perthian coast, that
an attack will happen and that he can become a hero by leaping into
the waves and saving someone. But then he is scooped by a rival
reporter who learns that Drewe's friend has drowned in the heavy
surf that Drewe had swum in the same day, which leads him to a
brief disquisition on the shark nets of his title, those screens
the authorities put up to protect swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Drewe does not seem to be in favor of shark nets: you've got a
better chance of dying in a plane crash or from just plain
foolishness than you do being attacked by a shark. Sharks here
represent the human imagination, how we organize the data of
experience in our minds as we react to the presence of a mad killer
among us, or perhaps to the death of a mother or to some of the
lesser accidents of life. In the deepest sense Drewe's affecting
memoir is the story of how one man comes to terms with the absence
of ultimate protection, with the reality that for some things the
only safety net comes from within.

SIMULTANEOUS FOUR-ORGAN TRANSPLANT MAY BE A FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Talk about split-second timing. A hundred doctors,
nurses, and other staffers at Brigham and Women's Hospital last
week managed to quickly track down four patients anxiously awaiting
new organs, to harvest and fly back to Boston a heart, two lungs,
and a kidney from a donor who had just died, and to simultaneously
stage four implant operations within the four-hour window during
which the excised organs remain viable.
</P>
<P>
   The quadruple-recipient donation, the first of its kind in New
England and maybe in the world, yielded precisely the results the
medical mavens hoped for: All four recipients were doing ``great''
Tuesday night. And while that sort of symphony of surgical movement
is a novelty now, doctors say it worked so well that it will soon
be standard operating procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first grand slam transplant,'' Dr. David Sugarbaker,
Brigham's chief of thoracic surgery, said at a press conference
Tuesday announcing the results. ``I think this is the future. The
idea is to maximize the organ donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Perry of Taunton, whose husband received a new heart,
was even more effusive. ``It's amazing that the donor's family rose
above their pain to reach out and help somebody else. . . . They've
given something very precious to these people,'' she said, adding
that as soon as her husband recovers he plans to take her dancing
and go fishing with his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Despite decades of efforts to enroll people, organ donations
still are rare enough that there is a list of several hundred
would-be recipients at Brigham alone, with thousands more across
the region hoping for hearts, livers, and other organs. The result
is that every time a donor emerges, physicians labor to make the
maximum use of available body parts.
</P>
<P>
   The first quadruple transplant was performed at the Mayo Clinic
in 1996, but in that case all four organs went to a single
recipient. The Brigham operations involved considerably less stress
to any one patient but more to the hospital as a whole, requiring
it to assemble four separate operative teams on a moment's notice,
at a time of the year when medical professionals and recipients
tend to be on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The first call that a donor had surfaced came Thursday at about
10 p.m. That set off a chain of carefully scripted events, starting
with Brigham staffers' activating beepers for the four patients at
the top of their respective recipient lists. Other beepers were set
off and phones rung for the 100 or so surgeons, anesthesiologists,
OR nurses, admitting officials and all the rest of the personnel
who handle heart, lung, and kidney transplants. Luckily all were
easily summoned to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the four transplant teams and their patients were
assembling at Brigham, another medical unit was heading to the
facility where the donor had died. Brigham officials would not
identify the other hospital, citing privacy concerns, but they did
say it took a jet to get the harvest team there and back in time.
</P>
<P>
   The organs were removed from the donor shortly after 7 Friday
morning. Two hours later they were back in Boston and the four
operations were under way. ``They all came out at the same time and
went back in at the same time,'' said Sugarbaker. ``The plane had
to fly into Logan. Thank God there were no delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Brigham has a tradition of being on the cutting edge when it
comes to organ transplant. In 1954 it performed the world's first
successful human organ transplant, involving the exchange of a
kidney between identical twins. In 1984 it conducted the first
heart transplant in New England. And in 1990 it was the first Bay
State hospital to perform a lung transplant; later that year it was
one of the first in the nation to complete a double lung
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham showed in 1995 and again in 1998 that it could do three
simultaneous transplants, involving two lungs and a heart. Doing
four at once ``was the same experience,'' said Dr. Scott Swanson,
head of Brigham's lung transplant program. ``It's like a general
going into battle. Everyone knows their job, they know who's called
for, for what, and when. And we're in a groove right now because
this is our ninth transplant since July 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said both of his lung patients were doing ``extremely
well.'' Doctors treating the heart and kidney patients were equally
upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   And it was not just the four Brigham patients who benefited from
the unidentified donor. Doctors also were able to harvest and use,
or save for future use, another kidney, along with a liver, skin,
corneas, and bone and cartilage. ``At least a dozen patients could
benefit altogether,'' said Sugarbaker.

GILLETTE DIVESTS STATIONERY DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Looking to focus on core product lines such as razors,
batteries, and oral-care products, Gillette Co. has agreed to sell
its struggling stationery division to Newell Rubbermaid Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Though a sales agreement had been expected, terms of the
transaction were not disclosed Tuesday, nor would Gillette publicly
discuss the fate of roughly 4,000 employees who work in the
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still confidential,'' said Nicola Pugliese, Gillette's
director of financial communications.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's stationery business, which includes such brands as
Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman, and Liquid Paper, accounts for about
10 percent of Gillette's total work force.
</P>
<P>
   Only one plant making stationery products is in the United
States, and that plant is in California, Pugliese said; others are
in such countries as England, France, and India.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Gillette chairman and chief executive Michael C.
Hawley said, ``Our resources will now be devoted to the three core
businesses of grooming, portable power, and oral care.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the proposed sales price ranged from $500 million
to $750 million. Over the years, Gillette paid a total of about
$572 million for various pen brands it bought.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to be relieved that a sales agreement finally
had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very logical,'' said Fredric E. Russell of Fredric E.
Russell Investment Management Co., an Oklahoma firm that owns
Gillette shares. ``This is very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, as investors complained about Gillette's subpar
performance, Gillette hinted that it might sell its stationery
division and some Braun appliance lines. In June, it announced it
had entered talks to sell its stationery business to Newell.
Gillette recently said it plans to hang onto its Braun small
household appliance lines.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Gillette's strategy has been to take household
products that some might regard as commodities and improve them
with technical innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette then uses aggressive marketing campaigns to convince
consumers that its improved products are worth a premium price.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has worked splendidly with razors such as the
Mach3, but less well with pens, and some Wall Street analysts have
recently begun to wonder whether this game plan can work long-term
for Gillette's Duracell batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's stationery sales have declined sharply, perhaps in
part because the company isn't as dominant in the pen business as
it is in some of its other product lines.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gillette reported stationery sales of $743 million
and a divisional profit from operations of $18 million. In 1997, it
said it had $156 million in profit from operations on stationery
sales of $924 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Gillette had total sales of just under $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette put together its stationery portfolio bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, it bought the Paper Mate brand for $15.2 million. In
1979, it bought Liquid Paper for $69.9 million. In 1987, it bought
Waterman pens for $39.4 million. And in 1993, it bought the Parker
pen brand for $447 million.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1990s, Gillette had a phenomenal run.
</P>
<P>
   But about two years ago, economic problems in some key foreign
markets combined with a strong dollar to slow Gillette's momentum.
More recently, investors have fretted about fierce competition in
the battery market, which has hurt Duracell.
</P>
<P>
   Of the stationery brands, Ariel Capital analyst Todd Griesbach
said: ``These are good brands that have been undermanaged by
Gillette. Newell is much more focused on stationery products,
including writing instruments. There will also be a lot of
manufacturing synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Illinois, Newell had 1999 sales of $6.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette shares closed at $31.13 up $1.31. Newell shares rose 50
cents to $26. Both companies trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

 &HT;    EXCERPTS FROM GORE INTERVIEW ON MILITARY POLICY
 &HT;    With GORE.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Here are highlights from an interview with Vice
President Al Gore following his speech earlier Monday to the
Veterans of Foreign Wars national convention in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In your speech to the VFW today, you said you were ``so
concerned'' by ``others trying to run down America's military for
political advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   A. (Laughs) You're not going to make me say who, are you?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think reasonable people can conclude that you're talking
about Governor Bush. But let me ask you this: military policy is
certainly a legitimate political issue for debate in a presidential
campaign. But at what point does criticism of military policy cross
the line?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have long since begun the increased investments in
modernization and readiness that are needed. And therefore, I would
never say that it's not legitimate to raise questions about how
much investment of that sort is needed. I've pledged to continue
the increases. In fact, it was an issue in the primary contest,
where I called for increased defense spending and my opponent did
not.
</P>
<P>
   But to go beyond that and to say that two divisions can't even
respond to a call to deploy, or to imply that our fighting forces
are not the most capable in the world by far, that's mistaken. And
I don't think that it's helpful to the country to put an inaccurate
impression out there.
</P>
<P>
   I think people probably take it with a grain of salt. So I don't
want to overstate how much damage is done by it. I don't think it's
a lot. But it's just the kind of thing that ought to be accurate if
you're going to say it. The Pentagon immediately set the record
straight.
</P>
<P>
   And look, we picked a Republican to run the Defense Department,
partly to take military policy out of the political arena. I
strongly recommended Bill Cohen. I had served with him in the
Senate. He and I served on the Armed Services Committee with Sam
Nunn. And he and Sam and I were a threesome in working with Norm
Dicks in the House (a Democrat from Washington state first elected
in 1976) to advance the strategic forces modernization agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary Cohen offered my opponent a briefing on some of these
issues and he turned it down and accused Bill of partisan politics.
Well, Bill hasn't even endorsed me. In fact, he's said publicly
that he would probably vote for my opponent because of his party
affiliation, although _ and I haven't talked to him _ I doubt very
seriously that he would say that now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Today's newspapers include accounts of a new team of arms
inspectors being sent into Iraq, possibly setting the stage for
another confrontation with Saddam Hussein. And that raises the
question of what kind of commander-in-chief George Bush was. Also,
it's an issue in the context of the military the Clinton-Gore
administration inherited from the Bush administration and the fact
that he left Saddam in power. And you voted with Bush on the Gulf
war.
</P>
<P>
   A. I did. I have always defended former President Bush's
decision to pull back when he had the knife at Saddam's throat. I
think it was a mistake, and I've said that I thought that decision
was a mistake. But I also know the pressures that he and our
country faced at the time, having put together an international
coalition that included Egypt and Syria and other Arab countries.
And I understood how, having achieved the narrow objective he
established for Operation Desert Storm. So while I have said it was
a mistake, I've also said it was an understandable mistake.
Therefore, it does not in my view fall into the category of huge
blunders that greatly damaged our national security. I think it was
a mistake, but I think we ought to cut him some slack on it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Nearly every presidential candidate in my lifetime has talked
about improving benefits for veterans. And yet, conditions at VA
hospitals are often deplorable. And benefits seem inadequate. So
why should a voter think you would do any better?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have brought about some significant improvements, but the
challenge continues to grow with the aging of the veterans
population, particularly the aging of the World War II vets, who,
like all the rest of us, have increasing medical needs as they age.
Therefore, we have to make this a decision to make this a priority,
and I will.
</P>
<P>
   I've been involved through the reinventing government work in
getting to know a lot of the most effective regional VA
administrators. We've actually implemented some of the ideas out of
the Reinventing Government Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   I've had some experience with how to listen carefully to the VA
employees and make some of the changes that can improve the quality
of life for veterans seeking health care.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Because you're a veteran, do you feel a special obligation to
them?
</P>
<P>
   A. I sure do, especially since I've a veteran who, as I said
today, didn't do the most or run the gravest risk. I know the guys
who did that. I want to make sure that our country, by God, does
right by them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Sometimes this election sounds like it's taking place in the
1980s, about ``Star Wars'' and other expensive weapons systems.
Haven't we had this debate before?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure. But there certainly are disagreements and I think they
should be debated, because a lot is a stake, both in terms of the
astronomical costs involved and, more importantly, the dangers of
restarting an arms race with Russia and kindling a new one with
China if we don't approach it in the right way.

<P>
   The 19th century's dream of an open polar sea has become the
21st century's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's news that an icebreaker arriving at the North
Pole had found open water instead of ice means that the fantasies
of 19th century explorers are now a reality _ one with potentially
dire implications for the environment. A hundred and fifty years
ago, such a discovery would have been a cause for celebration. In
1853, for example, the American explorer Elisha Kent Kane sailed
north to Greenland, determined to find an open polar sea and with
it a shortcut to China. The details of his journey inspired Jules
Verne's novel of 1866, ``At the North Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Were pioneering arctic explorers like Elisha Kent Kane crazy?
Didn't they know the North was frozen? Sure, they knew that the
Arctic was frozen; whaling ships had been hunting in Baffin Bay for
centuries, and sailors had seen the ice packs. But no one had yet
been to the North Pole. The explorers were hopeful that, like a
lake whose shores are frozen but whose middle is not, the Arctic
Ocean might contain open water at its center.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th century's optimism about finding a Northwest Passage
through the pole was founded on ignorance about climate change. In
1837, when the Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz proposed that much of
the geology of northern Europe was the result of a geologically
recent Ice Age, he was greeted with shock and disbelief. To his
contemporaries, the idea of a glacier extending from the Arctic to
the Alps was inconceivable, as were the cold temperatures necessary
to sustain it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, optimism and ignorance have again gotten in the way of
understanding, this time in the debates over global warming. The
evidence of accumulating greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere
is indisputable, but optimists have insisted that this change does
not necessarily bode ill for the climate. Meanwhile, hard-nosed
experts have had to admit that they do not know enough to predict
precisely how global warming will affect life on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the broad implications are clear enough. A temperature
increase great enough to melt the northern icecap means a massive
reorganization of the earth's heat and water patterns. Some places
that have been able to support millions of inhabitants may in the
future be able to support only thousands. Some formerly
uninhabitable areas may eventually become suitable for farms and
cities, but settling and developing those areas will take
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, many people resist the notion that such a brutal
future is possible. The Rev. Jerry Falwell recently said on
late-night TV's ``Politically Incorrect'' that he thought global
warming was nonsense. Of course, he does not believe in evolution
or the Big Bang either, but he expresses an optimism about
Providence that many share.
</P>
<P>
   General acceptance of the Ice Age began only when Elisha Kent
Kane returned from his ill-fated search for an open polar sea. He
published a richly illustrated account of his experience that
enabled people to understand for the first time what arctic ice was
like. His discovery and account of the Humboldt Glacier, the
world's largest, astonished and impressed the world. Modern
Greenland became a popular metaphor for the old Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the recent photographs of the open waters at the North
Pole will do the same for global warming theory. They show clearly
and unmistakably what so many experts had once thought impossible.
For the first time in 50 million years, we now have an open polar
sea.

<P>
   KEEDYSVILLE, Md. _ Sex and politics always make an intriguing
couple, but usually what we hear and read about are illicit sex and
dirty politics. When it's sexual zing between a happily married and
political couple on national television, we apparently don't know
what to make of it.
</P>
<P>
   When Al Gore planted a big kiss on his wife, Tipper, at the
Democratic Convention and it was not the nice, firm and friendly
peck it appeared she, and the rest of us, were expecting, it was,
to me, sweet, sexy, amusing and romantic all at once. That's a lot
of punch from one kiss.
</P>
<P>
   You go, Al.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the endless speculation in the days since that this was
all about communicating that Gore would be involved in no Monica
Lewinsky-like scandals, what I saw in the Gores' kiss was a man and
woman, married long enough to be grandparents, embracing at one of
the high points of their personal and professional lives.
</P>
<P>
   The kiss came after a taped montage of their life together and
directly after Tipper introduced Al as the man she fell in love
with at first sight. A good strong kiss seems pretty appropriate to
me at such a moment.
</P>
<P>
   If I'd been writing the internal dialogue of Al Gore, so often
described as a cardboard man, when he pulled Tipper into that
clinch, it would run something like this: ``This is our moment.
Look where we are, after all these years. Look what we've achieved.
Together. I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   The love in that kiss speaks to me as a woman, as one who
appreciates both intellect and romance. This was a man who, at one
of the pinnacles of his political career, felt compelled to show
his wife his love, his need and his gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   What could be more romantic?
</P>
<P>
   And it is the romance that seems to have eluded all the
political commentators, despite their endless search for new angles
to analyze. But I'll bet it was not missed by the nation's women.
</P>
<P>
   I can only assume that there were a great many women watching,
as I was, who would hope they would be as important, as essential
to a life mate at a crowning moment in his career, as Tipper was at
that moment to Al.
</P>
<P>
   I think Tipper was, initially, a bit taken aback. But she
rallied, put her arms around him and was as much a part of that
moment, of that kiss, as he was. The embrace after the kiss was
even sweeter, even more intimate, to my mind, than the kiss itself.
This made them a team, demonstrated a passion between them and from
them that I think women voters will admire and respect.
</P>
<P>
   But will those women voters show that admiration in the voting
booths? None of the women I know would be swayed in their political
judgments merely by the sight of a guy locking lips with his wife
on TV, any more than a man would cast a vote for a candidate based
on his ability to throw the perfect sinking curve ball. We are not
quite that simple.
</P>
<P>
   But while a kiss has nothing to do with platform or policy, it
does speak, very clearly, to human nature. Love matters, even in
politics, or we as women _ as voters or as candidates _ should hope
it does. Candidates can make promises or sling mud, and will,
endlessly. But show me the heart of the candidate, and I _ as a
woman _ will pay more attention to that candidate's words.
</P>
<P>
   We had a glimpse inside the heart when Gore embraced his wife
before he addressed the world as the Democratic presidential
nominee. That heart took one long, public moment to express love
for a woman. A lot of us may pay more attention to Gore's words
because of that quick, endearing and romantic impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Will it add up to more votes in November? If we like what we
hear, it well might.

   BILINGUAL-AMERICA _ CHICAGO _ ``Welcome. We speak Spanish,''
said the sign in Spanish beckoning customers to get a haircut at a
suburban Chicago salon. But somewhere along the way, former
employees allege, the Regis Hairstylist Salon decided that Spanish
spoken among employees made its English-speaking customers
uncomfortable. The sign disappeared and employees were ordered to
speak only English. Several hairstylists allege that they lost
their jobs for speaking their native tongue. As immigrants from
non-English-speaking countries flow into the United States,
businesses and institutions increasingly face a foreign-language
test: How best to cope with new workers and new customers whose

as wide as saucers. But Lopez never made to Houston or El Paso, her
dream cities. Instead she, her sister and a cousin _ all teen-age
girls _ ended up in a jail cell here for undocumented migrants
crossing into Mexico's southernmost Chiapas state. While U.S.
officials conduct their own battle to stem illegal crossings,
Mexican officials here say they've seen a 30 percent increase over
last year in the number of undocumented immigrants they're

   JUDGES-CAMPAIGNS (Undated) _ Judicial campaigns in quite a few

matches. As a result, judicial disciplinary panels are regularly
trying to do something unique in American politics: forcing
candidates to stop calling each other lazy, corrupt or soft on
crime, unless they can prove it. Across the country, judges are
being fined, censured and even threatened with removal for
practicing that venerable political art: exaggerating or outright

   CAMPAIGN-MILITARY (Washington) _ Ever since President Clinton
appointed him in 1996 as the only Republican in his Cabinet,
Secretary of Defense William Cohen has often claimed he represents
the bipartisanship needed to manage matters of national security.
Now he finds himself _ by all accounts reluctantly _ at the center
of a highly partisan debate over the state of the American
military. And it has left him in the delicate position of defending
the administration, on one hand, while at least indirectly
underscoring some of the Republican criticisms leveled against it.

   NY-CHARTER-SCHOOL (New York) _ While most political debate over
education involves tweaking existing programs, charter schools
present a chance for teachers, parents, management companies and
bright young idealists to sit around a blank blackboard and imagine
a school from scratch. Charter schools, which get public funds but
are run without regulation from the local school district, have
been embraced by conservatives and liberals alike as an outlet for
innovation, what many see as the most dynamic and important
education reform movement in decades. Times reporter Jodi Wilgoren
looks at the opening of one such school in New York, Bronx

ADVERTISING COLUMN: `IMMERSION' PLAN KEY TO LINCOLN'S ADS AT U.S.
OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While there are plenty of sponsors at the U.S. Open
tennis tournament, which begins on Monday, one sponsor intends to
stand out _ quite literally _ among visitors to Flushing Meadows in
Queens County, N.Y., where the event is held.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Sept. 1, Lincoln Mercury, the Ford Motor unit based
in Irvine, Calif., will usher visitors through elaborately staged
exhibits in a pavilion the size of four tennis courts to promote a
more contemporary image.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the unusual exhibits, Lincoln is embracing a new
idea in marketing called experience marketing, made popular in
books like as ``The Experience Economy,'' by B. Joseph Pine and
James H. Gilmore (Harvard Business School Press, 1999). Experience
marketing tries to appeal to consumers through the senses
experience the brand, often through show-businesslike techniques
that appeal to the senses. Retailers like Niketown and DKNY in
Manhattan are examples of brands that use similar techniques to
create an experience intended to move beyond just shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Wahl, Lincoln Mercury's marketing communications
manager, said Lincoln was intrigued with the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message in the experience economy is to combine education
with sensory experience and entertainment,'' Wahl said. ``We took
that cue, and made it relevant to Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln American Luxury Immersion exhibit is part of the
automaker's strategy to align itself with its belief that there is
a new idea of American luxury. Based on consumer research, the
company describes the new luxury as casual, energetic and
optimistic. One example: a generation ago, a nice evening might
have included driving a Lincoln to a formal restaurant where diners
had to dress accordingly and use the right fork, Wahl said. Today,
Lincoln's key consumer audience _ drivers 30 to 50 _ would probably
prefer skewering jumbo shrimp on an expensive gourmet grill while
dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, with _ Lincoln would hope _ a
Lincoln Navigator in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boils down to luxury without rules,'' Wahl said. ``It fits
into the new trend. All the new affluence is redefining how we
define luxury; it's a different way of approaching it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln pavilion, situated inside the grounds' former indoor
tennis courts, is a series of interactive sensory experiences that
juxtaposes old definitions versus new definitions of luxury. Upon
walking into the pavilion, for instance, visitors will experience
the sights and sounds of tennis from the past, with real grass
courts, still photography from the 1940s and '50s and video and
audio evoking that era, followed by the sights and sounds of
today's more causal and energetic U.S. Open. In the last stage of
the exhibit, Lincoln unveils its newest vehicle, a sporty truck
called the Blackwood.
</P>
<P>
   Impiric, the customer relationship unit of Young &AMP; Rubicam in
Irvine, Calif., is overseeing the project for Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like building a set: It's a cross between
Broadway and a sound stage,'' said Allan Finehirsh Sr., vice
president-director of event marketing and promotions, at Impiric.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln exhibit is the largest to ever appear at an Open,
said Pierce O'Neil, chief marketing officer for the U.S. Tennis
Association, the nonprofit group that owns and operates the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln recently signed a five-year agreement as exclusive
sponsor of the United States Tennis Association, which makes it the
exclusive auto sponsor and a year-round sponsor of USA League
Tennis, the world's largest recreational tennis league.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln will run commercials during the Open on CBS and USA
Cable.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil said the sponsorship was a perfect match for the
association. After reaching a peak in popularity in the early
1980s, fan interest waned and the Open's television ratings
declined. But in the last few years, the USTA has been working to
attract a younger, more diverse crowd. The group believes it is in
the early stages of a resurgence: ratings climbed in 1998 and this
year it began attracting a variety of sponsors, from newcomers like
Lincoln and Elle magazine to longtime supporters like Heineken and
Fila.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many similarities between the demographics, but it's
more about the image,'' O'Neil said of the Lincoln sponsorship.
``Optimistic, inviting, friendly _ those are all words and concepts
that Lincoln uses and those are words and phrases that certainly
describe the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Trout, a marketing consultant and author in Greenwich,
Conn., said Lincoln has a way to go to change its image.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's undermining their image is that the biggest way you
experience the Lincoln is when you are going to the airport,''
Trout said. ``They kind of dominate the limo market, and to me that
is a big factor in their image problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Lincoln sales are up this year because of its newer
vehicles, the sporty LS, and the Navigator, a sport utility
vehicle. According to J.D. Power &AMP; Associates, a market research
firm in Augura Hills, Calif., Lincoln sold 101,024 vehicles for the
year ended June 30, compared with 81,131 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   To attract visitors to the exhibit, Lincoln will begin running
advertisements on Aug. 23 from Young &AMP; Rubicam that ask questions
like ``Have you heard about it?'' and ``Are you living it?''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements will also appear throughout the 50-acre Flushing
Meadows site.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of Lincoln's efforts to attract visitors are
contemporary. Lincoln possesses one of the oldest summertime
marketing ploys: Immersion, Wahl said, is the only site open to all
visitors that has air conditioning _ a fact the company will not
advertise but knowledge of which is sure to get around, especially
if temperatures rise during the two-week event.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The word of the day was ``preparatory.''
</P>
<P>
   As in, Bronx Preparatory Charter School, the name stitched in
blue and gold on the patches decorating the children's white polo
shirts. As in, Preparation (plus) Focus (equals) Success, the motto
posted on the wall in the cafeteria, in the hallway, at the front
of every classroom and at the bottom of teachers' letters to
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission, the reason, the be-all and end-all of why we are
here, is to prepare you for college _ and for life,'' Kristin
Kearns Jordan told the 100 black and Hispanic youngsters seated
around the tables she and her husband spent the Saturday before
putting together. ``Everything that happens here happens to help
get you prepared. But you're never going to be prepared if you
don't do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 31, had been preparing for this moment for 18 months, or
maybe for her entire life, but especially throughout this summer of
14-hour workdays filled with assembling computer tables,
negotiating staff contracts, collating student binders and soothing
parental worries. It was the first hour of the first day of the
first year of a new school.
</P>
<P>
   While most political debate over education involves tweaking
existing programs, charter schools present a chance for teachers,
parents, management companies and bright young idealists like
Jordan, who had never before worked in a school, to sit around a
blank blackboard and imagine a school from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools, which get public funds but are run without
regulation from the local school district, have been embraced by
conservatives and liberals alike as an outlet for innovation, what
many see as the most dynamic and important education reform
movement in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx Prep started with 102 fifth and sixth graders on
Wednesday, Aug. 16, three weeks before almost every other New York
City public school, part of its regimen of extra class time and
rigorous discipline. With plans to add a grade each year until it
stretches through high school, Bronx Prep is one of 380 new charter
schools opening across the country this fall, including 18 in New
York state, 11 of them in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A movement that began with three schools in Minnesota and
California in 1992 now stretches across 34 states and the District
of Columbia, with nearly 520,000 students _ 1 percent of the
nation's schoolchildren _ enrolled in 2,069 schools.
</P>
<P>
   Though more than two-thirds of the schools have waiting lists
and some have posted remarkable achievement gains, the freedom
granted to charter schools has also created new opportunities for
corruption, with some schools shuttered after officials discovered
dangerous facilities, the illegal teaching of religion or financial
irregularities. Over all, 79 new charter schools have closed.
</P>
<P>
   As Bronx Prep begins its first year, promising to prepare
students for the nation's top colleges through a tightly controlled
environment and an extended school day and year, the looming
question is whether independence and innovation can transcend the
problems plaguing children from one of the nation's poorest and
most troubled neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question yesterday was, will we be able to pull it off?
The question today is, how good can we get?'' Jordan said last
week, on Day Two. ``Everyone can perform for the first day. Now our
challenge is to sustain it and build it and make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   29, New York's charter law, passed in 1998, dictates that
enrollment be determined by lottery. Technically, the school is
open to any student in the state, but Bronx Prep's 155 applications
came from within a few miles of the school, where recruiting was
focused.
</P>
<P>
   Charters cannot hand-pick high-quality students, but the fact
that their families sought out the school suggests a certain
commitment to education.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who turned up for the 10 information sessions this
spring had once applied to the School Choice Scholarship
Foundation, an organization Jordan used to run that sends
low-income students to private schools. Some of the children were
bright and unchallenged in the local schools. Others had behavior
problems, lagging years behind grade level. A few parents were
lured by Bronx Prep's promised schedule: 7:55 a.m. to 5 p.m., 200
days a year, or some 50 percent more time in class than the Board
of Education requires.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx Prep was born out of frustration with the educational
desert that dominates the South Bronx, combined with Jordan's
yearning to work more closely with children after years in
educational nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   By March 1999 _ more than a year before the charter would be
formally issued _ Jordan had told her bosses she planned to open a
school. Unlike most charter-school operators, for whom obtaining
facilities is the biggest challenge, Jordan quickly secured a
$75,000-a-year lease _ cheap at $5.75 a square foot _ from Our Lady
of Victory, a Catholic church, for the school next door, which had
stood vacant for five years. Bronx Prep was chartered by the State
University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, the school's director, hired as the principal Marina
Damiba,29, a Haitian-born dynamo who was one of the founding
teachers at KIPP Academy, a school a few miles away that has
received national attention for outstanding performance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a charter school, Bronx Prep can ignore city and state
mandates regarding curriculum, testing, staffing and spending,
though it has promised to administer the same standardized tests as
the New York City Board of Education so that its progress can be
compared with that of its competitors. The school will also be held
accountable for lengthy standards described in the charter, . which
SUNY can renew or revoke after five years.
</P>
<P>
   Tidbits like ``the word of the day,'' the hand-rung bell to
signal class-switches, and the achievement agreement that all
students, parents and teachers must sign are borrowed from Exeter,
Catholic schools, other charters, and, especially, from KIPP, the
Knowledge is Power Program, which itself is converting this fall
from a branch of the Board of Education to a charter school.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx Prep will have daily 90-minute blocks of reading and math,
plus separate classes in grammar/writing and novel reading, along
with science and social studies. The afternoons are devoted to
``enrichment'' _ 42 students are in the orchestra, the rest will be
split among African dance and drumming, step dancing and chess.
Each teacher will also meet daily with a small group of students
for discussions and activities like community service; plans for
recess and physical education remain sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be a place of rigid discipline, filled with rituals,
where students are called ``scholars,'' drilled in basic skills and
nitpicked about decorum _ girls endlessly reminded to close legs
under the plaid uniform skirts, boys admonished to keep hands out
of the pockets of their khakis. Over and over again, students are
told to ``practice their STEPS'': S means sit up straight; T, track
the speaker; E, enrich the class; P, pay attention; and S, show you
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has never taught a class. She has not designed a
curriculum. She has no degree in education, no teaching
certificate, little hands-on experience with children.
</P>
<P>
   What she has is a thick Rolodex, with relationships in the world
of education and the Bronx community, organizational savvy and
newly discovered skills like shopping for industrial-size food
warmers, operating a power drill and sewing curtains for the
doorless women's bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   She also knows how to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $900,000 to date, much of it before the charter was even
granted, from foundations, corporations and, friends. Expenses for
the first year are estimated at $1.1 million, plus $400,000 in
pre-opening costs. The state's per-pupil allocation of $6,630 adds
up to $676,000, with other revenues of $150,000 in federal and
state startup grants; $125,000 in aid for programs for poor
students; and $8,000 from the state for materials.
</P>
<P>
   Before opening day, about half of Bronx Prep's students had
already logged hours in its classrooms, summer's sun glinting
through arched windows.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty children struggling academically or socially were ordered
to attend a two-week preparatory session, which served as a trial
run for everything from bathroom procedures (children must sign a
log) to Scholar Dollars, a point system to monitor attitude.
Orchestra auditions _ students had to mimic a series of clapping
beats _ began in late July; a week after receiving their
instruments, the violinists were playing harmony for ``The Star
Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers, too, trickled in. Three of them, like Damiba, are
alumni of Teach for America, the national program that places
recent college graduates in impoverished classrooms. One just
returned from the Peace Corps in Zimbabwe, another spent the last
two years teaching in a San Francisco group home for emotionally
disturbed teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran of the group is 32, with a master's degree in
teaching English as a second language, the baby a 1999 Yale
graduate facing the front of a classroom for the first time. There
are two men and five women; four are white, two black, one Puerto
Rican.

MONTANA'S GOVERNOR TO CLOSE MORE COUNTIES UNTIL FIRES ARE UNDER
CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With some of the summer's worst wildfires burning vast
stretches of Montana, Gov. Marc Racicot is preparing to close at
least 16 counties in the western part of the state, a decision that
would put some of Montana's most popular recreation areas off
limits until the fires are brought under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an extremely serious situation for us to be addressing
it in these terms,'' Racicot said Tuesday in an interview,
referring to an announcement he expected to make on Wednesday.
``It's so incredibly difficult for people who rely, in so many
ways, on this area for recreation and their livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana is one of several Western states in which officials have
taken unusual precautionary measures because of wildfires that have
now consumed 4.1 million acres in 11 Western states, and some 5.7
million acres in the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming last week declared his state a
disaster area because of wildfires and drought. On Monday, the
Forest Service closed the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, a part
of Clearwater National Forest in north central Idaho, and the
Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The expected decision by Racicot could include as many as 19
counties, which would effectively close the entire western third of
Montana to all but those who live and work in areas that fire
officials have determined are not in immediate danger.
</P>
<P>
   It would also bring to 28 the number of counties that he has
closed this month _ or half the state, which has 56 counties _
following an order two weeks ago to shut off all or part of nine
counties in central Montana. The Bureau of Land Management has
already closed federal land it controls in those counties.
</P>
<P>
   The closings are intended to minimize the risk of injury from
wildfires that have been spreading rapidly by persistently dry
weather conditions and, for the most part, temperatures in the
upper 80s and low 90s. Racicot's orders so far have made exceptions
for some recreational areas, and the ones he is expected to issue
Wednesday are expected to do the same. Several major national
parks, like Yellowstone and Glacier, remain open.
</P>
<P>
   But restricting movement is one of several unusual elements that
reflect the seriousness of wildfires that are making this one of
the worst years in decades. There were 20,364 wildfires in the West
on Tuesday morning, with 79 large fires still burning across almost
1.4 million acres in nine Western states.
</P>
<P>
   Resources have been so strained that for the first time, fire
management teams from other countries are assisting local efforts.
Two supervisory teams from Canada are at work, and a team from
Australia is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unprecedented,'' said J.D. Coleman, a spokesman for the
Northern Rockies Coordinating Center in Missoula, Mont. ``Never
have we been stretched so thin that we've had to bring in fire
management teams from other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Parman, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire
Center in Boise, Idaho, said that the firefighting force includes
20,000 to 25,000, with about 1,200 more soldiers expected to arrive
later this week to join about 2,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   But the fighting force is comprised of more than veterans of
past fires and even scores of retired fire fighters who have joined
the efforts. Officials at the Fire Center estimate that as many as
9,000 college students may be on the lines, many of whom will have
to depart in the weeks ahead to return to classes. And in Wyoming,
42 prison inmates are working alongside professional firefighters
as part of a program that has been in effect since the 1960s.
California has also used inmates in a similar program.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are inmates who are about to be released or who have
earned the right to less security and are not a threat to
society,'' said Melinda Brazzale, a spokeswoman for the Wyoming
Department of Corrections. ``They are professionally trained by
another firefighter and go out and fight fires all over Wyoming and
in South Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazzale said the program has proved beneficial to both the
inmates and the state, which has saved more than $125,000 this year
by using them to assist the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a savings to federal and local agencies,'' she said.
``It's also a real benefit to the inmates to learn a saleable
skill.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to personnel needs, firefighting efforts this year
have been compounded by the growing number of private homes that
have been built inside of forested areas, a trend that Racicot and
other officials said reflects the nation's vibrant economy. Many of
the houses are owned by people in retirement; others are second
homes.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, they have made achieving containment more
difficult because of their remote and isolated locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have completely changed how we go about fighting fires,''
Coleman said. ``So many people have come out West to burrow into
woods, draws and creek beds. They like being a modern-day pioneer.
But now we have to protect their homes, and with the volume of
fires and their complexity, it makes for such an unpredictable
situation.''

   NEW YORK _ When it comes to fish, geography seems to dictate
consumer tastes. New York's markets and menus are dominated by
ocean-going varieties, not fish that spend their lives in rivers
and lakes. Chicago and other Great Lakes cities are where
freshwater fish are more in favor.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, several European-trained chefs here have been
delighted to discover walleye from the Great Lakes. The fish is
extremely meaty, with firm snowy flesh of uncommonly satiny
succulence and a sweet, mild flavor.
</P>
<P>
   For one of these chefs, Laurent Tourondel of Cello, on the Upper
East Side, it has been a reunion of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Troisgros, in France, we would get sandre from
the Loire, and I didn't think it was available here,'' he said.
``But your walleye pike is the same. It's a wonderful, big,
firm-textured fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Gutenbrunner, the chef and owner of the new Wallse in
Greenwich Village, named for his hometown in Austria, is also
serving the fish, which is called zander in German. He calls it
yellow pike on his menu, which is another common name.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Gras at Peacock Alley in the Waldorf-Astoria and Daniel
Boulud at Daniel are also using walleye now. Jean-Georges
Vongerichten, though, says he has been familiar with it for several
years but does not have it on the menu regularly because supplies
are not guaranteed. He offers it as a special, often poached in
butter with a caramelized shallot broth.
</P>
<P>
   Walleye is actually not a member of the pike family at all, but
is related to perch. Pike-perch is another of its confusing
aliases, which explains why the translation of the French sandre is
sometimes given as both pike and perch. In Michigan, walleye is
also known as pickerel. In the northern Midwest, it's popular at
fish fries.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, walleye is often sold as yellow pike, which is one
of the classic ingredients of gefilte fish.
</P>
<P>
   Walleye range in size from about 5 to 10 pounds and have a shape
like salmon but with a fierce-looking jaw. They rarely have the
slightly muddy taste typical of some freshwater fish. The name
walleye refers to its wide-set eyes, which, because it forages at
night, never have the clarity and brightness characteristic of the
freshest fish.
</P>
<P>
   Walleye can be found in rivers and lakes from New York to
Montana, as far north as Hudson's Bay in Canada and as far south as
North Carolina. In 1812, walleye were introduced into a branch of
the Susquehanna River near Elmira, N.Y., and they thrived so
abundantly throughout the Middle Atlantic river system they were
called Susquehanna salmon. But they were highly prized on the
plate, and by the end of the 19th century had been overfished in
this region nearly to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the walleye on the market comes from the Great Lakes,
especially Lake Erie. It's available fresh in markets here from
spring through early fall. During the rest of the year it is
usually available frozen, though sometimes fresh walleye shows up
in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Citarella on the Upper West and Upper East Sides of Manhattan
sells the whole fish for $5.95 a pound. Jake's Fishmarket on the
Upper West Side has it for $6.99 a pound. Wild Edibles in the Grand
Central Market is selling fillets for $13.95 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Tourondel of Cello sears the fillets and serves them with a
red-wine butter sauce, often on a bed of Swiss chard stems.
``That's the classic way it's done in Burgundy,'' he said.

MONTANA'S GOVERNOR TO CLOSE MORE COUNTIES UNTIL FIRES ARE UNDER
CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With some of the summer's worst wildfires burning vast
stretches of Montana, Gov. Marc Racicot is preparing to close at
least 16 counties in the western part of the state, a decision that
would put some of Montana's most popular recreation areas off
limits until the fires are brought under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an extremely serious situation for us to be addressing
it in these terms,'' Racicot said Tuesday in an interview,
referring to an announcement he expected to make on Wednesday.
``It's so incredibly difficult for people who rely, in so many
ways, on this area for recreation and their livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana is one of several Western states in which officials have
taken unusual precautionary measures because of wildfires that have
now consumed 4.1 million acres in 11 Western states, and some 5.7
million acres in the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming last week declared his state a
disaster area because of wildfires and drought. On Monday, the
Forest Service closed the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, a part
of Clearwater National Forest in north central Idaho, and the
Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The expected decision by Racicot could include as many as 19
counties, which would effectively close the entire western third of
Montana to all but those who live and work in areas that fire
officials have determined are not in immediate danger.
</P>
<P>
   It would also bring to 28 the number of counties that he has
closed this month _ or half the state, which has 56 counties _
following an order two weeks ago to shut off all or part of nine
counties in central Montana. The Bureau of Land Management has
already closed federal land it controls in those counties.
</P>
<P>
   The closings are intended to minimize the risk of injury from
wildfires that have been spreading rapidly by persistently dry
weather conditions and, for the most part, temperatures in the
upper 80s and low 90s. Racicot's orders so far have made exceptions
for some recreational areas, and the ones he is expected to issue
Wednesday are expected to do the same. Several major national
parks, like Yellowstone and Glacier, remain open.
</P>
<P>
   But restricting movement in areas like the Lolo National Forest
and the Bitterroot National Forest is one of several unusual
elements that reflect the seriousness of wildfires that are making
this one of the worst years in decades. There were 20,364 wildfires
in the West on Tuesday morning, with 79 large fires still burning
across almost 1.4 million acres in nine Western states.
</P>
<P>
   Resources have been so strained that for the first time, fire
management teams from other countries are assisting. Two
supervisory teams from Canada are at work, and a team from
Australia is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unprecedented,'' said J.D. Coleman, a spokesman for the
Northern Rockies Coordinating Center in Missoula, Mont. ``Never
have we been stretched so thin that we've had to bring in fire
management teams from other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Parman, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire
Center in Boise, Idaho, said that the firefighting force includes
20,000 to 25,000, with about 1,200 more soldiers expected to arrive
later this week to join about 2,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   But the fighting force is comprised of more than veterans of
past fires and even scores of retired fire fighters who have joined
the efforts. Officials at the Fire Center estimate that as many as
9,000 college students may be on the lines, many of whom will have
to depart in the weeks ahead to return to classes. And in Wyoming,
42 prison inmates are working alongside professional firefighters
as part of a program that has been in effect since the 1960s.
California has also used inmates in a similar program.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are inmates who are about to be released or who have
earned the right to less security and are not a threat to
society,'' said Melinda Brazzale, a spokeswoman for the Wyoming
Department of Corrections. ``They are professionally trained by
another firefighter and go out and fight fires all over Wyoming and
in South Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazzale said the program has proved beneficial to both the
inmates and the state, which has saved more than $125,000 this year
by using them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a savings to federal and local agencies,'' she said.
``It's also a real benefit to the inmates to learn a saleable
skill.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to personnel needs, firefighting efforts this year
have been compounded by the growing number of private homes that
have been built inside of forested areas, a trend that Racicot and
other officials said reflects the nation's vibrant economy. Many of
the houses are owned by people in retirement; others are second
homes.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, they have made achieving containment more
difficult because of their remote and isolated locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have completely changed how we go about fighting fires,''
Coleman said. ``So many people have come out West to burrow into
woods, draws and creek beds. They like being a modern-day pioneer.
But now we have to protect their homes, and with the volume of
fires and their complexity, it makes for such an unpredictable
situation.''

 &HT;    BUSH CRITICISM OF MILITARY OUT OF BOUNDS, GORE SAYS
 &HT;    500&AMP;add. With GORE-Q&AMP;A.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Vice President Al Gore suggested Tuesday that Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas went beyond the appropriate boundaries of
political debate by creating an ``inaccurate impression'' of U.S.
military forces.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made the suggestion in an interview as he expanded on his
remarks earlier in a speech to the national convention of the
Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, wearing the military-style cap of VFW Post 5021 in
Carthage, Tenn., told the group that ``an unshakable national
commitment to our veterans'' has been a hallmark of his 24 years in
politics, rooted in his service as an Army journalist in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that year-after-year commitment to a strong American
defense that makes me so concerned when others try to run down
America's military for political advantage in an election year,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president did not mention Bush by name, but his meaning
was clear. The day before, Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee, used the VFW convention as a forum for accusing the
Clinton administration of allowing the U.S. military to ``decline''
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In the subsequent interview with Cox, Gore cited Bush's earlier
criticism of the administration's military policies _ which he
called inaccurate _ to suggest that the Texas governor has stepped
beyond what is appropriate for a political debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have long since begun the increased investments in
modernization and readiness that are needed,'' Gore said. ``And
therefore, I would never say that it's not legitimate to raise
questions about how much investment of that sort is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to go beyond that and to say that two divisions can't even
respond to a call to deploy, or to imply that our fighting forces
are not the most capable in the world by far, that's mistaken,'' he
added. ``And I don't think that's helpful to the country to put an
inaccurate impression out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett said Gore's comments were
``reactionary and defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, speaking to the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia, Bush charged that two divisions of the
U.S. Army were not ready for combat duty. He was immediately
corrected by Defense Secretary William Cohen, a Republican and
former member of the Senate Armed Services Committee with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked a Republican to run the Defense Department, partly
to take military policy out of the political arena,'' Gore said in
the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, received a rousing reception from the nearly 7,000
veterans at the VFW convention, especially when he vowed to ``make
sure our military continues to be the best-trained, best-equipped,
best-led fighting force in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He also promised military pay raises and improvements in
veterans benefits. But he cautioned that a $1.3 billion tax cut
proposed by his Republican rival would ``wreck our good economy and
make it impossible to modernize our armed forces and keep them
ready for battle.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore is one of 1.9 million members of the VFW by virtue of his
service in Vietnam, in contrast to Bush, who served stateside n the
Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your military experience makes a little difference to this
group, but not much,'' said Dale Hundt, a 69-year-old conventioneer
from Madison, Wis., who was a paratrooper in Europe during World
War II. ``The important thing is where you stand on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a 10-year, $127 billion defense package that
includes the 3.7 percent military pay increase enacted this year,
investments to modernize equipment and more funding for veterans
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Chris Lehane said Gore's proposed spending on defense
would probably be increased in a fall revision of his budget to
reflect bigger surplus projections.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed pumping $1 billion a year more into military
pay over the next five years and spending $310 million to fix
schools on military bases.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with Cox, Gore said he feels a special
obligation to veterans because of his noncombat service in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure do, especially since I've a veteran who, as I said
today, didn't do the most or run the gravest risk. I know the guys
who did that,'' he said. `` I want to make sure that our country,
by God, does right by them.''

WHEN IS IT TIME TO HANG UP THE PEN? 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There comes a moment in the twilight of literary careers when
some popular authors feel compelled to reveal plot twists in their
own lives that lead to unlikely denouements: pensions and
retirement planning.
</P>
<P>
   As summer beckoned, the self-described airport author Maeve
Binchy declared to headlines in London that her 12th book,
``Scarlet Feather,'' was her very last big novel. So millions of
loyal readers should expect no more sprawling page-turners from
this Irish bard of heartache, humor and transcontinental
house-swapping.
</P>
<P>
   Ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all a Frank Sinatra person who can be lured back,''
warned Binchy, 60, a former teacher and journalist whose best
sellers, like ``Tara Road,'' have earned her Oprah Book Club
celebrity, advances in the $10 million range and sales in her
homeland that outstrip those of William Butler Yeats and Oscar
Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   Binchy was followed by Rosamunde Pilcher, 75, who revealed that
she was shaping the final chapter of a 50-year career that has
produced several cozy best sellers about English hearth and home.
Her latest, ``Winter Solstice,'' with 600,000 copies in print,
soared to the top of the fiction best-seller list of The New York
Times after St. Martin's Press published it this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could write another,'' Pilcher, whose latest
book commanded an advance of more than $6 million, said in an
interview. ``I hate publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Such open declarations raise a delicate issue in the literary
world, where there are no standard tribal retirement rituals. It is
a long way from the universe of sports, which lavishes attention on
its pensioners. Computer keyboards are not retired. Career
best-seller records do not lead to teary stadium send-offs. The
creative force that drives writing may still burn, but the energy
to promote a book fades like the pitching arm of a middle-aged
hurler. In some ways, mulling a writerly finale seems a bit morbid;
or, as Pilcher put it in a polite British accent, ``I don't think I
thought about it anymore than my own death.''
</P>
<P>
   The retiring literary set is a group usually overlooked in favor
of writers like Saul Bellow, who this year, at 85, delivered
``Ravelstein,'' his first major novel in more than a decade. The
very notion of a pension is not suitable publishing-party
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've only discussed this with one other author,'' said
Sidney Offit, 71, the author of more than a dozen books and the
president of the Authors Guild Foundation, the educational arm of
the Authors Guild. He added: ``Retirement depends on why people
need to write. For some people, writing is the only world they
control; it satisfies a therapeutic aim. Other people have a
message they want to deliver and when they're done, they're out.
Then there are people who write under the Sam Johnson dictum:
`Anyone who writes for anything other than money is a blockhead.'''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is so touchy that some writers refuse to discuss it.
Sidney Sheldon, for example, declined to be interviewed for this
article. At 83, he is publishing his 17th novel, ``The Sky Is
Falling,'' next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bradbury, who just turned 80, keeps writing despite the
effects of a stroke he had months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote part of my novel while I was in the hospital, and I
wrote a screenplay,'' he said in an interview. ``You want to live,
don't you? If you don't give up, you don't die.'' Bradbury
continues to deliver lectures from a wheelchair, and in the fall of
2001 he will publish a novel about a friendly vampire family called
the Elliots, a work that he has been laboring on sporadically for
about 55 years.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Kurt Vonnegut, 77, insisted that his 19th book,
``Timequake,'' was the last in his almost 50-year career. Back
then, he confessed relief that he had crossed the marathon finish
line. But now his retirement is an issue that he declines to
address. ``Well, I don't want to talk about that,'' he said from
his summer home in Sagaponack, N.Y., a Hamptons retreat on Long
Island's South Fork that is the literary parallel to a Florida
retirement community.
</P>
<P>
   Many older writers decide at some point to devote more time to
their lives than to their characters. A prosperous Shakespeare is
said to have retreated in perfect health to Stratford in his last
two years and produced nothing, leaving others to finish his
incomplete plays.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, even some middle-aged authors have felt compelled to
seek short forms of semiretirement. At 45, the Scottish author Iain
M. Banks, whose first novel was ``The Wasp Factory,'' announced a
few months ago that he was taking a year off from a relentless
writing schedule that has resulted in an annual novel or science
fiction title for the last 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``His wife wanted him to spend some time with her,'' explained
Mic Cheetham, Banks' literary agent in London, who called the break
a sabbatical. ``I don't know why some writers say they are
retiring. Maybe to get people not to phone them? One of the things
about writing is that it's such a very private business. But when
you become a best-selling writer, it becomes very public, and
everyone keeps asking, `When's the next one?' Then everyone is
completely astonished when you say you're taking a year off. It
seems to me very normal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The increasing rigors of a public literary life are often the
deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   Maeve Binchy's epiphany came as she was sitting at a book event
beside another successful writer whom she would identify only as
``a very bad-tempered woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was drumming her fingers on the table,'' Binchy recalled.
``She kept saying: `This food is terrible. There should be more
people. This is too tiring. It's going on too long.' I thought,
this discontented lady has written books, which is what we've
always wanted to do. She's allowed this to get into her soul. And I
said to myself, `A little voice of warning, Maeve. Leave before you
become like that.' I was really afraid that I would become one of
the people to whom this was a treadmill.''
</P>
<P>
   Roaming the world on an international book tour was not easy on
Binchy's arthritis; the unending airport corridors tested her
joints. Her readers seemed to be getting younger as she gazed out
at them at book events. She wondered if she could keep up her
appeal. And she and her husband, Gordon Snell, an author of
children's books, were content with the state of their bank
accounts and pensions and with their homes in London and a village
outside Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terribly young, and I feel 23 in my heart,'' said
Binchy, who is published in the United States by Delacorte. ``But I
have to realize that the world has changed very much, and so have
people's dreams and aspirations. I think a sensible woman would
realize that it's hard to keep a finger on the pulse of the young
today. It's quite a different lifestyle. They're so much more
traveled, so much less insular.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tara Road,'' for example, one of her most popular books in the
United States, explores the fates of two young women who change
their lives by swapping their homes in Ireland and America for the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Binchy added that she would write some short stories, which did
not produce the same sort of publishing pressures as her
bread-and-butter full-length novels, like ``Circle of Friends,''
which was made into a movie starring Minnie Driver. She has also
dropped a column that she had been writing for The Irish Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my publishers very honestly, from the start, that I was
going to do this,'' said Binchy, who has since retreated on an
Alaskan cruise. ``I gave them six months' notice, but they didn't
really believe me. I think the thinking is that I could be
persuaded to go back. I couldn't go on in this kind of way, and I
don't want more money.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that publishers and editors prefer to consider
retirement announcements as figments of fertile imaginations and to
believe that ultimately writers will be unable to resist the muse,
and the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for a born storyteller like Rosamunde Pilcher or
Maeve Binchy not to tell a story,'' said Thomas Dunne, Pilcher's
editor of more than 20 years. ``At least, that's what the
publishers hope, and there are millions of dollars at stake for
them, of course. If you ask Ros Pilcher right now, she'll tell you
that she doesn't see another book on the horizon. I think that is
entirely possible, but I also believe that she will return to
writing after a bit, if only because she enjoys the process.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Dunne who patiently persuaded Pilcher to write another
book after she finished ``Coming Home,'' which sold more than
500,000 copies and provoked their first discussions about
retirement. Dunne called the author at her home in Perthshire,
Scotland, in 1997 to suggest an idea for a novel set at
Christmastime. Eventually, the idea took hold, and Pilcher
delivered ``Winter Solstice,'' which happens to include a 60-ish
character, a former actress who is seeking retirement.

<P>
   ``Once I started to think about the characters, I had them in my
mind and I had to write their story,'' said Pilcher, whose daily
efforts would take up part of her morning and afternoon, as well as
her dog walks, in which she would mull over plot and character.
``Writing is work, but it's also a compulsion, and once you get
your characters on paper, you can't abandon them. You have to
respond to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The creative process was stimulating, she said, but she doesn't
consider writing a pleasurable pastime. ``It's a job that you have
to do,'' she said. ``But it's still demanding and draining, and I'm
very tired at the end of a day's work.'' She vowed that with the
completion of the book she would retreat into a ``world of
domesticity'' populated by her husband, Graham; their four
children; their grandchildren; their friends; and their dachshunds,
Daisy and Polly.
</P>
<P>
   She is not touring the United States to promote her latest
novel, adding that the task of selling a book is wearing. ``I'm
really quite a private person, and I find it intrusive,'' she
continued. ``My husband has a new hip, and all of this happened
while I'm trying to juggle 24 balls. I never found it this way
before. I suppose when I was younger, I had more energy, and I
wasn't looking after a sick husband. This time I think the time has
come to hang up the hat, but I'm not going to say that
definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years ago, Carl H. Klaus, the founding director of
the University of Iowa's nonfiction writing program, decided that
he also needed a break after a four-year effort on his latest book.
</P>
<P>
   He treated his literary exhaustion with a regimen of reading,
traveling, and tending his prized vegetable garden of cherry belle
radishes and Oregon giant snow peas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the urge to be writing again returned before the year was
out,'' said Klaus, 68, who suspects that retiring authors are more
fatigued by publishing pressures than by writing itself. ``It's
irrepressible and comes from the same deep well that I drew upon
when a student asked if I had any last words at the end of my last
course at Iowa _ and without thinking, I told her, `Just keep
writing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Klaus is back at the keyboard, pounding out the chapters
of a book of essays. He is fully recovered from the rigors of
writing his last title, a memoir called ``Taking Retirement: A
Beginner's Diary.'' &QL;

PHOTOGENIC MAINE: WILDERNESS THAT'S EVERYONE'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
 By DEBORAH WEISGALL

<P>
   ROCKPORT, Maine _ Maine is a place of lakes and bays, hills and
islands, weathered people who live in plain and weathered
buildings; a place eroded to the bone, both hard and tender. Since
the 19th century, when Hawthorne and Thoreau published accounts of
sojourns there and Thomas Cole and Frederic Church sent paintings
of its coast and mountains south to the cities, Maine has
represented an accessible wilderness: America's idea of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers played an important part in inventing this idea of
Maine, though their role is less well-known than that of writers
and painters. With an ambitious, two-part survey, ``Photographing
Maine: 1840-2000,'' the Maine Coast Artists/Center for Maine
Contemporary Art documents the themes and variations of
photographers' rich and complex reactions to this landscape and its
inhabitants. Bruce Brown, the gallery's curator, organized the
exhibitions with John Chandler, a former curator. The first
installment, covering the years 1950-2000, runs until Oct. 1, and
the second, called ``1840's-1940's: The First Century,'' from Oct.
21 to Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they form a short course in American photography.
Almost everybody visited Maine, and many stayed. Ansel Adams,
Walker Evans, Gertrude Kaesebier, Paul Strand _ all have work in
Part 2 of the show, while Berenice Abbott, Eliot Porter, Ernst
Haas, Arnold Newman, Rudy Burckhardt and William Wegman are among
those represented in the current installment. One of its surprises
is the number of photographers who came from Maine: Kosti Ruohomaa,
for instance, one of Life magazine's great regulars in the 1950s,
was born in Rockland. His ``Monhegan Light, January 1957,'' with
the lighthouse beacon shining like the low sun, catches the
bleakness and exhilaration of a Maine winter, its daily
chiaroscuro.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Peterman, a young photographer whose photographs of ice
fishing huts were recently shown in New York, grew up in Camden; in
``Long Lake,'' the painted, recycled boards of a shack acquire the
minimal elegance of a Mondrian.
</P>
<P>
   For year-round Mainers, winter dominates, but to most visitors
Maine represents summer. Abelardo Morrell, who began studying
photography at Bowdoin College, pinpoints the season's elusive
magic in his ``Camera Obscura Image of a Pine Tree in Bedroom,
Little Deer Isle.'' The picture superimposes a ghostly state symbol
on the interior of a motel room like those where so many passing
tourists sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Despite motel corridors and the poverty of many of its citizens,
Maine appears desirable and beautiful, always pristine. Many of the
images, like Morrell's pine, locate their poetry in this
contradiction. Haas' ``Maine, 1960'' draws lyrical patterns with a
road's white dividing line, the flaking white spokes of an
abandoned wagon wheel, the fading white geometry of a decrepit
farmhouse and the bent dark figure of the old farmer. In Patrisha
McLean's ``Brandy in a Bathing Suit,'' a little girl grins and
arches her back as she leans against a windowsill; she looks like a
saucy ripening bean. Observing her balefully through the glass from
his chair just inside is an obese and coarsened man, obviously the
child's father, and her future.
</P>
<P>
   In Burckhardt's ``Bunchberries, Deer Isle, 1955,'' delicate
leaves float like paper boats on light rippling the forest floor.
Bunchberries and their clumps of red fruit, like Haas' native
farmer, have almost vanished in the last half century. But Judy
Ellis Glickman's ``Reflections, Great Diamond Island,'' made in
1999, shimmers with a sense of solitude no different from the
feeling of George Daniell's ``Portrait of John Marin,'' taken in
1952.
</P>
<P>
   With 135 pieces, each by a different photographer,
``Photographing Maine'' emerges as a brilliant play on the changing
nature of place, on what vanishes and what remains. We come here to
this ideal place that promises innocence, hoping that what we see
will illuminate that quality in us.
</P>
<P>
   In Paul D'Amato's ``Girl in Pew, Peak's Island, 1997,'' a girl
turns her head, caught in the camera's flash like a deer in
headlights. She seems innocent, shot in the plain church where she
thought herself safe. ``Photographing Maine'' snares these living
moments: Subjects vanish, wilderness diminishes, but the images
endure, imprinted in the imagination.

BRAZIL BUILDS BIGGER AND BETTER TELENOVELAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 27)  
 By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ When a television serial about an
18th-century courtesan went off the air here two years ago, few at
the struggling network that had produced the drama, called ``Xica
da Silva,'' expected it to have much of an afterlife. But then 150
episodes were dubbed into Spanish and sold to a dozen other
countries in Latin America, where the series quickly went on to
become a ratings phenomenon everywhere it was broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Now the United States, or at least the growing portion of it
that watches Spanish-language television, has succumbed to the same
spell. Since going on the air seven months ago, this tale of a
Brazilian slave who uses her quick-wittedness and sexual prowess to
gain freedom and wealth as the mistress of a powerful colonial lord
has revived the fortunes of Telemundo, the country's perennial No.
2 Spanish-language network.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the success of ``Xica'' (pronounced SHE-kah) undoubtedly
stems from the saucy performance of Tais de Araujo, the 21-year-old
actress who plays the title role and who was recently included in a
list of the 25 most beautiful people in Latin America published by
People magazine's Spanish-language edition. But the international
popularity of ``Xica'' also demonstrates that in the genre known as
the telenovela, as in soccer, nobody plays the game with more skill
than Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The novela is a form of entertainment that has developed into
one of the best products of Brazilian show business,'' said Joao
Carlos Daniel, who, working under the stage name Daniel Filho, is
one of this country's most successful directors in the genre. ``It
is not an exact science and there is no sure-fire formula for
guaranteed success, but without a doubt, we do it better than
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The telenovela, usually referred to simply as novela, is often
described as a Latin American version of the soap opera, and while
there are many similarities, there are also important differences,
beginning with structure. While some American soap operas have been
running for more than 40 years, a novela always has a beginning and
an end, which here normally comes after about 180 episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the novela consigned to the ghetto of daytime
programming. The United States has had prime-time soaps such as
``Dallas'' and ``Dynasty,'' but in Brazil, as in the rest of Latin
America, novelas are glossy entertainment on the air five or six
nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   As such, they attract the biggest audiences, demand the highest
rates of advertisers and thereby are entitled to the biggest
production budgets, with the cost of making a single episode often
exceeding $100,000. Novelas are so popular that nighttime
broadcasts of soccer, Brazil's other great passion, are delayed
until the last one is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that in the United States the soap opera is not a
prime-time product and so less investment and effort goes into
it,'' said Walter Avancini, who directed ``Xica da Silva'' and more
than 20 other novelas. ``That's not the case here. The novela is
the backbone of prime time, and so it has assumed a tremendous
level of importance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Hollywood's biggest stars would view a
role in a soap opera as beneath their dignity. Not so here: because
even Brazil's most distinguished actors and actresses find it all
but impossible to make a living just from films or theater, they
are often recruited to play choice roles in novelas, performing
alongside whoever the latest teen-age heartthrob happens to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a good script comes along, why should I refuse to
participate just because it is a telenovela?'' asked Fernanda
Montenegro, who was nominated for an Academy Award in 1999 for her
role in ``Central Station'' and is usually cast as an elegant
upper-class matron when she works in novelas. ``Why limit myself?
After all, Balzac, Dumas, Dickens and Dostoyevsky all wrote
serials.''
</P>
<P>
   The novela originated more than 50 years ago in Mexico as a
radio melodrama, but when television appeared the genre was quickly
adapted to the new medium and soon spread all over Latin America.
Every country from Argentina to Mexico now makes novelas, but
Brazil's tend to have larger casts and more elaborate plots and
sets _ thus attracting the biggest audiences, even though, as in
the case of ``Xica da Silva,'' they have to be dubbed from
Portuguese into Spanish for the rest of Latin America and for the
Spanish-language networks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Brazilian novelas more than any others because they
are so beautiful to look at,'' Maria Dolores Faundez, a Venezuelan
housewife, said in an interview in Caracas early this month. ``The
stories are wonderful too, but everything always looks so
luxurious. I especially like the way the characters dress and the
magnificent apartments they live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the popularity of Brazilian novelas may also stem from a
willingness to tackle controversial social and political themes
such as agrarian reform, racism, abortion, environmental
degradation, homosexuality and corruption, mixed in, of course,
with classic themes of jealousy, intrigue and betrayal. That
tendency has in large part been implanted by scriptwriters with
leftist sympathies who came to television in hopes of addressing a
mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telenovela is basically a distraction, and no one watches
it in order to be educated,'' Brazil's leading author of novelas,
the playwright and former Communist Party member Alfredo Dias
Gomes, said in an interview shortly before his death in an
automobile accident last year. ``But it is an instrument through
which you can denounce and point out the errors in a society, and I
have often done that and felt the public respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a striking boldness on sexual matters, including
generous doses of nudity, has also proved to have universal appeal.
``Brazilian television is the most liberal in the world,'' said
Daniel, who has worked in the medium since the 1960s. ``In terms of
open sexuality, nobody in the world shows what is shown on
Brazilian television. It is extremely bold, perhaps because of our
Carnival tradition and the procession of nudity and raw sexuality
that people have come to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the American market is the final frontier for
Brazil: since 1978, more than 80 different Brazilian novelas have
been exported to 119 different countries. A novela produced here,
``Isaura the Slave,'' is said to be the most popular television
program ever shown in China, and Brazilian novelas today are
broadcast as far afield as Indonesia, Russia, Chad, Turkey and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian television executives say that period costume dramas
that touch on themes of slavery or other social abuses tend to do
the best abroad, and ``Xica da Silva'' certainly fits that
description. A movie version directed by Carlos Diegues had already
been an international success in the 1970s, largely as a result of
the perforamnce of Zeze Motta, who ended up being cast as Xica's
mother in the novela.
</P>
<P>
   So for an unproven newcomer like Araujo, who was only 17 when
``Xica da Silva'' began taping, the chance to play a figure so
important in Brazilian folklore was both an unusual opportunity and
a daunting challenge. ``I turned the role down at first, because I
was scared and didn't think I was ready for it,'' she said in a
recent interview at her home here, shortly before heading off to
New York to study English. ``Xica is a legend in Brazil, and here I
was, just a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Xica da Silva'' was a conscious attempt to break
down an imposing social barrier. The majority of Brazil's
population may be of mixed race, but the ideal novela star, male or
female, is still someone who is light-skinned, preferably with
blond hair and blue or green eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first time that Brazilian television had a black
woman as the protagonist of a novela, so we were up against some
deeply ingrained prejudices,'' Avancini said. ``But Xica is one of
the first symbols of feminine liberation in Brazil and has become a
mythical Afro-Brazilian figure, and Tais had just the right
temperament, naughty but gutsy, to win over the public.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Xica da Silva'' was also unusual in that it was made by the
Manchete network and not by Rede Globo, which is both the largest
television network in Brazil and the largest privately owned
commercial network outside the United States. Globo's Projac
production center on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro is a vast $125
million facility that churns out programming at a pace and on a
scale that rivals a Hollywood studio.
</P>
<P>
   At any given moment, three of Globo's four giant soundstages are
being used to tape novelas that are currently on the air, using
props and sets that have been manufactured at shops on the
premises. The fourth stage is usually reserved for novelas that are
in the pre-production phase, comedy and variety programs or for
somewhat shorter versions of novelas called ``mini-series'' that
can run as many as 100 episodes, and there are also buildings on
the premises set aside for editing and special effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to producing novelas, Globo functions like a
Japanese factory that uses the just-in-time principle,'' said
Avancini, who now works for the network. ``Normally you like to
work well in advance, finishing an episode a couple of weeks before
it goes on the air, but sometimes you end up taping things that are
going to be broadcast in just a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   By working so close to broadcast date, Globo's novelas
department gains unusual flexibility. The network makes extensive
use of focus groups, whose recommendations are taken into account
in expanding roles of minor characters who suddenly become popular,
eliminating altogether characters that viewers do not like and even
extending particularly popular novelas beyond their original
length: ``Terra Nostra,'' about Italian immigrants in Sao Paulo,
ran a record 233 episodes before ending early this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 321-acre facility, which opened in 1995, also includes
outdoor areas for settings that tend to recur from one novela to
the next, such as the typical Latin American town square and church
or a big city at the turn of the century. When an Indian village
was needed for a series that was broadcast earlier this year,
Indians were even brought from the Amazon to build it.
</P>
<P>
   A visit one day earlier this month to Avancini's current
production, a costume drama called ``The Thorn and the Rose,''
found one unit shooting on an outdoors set made up to look like a
Sao Paulo street in 1927 while another was indoors on a soundstage
that recreated a rustic hacienda. For the actors involved, that can
mean a routine that is taxing and frantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have 29 scenes to shoot, and I am in almost all of
them,'' Eduardo Moscovis, who plays the male lead in ``The Thorn
and the Rose,'' said as he hurriedly ate a plate of cold pasta
during a short break. ``That's the way it is when you're right in
the middle of making a novela, but you learn to get used to that
rhythm, intense as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Avancini, Araujo is now under contract to Globo, and
quickly noticed the difference in atmosphere from her days at
Manchete, which recently declared bankruptcy. ``With `Xica da
Silva,' we had four months of readings and rehearsals before we
even began shooting, which is very unusual in Brazilian
television,'' she recalled. ``Globo doesn't have time for that.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than 30 years of experience and a total of 203
novelas produced in-house, the Globo formula and schedule contain
few surprises. The network's evening programming begins at 6
o'clock, often with a period piece like ``The Thorn and the Rose,''
which is a Brazilianized version of ``The Taming of the Shrew''
that is set in Sao Paulo in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 7 o'clock comes a comedy, the frothier the better. The
current offering, in which Araujo plays a small role, is called
``Uga Uga'' and tells the Tarzan-inspired tale of a handsome young
man raised in the jungle who returns to civilization, clad only in
a loincloth that allows him to continually show off his muscles to
a mainly female audience, in order to claim a family inheritance at
the behest of the Indian tribe that has sheltered him.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious piece of prime time, or ``the noble hour,''
as it is called here, comes at 9 p.m., after the nightly news _
which is broadcast at 8 p.m., several hours later than in the
United States _ and is reserved for a melodrama. At the moment,
``Lacos de Familia,'' or ``Family Ties,'' holds down the slot every
evening except Sunday, and on a good night, more than half the
television sets in this nation of 170 million people are tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Ties'' stars Vera Fischer, Brazil's leading sex symbol,
as a rich and glamorous Rio widow competing with her daughter for
the affections of a 25-year-old hunk. But according to the numerous
gossip magazines that track every detail of every novela, the
daughter will soon come down with leukemia and will need a bone
marrow transplant that can only be obtained from her father, who
she has been told died when she was 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The novela is what it is,'' Daniel said. ``You can change the
characters, but the stories remain basically the same, and the only
novelty you are likely to see is that today's novelas are more and
more technically polished. That is why I tend to agree with Peter
Bogdanovich when he says that the best movies have already been
made. The same is true of novelas.''
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, as new forms of entertainment such as the Internet
and satellite television emerge, critics predict the decline or
even disappearance of the genre. But Dias Gomes disagreed, saying
the novela ``cannot be substituted'' because it is too deeply
rooted a habit in Latin America, and Daniel agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the novela talks about things that are truly ours,
and the people identify immediately with the characters,'' he
explained. ``The novela is part of the daily routine of the
Brazilian people, and there is no way to deprive them of it.'' &QL;

MARKETPLACE: NO IMPACT FROM BROKER'S REPORTING FAILURE, REGULATORS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every month the National Association of Securities
Dealers compiles the short interest table for Nasdaq stocks, a
table that shows just how popular _ perhaps unpopular is a better
word _ a stock is with investors who bet on a decline in price. The
numbers are avidly scanned by investors and by the companies
themselves. Some investment strategies are based in part on those
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But how good are those numbers? Only as good as the reports from
brokerage firms, which are required to add up short positions of
their customers on all trades that have settled by the 15th of each
month. And it appears that the NASD is doing something less than a
stellar job of riding herd on the brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, NASD Regulation, the regulatory arm of the
association, announced that ETrade Securities, a large online
brokerage firm, had been fined $20,000 because it failed to file
such reports for 28 months, from June 1996 through September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   How did ETrade manage to go for more than two years without
reporting? The firm called it inadvertent and an NASD official
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Luparello, a vice president for market regulation of
NASD Regulation, said ETrade, like many other brokerage firms, had
arranged for the brokerage firm that clears its trades to do the
report.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, ETrade began to clear some of its own trades, but did
not realize that it had an obligation to make the reports, he said.
Nobody at the NASD noticed until 1998, when an examiner spotted the
failure during a routine examination of the firm, and referred the
matter to NASD Regulation, which began an investigation in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Luparello said that the NASD does make sure that every firm it
knows has an obligation to file such reports does so every month.
But any firm that is newly required to file will only be caught
during an examination, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sort of a technical administrative failure where they
didn't realize the obligation they had,'' Luparello. He added that
the numbers, which ETrade supplied after reviewing its records,
were ``not material'' to the Nasdaq short interest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures show the number of shares in each stock that have
been borrowed and sold short, but not yet repurchased, by the
reporting date.
</P>
<P>
   One reason to short a stock is to bet on its decline; others
include arbitrage involving differing securities issued by the same
company or involving two companies that are planning to merge.
</P>
<P>
   Luparello said that in the first month ETrade failed to file,
its customers had a short interest of 314,000 shares in 298
securities. By September 1998, the final month it failed to make
the report, the figure had grown to 1.4 million shares involving
749 companies, while the overall figure for all brokers was 2.15
billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Luparello said that NASD had decided not to update its
historical records after concluding the figures were not material
for any stock. He said that the NASD would not release the figures
for individual stocks because it had decided there was no need to
make the information public.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for ETrade could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty is the second in a few months that indicates ETrade
had a great deal of trouble in dealing with its explosive growth.
In May, NASD Regulation fined the brokerage firm, a subsidiary of
ETrade Group, $20,000 because it had failed to respond to NASD
requests for information concerning customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade shares rose 13 cents to $17.25 in Nasdaq trading Tuesday.
The company went public in August 1996 _ a month after it began
clearing some of its trades without complying with reporting
requirements _ at $2.63 a share, adjusted for subsequent splits,
and rose to a high of $72.25 in April 1999.

flew to an Arctic naval base Tuesday to face, and try to console,
the families of the crew of the submarine Kursk, which sank after
suffering a large explosion on August 12.
</P>
<P>
   The president's trip is one clear sign that the leaders of
today's Russia cannot ignore public opinion the way Soviet leaders
once could. So are the actions of several military commanders, who
have reacted to the startingly public outflow of anger and grief
with equally surprising public apologies.
</P>
<P>
   These gestures may mean little to relatives who were kept in the
dark about the fate of their loved ones during the bungled nine-day
rescue effort. But they provide a clue as to how much Russia has
changed, and how the Kursk tragedy may change it still more.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians, however, are inclined to see the government's
actions as a marker of what has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Many saw the accident as an object lesson on how little the
state cares about ordinary people's lives, and there is a segment
of the population who will always believe that the authorities are
covering up some terrible crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The navy is hiding the reason for the explosion, and delayed
the rescue so that none of the crew memebers would be alive to say
why the Kursk sank,'' said Viktor Sokirko, defense correspondent
for the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   When the navy balked at Western offers of help, Sokirko and many
others saw it as a continuation of another old Soviet tradition:
the secrets of Russia's most advanced submarine were more important
than the lives of some of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be hard to raise the nuclear submarine from the
bottom,'' wrote Vitkor Loshak in Moscow News. ``But it will be even
harder to return the trust between society and the authorities that
has drowned in the Barents Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   But other commentators do not believe that trust in Putin, which
was well over 70 percent just a few months ago, will suffer that
much.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that Putin's image makers have shown they can use
public opinion to their advantage _ they managed to turn an
unwinnable quagmire in Chechnya into a rallying cry that carried
Putin to the Kremlin. The president's meeting with the grieving
relatives could pull off a similar result.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way, Putin will show that he is not a heartless `Black
Colonel,' but a sincerely begrieved man, who understands that he
made a serious mistake,'' commented the Moscow daily Kommersant.
</P>
<P>
   The process began Tuesday. Russian television showed Putin,
dressed in a somber black suit with black shirt but no tie, meeting
with Irina Lyachina, the wife of the Kursk's commander, Captain
Gennady Lyachin. Later, the president had a long private session
with more than 500 victims' family members.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, which Putin has decreed an official day of mourning,
he is scheduled to sail to the area where the Kursk went down in
354 feet of water to commemorate the memory of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Putin's subordinates have followed his example by
publicly expressing their regret, a remarkable event in a country
where officials traditionally never say they are sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Admiral Vyacheslav Popov, commander of Russia's Northern Fleet,
begged forgiveness Thursday night for his failure to save the crew.
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev all but asked to be fired by
acknowledging that he had waited 12 hours before informing the
president of the accident in the crucial period when perhaps some
crew members still could have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are often cynical about the intentions of their
leaders, and it is too early to tell whether the belated reaction
to the Kursk sinking will change the way the authorities respond to
future disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that ``Black August,'' as this month has
become known because of the Kursk, the ongoing violence in
Chechnya, and a deadly bombing in central Moscow, has merely shown
that the state continues to be indifferent towards, and unable to
protect, its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more afraid about their lives, the worth of their
lives, the degree of protection against any kind of disaster,
whether it is an explosion in Moscow or a sub that sinks,'' said
Yevgeny Volk, director of the Moscow office of the Heritage
Foundation think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The television images of a mother who had sent her son to the
navy so that he would not have to fight in Chechnya, only to have
him die on the Kursk, have added to a general negative mood about
the military in a country where all young men are obliged to serve
at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to go to jail than to give your son to the fleet
or the army,'' commented Moscow News.
</P>
<P>
   It was Russia's mass media, which has complained of increasing
pressure from Putin's Kremlin to toe the party line, that gave
voice to the public anger. ``It was after all public opinion, about
the absence of which we have always complained, that forced the
president to break off his vacation and accept aid, from NATO of
all people,'' wrote Inna Rudenko in the newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda. It remains to be seen whether Putin will respond by
fostering more openness in government and the military, or with new
restrictions on the vulnerable media.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators expressed dismay that the former superpower
could not send its own divers to open a hatch on a Russian
submarine, and in the end had to ask Norwegian divers to do the
job. But another Komsomolskaya Pravda commentator said the Kursk
underlined a larger reality about post-Soviet Russian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't have the right wrench,'' said Vladimir
Mamontov. ``It's that we don't have a country. One ended, and the
next one hasn't yet been built.''

<P>
   Horror vacui _ fear of emptiness _ is the driving force in
contemporary American taste. Along with the commercial interests
that exploit this fear, it is the major factor now shaping
attitudes toward public spaces, urban centers and even suburban
sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Every public space must be packed with distractions. Food and
flower vendors, musicians, banners, fountains, benches and plants
must fill every mid-block plaza. They must be packed with young
urban professionals, picturesquely enjoying wrap sandwiches and
bottles of Evian water. Otherwise, it is a failure. Periodically,
photographs of empty spaces will be published. Captions will say:
these are failures.
</P>
<P>
   Streets are too empty. They must have more billboards, public
art or distinctive street furniture. Trees are too empty. They must
be hung with Christmas lights or signs identifying their species.
Train stations and airports are too empty. They must become
so-called destination places or be, in professional parlance,
packed with program _ specialty shops for chocolates, sunglasses,
lingerie and watches, along with eating spots featuring Mexican,
New England, Deli and Healthy cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban lawns are too empty. Houses must be built on smaller
lots. They must be filled up with the latest weed killers and lined
with free-form planting beds that are themselves filled with bags
of redwood chips. Iced tea is too empty. It must be lightly laced
with mango juice or it cannot be enjoyed. Water is too empty. It
must come flavored with orange, lime or wild cherry. This whole
package is called The New Urbanism.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the time has come to change the criteria for measuring
success. Emptiness may not be a quality to be feared. Perhaps the
Japanese are not the only people with the capacity to appreciate
the quality of a void. After all, there is often little difference
between a failed American public space and a Zen garden. Why
shouldn't we, too, learn to recognize the value of hollowness?
</P>
<P>
   Recently I have been revisiting Michelangelo Antonioni's classic
movies of the early 1960s _ ``L'Avventura,'' ``La Notte,''
``L'Eclisse'' and ``Red Desert.'' As much portraits of places as
they are essays in plot and character, they have lost none of their
power to convey fragmented social relationships and the oblique
urban environments in which human affairs unfold. Existential film
noirss, these movies portray a kind of space that remains useful in
the present moment of urban transformation: space noir. Emptiness
is its essential quality.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   I find ``L'Eclisse'' the most haunting. Monica Vitti and Alain
Delon hold the screen by virtue of their physical beauty, but the
entire movie seems like one big build-up to the final scene, in
which the two actors pointedly fail to appear. They have made
desultory plans to meet at ``the usual place,'' a highway
intersection on the outskirts of Rome. Vitti lives nearby, in a
modern flat.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the movie, the director contrasts this antiseptic,
postwar environment with the medieval streets of the historic
center. But he betrays no sentimental attachment to the ancient
city. Frank Lloyd Wright once condemned cities as places for
``mutual assignations and assassinations.'' That is roughly what
Antonioni shows us, too. Stock brokers slaughtering each other on
the floor of the Borsa. Lovers seducing and rejecting one another
all over town.
</P>
<P>
   In town, these passions are softened by the cafes, newsstands,
dim palazzo interiors, narrow streets, the weathered masonry of the
buildings lining them and other furniture from the attic of Old
World charm. In the modern outskirts, we still get the assignations
and assassinations, but we get them pure, without the comforting
distractions. Instead, the passive-aggression of phone calls and
traffic transpires amid the abstract geometry of the postwar
utopia.
</P>
<P>
   When new, Antonioni's movies were received in fairly
one-dimensional terms. They were thought to depict the malaise of
the modern world. The fragmented cityscapes and industrial
wastelands were even seen as causes of the sickness. In retrospect,
the disaffection of Antonioni's characters looks like a human
condition, not merely a modern one. There is no malaise, no need
for a cure. There is only an emotional reality to be confronted.
With what elegance, what style, Antonioni's characters face it!
Such exquisite doubt, such refined anxiety. What an artistic
gesture of refusal the pair make by not showing up _ not venturing
to disturb the noir composition of street lights and headlamps
blinking on at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Antonioni's cinematography was once criticized for being too
beautiful for his existential subject matter. Today, the beauty
holds the meaning. From an urban point of view, his movies are
premonitory fables. They anticipate the conversion of the rusting,
postindustrial metropolis into the increasingly aestheticized city
of art.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to see these movies again, after nearly 40 years, was
aroused by a group of projects that represent the most recent phase
of this conversion. I refer to the art parks or culture districts
now taking shape in Pittsburgh, downtown Los Angeles, Philadelphia,
Newark, Charleston and other cities nationwide. In New York, two
such projects are under way. In Brooklyn, an art zone is now being
planned for the area surrounding the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In
Manhattan, architects are now submitting bids for the redevelopment
of the buildings and open spaces at Lincoln Center, the grandparent
of all performing arts centers. These projects offer an opportunity
to rethink the criteria by which the success of public spaces is to
be judged.
</P>
<P>
   Many enlightened people helped shape the standards currently in
use. They include Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, Benjamin J.
Thompson, Kevin Lynch, Edward Logue and James Rouse. Thompson is
the undersung figure of the group, though he was the visionary who
first conceived what would later be called the festival
marketplace. Thompson was a young partner in the Architects
Collaborative, a Cambridge, Mass., firm established by Walter
Gropius. Later, he succeeded Gropius as dean of Harvard's Graduate
School of Design. Despite his modernist pedigree, Thompson
recognized that the modern vision of the city was flawed. In the
era of suburban exodus, the urban core was not sufficiently
alluring to attract people after work hours.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rem Koolhaas decades later, Thompson recognized the
potential of shopping to animate inert urban space. In the 1960s,
Thompson created the first of a chain of retail establishments,
called Design Research, that specialized in modern furniture and
accessories for the home. He also owned a restaurant in Harvard
Square. Faneuil Hall, the first of the Rouse-Thompson
collaborations, opened in 1976. With it, the new retail-populist
paradigm was launched.
</P>
<P>
   When creative responses become formulaic, they can stifle
creativity later on. Thompson's vision has suffered this fate. The
festival marketplace remains a useful concept for orchestrating
certain kinds of urban space. But its very success created new
problems in turn. For one thing, it displaced urban diversity with
a homogenized atmosphere of chain stores, coordinated street
furniture, banners and signs. As a controlled, commercial
environment, it eroded the distinction between the open urban
environment and such suburban places as like the shopping mall, the
theme park and the residential enclave. Consumerism, when working
properly, should increase access to the public realm. When applied
to public urban space, it raises invisible, exclusionary barriers.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why modern architecture's failed public spaces
are looking quite good these days. There's no pressure to spend $2
for a cookie. A stroll across Chase Manhattan Plaza, in lower
Manhattan, offers a refreshing vacation from distractions. You're
in the heart of a huge bank, but there are no commercial
interruptions. The emptiness is ideal for sorting out inner and
outer worlds. It's a democratic space, too. Democratic and popular
are not, after all, synonyms. There are moments, in fact, when the
two concepts are at odds. A city that offers the alternative of
unpopular spaces is more accessible than a city that only tolerates
popular success.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if failed space isn't more conducive to creativity.
This may be a romantic notion, but it's also a classical idea.
Think of Goethe pondering Roman ruins. Postindustrial cities that
are seeking to remake themselves as cultural centers might also
benefit from pondering the success of failure: the glamour of their
own collapse.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The aura of failure: this is what I find appealing about the
outdoor lighting system designed by Richard Gluckman and Robert
Wilson for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, a 16-block performing
arts district now being realized in downtown Pittsburgh. Using
theatrical scrims, natural light and artificial illumination,
Gluckman and Wilson have woven a discontinuous maze through the
districts back alleys. The lighting effects, a changing blend of
blue, green and white, have the phosphorescence of decay.
</P>
<P>
   The project serves a practical function. It's supposed to
reassure culture consumers that muggers and junkies aren't lurking
in the alleys. But instead of going merry and festive, the lighting
has a consumptive pallor. Gluckman designed Pittsburgh's Andy
Warhol Museum, and the noir spaces he designed with Wilson are
strikingly Warholian. Particularly as presented serially in
renderings (as it appears in a new monograph on Gluckman's work),
the design evokes Warhol's Shadow paintings of the late 1970s. The
lighting seems to shimmer between the pop extremes of obscurity and
fame. The light will make your skin look as bad as Andy's.
</P>
<P>
   Emptiness, obscurity, failure, bleakness, pallor _ such noir
terms are not found in the vocabulary of civic success with which
urban revitalization programs are typically promoted. But these
terms should be permissible wherever culture comes up. Even an
artist like Warhol, with all that diamond dust in his eyes, knew
that too much glitter is unhealthy for art.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democrat Al Gore struck flint, but no great
political fire, when he accepted the Democratic presidential
nomination at his party's national convention here last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, as is expected for all pols coming out of their
conventions, he bounced up in the polls. Thus, at long last, he got
the joy of leading his Republican opponent George W. Bush in some
of the better known polls.
</P>
<P>
   And, as those polls indicate, he recaptured a great chunk of the
traditional Dem base of liberals and women, which had been less
than enamored with him before his speech, widely billed as ``the
most important'' of his political life.
</P>
<P>
   But, that he had to devote so much of his effort to
accomplishing that does not bode politically well for Gore.
Especially if those who warmed to him because of his super-long
litany of political promises ever snap to wonder how those promises
will be kept _ a question many in the hall here apparently had.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if that crowd's acceptance of the speech Gore and many
of his operatives contend was filled with substance had only
approximated the passion demonstrated in the onstage embrace
between Gore and his wife, the veep would have greater cause for
political contentment.
</P>
<P>
   There is a peculiar trend growing in presidential politics this
year _ a trend strongly supported by many in the political press
and one the candidates simply love. In essence, it causes any mere
mention of any subject _ especially those of Gore's choosing _ to
be deemed substance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, of course, hardly is alone in playing that the promise to
favor positions is substantive. Bush seems to do it as well _ if
not nearly as extensively as Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But, not only is promise-making far from the truly substantive,
what Gore achieved with his promises is too restricted to be
considered far on the road to winning. For example, many think he
scored so well with women because he promised so many things that
appeal to them, such as prescription drug benefits for senior
citizens, affordable health care for all and his promise to
continue to provide Social Security benefits with no changes.
</P>
<P>
   Topics such as these do not become substantive until the
candidate reveals how he will achieve them and at what cost. That
is why it is, to use a word he favors, risky for Gore to base his
campaign on promises and in his derision for candidates with
personality and likability _ his allusion to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting to not being able to sustain a display of strongly
convincing leadership and likability ultimately is quite likely to
wear too thin to serve Gore well. For example, though he evidently
played fairly well on the tube, the veep failed to genuinely excite
those in the hall with his rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest signals of this came in the comments of delegates
leaving even as the Democrats' version of a four-day
infomercial/political extravaganza was gaveled to a close.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke of their plans for the evening ahead, their
transportation schedules home, the parties they attended, the basic
thrill of a political convention for political junkies and of their
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was one lone man who announced to the clutch of
friends with whom he was walking, ``Listen, for Gore, that was
really pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   It was this sentiment that prevailed when folk were questioned.
Some were more enthusiastic, several quite emphatic, most rather
calmly observant, in thinking the veep's delivery was quite good _
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most ardent of Democrats, however, were inclined to
think Gore's speech was considerably longer than it actually was
and much lacking in comparison to the one delivered by Bill Clinton
the opening night.
</P>
<P>
   To Gore's rhetorical credit, however, it can be said he did
about as good a job as possible of trying to associate himself with
the great economy the country has experienced in Clinton's tenure,
yet working to disassociate himself from the many peccadilloes
associated with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, it is the latter that has caused the Gores to engage in
a fantastic number of displays of ardent affection _ as though such
will convince the American electorate this year's Democratic ticket
absolutely is committed to unwavering monogamy.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a far greater fool than even a ragtag political writer
stuck in the smog of California to flatly _ thus, madly _ predict
the outcome of a presidential election weeks down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one can't help but wonder: How many more of the most
important political moments of his life can Al Gore have this year?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it was his convention speech. This week, the Dems are
looking toward the presidential debates. &QL;

A COLLECTOR WHOSE PASSION IS SAVING OLD HOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 27)   By RITA REIF  
 &HT;     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ Lars Sjoberg dates his obsession with old
Swedish houses to 1951, when, at age 10, his mother gave him a book
from his grandfather's library on manors and villas from centuries
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two years after that, I was always drawing houses and
making models of them,'' he said. ``And some looked like the
earliest and smallest of the six I own today, a red timber house
called Sorby in a tiny village of that name.''
</P>
<P>
   Built like an American log cabin in the 17th century, Sorby,
about 130 miles southwest of here, was updated a century later to
look like a manor house: the windows were enlarged and the grass
roof replaced by a mansard roof, with small glass panes in the
short wall between the two levels, to admit light into the attic.
``In some ways it's my favorite house,'' Sjoberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people collect Hula-Hoops, cookie jars, Japanese screens or
even racing cars; Sjoberg collects houses. What began as a
childhood fancy became a reality when he needed places to live, and
it evolved into a compulsion when he saw old houses about to be
torn down.
</P>
<P>
   His passion to save houses is perhaps rooted in his father's
belief that he could make and repair most anything. His father
taught wood and metal crafting at the boarding school near
Stockholm that Lars Sjoberg and his two sisters attended and where
the family lived. ``He taught me that everything is possible for a
carpenter,'' Sjoberg said. ``I'm trying but not always
succeeding.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sjoberg was a teen-ager, the family built a simple modern
house near the school. ``Even then, I longed for something
old-fashioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His interest deepened when he studied art history and
architecture at Stockholm University. After he graduated in 1965
and became an assistant curator of art at the National Museum, he
grew even more determined to make old houses part of his life. So
he and his bride, Ursula, also a budding art historian, began
living in a timber house on his family's property while they hunted
for an old manor house they could call home.
</P>
<P>
   The first house Sjoberg bought, 35 years ago, was Regnaholm, a
splendid 18th-century white and yellow manor house that he now says
was too large, too expensive and too distant from Stockholm _ 120
miles southwest in Ostergotlund. But the house was facing
demolition, so he and his family pooled their resources and bought
it as a vacation house. At the time, Swedish preservationists were
not yet protesting the razing of 18th-century buildings because, as
Sjoberg said, many still existed and preserving old houses seemed
elitist to those campaigning for low-cost housing.
</P>
<P>
   The couple searched for nine years before they found their
perfect house, Odenslunda, a five-room manor house in Uppland, only
18 miles from Stockholm. Built in 1775 for the military, it was,
Sjoberg said, ``the largest type made for a colonel.'' The house
was made of timbers, stone and bricks and covered with wooden
vertical siding and had an attic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sjoberg, 59, a senior curator at the museum, uses his
houses, built between 1680 and 1830, for his workshops on
architectural restoration, a program he conducts for Stockholm
University. In addition to manors, he owns an 18th-century
Italianate villa, an 1830s country inn and an 1810 building that
housed the families of factory workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Sjoberg was a consultant to Ikea and designed
a line of traditional Swedish furniture, lighting and accessories
for the chain. He has written several books on Swedish furniture;
his best-known work, ``The Swedish Room,'' a collaboration with
Sjoberg, who is now a curator of the Royal Collections, includes
four of their houses.
</P>
<P>
   All of Sjoberg's houses reflect the French-influenced Gustavian
style of the 18th century. The look was shaped in part by the
architect Carl Harleman, who had visited Versailles before
designing the interiors of the Royal Palace in Stockholm. He
brought back to Sweden the mansard roof, tall narrow multipaned
windows, crystal chandeliers, pastel and white color schemes,
neo-Classical furnishings, floral patterned fabrics and wallpapers
and gilded rococo embellishments.
</P>
<P>
   This style flourished in Swedish palaces and homes, and lives on
in turn-of-the-century paintings by Carl Larsson and in the films
of Ingmar Bergman. Lars Sjoberg is also reviving the style in the
rooms of palaces he has decorated and the houses he has collected,
using techniques he learned from master craftsmen decades ago or
discovered on his own or through teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``My students, all 20 of them, practice restoration,'' he said.
``They are learning how to mix plaster and apply it thinly to the
walls the way they did in the 18th century.'' They also stucco
ceilings and dismantle and reassemble porcelain stoves to repair
them. The most difficult task, he says, is scraping layers of paint
from walls, to get down to the original surfaces. ``You have to
know what you should look for _ not the raw wood, but the first
layer of paint,'' he said. ``And you have to know what to do with
what you find: don't repaint the wall. Instead, when you strip off
the layers, leave the original painted surface, worn though it may
seem.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret to restoration, he said, often has more to do with
what you remove than what you add. The windows at Regnaholm, he
says, still have the original glass panes. Nearly clear but lightly
tinted green, they produce a wondrous light when left uncovered on
sunny days.
</P>
<P>
   ``And at Sorby, all the rooms still have the painted canvas wall
decoration, from 250 years ago, faded but intact,'' he said. ``The
Gustavian lightness is back again.''

<P>
   Luckily for them, most politicians and journalists left for home
Friday after the Democratic National Convention. A headline on the
front page of Saturday morning's Los Angeles Times would have sent
many of them back to bed with a migraine.
</P>
<P>
   It said: ``2004 Conventions May Run Longer as Focus Shifts to
Cable, Local TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight nights of primarily pre-scripted pablum (four in
Philadelphia for the Republicans, four on the West Coast for the
Democrats) hadn't been enough? An extension of the exquisite
torture was not what many in the political class had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Network coverage hit a historic low and viewership, too,
cratered _ the worst for the quadrennial wingdings since Nielsen
started keeping score back in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   But taking their cue from the glut of weightlifting, cookware
and cosmetics informercials flooding the airwaves, some party
leaders see merit in making the national conventions lengthier,
even more packaged and increasingly targeted. It's called
``narrowcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Add in the Internet and you have the new frontier in convention
planning.
</P>
<P>
   The national parties as well as the state and local political
honchos (especially candidates who have to fight for television
attention back home) like the largely uncritical coverage served up
by many local television reporters and even some of the national
cable broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Cable plays along because it has a gaping maw of a schedule to
fill, and many local TV stations and their correspondents don't
seem to know any better.
</P>
<P>
   But why just add a night or two to the current schedule?
</P>
<P>
   Why go to bed at all? Run those sessions round the clock. Surely
there's a big insomniac vote. Make conventions look like a Jerry
Lewis telethon. There are some politicians who will get up at any
hour to go on TV. (Note to Sen. Phil Gramm and Rep. Sheila Jackson
Lee: Don't set your alarm clocks. I'm just joking about this.)
</P>
<P>
   But don't laugh. The L.A. Times caught Democratic Rep. Ron Klink
of Pennsylvania, who's after a Republican-held Senate seat, getting
up one morning last week at 1:30 a.m. and hitting the convention
center at 3 a.m., California time, just so he could do a 6 a.m.
morning show back in Johnstown-Altoona, one of his home state's
medium-sized media markets.
</P>
<P>
   And why just one city? If Republicans this year had a rolling
roll call of the states, why can't there be a rolling convention?
Start about Memorial Day in Portland, Maine, hit the population
center of the nation (some burg in Missouri) around July Fourth and
then wrap up Labor Day weekend on the beach in Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   And because fund-raising is such an integral part of the
convention landscape, it may be time to revisit the idea of having
corporately sponsored events, such as the General Motors Pledge to
the Flag, the Boeing Co. Attack Night or the American Federation of
Teachers Acceptance Speech.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties quickly cottoned to the voracious needs of cable as
well as to the increasing (and, remember, uncritical) appetite of
many local network affiliates around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Andrew Card, the architect of the Republican show,
sensed there was a synergistic prospect in blending the
pre-convention, convention and post-convention show, and the Bush
campaign signed off happily.
</P>
<P>
   Card played what became known as a four-four-four strategy:
planning a largely repetitive four days of warm-up, four days of
convention and four days of postlude. It was a variation on the old
drum-it-in dictum of radio news: Tell 'em what you're going to tell
'em. Tell 'em. Then tell 'em what you told them.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans updated the design of the media stands in First
Union Center to provide plenty of positions for local TV stations.
Stanley Stiffhair could do his live shot back to Keokuk with the
GOP podium in the background, and it wasn't obvious to homefolks
that he was two inches from Gloria Goldentonsils who was warbling
for viewers in Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats zapped the heavens with multiple satellite uplinks to
beam local candidates back up to hometown television stations.
</P>
<P>
   And we just thought that the biggest smooch at the conventions
was Tipper's and Al's.

   INCHON, South Korea _ About 15 years ago, Bai Eun-shik swallowed
his pride and got himself a permanent wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started noticing that I didn't have a lot of hair, and what
was left wasn't so thick or strong,'' Bai said. ``I thought a perm
would help.''
</P>
<P>
   Today that perm, carefully maintained over the years, has helped
in ways Bai never dreamed of, although his colleagues at the
insurance company where he used to work picked up on the potential
of his hairdo long ago. With it Bai, 53, is a dead ringer for the
58-year-old Kim Jong Il of North Korea, who over the six years
since the death of his autocratic father, Kim Il Sung, has emerged
to become the unlikely darling of the global media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I think I'm better looking,'' Bai said. He batted
his eyelashes behind the tinted sunglasses that, together with a
simple, dun worker's suit, are the hallmarks of the Kim Jong Il
look. ``I have prettier eyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's slimmer, too, but is trying to beef up a bit around the
middle, the better to replicate Kim Jong Il's slight paunch.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the landmark summit meeting in June between Kim Jong
Il and South Korea's president, Kim Dae-jung, Bai won a Kim Jong Il
look-alike contest sponsored by the Sun Woo Corp., which was using
the meeting to drum up business for its matchmaking services.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the resemblance has led to lucrative advertising
contracts for Bai _ a paradox, since advertising is such a
blatantly capitalist concept.
</P>
<P>
   He can currently be seen hawking a high-tech phone service that
North Koreans would probably find otherworldly, given that their
country's communications system has not been upgraded since the
1950s and its people have virtually no access even to rotary dial
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Bai clearly finds his uncanny resemblance to the Dear Leader, as
Kim Jong Il is called in North Korea, amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to appear in a way that inspires respect,'' he said,
``because I want to contribute to the thaw in relations between our
two countries and support it.''
</P>
<P>
   His Kim Jong Il suit, with its distinctive zip-front jacket, is
tailor-made. The pants are slightly too long because Kim Jong Il
reportedly wears his pants long to cover the lifts in his shoes.
The outfit puts him on the cutting edge of fashion here. An average
of six people a day buy Kim-Jong-Il-style sunglasses at the Midopa
Department Store in Seoul, according to a spokeswoman, Jung
So-yeun, who said the store was planning to offer other
Kim-Jong-Il-related items.
</P>
<P>
   Next month Bai is scheduled to begin work on a movie,
tentatively titled ``1004 Days,'' in which he will play Kim. ``I've
been very busy,'' Bai said.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is set in 2003, with North and South in a federation
suddenly confronted with a financial crisis somewhat similar to the
one that rocked the South Korean economy less than three years ago.
As the federation slides toward economic disaster, hardliners on
both sides start agitating to split it apart. Kim Jong Il and Kim
Dae-jung must fight to keep the peninsula united.
</P>
<P>
   After the first across-the-border family gathering last week
aimed at healing the human wounds wrought by the Korean War,
eventual reunification of the peninsula does not seem as
far-fetched as it was even three months ago. And since the June
summit meeting, Kim Jong Il has embarked on a shrewd campaign to
burnish his image, proving himself deft at the sharp, witty retort
and a master at affable but intelligent rapports. Once regarded as
one of the most reclusive and insular leaders, he has become an
overnight sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to beat him to death with my bare hands,''
said Kim Kyung-ho, a taxi driver in Seoul, ``but over the last
several weeks that feeling has faded. Now it seems that one word
from Kim Jong Il can make anything happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his startling mastery of spin, Kim continues to reveal
himself as a shrewd politician. His mercurial joviality and
on-again, off-again proposals for ending the state of war that has
persisted here for half a century bring an ``Alice in Wonderland''
quality to the efforts to bring the countries together.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, for instance, he surprised many around the world when
he told a delegation of visitors from the South Korean media that
he had been joking when he told the Russian president, Vladimir
Putin, that he would scrap North Korea's missile development if the
United States helped his country launch satellites.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to relish the notion that the proposal might have
given the United States ``a bad headache,'' the South Korean media
reported.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has a history of slighting citizens who resemble its
own political leaders, as Bai well knows, having recently met an
actor who looks like the former South Korean strongman Chun
Doo-hwan. ``He told me he has sometimes had difficulty getting
work,'' Bai said.
</P>
<P>
   Men resembling other former South Korean autocrats, Roh Tae-woo
and Park Chung-hee, have had similar complaints. But Bai does not
worry that Kim's capriciousness could hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he is perceived in political circles,'' Bai
said, ``but among ordinary people, he's been very well received,
and these family reunions only enhance that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bai has his own plans for fostering continuing reconciliaton. He
is certain that travel between the countries will become far
easier, and when it does he would like to begin cultivating
environmental awareness in his North Korean neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard there's deforestation there,'' he said, ``and
that's a problem we can help address.''
</P>
<P>
   He said North Korean agents seeking a stand-in for the Dear
Leader had never contacted him, but he confessed a desire for a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have to meet him, at least once,'' Bai said. ``And
judging from his style, I feel sure he'll call me.''

CANDIDATES EXPRESS DIFFERING VIEWS ON TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ill. _ George W. Bush said Tuesday that ``I've got to do
a better job'' of making the case for his $1.3 trillion tax cut
proposal, even as a GOP congressman questioned public support for
it and Vice President Al Gore charged ``it would wreck our good
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Ray LaHood of Illinois introduced Bush at a
boisterous airport rally in this battleground state, but in an
interview later, he gave lukewarm support to the tax plan. ``I
think there's some appetite for it. But I think he should also be
talking about, `I want to be able to pay down the debt, too.' I
think that is problematic for people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been sharply critical of Bush's proposal, which is more
than double the $500 billion in targeted tax cuts he has proposed,
saying it would disproportionately benefit the rich, prevent Social
Security reforms, and leave the $5.6 trillion national debt
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism has prompted a more vigorous defense of the tax
proposal this week from the Bush team, including Bush's unprompted
declaration Tuesday that ``I'm not changing my opinion on it,
because it's the absolute right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore criticized the tax cut again as he also attacked
Bush on different front. During a speech in Milwaukee to the
convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, he accused Bush of
trying to ``run down America's military for political advantage in
an election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a VFW hat attesting to his service as an Army reporter
in Vietnam, Gore replied: ``Since the day I founded the Vietnam-era
Caucus in Congress, I have never stopped fighting for an
unshakeable national commitment to our veterans. It's that
year-after-year commitment to a strong American defense that makes
me so concerned when others try to run down America's military for
political advantage in an election year.''
</P>
<P>
   He added to applause: ``It's not only wrong in fact; it's the
wrong message to send our allies and adversaries across the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Gore campaign released a biographical TV ad that
begins with Gore's decision to enlist and volunteer for duty
overseas. Bush served as a fighter pilot in the Texas Air National
Guard and served stateside.
</P>
<P>
   The ad will run in 17 closely contested states and cost about
$5.5 million. Last week the Bush campaign launched its first pair
of general-election ads.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his tax comments in response to a general question
from reporters about why he thought he could do well in
traditionally Democratic states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got ideas on issues that people are concerned about, like
education and strengthening the military, a tax-relief package that
says to the people we're going to give you some of your own money
back. I've got to do a better job of making it clear,'' he said on
his campaign plane.
</P>
<P>
   The federal budget surplus is projected to total nearly $4.6
trillion over the next 10 years, even after accounting for $3.3
trillion in growth of existing government programs, Bush and his
aides pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed splitting up the $4.6 trillion surplus, which
includes $2.3 trillion in Social Security trust funds, by leaving
the Social Security money alone; spending $1.3 trillion on a
10-year, across-the-board tax cut; and leaving the remaining $1
trillion in reserve for new government programs, debt repayment or
federal emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes accused Gore of ``trying to muddy
the waters'' by saying that the tax cut would affect existing
government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that many American people do not realize exactly how
much additional spending is already budgeted and how much on top of
that additional spending is the surplus announced for over the next
10 years, and that is the point that the governor wants to make,''
Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood repeatedly labeled the tax plan ``ambitious'' and ducked
when asked if a smaller tax cut would be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's made a decision on this and he's decided what
it's going to be, and when he gets elected president, then
obviously other people are going to weigh in on it, including
members of Congress,'' LaHood said.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman added: ``I think it does resonate with some
people, but I think the issue of paying down the debt also
resonates.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance for the veterans appeared to heighten
awareness of his military record. Some in the convention hall said
they hadn't even known, until the vice president mentioned it, that
he had been in Vietnam, and that it affected their view of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was leaning toward Mr. Bush, but I don't know now,'' said
Korean War veteran Jerry Litzau, 71, of Brown Deer, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   But many veterans said they didn't care what Bush and Gore did
during the war. More important, they said, was what each man would
do for veterans if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's biggest applause line came when he pledged to raise pay
for military servicemen and to improve their housing and
educational opportunities.
</P>

<P>
   GUSAU, Nigeria _ When Yusuf Oumar saw early this year that this
state's politicians were adopting Islamic Shariah law and planning
to enforce it by segregating schools and taxis, not to mention
caning drinkers and amputating thieves, he made the only sensible
decision he could think of: He moved here.
</P>
<P>
   Oumar, a 37-year-old petty trader, packed up his goods and his
family, leaving the center of this West African nation for Gusau,
the capital of the small, formerly obscure state of Zamfara, in the
dusty northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Delighted with this place, he has recently built a house here
and set up shop in the middle of town in a new market populated by
recent arrivals like himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Shariah,'' Oumar said the other day, behind a table
laden with gadgets with seemingly familiar names like ``Suny'' tape
recorders and ``Naiwa'' radios.
</P>
<P>
   Oumar explained that no one cheated, stole or haggled in the
market thanks to the Islamic legal code. ``But even now our Shariah
is not yet like the one in Saudi Arabia. But in time _ by the grace
of God _ it will be like that. Small, small.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Zamfara, seven other states have embraced the laws of the
Koran in predominantly Muslim areas of northern Nigeria. The latest
one, Borno, held a ceremony to adopt it on Saturday, a week before
President Clinton's scheduled visit to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   If this state is a harbinger, this country of 36 states divided
uneasily between Muslims and Christians seems likely to experience
a hardening of those divisions. In a development that risks further
undermining the fragile unity of Nigeria and its 15-month-old
democracy, Muslims have been moving into the Shariah states and
Christians moving out, according to interviews here and with
officials from other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Since a series of deadly religious clashes in the north
recently, many Christians have relocated to Jos, a traditionally
Christian city and geographically the closest to the predominantly
Muslim north, said Rima Shawulu, an aide to the House speaker, Umar
Ghali Na'Abba. The influx was raising rent and land prices, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear of the Christian population is widening the
Christian-Muslim gulf,'' said Shawulu, who commutes to Jos on
weekends from Abuja, the capital. ``Increasingly, it's becoming
difficult to have common ground. That is why it is fearful when we
think of national integration in the context of this gulf.''
</P>
<P>
   It was late last year that the ambitious politicians in this
state, backed by powerful northerners fallen out of favor in the
government of President Olusegun Obasanjo, began calls for Shariah.
The move proved so popular that other Muslim politicians, who had
initially dismissed Zamfara, could not but follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are using Shariah to create problems for the
Obasanjo government, either Muslims who have lost relevance in the
north or Christians who are calling for sovereignty in the south,''
said Yahaya Mahmood, the lawyer for a Muslim organization in the
north.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim leaders have politicized Shariah, Mahmood said, while
the Christians have used it to inspire fear among their followers
and stoke separatist sentiments. Nigeria's desperate poverty,
resulting from successive governments that have stolen the
country's oil money, provided the ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was enough to eat, nobody would riot,'' Mahmood said.
``What we need is good government and sincere leadership.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nigeria has been blessed with little of either. In the
religiously mixed state of Kaduna, where thousands were killed in
riots after the state's leaders said they were considering Shariah,
Christians have gravitated to the south and Muslims to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard this area was all Christian,'' said Simon Tyonongo, a
new arrival to a neighborhood called Sabon Tasha. Tyonongo, a
jobless 40-year-old, who said he had lived until recently in a
mixed northern neighborhood, sat recently by a roadside in front of
two gutted houses. ``You see the Muslim houses there. They are all
burned and they are no longer staying here. It's better here for
me. I feel free.''
</P>
<P>
   Shariah has long been in effect among Muslims in the northern
states, as local religious leaders referred to it to decide on
personal matters like marriage and inheritance. While governments
played little role in its enforcement in the past, they are the
ones pushing it forward today.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Gusau, the government of Zamfara state has implemented
policies that now affect all areas of life: schools,
transportation, hotels, restaurants and criminal matters. In the
most famous case, a man who stole a cow was convicted in Shariah
court and had a hand cut off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He confessed, so there was no doubt at all,'' said Mahmud
Aliyu Shinkafi, the state's deputy governor, in an interview inside
his office here.
</P>
<P>
   Like all politicians who have moved toward Shariah, Shinkafi
emphasized that the law would apply only to Muslims, never to the
Christian minority living in Zamfara. This, he said, was not a move
toward an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, just outside his office, construction workers were
building a mosque with public money. A couple of miles away, in the
compound of the deputy governor's official residence, workers were
doing the same. The deputy governor's aides said they simply needed
a place to pray.
</P>
<P>
   Under Shariah, Shinkafi said, gambling, prostitution and crime
had nearly vanished. ``We had no armed robbery for 4 months,'' he
said, adding that it was only robbers from neighboring Kaduna state
who had recently slipped inside state lines to commit an offense.
``This is a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews in Gusau suggested that most Muslims shared his
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   At the market, Abdulmmounu Mohammed, 35, was another trader who
had moved here after Shariah. ``We're enjoying it _ we have
peace,'' Mohammed said, explaining that in Kaduna, where he had
lived previously, his business had suffered. ``There were armed
robberies and stealing.''
</P>
<P>
   About the amputation of the cow thief, he added: ``People were
happy over it. The majority of the people here supported it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At another market, traders said Shariah had raised sales by
raising morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before when men collected their salary, they would spend it on
prostitutes or beer,'' said Ahmed Salis, 27, who sells plastic
containers. ``Now they come here with their wives and buy things
for the family.'' His sales had at least doubled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another trader, Ibrahim Lawal, 25, said he himself had turned
over a new leaf. ``This Shariah encouraged me to get married,''
Lawal said, adding that in another year or so he expected his
15-year-old wife to bear him a child.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of town, Halima Mamman, 55, was walking along
Gusau's biggest street, with her 7-year-old grandson in tow. Mamman
had moved from a village in the state to the capital here six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come here to the headquarters of Shariah,'' she
said. She strongly supported changes such as forbidding women to
ride on motorcycle taxis, called kabu-kabu.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision against kabu-kabu,'' she said, ``is in order for
the simple reason that Islam forbids women from touching any man
apart from her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred feet away, a group of girls had been waiting for
at least half an hour for a women-only taxi to pass by. The girls,
students at the government's Girls Arabic Secondary School, covered
their heads and faces with their shawls and hands. ``It has no
effect on us,'' one of them said of Shariah.
</P>
<P>
   Moving around town had become even harder for Christian women.
Forbidden from entering public taxis or buses, as well as
women-designated taxis unless they covered their heads, they relied
mostly on Christian kabu-kabu drivers. But they were often
difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we trek,'' explained Victorian Jonathan, a waitress here.
``I want to leave. I don't like the state. It's not good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Christians had already left, not only from this state, but
also from the others that have taken up the Koran, said officials
in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has bedeviled us, particularly at this time of
democracy,'' said Barminas Yilkes, 45, a congressman from Plateau
state, which include Jos, the city where many Christians had moved
to in recent months. ``Really, the effect is bad. You cannot live
in isolation and develop properly in a modern world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim generals who ruled Nigeria for most of its
post-colonial history had understood the divisiveness of Shariah.
And they had quickly suppressed calls for it in the past, viewing
it as challenge both to them and national unity.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Shariah seems to be weakening several of the policies
that had been undertaken to stitch together Nigeria after the
Biafran war, in which 1 million Nigerians were killed when the Ibo
tried to secede.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, university students have been required to spend
their first year after graduation serving in an area of the country
other than their own. In recent months, though, many Christian
graduates have left the Shariah states, or simply refused to go
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not allow my daughter to serve in the north,'' said
Dorcas Odujinrin, a Congresswoman from Lagos. ``It does not make
sense to train her and then send her to the den of the lion.''
Shariah, she added, ``is an infringement on the rights of women. It
is an oppressive system against everybody, especially women.''

FINDING ART IN RANDOM IMAGES IS AS OLD AS ART ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 27)  
 By MILES UNGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Jackson Pollock first lifted his brush from the
canvas and allowed paint to drip in tangled skeins across the
surface, or Jean Arp and Marcel Duchamp began to experiment with
chance procedures, they sought in the accidental and unpredictable
the means to shatter the stale conventions of art making. So, too,
Surrealists like Andre Masson and Juan Miro, who allowed their pens
to wander over the page in the belief that they would discover in
those doodles the ghosts of their own repressed imaginations. What
these artists _ all currently featured at the Museum of Modern Art
as part of the show ``Making Choices'' _ hoped to attain was
freedom, from the past, from academic formulas, and the random act
was their declaration of independence.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption was that the old masters were a more plodding
bunch, perfecting their craft only through years of patient study.
But a closer examination of the art of the past reveals that
artists _ and writers on art _ have long recognized the importance
of the unintended and unexpected in the creative process.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier centuries placed a greater emphasis on discipline, but
sometimes a masterpiece was born with an inadvertent splash or in a
moment of aesthetic pique. The first-century Roman writer Pliny the
Elder tells the story of the artist Protegenes, who became
frustrated with his efforts to paint a dog foaming at the mouth:
``Finally he fell into a rage with his art . . . and dashed a
sponge against the place in the picture that offended him . . . and
chance produced the effect of nature in the picture!''
</P>
<P>
   Here, the rage-induced splatter achieved what no amount of
careful planning could, a faithful rendering of animal fury.
Similar stories abound in other traditions. A ninth-century Chinese
treatise on painting describes the artist Wang Mo, ``who excelled
in splattering ink to paint landscapes.'' The chronicler continues
with a description that will sound familiar to audiences acquainted
with the biographies of more recent artists: ``There was a good
deal of wildness in him, and he loved wine. Whenever he wished to
paint a hanging scroll, he would first drink, then after he was
drunk he would splatter ink. Laughing or singing, he would kick at
it with his feet or rub it with his hands ... According to the
forms and appearances, he would make mountains and rocks, clouds
and water.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories like this _ or another told of the 12th-century painter
Cheng Kang-chung, who also preferred to make his ink-blot paintings
after a few stiff drinks _ show that the myth of artist as savage
is not an invention of the Romantic era.
</P>
<P>
   For the Chinese chronicler, as for more modern biographers,
vitality of expression is often the gift of the untamed soul. But
it need not be the product of uncontrolled passion. One artist who
tried to systematize the use of the fortuitous mark was the English
landscape painter Alexander Cozens, whose 1785 how-to manual, ``A
New Method of Assisting the Invention in Drawing Original
Compositions of Landscape,'' recommends covering the page with
random ink blots, ``to draw forth ideas of an ingenious mind
disposed to the art of designing.'' The ink blots suggest new forms
to the mind in a manner similar to the Rorschach test, whose
deliberate ambiguity serves to draw out the patient's own fantasies
or obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   While Cozens' goal was not to probe the psychology of the
artist, he knew that indeterminate forms could unlock the inner
workings of the mind. ``There is a singular advantage peculiar to
this method,'' he declared, ``which is, that from the rudeness and
uncertainty of the shapes made in blotting, one artificial blot
will suggest different ideas to different persons; on which account
it has the strongest tendency to enlarge the powers of invention.''
</P>
<P>
   Cozens, like the Surrealists a century and a half later,
understood that ambiguity gave rise to individuality. In its
dismissal of convention and promotion of idiosyncratic invention,
this treatise is an important early salvo in the nascent Romantic
revolt.
</P>
<P>
   E.H. Gombrich, who wrote extensively on the role of the accident
in his book ``Art and Illusion,'' stressed that ambiguity is the
main ingredient in all such techniques. But mere ambiguity is not
enough to explain the efficaciousness of these forms, which suggest
profound affinities among the psychological, the natural and the
creative. Leonardo da Vinci, whom Cozens cites as the inspiration
for his own pedagogical technique, uses similarly muddled forms for
the purpose of ``arousing the mind to various inventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo's preferred method was not to hurl and splatter at
random but to find suggestive forms in nature itself. In a famous
passage from his ``Treatise on Painting,'' Leonardo encourages the
aspiring landscape painter seek inspiration in natural forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at any walls spotted with various stains or with a
mixture of different kinds of stones,'' he wrote. ``If you are
about to invent some scenes, you will be able to see in it a
resemblance to various different landscapes adorned with mountains,
rivers, rocks, trees, plains, with valleys and various groups of
hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo's method differs from Cozens' in that he seeks out the
accidental in the world around him rather than improvising it on
the page. But, as Gombrich asserts: ``It matters less whether the
initial form into which the artist projects the image is man-made
or found. What matters is what he can make of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``found accident'' shifts the focus from the world of the
mind to the world of nature. Gombrich finds a remarkable parallel
to Leonardo's method in a passage by an 11th-century Chinese
artist, Sung Ti, who recommended that to achieve a ``natural
effect'' in landscape, the painter should throw a piece of silk
over an old wall and study its bumps and hollows. It is not
surprising that the found landscape plays a central role in Chinese
art, which, heavily influenced by Taoist beliefs, proclaims the
unity of all nature. The purest embodiment of these beliefs is the
so-called scholar's rocks, naturally occurring stones _ sometimes
minimally ``improved'' through human intervention _cherished for
their capacity to conjure in their crags and hollows whole
landscapes or mythical beasts. Robert Mowry, writing in ``Worlds
Within Worlds: The Richard Rosenblum Collection of Chinese
Scholars' Rocks,'' explains: ``Like a landscape painting, the rock
represented a microcosm of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a single stone standing as a cosmos-in-miniature
is intimately bound up with the Taoist world view, but this feeling
for the indivisibility of nature is not confined to the Eastern
tradition. An intriguing echo can be found in a treatise on
painting an the early 15th-century follower of Giotto, Cennino
Cennini.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter titled ``The Way to Copy a Mountain from Nature,''
Cennini advises. ``If you wish to acquire good style for mountains,
and to have them look natural, get some large stones, rugged, and
not cleaned up; and copy them from nature, applying the lights and
the darks as your system requires.''
</P>
<P>
   Though this passage is often quoted as an example of the
artificiality of medieval studio practice, it reveals an
understanding of how a single set of principles runs through all
nature, from the microscopic to the monumental, a belief that
Leonardo would certainly have found congenial. Like the Chinese
scholar, the medieval Italian painter was able, to borrow William
Blake's famous line, ``to see infinity in a grain of sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the mottled forms of the ink spatter or the
convoluted topography of a water-carved stone are suggestive enough
to stimulate the imagination and open-ended enough to allow for an
almost infinite variety of readings.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are not made deliberately they do not come with
assigned meanings. Rather, it is we _ artist and viewer _ who must
make sense of them, bringing our own experience and personalities
to bear.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the accidental form as both a diagnostic tool in
psychology and a creative tool in art testifies to the mind's need
to organize random data into meaningful configurations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether deliberately fashioned, sought out or merely stumbled
upon, such forms traffic simultaneously in the universal and the
deeply personal. They are both liberating in their capacity to
stimulate our creative faculties and tyrannical in their insistence
that wherever we look, we will only see ourselves reflected.

TWO BALLET STYLES WITH SOMETHING IN COMMON, ALAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
 By JACK ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's ballet world has two poles, and both are in danger of
freezing over. Plotless, or abstract, ballets are at one pole;
narrative ballets are at the other.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that because there are two different but
valid types of ballet, each would theoretically complement the
other, thereby enriching company repertories. Unfortunately,
however, both abstract and dramatic works often suffer from a
deadly chill.
</P>
<P>
   These days, abstract ballets dominate many repertories. It was
George Balanchine who popularized the genre. Indeed, his
abstractions proved so remarkable that during the '50s and '60s
some dancegoers argued that it was aesthetically necessary for
ballet to discard plot and characterization, just as certain
artistic and musical authorities had argued that painting was
destined to become abstract and that historical necessity had
propelled music toward serialism.
</P>
<P>
   At their weakest, abstract painting and serial music developed
academic conventions. So, too, at times has abstract ballet. Thus
one currently popular choreographic recipe seems to be: Take a
piece of classical music and plow your way through it with fast
steps to the allegros and slow ones to the adagios. Few
choreographers have come close to equaling Balanchine, perhaps
because they have failed to realize that his abstractions, though
devoid of narrative, can be kinetic revelations of love, longing,
fear, struggle and aspiration. In contrast, other abstract
choreographers merely string steps together.
</P>
<P>
   Surely choreographers who have tired of abstractions ought to
revel in emotional confrontations, swashbuckling derring-do or
comic misadventures. Unfortunately, recent dramatic ballets can be
as tepid as the abstractions. One reason is that they tend to be
full-evening creations, and the longer they are, the duller they
grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the past season, for instance, American Ballet Theater danced
John Cranko's full-evening version of Shakespeare's ``Taming of the
Shrew.'' It has boisterously funny moments. It also has lots of
choreographic padding and is less ebullient than another Cranko
comedy, ``Pineapple Poll,'' a nautical romp in the style of a
Gilbert and Sullivan operetta that the Joffrey Ballet used to
perform. But ``Pineapple Poll'' is in only one act.
</P>
<P>
   Too many choreographers now appear to assume that dramatic
ballets ought to be multi-act productions. But consider some of the
distinguished dramatic pieces of the past century: Michel Fokine's
``Petrouchka,'' ``Firebird'' and ``Scheherazade,'' Leonide
Massine's ``Three-Cornered Hat'' and ``St. Francis,'' Balanchine's
``Apollo'' and ``Prodigal Son,'' Ninette de Valois' ``Job,''
Frederick Ashton's ``Wedding Bouquet,'' ``Enigma Variations'' and
``A Month in the Country,'' Antony Tudor's ``Jardin aux Lilas'' and
``Pillar of Fire,'' Eugene Loring's ``Billy the Kid,'' Jerome
Robbins' ``Fancy Free,'' and Agnes de Mille's ``Rodeo'' and ``Fall
River Legend.'' All are in one act. And their economy helps make
them enthralling.
</P>
<P>
   How many comparably admirable multi-act ballets can be set
beside them? The list is ominously short. Some balletomanes might
choose ``Romeo and Juliet,'' as choreographed by Ashton, Cranko,
Kenneth MacMillan or Leonid Lavrovsky, or Balanchine's adaptation
of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' But ``The Dream,'' Ashton's own
treatment of that fantasy, is equally worthy _ and in only one act.
We also have Ashton's fine personal versions of ``La Fille Mal
Gardee,'' an 18th-century comedy, and ``Ondine,'' a 19th-century
Romantic ballet. And what else?
</P>
<P>
   Repertory lists might suggest that a lot else exists. In recent
seasons, choreographers have based multi-act works on such literary
and historical figures as Cinderella, Camille, Peer Gynt, Anna
Karenina, Cleopatra, King Arthur, Peter Pan, the Three Musketeers,
the Great Gatsby and Dracula. Shakespeare is always popular source
material, ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and ``Romeo and Juliet''
especially but others as well, including ``Othello.'' Yet the most
potent choreographic retelling of that tragedy remains a one-act:
Jose Limon's ``Moor's Pavane.'' And once Tudor also created a
poignant one-act ``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   A curious thing about some of the multi-act productions is how,
after receiving their premieres and attracting attention (for they
are often scenically elaborate), they soon drop out of repertory. A
few return in a season or two, only to vanish once more; many are
never seen again. They have had their moments of fame.
</P>
<P>
   One would have to inspect companies around the world to come to
a definitive conclusion on this matter, yet it sometimes seems as
if choreographers turn to ``Romeo,'' ``Cinderella'' or ``Dracula''
not because they are deeply interested in those characters and
their stories but because they think such familiar titles will sell
lots of tickets. There's nothing wrong with selling tickets, but
marketing should not take precedence over creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographers should ask themselves, and managing directors and
board members should allow them to ask, ``What do I want _ what do
I really want _ to do?'' Balanchine's love of bodies moving to
music through intricate patterns in time and space gave us
``Agon.'' Tudor's concern for the quiet desperation of lonely
people gave us ``Pillar of Fire.'' Both works were considered
unconventional when new. Neither is tied to a well-known story or
an easily hummable score. But as audiences began to sense their
passion and realize their excellence, these ballets grew popular.
</P>
<P>
   Let marketing experts take care of the marketing. Choreographers
burning with passion ought to be encouraged to express that passion
in whatever dramatic or abstract form they think appropriate.
Otherwise, there may be no thaw at either balletic pole.

MORE CRACKS IN THE WALLS OF VALHALLA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYREUTH, Germany _ On the morning of a recent performance of
``Goetterdaemmerung'' (``Twilight of the Gods''), Wolfgang Wagner,
80 and a grandson of the man who composed the opera, was fighting
off a twilight of his own. Wagner is no god. Small, combative,
prolix and not without humor, he sparred with a press corps eager
to know more about the star defections and family squabbles that
have encroached on his 34-year regime as sole director of the
Wagner Festival here.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 124 years ago by Richard Wagner, the festival is under
siege from several directions. This press conference, accompanying
Juergen Flimm's new production of ``Der Ring des Nibelungen,'' had
art as its advertised subject matter, but so quickly did it veer
toward internal politics that Wagner threatened to call the
proceedings off scarcely after they had begun.
</P>
<P>
   This is a country accustomed to command and control on one side,
and order and acquiescence on the other. In what other culture
would an opera audience allow itself to be locked in (literally) to
a performance? My enduring image from a week spent in this small,
dull but not disagreeable Bavarian city was of two well-dressed
women standing at a curb late one evening. Not a car or a
pedestrian could be seen in any of four directions, yet patiently
they stood waiting for the ``Don't Walk'' sign to turn green. For a
Manhattanite it was an eerie picture.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner took every question not to his liking as an insult. He is
accustomed to command, and there was a palpable sense of a man who
no longer had the energy to exercise it fully. His 11-year-old
production of ``Parsifal'' had begun the week. It was a dreary
affair, rescued only by his grandfather's breathtaking music. The
principal props were giant crystalline stalagmites, shuffled into
different formations. In matters of staging, Wagner leaned toward
the emotive stagger, the beaten breast and the well-wrung hand.
</P>
<P>
   Decently sung and eccentrically conducted by Christoph
Eschenbach, this ``Parsifal'' should have been the anchor of the
festival. It is the one opera Wagner wrote specifically for the
distinctive qualities of his Festspielhaus. He did so with the
muffled glow of the orchestral sound and the easy resonance
provided singers already in his ears. The Bayreuth production of
``Die Meistersinger,'' I am told, is just as forlorn.
</P>
<P>
   Other factions of the Wagner family want Wolfgang out, but he is
virtually unfireable. His niece Nike Wagner has joined Elmar
Weingarten, the general manager of the Berlin Philharmonic, in a
manifesto proposing that the festival widen to different locations,
introduce theme seasons and add early Wagner pieces like ``Die
Feen'' and ``Das Liebesverbot.'' Intriguing is their idea to
commission site-specific operas gauged to the peculiar qualities of
the Festspielhaus.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Bayreuth is human nature at work: the good and the
bad of tradition versus the good and the bad of change. Wagner's
widow, Cosima, ran the early years in stern homage to her husband's
specific wishes. These were, of course, wishes as interpreted by
her, and Cosima was careful to get rid of adjutants who had been
around and might have had a different version of the ``facts.''
Cosima-induced rituals of gesture survived well into the 20th
century, as did some of the painted scenery. Yet her son,
Siegfried, began the modernization of Bayreuth productions (often
at odds with written directions) as early as 1908.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt a conspiracy, but the defection this summer of two
longtime Bayreuth stars lines up alongside the Nike Wagner forces.
The bass Hans Sotin, after 29 years at the festival, withdrew as
Gurnemanz in ``Parsifal'' following the dress rehearsal, citing
``unbridgeable differences'' with Eschenbach; the administration
line was one of puzzlement and disappointment. Eschenbach was on a
plane to the United States on the morning after the opener, leaving
Wagner to fence with the press.
</P>
<P>
   The more glamorous accuser was the mezzo-soprano Waltraud Meier,
who, in an interview with the local newspaper the Nordbayerische
Kurier, described the festival's course as ``sad and aimless,''
expressed horror at the Sotin affair and announced her withdrawal
from future festivals. This year she sang Sieglinde in the
``Ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, in an eight-and-a-half-minute response at the press
conference, said that Sotin's decision to quit was purely his own
and that the Meier affair involved the singer's competing
commitments in Munich and Salzburg, which overlapped her rehearsal
times at Bayreuth. Wagner had a point, but Sotin and Meier can
sing, and he can't. What was offered this summer at Bayreuth was
Gabriele Schnaut, coarse and deafening as Bruennhilde, and Wolfgang
Schmidt, a vocal disaster as Siegfried.
</P>
<P>
   American money is coming in bigger amounts to Bayreuth, which,
like other European arts institutions, is no longer smug in the
knowledge of heavy government support. With levels of federal and
local underpinning altered in Germany, the nurturing of ``Friends
of'' societies in foreign countries is becoming as important in
Bayreuth as it has been at the Salzburg Festival in Austria. One
major gift is from Alberto Vilar, an investment manager whose name
and checkbook are already writ large at the world's prestigious
opera houses. Vilar will pay for a new ``Tannhaeuser'' production
in two years, and ``no artistic influence'' will accompany the
money, Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   Munificence like this has become crucial to the changing economy
of opera. Yet it will arrive in the middle of a political war for
control of the festival (with other members of the family also
candidates to succeed Wolfgang, including Gudrun Wagner, his second
wife; Eva Wagner-Pasquier, his daughter by his first wife; and
Wieland Lafferentz, a nephew of Wagner); and whether intended or
not, it lands squarely in Wagner's camp. One image that Bayreuth
does not need is American money versus European art.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ One October evening in 1994, a scruffy pod of
homeless people sitting around a fire in the dank, dark Amtrak
tunnel they lived in beneath Manhattan heard a thin, animated man
named Ralph come up with an idea. ``Someone should be making a film
about this stuff,'' he said. The others nodded or laughed or agreed
or shook their heads at the absurdity of the thought, and the
conversation moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Singer still finds it hard to believe that such an idle
remark could have inspired his odyssey, one that led a 20-year-old
who had never picked up a camera to live underground himself,
enlist his fellow outcasts as his crew and put together an
84-minute, black-and-white documentary that won three awards at
this year's Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   But when Singer's ``Dark Days'' opens for a two-week run at the
Film Forum in New York on August 30 _ with bookings in six other
cities set after that _ it will mark the culmination of six years
of work that in almost every way mirrored the life-on-the-edge
existence of his compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   The film was cobbled together through grit, guile and an ability
to rummage through society's detritus and spare parts. It was done
in utter isolation from anything resembling the mainstream world of
film. It was a project whose survival was always not just in doubt
but highly unlikely. In the end, it reached an improbably
redemptive conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   If the documentary is unlikely to change too many minds about
the nature of the homeless, it allowed Singer, who grew up in an
upper-middle class family in London and came to New York with hopes
of becoming a fashion model, to succeed in his aim of making not
just visible, but thoroughly human, New York's invisible people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal, crazy as it sounds, was to make enough money to
get everyone out of the tunnel,'' said Singer, 26, whose restless
energy, close cropped hair, white T-shirts and cargo pants, summon
up the street more than the runway. ``But the other goal was to
just let people see the homeless as they are, so maybe they'll look
at them with less hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to go on a mission with this film. I never
wanted to convert anyone into helping the homeless. But we look at
them as if they're not human. It's like there's an invisible wall
there. But you go and meet them, and it turns out they're just like
me and you; they just don't have a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer's unlikely journey began when he was living in the East
Village, shortly after he moved to New York from Miami. He came to
know some of the street people in his neighborhood and through them
learned about the subculture of ``mole people'' living in the
railroad tunnels from 72nd Street to 125th Street underneath the
West Side Highway. There were from 50 to 75 of them in the winter
and perhaps 150 to 200 in the summer, and soon he found himself
spending most of his time with them by the plywood shacks,
makeshift shanties and nightly campfires they built alongside the
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than thinking of Ralph's idea as a stray pipe dream, he
took it on _ first as a quixotic project, then as something close
to an obsession. He began by getting Cinevision, the downtown
camera shop, to give him the use of what became the first of four
Arriflex SR2 16-millimeter cameras he used to make the film. He
sold most of his belongings, and finally even his own bed, to buy
film and supplies. When he ran out of film and money, Kodak gave
him much of what he needed free of charge. He took to living
underground with his subjects and eventually became homeless too. A
friend went to the bank and gave him his last $10,000. He did not
have a print to take to Sundance until the day he got on the plane
and carried it with him.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the homeless people _ identified in the credits
only by their first names _ became not just his subjects but his
collaborators. Singer and the tunnel people all trooped off
together to see the documentary ``Hoop Dreams'' and decided they
could make a film, too. They became Singer's film crew, learning
and improvising as they went along, much as he did. When they
needed a dolly, they built one using an old grocery cart and an
abandoned stretch of rail. They ran cable underground, hooked up to
whatever power source they could find, and for lighting used
hand-held floodlights mounted on metal crosses. He gave a dozen of
the homeless _ three of whom died before the film could be released
_ part ownership in the film, so they stand to profit if it makes
money.
</P>
<P>
   What he captured was a life underground that was at once
entirely alien and oddly familiar. Singer's friends cooked over
fires and small stoves. They listened to radios and watched
television, using electricity tapped illegally from aboveground.
They sat in their shacks in T-shirts emblazoned ``Bank of America''
or ``Republican National Convention,'' with a dog at their feet and
pictures on the wall, discussing favorite recipes, long-lost pets
and sometimes horrific family tragedies. They got food from
scavenging through garbage and showered under a leaky water pipe.
</P>
<P>
   But through much of the film they seem not so much homeless as
people whose home happens to be 50 feet underground, one that can
be torn down with a sledgehammer in about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting portrait is tantalizingly complex: at one moment
there are rats scurrying around; in the next, it all seems vaguely
homey. While the subjects come across for the most part as
articulate hosts and raconteurs, they are also capable of
lacerating confession and crack-addled delusion.
</P>
<P>
   Singer's unconventional film concludes with the most
conventional of scenes, one depicting the bliss the homeless people
ascend to when, after being evicted from the tunnel, they find
themselves in clean, private apartments paid for with Section 8
government-subsidized housing vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of romanticizing the homeless or vilifying the Amtrak
officials who evicted them, the film reminds us that the people on
the street _ or under it _ want nothing so much as a home.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Singer takes pains to point out that his subjects
aren't stand-ins for ``the homeless,'' a more-or-less homogeneous
group of society's victims. ``People on the street get lumped
together, but there are so many types,'' he said. ``There are
people who are mentally ill and people on the street fleeing
abusive homes, there are runaway kids on drugs, there are people
who've been burned out of their house and have nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a million ways that people can get on the street,
and there are bad people there. But there are a lot of good people,
too. And I ended up with enormous respect for everyone in the
tunnel, because they just wouldn't give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put myself in that situation, and I wonder what would I have
done? Would I have given up, because it would have been easy to do.
I mean out of sight, out of mind, and how much further out of sight
can you get than living in a tunnel?''
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, the making of the film was very much a process
of clawing in the direction of survival. ``Marc's incredibly
confident and incredibly determined,'' said Melissa Neidich, the
film's editor. ``If he wants to learn something, he'll learn it
completely. If he wants to do something, he'll do what he has to do
to master it. That's the way he was able to get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   But after devoting six years to the film, Singer views its
theatrical release with mixed feelings of excitement, trepidation
and, finally, an urge to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so ready to let go of it, mate,'' he said. ``Six years is
a long time to think about something seven days a week, often 20
hours a day. I can't get past it yet, but I'm looking forward to
when I can. What I'd like to do is get away, sit on a beach and
think the bloody ocean is a lovely color blue.''

   ISRAEL: ROYAL PEACE TRIP
</P>
<P>
   On the first visit to Israel by an Arab leader since the failed
Camp David talks, King Abdullah II of Jordan met Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, and Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Arab diplomats
said the king's aim was to try to find common ground on the issue
of Jerusalem, but the talks appeared to have produced no break in
the impasse. It was the second meeting between the king and Barak
in a week; the two also held talks in Amman, the Jordanian capital.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL: 23 HELD AS TERRORISTS
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian security officials have arrested 23
Arabs suspected of planning a series of terror attacks to disrupt
peace plans, and said at least one suspect had links to Osama bin
Laden, the FBI's most wanted terrorist suspect. Security officials
said the arrests, over three months, involved radicals with links
to the Hamas and Islamic Holy War groups active in Gaza and the
West Bank, as well as the Al-Qaeda movement led by bin Laden from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN: DROUGHT HITS 37 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   The drought that has devastated large areas of southern and
western Asia, from India to the Middle East, has affected 37
million people in Iran, a U.N. relief official said. Vladimir
Sakharov, who toured Iran for 17 days with a team from Unicef, the
World Health Organization and the office of the U.N. coordinator
for humanitarian affairs, said drinking water was scarce and many
people had lost crops and livestock for the second year. He said it
was the worst drought in Iran since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL: AWOL OFFICER LEAVES
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Army Reserve intelligence officer who was declared absent
without leave in Israel denied reports he was a spy and returned to
the United States. ``First of all, I'm on vacation here,'' Lt. Col.
Jeremiah Mattysse said. ``I'm not a spy. I've given no classified
information to anybody.'' Mattysse, 50, denied allegations he had
fled the intelligence unit he had headed in Texas with confidential
information.

</P>
<P>
   The government announced the uncovering of an international arms
trafficking ring that smuggled 10,000 assault rifles from Jordan to
the Amazonian jungles of Peru for delivery to Marxist guerrillas
fighting in Colombia. Six people were arrested, including two
Peruvian military officers.

<P>
   ARGENTINA: BRIBERY INQUIRY
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando de la Rua promised to cooperate with an
investigation into charges that a labor reform bill he proposed
passed the Senate in April after opposition senators received
bribes and other personal favors. Several officials, including the
labor minister, have volunteered for questioning by prosecutors.

   JAPAN, NORTH KOREA: ROCKY TALKS
</P>
<P>
   Japanese and North Korean negotiators vowed to try to set up
diplomatic ties, but hopes for a breakthrough looked dim as the
longtime foes stuck to entrenched positions on key issues. On the
first of two days of talks in Tokyo, North Korea repeated its call
for Japan to apologize and pay reparations for its 1910-45 rule
over the Korean Peninsula. Japan replied by raising the issue of 10
Japanese citizens Tokyo believes were kidnapped by North Korean
agents.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN: REVEALING PREMIER'S PAST
</P>
<P>
   A court decided to ask the police to make public whether or not
they apprehended Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori in a brothel more than
40 years ago _ an allegation by a weekly magazine that Mori has
denied. News organizations said the Tokyo District Court, holding
hearings on a suit filed by Mori against the magazine, Truth of the
Rumor, had made the unusual decision in response to a request by
the magazine's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   PHILIPPINES: LIBYA INCREASES RANSOM
</P>
<P>
   Libya has agreed to pay $1 million for each of the 12 foreign
hostages held by Muslim rebels in the southern Philippines since
April 23, clearing the way for their release ``fairly soon,''
officials close to the negotiations said. The hostages were to have
been freed last weekend but the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas delayed the
release after Libya haggled to lower the ransom to $700,000 per
captive, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
   MONGOLIA: HELD IN '98 KILLING
</P>
<P>
   The police have detained a leading opposition politician,
Erdeniin Bat-Uul, as a suspect in the 1998 killing of the country's
leading democracy figure, Bat-Uul's wife, Delgertuyaa, said. She
said her husband was first arrested on charges of disturbing public
order, but then prosecutors said he was being held as a suspect in
the murder of Sanjaasurengiin Zorig, minister of infrastructure
development.

</P>
<P>
   BURUNDI: PEACE TRIP OFF
</P>
<P>
   President Pierre Buyoya canceled a trip to South Africa and a
meeting with Nelson Mandela, and instead focused on calming Tutsi
opposition to a peace accord intended to end the country's civil
war, which started in 1993. Tensions between Hutu and minority
Tutsi have increased as an Aug. 28 deadline neared for signing a
power-sharing pact. Mandela, the former South African president,
has been mediating talks and has invited President Clinton to
witness the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   LIBERIA: BRITISH TV CREW HELD
</P>
<P>
   A judge rejected a request to grant bail to a British television
crew charged with spying, saying the accusations were too grave.
Two Britons, a Sierra Leonean and a South African say they were
working on a documentary for Channel 4 in Britain, where Foreign
Office minister Peter Hain called the arrests ``an attack on
international press freedom.'' Liberia says the crew was trying to
link President Charles Taylor to diamond smuggling and gun-running
in Sierra Leone.

<P>
   BRITAIN: PIG BAN NARROWED
</P>
<P>
   The European Union recommended the narrowing of a ban on
importing live pigs from England to cover only animals from an area
in southeast England where an outbreak of swine fever is said to
have been contained. A European panel said there had been no new
reports of the disease in Suffolk, Norfolk and Essex since Aug. 12.
The United States has also banned English pork products and China
said it would do the same.

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Vice President Al Gore stood before his fellow
veterans of foreign wars on Tuesday and rebutted Republican charges
that the readiness and morale of the armed forces have declined
during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who served as an Army journalist in Vietnam for five
months in 1971, told delegates to the Veterans of Foreign Wars'
national convention here of his own enlistment, his work on the
House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services
Committee, his vote for the Gulf War and his support in the White
House for increased defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that year-after-year commitment to a strong American
defense,'' said Gore, ``that makes me so concerned when others try
to run down America's military for political advantage in an
election year. That's not only wrong in fact, it's the wrong
message to send to our allies and adversaries across the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, was referring to his
Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who preceded him
here on Monday. Bush, who served in the Texas Air National Guard
during Vietnam, said in his address to the veterans that ``the
current administration had inherited a military ready for the
dangers and challenges facing our nation'' but that ``the next
president will inherit a military in decline.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the armed forces had suffered from poor pay,
shortages of spare parts and deteriorating readiness in the days
after his father was president and his running mate, Dick Cheney,
was defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, said Tuesday that Gore was
refusing to take responsibility for the military's condition during
the Clinton presidency. ``If the military's morale had gone down
under my watch,'' he said, ``I, too, wouldn't want my opponent to
point it out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, who wore a VFW hat, defended the Clinton
administration's defense record, saying that all 10 Army divisions
were combat-ready and that ``our military is the strongest and the
best in the entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   As in his speech to the Democratic National Convention last
week, and in a television commercial released by the Gore campaign
Tuesday, the vice president promoted his decision to enlist in the
Army in 1970. In his remarks, he did not mention, as he does in the
advertisement, that he enlisted despite having doubts about the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and his late father, Sen. Albert Gore Sr., opposed the
Vietnam War but the younger Gore enlisted, he has often said,
because he knew that someone else from Tennessee would have to go
in his place. Another factor he has mentioned was the potential
damage his father's 1970 re-election campaign might have suffered
if he had tried to avoid service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pretend that my own military experience matches in any
way what others here have been through,'' Gore said Tuesday. ``I
didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to
wear my country's uniform. And my own experiences gave me strong
beliefs about America's obligation to keep our national defenses
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he would push for a pay raise for
military personnel and for improvements in military housing. He
also pledged that ``in a Gore administration, I will make sure that
no members of our armed forces ever have to rely on food stamps.''
About 6,000 servicemen and women are eligible for food stamps.
``Our armed forces should be commemorated on stamps,'' he said.
``They shouldn't have to use them to buy groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, said the vice president
has called for a 10-year, $127 billion increase in spending on
military salaries, training and modernization and that those
numbers may rise when Gore adjusts his budget proposals to reflect
a growing surplus. Gore would maintain for 10 years the 3.7 percent
annual increase in military pay that was passed by Congress and
signed by President Clinton this year, Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Gore's running mate, was
one of eight senators to vote against a 4.8 percent military pay
increase in 1999. He has said he did so because it was part of a
Republican Pentagon spending package that he considered too costly.
Later that year, he supported a less expensive bill that included a
pay increase of the same size.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would add $1 billion for an annual salary
increase on top of the increases authorized in recent years. On
Monday, he also proposed spending $310 million for construction and
repair of public schools that serve the children of military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion cut in income tax
rates would be so deep that it would make it impossible to invest
in the military. ``I think it's wrong to spend our budget surpluses
on short-term gain,'' he said, ``when we need to make sure the
resources are there to keep our military strong far into the
future.''

MARKET EDGES UP AFTER FED LEAVES INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FED-RATES) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed Tuesday after the Federal
Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's decision to keep the federal funds rate on overnight
loans between banks at 6.5 percent had been widely expected. Still,
stocks of financial services companies, which stand to benefit if
interest rates stabilize or start to fall, were the standout
performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the market wanted to see,'' said Jonathan Olesky,
head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``The view is
that we are now in a friendlier rate environment.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading the central bank's so-called policy directive,
analysts said that the Fed was not likely to prove threatening to
stock investors, at least for the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what we know today, the consensus view is that the Fed
has finished raising interest rates for the year,'' said Edward
Yardeni, chief global economist and investment strategist at
Deutsche Bank Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Led by J.P. Morgan, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 59.34
points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,139.15. The Nasdaq composite index
gained 5.06, or 0.1 percent, to 3,958.21. But the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index slipped 1.35, or 0.1 percent, to 1,498.13.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Fed made its midafternoon announcement, major market
gauges were all solidly higher. But selling set in after the news
was reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the potential for a pullback no matter what the Fed did
because the market has had a good month,'' said William Meehan,
chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ``It is too early to say
the Fed is done for the year, but unless we get really bad
inflation numbers, I suspect the Fed will be on hold until after
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial service stocks, especially banks, did well.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose $3.56, to $148.50. Chase Manhattan gained
$1.56, to $52.50, while Citigroup advanced 44 cents, to $77.31, and
Wells Fargo rose $1.19, to $45.56.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel Networks, a component of the S &AMP; P 500, gained $1.81, to
$82.81. Intel managed its eighth consecutive gain, rising 6 cents,
to $72.13. And Microsoft rose 63 cents, to $71.25.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems fell 69 cents, to $64.81, however. Qualcomm shed
$2.38, to $56.63, and Dell Computer dropped $1.31, to $37.44.
</P>
<P>
   AMR, the parent of American Airlines, gained $1.19, to $33.81,
after Goldman, Sachs lifted its third-quarter profit estimate.
</P>
<P>
   But forest products companies fell after Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter lowered profit estimates for this year and for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper fell 44 cents, to $32.31. Weyerhaeuser
dropped $1.31, to $46.88, and Temple Inland fell $1.25, to $43.69.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic had a bad day, falling $3.13, to $49.69, after the
world's largest pacemaker manufacturer reported quarterly sales
that fell short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But most biotechnology stocks moved higher.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen closed at $69.06, up $1.81. Genentech gained $6, to $171.
Chiron rose $1.63, to $50.13. And Millennium Pharmaceuticals closed
at $115.14, up $3.20.

   TORONTO _ With lawsuits by former students of Indian boarding
schools threatening to bankrupt the Anglican Church of Canada, this
week the church started slashing its national budget by 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts come after an audit by the accounting firm Ernst &AMP;
Young predicted that legal fees and settlements arising from
charges of past abuses at boarding schools run by the church would
bankrupt the organization next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the leadership is in denial,'' said David
Harris, editor of The Anglican Journal, the church's newspaper
here. ``But I think people were expecting more drastic cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   To save money for legal bills, the newspaper is to be made
smaller and eight staff members here who work for the church's
national structure, the general synod, are to be laid off.
</P>
<P>
   From the late 19th century until 1970, boarding schools for
Indian children were run by four Christian churches in Canada:
Roman Catholic, Anglican, United and Presbyterian. The churches
were fulfilling a government policy of teaching Canadian Indians
English, assimilating them into Canadian society and training them
for lives beyond traditional hunting and gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1960s, about 20 percent of Canadian Indian children
passed through the schools, often in isolated places. In recent
years, there have been complaints, from accusations that
administrators failed to crack down on pedophiles to charges of
destruction of cultures, religions and languages.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Anglican Church, which ran 37 schools, the
second-largest number after the Catholic Church, is the target of
350 lawsuits, representing 1,600 former indian students claiming
damages. Last year, the synod, which has assets of $7 million,
spent $1 million in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   While most dioceses are legally insulated from claims, the
national organization and three western dioceses are threatened
with bankruptcy. The Anglican Church and the Catholic Church, which
faces claims by 4,110 former students, have asked the federal
government to help negotiate and pay for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   So far, such pleas have been rejected by the government of Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, who was Indian affairs minister from 1968
to 1974. Two years ago, when the Chretien government created a $250
million ``healing fund'' to pay for social projects in Indian
communities, a cabinet minister was quoted as saying: ``The
churches have got to feel some pain.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new Anglican budget, money devoted to a healing fund is
to be doubled, to $370,000.
</P>
<P>
   But, elsewhere, Indian communities will feel financial pain
because hundreds of thousands of dollars will be cut from transfers
to the Canadian north, where many Anglican churches are supported
by the national organization.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have found that the churches and government share
responsibility for abuses at church-run schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare government comment on the issue, Shawn Tupper,
director of the residential school division of the Department of
Indian and Northern Affairs, told The National Post last month that
churches should dig more deeply into their pockets to settle
claims. The Anglican Church, Canada's third largest, has 2.2
million members.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should ask their own membership ahead of asking the
taxpayer,'' said Tupper, whose agency is reported to have 150
lawyers working full time fighting claims.

FROM `NO' TO `YO'

   (Katherine M. Brady is chief executive of the Brady Corp., a
manufacturer of identification and material-solution productions;
this was written with Julia Lawlor)

<TEXT>
<P>
   I had planned to be an economics professor. I went to graduate
school at Cornell University on a fellowship, but in 1969, the
school fell apart. There were student demonstrations against the
Vietnam War, the administration lost control of the university, and
the campus shut down for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   I was studying; I wasn't demonstrating. I'm a conservative
Republican. So I took a leave from the fellowship, packed up my VW
Beetle _ that part of me was a little avant-garde _ and headed home
to Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   I knocked on the door at Eastman Kodak, where my dad had started
as a messenger boy at 18, and got a job as a systems analyst in the
logistics area.
</P>
<P>
   I was paid $10,206 a year, an awesome salary. So awesome, I said
to myself, ``Why would I go back to school to be an economics
professor?''
</P>
<P>
   After six years at Kodak, I had a goal: to be the first woman
corporate officer in a job that was not OK for a woman to be in.
That meant not human resources, not public relations, not
advertising. Something that was where the guys were.
</P>
<P>
   I ended up being talked into taking a job in corporate
communications. That led to a job as director of community affairs,
where I got to work with the Kodak's chairman, Walter Fallon.
</P>
<P>
   He was tough. The first time I went to his office with my boss,
he looked up and said, ``What's she doing here?''
</P>
<P>
   But he taught me how to think like the boss.
</P>
<P>
   After that, I turned around the instant photography division. We
went from losing $35 million to making $5 million a year. And in
1988, I became chief information officer, the first woman corporate
officer of Kodak. In the summer of 1993, the board of directors
fired the CEO, Kay Whitmore, and held a meeting of 50 Kodak
managers.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Goizueta, who was the chairman of Coca-Cola at the time,
told a story at the meeting about his grandfather, who raised boxer
dogs. He said if the dogs were more than 30 percent white, they
were considered defective and had to be destroyed. He said that was
the problem with Kodak management: it was too inbred, and we had to
bring new people in. Those of us in the room who'd been trying to
make changes all along were fuming. After you're accused of being a
dog, when the phone rings and it's a headhunter, you listen. Next
thing you know, I was CEO of a $240 million company.
</P>
<P>
   At Brady, our mission statement talks about creating a
challenging and fun work environment. We're going from a culture of
``No'' to a culture of ``Yo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo'' is our cheer. We give out yo-yo's as awards. My first
license plate on my Dodge Ram pickup truck said ``No2Yo.''
</P>
<P>
   We try to have fun. A few years ago, we would shoot each other
with Batman guns at our meetings. Every year we hold the ``Martha
Stewart Good Housekeeping Tour.'' I play Martha, and I go around
giving out the seal of approval to everyone who's done a good job
cleaning their office.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm proud that I've been able to sustain a family life. I
have a really great kid, a wonderful husband. A week before we were
supposed to get married, he was rushed to the hospital with a
blocked intestine. He almost died. So we held the ceremony in the
hospital. The bride wore a red business suit, the groom wore blue
pj's and a robe, and after 20 years of marriage, he can still get
in his wedding outfit, and I can't. We live on a farm with two dogs
and a cat. The problem with being a CEO is that you're always
thinking about work. I try to get home for dinner most nights so I
can spend time with my 12-year-old son. But if you'd talk to him,
he'd say Mommy works all the time.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: FLIGHT ATTENDANT SINGS PRAISES OF CORPORATE
FLYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moving in ``t'' category) 
 By JOE SHARKEY

<P>
   Rene Foss, a flight attendant, jokes about flying ``around the
world in a bad mood.'' In fact, she's written a musical revue with
that title. More on that later. But first, a good word for business
travelers from Foss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business traveler is my favorite passenger, mainly because
they're used to the system,'' said Foss, who is 38 and has worked
for Northwest Airlines for 16 years. ``As a rule, they're usually
the best dressed, the best behaved, and the most sympathetic when
there's a problem,'' she said. ``They're the most sophisticated of
the travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait, though. Let's not get carried away with the compliments.
You know those self-important bozos you often see with a
first-class upgrade and an attitude? (I recently watched a
businessman waving his first-class ticket literally push a woman in
a wheelchair out of the way so he could be the very first in line
to board a flight to Phoenix.) Flight attendants encounter
customers like that every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, with some business travelers, their demands have
increased,'' she said. ``There is a sense of entitlement. They
expect a little more, maybe because they're paying a higher price
for the ticket, or they're angry because they've had a horrible
experience on the previous flight, or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, don't get her started. This is a woman who sends out
information about her theatrical revue tucked in an airline barf
bag. A woman who has written ditties called ``The Ballad of Jed
Clampett,'' which describes the bewildered hordes of infrequent
fliers who fly during the summer-sale season, and ``The Hello
Song,'' in which overburdened flight attendants start out warbling
sweet hellos that soon descend into a cacophony of fulminating
rage. A woman who says modestly, ``I have written a musical comedy
based on my rotten life, I mean, my glamorous life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, referring to her day job in the sky, ``you get some
of these young guys in first class, they think they're kind of hot
shots,'' she said. ``They'll get done with their meal and then they
want to get their computer out right away, so they'll just put
their garbage on the floor. They don't even look up when we come by
to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The abilities to ``take abuse and collect trash in confined
areas'' are, in fact, prime job requirements for becoming a flight
attendant, as an employment supervisor for Wafti (We Apologize for
the Inconvenience) Airlines explains it to the bright-eyed
job-seeker played by Foss in her show, ``Around the World in a Bad
Mood.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical revue has a cast of five, including one other
working flight attendant. Originally produced in New York two years
ago, it was a hit this summer at the Minneapolis Fringe Festival, a
program of off-beat theater. The show, which is popular with
off-duty flight attendants and other airline employees, returns to
New York for four Saturday night performances next month at Rose's
Turn, a Greenwich Village cabaret (212 712-8702).
</P>
<P>
   Foss' mother was a flight attendant in the 1950s, when air
travel was considered to be an elegant way to go. But she doesn't
have any illusions about the way women were once treated as
stewardesses who were there to pamper and flatter business
travelers, who have always been the airlines' prime customers and
whose ranks were overwhelmingly male until the 1980s. Remember
those pouty, suggestive ``Fly Me!'' airline commercials?
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother was flying the stewardesses wore white
gloves,'' Foss said. ``But they also had to wear a girdle. They
would come to work and have to be checked. Yes, the airlines had a
girdle checker. And do you know what else? They had a weight
checker. And if you were five pounds over what your weight was
supposed to be, you were grounded till you lost the weight.
Stewardesses would go on these awful diets, not eat for three days
to try to lose five pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, she said: ``They had to quit when they got married, which
is why my mother left the business. They had a rule that at age 32,
you had to quit, no matter what. So the life was glamorous in a lot
of ways. Airline crews used to stay at much better hotels and enjoy
longer layovers, for example. But at the same token, there was a
dark side. There was a girdle checker.''
</P>
<P>
   Do we hear a song coming on there?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Other possibilities for new material in the show
include the prospect of passengers being able to use cell phones in
the air, with all the ensuing drama, resentment and fury.
``Actually, that could be an opera,'' said Foss, who is always
working on new material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I'm any big writer or anything, but for me the
airline experience is fascinating to try to capture because it's
sometimes so much like a drama or a comedy,'' she said. ``Honestly,
it's like watching a play. You just stand there and observe
quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd never know she was a wise acre, at least not on the job.
``I'm really not much of a smart aleck,'' she confided. ``I'm too
afraid I'll get in trouble. I try to keep my mouth shut as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Just remember, though. That flight attendant up there by the
galley might well be taking notes.

IN LOUISIANA, LAWYERS' ARCHRIVAL STUDIES LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For five years, Gov. Mike Foster of Louisiana has made
no secret of his contempt for the state's trial lawyers, calling
them ``bad guys'' who played too large a role in picking judges and
influencing legislation. He pushed through changes to Louisiana's
legal system that reduced damage awards, and accused lawyers of
driving jobs out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday morning, demonstrating the assured singularity that
has become his trademark, the 70-year-old governor walked into a
classroom at Southern University in Baton Rouge and began his first
day of law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a lifelong ambition,'' he explained to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   That ambition has been well-hidden from the public, which has
watched with some amusement as he made his battles with lawyers a
foundation of his successful campaigns for office in 1995 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial lawyers always hide behind the working people, but
they are the biggest enemy of the working people,'' Foster said
last year. ``The lawyers will run business out of the state and
that means they run jobs out of the state. They've done it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marsanne Golsby, Foster's press secretary, said the governor
has been talking about studying law for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes a challenge, and he's had to put up with lawyers all
of his professional life,'' Golsby said. ``It just eats at him that
an area of expertise that he runs across, a big area of knowledge
that's very very important, he doesn't know himself. He doesn't
like it when they know something he doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Golsby said the governor will begin with three courses _ torts,
civil procedure and legal writing _ and will continue taking a
half-load of courses as long as he has the time. She described him
as ``a little nervous'' when he realized how much reading he would
have to do, but said he was willing to try it.
</P>
<P>
   Foster has not said whether he would actually become a lawyer
after his term expires in three years, but he does not appear to
need the extra income. Before entering public office, he became a
wealthy businessman with interests in construction and his family's
sugar plantations. But several law-school graduates said he was
welcome in their profession, hoping it might ease some of the
tension between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased education always allows people to make better
decisions,'' said Sam Gregorio, president of the Louisiana Trial
Lawyers Association. ``I applaud his intellectual interest.''

GORE TELLS VETS BUSH IS WRONG IN CRITICISM OF MILITARY READINESS 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore told a
veterans group Tuesday that his Republican opponent was not only
wrong in his criticism of the nation's military readiness, but was
risking the nation's security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the Veterans of Foreign Wars national convention that
the Clinton administration has worked to reverse the decline in
defense spending and has successfully lobbied for military pay
raises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that year-after-year commitment to a strong defense that
makes me so concerned when others try to run down America's
military for political advantage in an election year,'' Gore said.
``That's not only wrong in fact _ it's the wrong message to send
our allies and adversaries across the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was referring to Bush's speech to the veteran's group
Monday, when the Texas governor said the ``next president will
inherit a military in decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore rebutted Bush's claims, saying the Army's 10 divisions are
combat ready, the Navy has more than twice as many surface ships as
China and ``our Air Force is by far the largest and most modern in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his critics, Gore said, ``Let them remember our
overwhelming victory in Kosovo _ without a single American life
lost in battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore pledged to modernize weapons systems, lobby for another pay
increase, improve military housing, and reduce the number of
soldiers on food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will insist that we follow this simple rule: We must never
send our service men and women to do what they are not equipped to
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also drew a subtle contrast with his opponent by noting
that he had served as an Army reporter in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Bush served in the Texas Air National Guard. Neither man went
into combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do the most or run the gravest danger,'' Gore said.
``But I was proud to wear my country's uniform. And my own
experiences gave me strong beliefs about America's obligation to
keep our national defenses strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's military credentials were on display when he entered the
convention hall wearing his VFW Tennessee chapter cap.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett called Gore's comments ``reactionary
and defensive,'' proof that Bush's point was having an effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore says he's committed to helping veterans, but this
administration has continually offered budgets that made huge cuts
in veterans programs,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore launched a series of campaign ads Tuesday that detail his
Vietnam experience, congressional career and family life.
</P>
<P>
   The ads begin by looking back to 1969. ``America in turmoil,'' a
narrator says. ``Al Gore graduates college. His father, a U.S.
senator, opposes the Vietnam War. Al Gore has his doubts, but
enlists in the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent biography, Gore enlisted to help his
father weather attacks by his Republican opponent during his
re-election campaign in Tennessee. The senior Gore lost anyway.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore may hope his Vietnam stint will give him an advantage
over Bush, his boss, Bill Clinton, proved that military service is
not prerequisite to winning the White House. Clinton beat George
Bush and Bob Dole, both of whom saw action in World War II.
Republicans were unsuccessful in derailing Clinton by portraying
him as a draft dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was received warmly by the veteran's group, a number of
whom said they liked the fact that he served in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   However, others said they saw little differences between the two
candidates when it came to strengthening the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think on most issues both candidates are the same. They tell
you what you want to hear,'' said Kenneth Ricciardi, 54, who served
in the Marine Corps in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Ricciardi, who works for the city of Milwaukee, said he is
tempted to write in on the presidential ballot the name of Sen.
John McCain, the former Vietnam POW who unsuccessfully challenged
Bush in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Korean War veteran James Klug, 69, was puzzled how Bush and Gore
could offer such different assessments of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush was telling us we are in a decline. Today we heard the
opposite,'' said Klug of Omaha, Neb. Klug said he liked the more
``positive'' outlook saying ``as of today I'm voting for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Kobluck, 49, a Vietnam War veteran from Chicago, said
that while military experience is important, it was not the only
factor he weighed in voting for a president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say the economy is the best it's ever been. My
pocketbook tells me at the moment to vote Democrat,'' he said.

being taskmasters. ``You can't be a taskmaster?'' asks Stewart.
``Forget it. You can be a taskmaster and you can uphold your

WORKPLACE: EXPERIENCE IN SELLING FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Gerard `J.J.' Carelli is a basketball stand operator at Rye
Playland in Rye, N.J.; this was written with Amy Zipkin)  
 By GERARD `J.J.' CARELLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I sell fun. I work six days a week, 10 hours a day,
all summer long.
</P>
<P>
   Park rules are you can't call out, so I lure people by making
eye contact and smiling. They come over to see me. I can tell by
looking at somebody if they are interested. I started 10 years ago,
when I was 15. My first game was setting up milk bottles on the
shelf. It was back-breaking. We didn't get the little kids. We got
the macho guys who weigh a ton and wanted to throw cannons. I got
hit in the head a lot. They think it takes might, but the softer
touch is better.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I moved on to a stock job. I walked around the park for
two years carrying large plastic bags of toys and delivered the
prizes to the different booths. It wasn't much fun.
</P>
<P>
   This is my fourth year at the minibasketball game. Three in a
row for $2 gets you any prize you want. If you miss, you can still
win. I have 14 levels of play. One basket gets you a ball. Two
baskets gets you a Yankees or Mets bear. Three balls wins a framed
picture or rubber Playland ball. Derek Jeter and Britney Spears are
the most popular. I have 22 prizes that change every year. Last
year, Pokemon was big. The year before that it was Tweety in a
cage. My largest prizes, for 14 balls, are Taz, Scooby and
Sylvester stuffed animals and a black inflatable WWF chair. It's
the coolest.
</P>
<P>
   I get about 1,000 players on an average day. Most of them are
teen-agers. It's kids that have the touch. The ratio of kids to
adults that win is about 10 to one. The adults tend to rationalize
it and think how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can get abusive because they feel a lot of pressure
playing this game. I had one customer who kept on playing and
playing because the kid he was with kept telling him what prizes
she wanted. When he didn't win, he started to take it out on me. He
started screaming, ``This game is a rip-off.'' Then he started in
on me. ``No wonder you work in a minimum-wage job.''
</P>
<P>
   I just try to keep my cool when that happens. That's where the
experience comes in. I take a ball and toss it through the hoop. I
don't count it in the scoring, but I tell him, ``Throw the ball up
higher, you get a better chance.''
</P>
<P>
   One day last summer, I had three girls about 15 playing with
their father. One of the balls they were using rolled out into the
midway. A bystander picked it up, and from a distance, aimed it at
one of the baskets. Instead of hitting the basket, he hit the light
up above. The glass from the light shattered and went into the hair
and the eyes of one of the girls. Nothing like that had ever
happened in the booth before. I was frightened, but there was
nothing I could do except call my boss and tell him to get first
aid.
</P>
<P>
   I have my regular customers. I have one older couple that live
in Yonkers, Jean and John. They come about three times a year and
always leave with something big.
</P>
<P>
   I always give free shots. If they're little kids, I let them
stand on the counter for their last shot. If they miss I give them
a smiley face. No kid goes away empty-handed.

VISA-MASTERCARD ANTITRUST CASE MOVES CLOSER TO RESOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   by ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The two-month trial of the government's landmark
antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard limped to the finish
line Tuesday with both sides expressing satisfaction with their
arguments and independent observers reluctant to predict the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of testimony and evidence, the heavily lobbied case
headed toward the day, slated for late October, when it will go to
U.S. District Court Judge Barbara S. Jones for a decision. That
could lead to a restructuring of the giant, highly profitable
industry or, at the other extreme, to what in effect would be a
ratification of current practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have presented strong evidence,'' said assistant
attorney general, Joel I. Klein, in a statement, ``that Visa and
MasterCard engaged in conduct that stifled competition and harmed
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard, for its part, contended: ``The absence of evidence
is glaring. To make matters even worse, its proposed remedies would
likely harm consumers, not help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, filed by the Justice Department nearly two years ago
and which went to trial June 12 in the federal courtroom in lower
Manhattan where IBM fought monopoly charges in the 1980s and where
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of spying in the 1950s,
centers on two main accusations.
</P>
<P>
   One is that both credit card associations are controlled by the
same group of large banks whose representatives sit on both boards.
The government contends that this dual governance lessens
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The other target is the practice by the associations, which
serve banks that are the actual issuers of credit cards, of
forbidding members to also offer those of rivals like American
Express or Discover, which is owned by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Visa and MasterCard control about 75 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the evidence showed that if Amex were allowed to
issue its cards through MasterCard and Visa banks, consumers would
be harmed,'' said Noah Hanft, deputy general counsel of MasterCard
in a statement at the end of the trial. ``This is because Amex
would only seek to partner with select banks from these networks,
which would undermine the associations and their ability to
continue offering competitive pricing and advantages to the benefit
of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But after 36 witnesses, 18 on each side, and millions of pages
of documents, impartial observers, including some who called the
government's case unpersuasive, were cautious when asked to predict
how Jones will rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tossup,'' ventured Bradley Ball, an analyst at Credit Suisse
First Boston. ``It's very difficult to assess where she ultimately
will come out,'' he said, pointing to what he said was a
concentration of testimony on whether consumers were being harmed
rather than on the more technical legal questions.
</P>
<P>
   Anita L. Boomstein, a credit card specialist at the law firm of
Hughes, Hubbard &AMP; Reed, declined to predict that Judge Jones would
side with the defendants but said she thought the government's case
was ``weak'' and over reliant on academic theory.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which did not spell out specific remedies it
seeks until mid-trial, wants to require banks that sit on the
MasterCard board to begin issuing only MasterCards and such Visa
board members to issue only Visa cards. This would end dual
governance, which the government has likened to a big shareholder
in Procter &AMP; Gamble sitting on the board of Kimberly-Clark, which
makes similar products.
</P>
<P>
   But the trial's final defense witness Tuesday, professor Robert
Pindyck of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, contended
that this would limit, not enhance, competition between the two
networks as well as among other card issuers and other forms of
payment.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the defendants have said, barring joint
governance would mean that board members could not issue both kinds
of cards, which both parties agree is to be encouraged. And it
would restrict banks' ability to play the two card associations
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Visa is less interested in preserving dual governance than is
MasterCard, however, because as the larger network it would more
likely prevail if issuers were forced to choose a single partner.
Indeed, some testimony has called MasterCard's very survival into
question in this situation. &QL;

BUSH CLARIFIES TAX RELIEF PROPOSALS; DENIES PLANS HARMFUL TO
FEDERAL PROGRAMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ill. _ As he hopscotched across the Midwest in search of
undecided voters, Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush on
Tuesday defended his tax cut proposals by reassuring the public
that he wouldn't decimate existing federal programs or exhaust
projected federal budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that he'll have to try harder to explain his tax
relief plans, the Texas governor sought to counter criticisms that
his plan to grant across-the-board income tax breaks and bolster
the Social Security system is potentially harmful to important
government programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denied he was reacting to claims by his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Al Gore, that his plan was too risky. Bush
said he was responding to distortions of his plan's impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to do a better job of making it clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan for $1.3 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years, Bush
said, ``we're going to give you some of your own money back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not changing my opinion on it because I think it is the
absolute right thing to do for America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once voters ``buy into the tax relief package even more,'' Bush
predicted, his campaign will capture wide support in several
Midwestern states where the GOP faltered in the last two
presidential elections. That's why he has spent two days this week
stumping in Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's proposal, the dollar amount of tax relief would
depend on income _ prompting Gore's claim that the rich would
benefit the most. But Bush insists that his goal is to help every
taxpayer. He said a two-income family of four earning $50,000 a
year would get a tax cut worth $2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even some Republicans have raised questions about the plan.
U.S. Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., who warmed up a Peoria airport rally
crowd of 4,000 people, told reporters the Bush plan was ``very
ambitious,'' to the point of being ``problematic.'' He said Bush's
proposal has appeal, but some voters would prefer to see more
surplus funds applied to decreasing the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed cutting $500 billion over the same 10-year
period, closely targeting his reductions for specific areas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane ridiculed Bush's effort to step up
his sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The P.R. people who tried to sell the Edsel could only go so
far because at the end of the day, the American people determined
the Edsel was a lemon. George W. Bush is having the same problem in
selling his tax plan,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush emphasized the feasibility of his tax cuts to
reporters, in his public appearances he touted the importance of
reading and education. His visits to a public school in Peoria and
another in the St. Louis suburb of Chesterfield were the 94th and
95th of his campaign. His goal is to top 100 school visits.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to third-graders in Chesterfield's Wild Horse
Elementary School, Bush encouraged the students to forgo television
and pick up books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching TV can be fun sometimes, but it's not as good as
reading because reading is how you learn,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He told educators and parents that he would take $1 billion a
year from the projected surpluses to operate a ``reading
initiative,'' mimicking a Texas program that helps schools pay for
teachers, special training and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is scheduled to be in Austin Wednesday, but returns
to the campaign trail on Thursday in New Orleans and Miami.

CHINA   GOES ON THE ROAD TO SOFTEN ITS IMAGE IN THE U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ After years of grumbling that it has been unfairly
maligned and misunderstood in the United States, the Chinese
government is taking its show on the road with a $7 million public
relations blitz _ a touring extravaganza intended to introduce
Americans to China and its culture.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Thursday and lasting for three weeks, cities across
the United States will play host to a series of performances,
exhibitions and lectures organized by the Chinese. There will be
displays about China's scenic spots in the Javits Center in New
York, musical performances in St. Louis and Des Moines and
question-and-answer sessions with a top Chinese official in
Washington, to name a few of the events.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, organized primarily by the Chinese State Council
Information Office (and partly underwritten by American
corporations with large investments in China), seems clearly
intended to polish China's image for the American public at a
crucial time in relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next month, the U. S. Senate is expected to vote on
whether to give China permanent trading status, the final obstacle
to China's full entry into the World Trade Organization. And
Chinese officials seem keenly aware that China is likely to be a
major foreign policy issue in the coming American presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``American voters should get to know us,'' said Zhao Qizheng,
the government minister who directs the State Council Information
Office. ``I hope that some day an American president will say
something good about China. Will that take 10 years? 20? 50? I hope
it's not that long. So we are bringing a little of China to the
U.S. for people to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign marks the first large-scale attempt by the Chinese
government at public relations and marketing, skills that were
largely irrelevant when it was an isolated Communist state and that
it has managed awkwardly in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But image building has become increasingly important as China
has sought acceptance in the world arena is the last five years.
The pressure on China is especially great because Taiwan, the
island whose future status is the main sticking point in China's
relationship with the United States, has long operated a
sophisticated, well-financed public relations machine in the United
States even though Washington does not officially recognize Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China considers Taiwan a breakaway province separated by civil
war and has not ruled out military force to achieve eventual
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao is one of a new generation of urbane Chinese officials _
his brother is a university administrator in the United States _
and Western diplomats have been uniformly impressed by his relative
openness.
</P>
<P>
   Although China is still a one-party dictatorship that tightly
limits political freedoms, day-to-day life here no longer feels
like repression for most Chinese. Its cities are diverse, bustling
places filled with Internet cafes, fashionably dressed women,
youths with punk attire and neon hair, and opinionated cabdrivers
eager to tick off the foibles of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what Americans' preconceived notions of China are,
what they see when they get here is different,'' said Joseph
Prueher, the American ambassador to Beijing, who announced the
exhibition at a joint news conference with Zhao last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``the hurdles to our relationship are large
because of distance, bias and also genuine differences in how we
approach issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, called ``2000, Experience China in the United
States,'' will certainly accentuate the positive developments in
China as well as the ties between the two countries. (It includes
an exhibit about President Clinton's 1998 state visit.)
</P>
<P>
   The ``genuine differences'' will be obvious only in relief _ the
important works that were not included in this display of Chinese
culture because they do not meet with the government's approval.
</P>
<P>
   While the Chinese literary and art scene has become much more
active and adventurous in the last few years, artists must be wary
about the political content of their work if it is to be openly
sold or shown in China.
</P>
<P>
   While much is now tolerated that brushes obliquely against
politics, books and art exhibits are still banned if they cross the
line _ especially if they become popular and come to the
government's attention. All magazines and publishing houses are
still owned by the state. And films are subject to rigorous
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most exciting recent works by mainland Chinese
authors, artists and directors have achieved international success
but are off limits in China.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Zhao played down the restrictions. ``In
China we have more than 8,000 magazines _ it would be foolish to
think we control this number,'' he said. ``If one peasant has been
arrested, you can't conclude that we deal with all peasants this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhao said that much of the financing for the event came from
corporate America, which is eager to help smooth China's entry into
the World Trade Organization and open China's vast markets to
international business.
</P>
<P>
   The list of honorary committee members for the exhibition reads
like a Who's Who of corporate America, including Maurice R.
Greenberg, chairman of American International Group; Sumner
Redstone, chairman of Viacom; John F. Smith, chairman of General
Motors; Gerald M. Levin, chairman of Time Warner, and Philip M.
Condit, chairman of Boeing.

ON THE OLYMPICS: ATHLETES ARE TAKING TRIALS FROM ARENAS TO THE
COURTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most American athletes are preparing for events like
swimming, gymnastics and track and field at the Summer Games next
month in Sydney, Australia, a number of them are preparing for the
burgeoning Olympic sport of arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Code of conduct and grievance procedures that govern American
Olympians allow athletes to take disputes to binding arbitration.
Generally, it is a good idea for athletes to have this avenue
available to seek redress from unnecessarily subjective methods by
which various sports federations choose their Olympic teams.
</P>
<P>
   But the arbitration process appears to have been abused in two
prominent cases. The Greco-Roman wrestler Keith Sieracki and the
cyclist Christine Witty were both named to the American Olympic
team, only to have their selections challenged by other athletes
who did not qualify. However, both Sieracki and Witty say that they
were never notified of the arbitration hearings or given a chance
to defend themselves. Because their rights of due process were
violated, they say, the subsequent rulings against them should be
invalidated.
</P>
<P>
   At the Greco-Roman Olympic trials in June, Sieracki, an Army
sergeant, defeated the four-time national champion Matt Lindland,
2-1, in the deciding third bout of the 167{-pound category.
Lindland filed an immediate protest, saying he had been illegally
tripped. Greco-Roman wrestling prohibits use of the legs to conduct
a maneuver, but incidental contact is allowed. Lindland filed two
protests with the U.S. wrestling federation, the sport's national
governing body, and both were denied.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland then took his case to an arbitrator, who ordered a
rematch. This time, Lindland won, 8-0. Sieracki said, however, that
he thought the rematch was simply part of training for the
Olympics. He filed a counterclaim, saying that the arbitration
ruling should be meaningless because he was not invited to
participate. A second arbitrator ruled in his favor in a
preliminary hearing. The case will continue Wednesday in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Equally troubling in the Sieracki case is the idea that a
referee's decision could be grounds for arbitration. Carried to the
extreme, every ball and strike called in a baseball game could be
subjected to review. Imagine the chaos in figure skating, which
combines artistry with sport and carries a great deal of
subjectivity in the judging.
</P>
<P>
   The great attraction of sport is that, unlike in everyday life,
victories and losses are clearly defined. Perhaps the officials
made an error in the Sieracki-Lindland match at the Olympic trials.
People make mistakes. But that should not be grounds for
arbitration. There is no quicker way to kill spectator interest
than to have a game played and the outcome decided a month later by
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three officials were there,'' said Sieracki's lawyer, Lt. Col.
Dan Shaver, referring to the referees at the Olympic trials. ``The
integrity of the officiating has to rely on those three officials.
If not, why not videotape every match and let arbitrators make the
decision?''
</P>
<P>
   Witty, who won silver and bronze medals in speedskating at the
1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, is attempting to become the
fourth person to win medals at both the Winter and Summer Games. In
the Olympic cycling trials in April, she finished second to Tammy
Thomas in the 500-meter time trial. But Witty was named to the
American team instead of Thomas because the U.S. cycling federation
used the criterion of international performance over the past two
years. Witty won the 1998 national championship and finished fourth
at the 1998 world championships in the 500-meter time trial, a
two-lap race against the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas protested to an arbitrator, who ordered a ride-off last
Sunday in Frisco, Texas Witty did not show up, and Thomas circled
the track alone. Because she had never been invited to the
arbitration hearing, Witty contended, she was not bound by any
order for a rematch. She has filed her own arbitration case,
scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was never invited to defend herself,'' said Witty's
lawyer, Jeff Benz. ``There was no due process.''
</P>
<P>
   Even stranger, Benz and the cycling federation said, the
arbitrator's ruling did not say that the winner of the rematch
should be placed on the Olympic team. Like Thomas in Sunday's
ride-off, the case continues aimlessly around in circles.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the cast members of ``Survivor'' could also determine
the outcome of these Olympic cases in Wednesday night's finale. At
least a couple of anonymous sports would get enormous television
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to have athletes deciding the Olympic teams
instead of lawyers,'' said Rich Wanninger, director of
communications for USA Cycling. ``We're going to have to start
including bios of the lawyers in our media guide.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Gore-Lieberman visit kicks off the start of rapidly growing
state campaigns
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Already peppering the state with new
campaign ads, the presidential candidates are making live
appearances in South Florida this week beginning with a trip to
Broward County today by Vice President Al Gore and his running
mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   They will be followed by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who is
scheduled to campaign Thursday and Friday in Miami-Dade County. It
will be the first visit for both campaigns since the national
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman are going to Kings Point, a largely Jewish
and politically active condominium community in Broward County.
Lieberman, a former Connecticut attorney general, has caused a lot
of excitement among South Florida's more than 500,000 Jewish voters
because he is the first Jew on a national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   During the Democratic National Convention, some members of the
Florida delegation cried during Lieberman's speech overcome with
joy at the fact that someone of the Jewish faith could be the next
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   After the event at Kings Point, where the candidates will
discuss plans for tax cuts to help families pay for long-term
health care, Gore and Lieberman will raise money for the Democratic
National Committee at the home of Mitchell Berger, a Fort
Lauderdale attorney. Cost is $10,000 per couple. Then they return
to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrives in Miami on Thursday. He will go to the Coral
Gables home of former Arvida Co. chairman Chuck Cobb where he is
expected to raise more than $1 million. On Friday, Bush will have
an early morning event, topic still to be determined, at Florida
International University.
</P>
<P>
   With each campaign describing Florida as a key battleground
state, the visits this week are just a small part of rapidly
growing Florida campaigns. Both sides are beefing up staff and
increasing their spending on television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began a new ad Tuesday that touches on various aspects of
his life building to a theme that ``Al Gore decided that to change
what was wrong in America, he had to fight for what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has two ads running. One is primarily about education and
Bush's ideas for solving learning problems by focusing on reading
and giving more control and accountability to local schools. The
second ad talks about the nation's ``deficit in values.''
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns are running the ads in key states.

 &HT;    Intel aiming at improving its presence on the World Wide Web
 &HT;    By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Maybe the world's biggest semiconductor maker
should change its slogan from Intel Inside to Intel Online.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since IBM Corp. picked Intel Corp. to supply
microprocessors for its first personal computers in 1981, the
company has made its bread and butter _ and billions in profits _
from selling semiconductors to the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   But with PC sales on the wane, and the World Wide Web on the
rise, Intel is betting its chips on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that more obvious than at Intel's annual developers
forum, which runs through Thursday here. Traditionally, the
conference has been the place where Intel gives details about its
latest and greatest PC chips _ past stars have been the 486 and the
Pentium lines.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Intel unveiled its Pentium 4 to a ho-hum audience of
about 5,000. The spotlight at the conference _ where the Intel
slogan ``Powering the net. Connecting the net'' is everywhere _ is
clearly on the company's Internet initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the PC is dead yet _ but our other businesses
are growing faster than our core business,'' said Intel Chief
Executive Craig Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Intel plans to show off new chips for cell phones and handheld
computers and to introduce the latest version of its
Austin-designed StrongARM chips, which are made for Internet-ready
cell phones and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which dominates the PC chip business, finds itself in the
odd position of underdog in the fast-growing business for wireless
Internet semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   Before it began buying its way into the industry two years ago,
Intel's share of the wireless chip business was virtually nil _
something that could make it tough for it to catch up with bigger
players such as Texas Instruments Inc. and Motorola Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Although PC chips will remain Intel's core business in the near
future, Barrett said that its wireless and Internet-related chip
business could surpass its PC chip business within five or 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even the new Pentium 4 is being ballyhooed primarily for its
ability to quickly handle Internet video and pictures, not complex
computing problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw that the Net would become much more visual,'' said
Albert Yu, general manager of Intel's chip business.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration of the new chip, Yu and an assistant filmed
video and sent it seemingly flawlessly over the Internet, capturing
938 frames in a matter of seconds. A similar demonstration using a
Pentium 3 chip captured only 530 of 940 frames, resulting in jerky,
hard-to-see video.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium 4 is expected to run at speeds of up to 1.4
gigahertz when released later this year, which would let Intel
recapture the title as the world's fastest chip maker from
arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Yu also demonstrated a
Pentium 4 that ran at speeds of up to 2 gigahertz, but declined to
say when that chip, which also is being developed with the Internet
in mind, might be available.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Barrett has been touting the wonders of the
Web, but in recent months, the company has seriously stepped up its
efforts. It has been buying, investing in or otherwise doing deals
with companies that do everything from online videoconferencing to
making chipsets and software for wireless Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Through June, Intel had made more acquisitions than any other
company in the electronics industry, according to figures from
merger specialist Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin Inc. And that was
before it went on a real buying binge earlier this month, spending
more than a half-billion dollars to pick up three companies in the
Internet wireless business (see chart). Monday, Intel was part of a
group that invested $9 million into Austin-based Banderacom, which
makes chips for high-speed connections for Internet servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been acquiring companies like crazy,'' said Will
Strauss, whose consulting company, Forward Concepts Inc., follows
the chip business. ``It's pretty clear they want to move into the
wireless market _ and they want to be among the big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's metamorphosis makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   After dizzying growth in the 1990s, the growth rate of PC sales
is starting to decline. Meanwhile, sales of wireless goods that
connect to the Internet _ everything from Web-ready telephones to
personal digital assistants _ are booming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the market for wireless chips) is the fastest-growing
segment of the semiconductor business and the only market bigger
than that for PCs,'' Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Intel's minor role in the wireless chip market, its
semiconductor sales grew by about 17 percent during the first half
of this year, compared with Texas Instrument's 26 percent, Motorola
Inc.'s 25 percent and STMicroelectronic's 55 percent, according to
figures from research company IC Insights.
</P>
<P>
   Look for that to change as Intel digests its recent acquisitions
and gets its new products rolling, analysts and company officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year is when we start to see its whole revenue structure
start to change,'' Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel stock closed up 16 cents to $72.13 Tuesday.

 &HT;    Ramseys to be interviewed by Colorado police next week
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - John and Patsy Ramsey will sit for further questioning
from Boulder, Colo., investigators on Monday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The first police interviews with the Ramseys in more than two
years will focus on new questions that have emerged regarding the
1996 slaying of their daughter, JonBenet, said Boulder Police Chief
Mark Beckner.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to discuss those questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to get some answers to some things we're not
sure of,'' said Beckner, who will be part of a seven-member
investigative team that conducts the videotaped interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys' attorney, Lin Wood of Atlanta, said the couple
hopes the interviews will help the police solve the murder. They
also want the police to eventually clear their name of any
suspicion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side anticipates the interviews, expected to take a day
or two, will end with a quick arrest or an immediate statement from
police clearing the couple of suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   As for clearing the Ramseys in the future, Beckner said, ``If we
are able to prove somebody else did it, then that's a possibility.
I don't know how else we could do that with certainty.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Vladimir Putin promised the grieving families
of the 118-member crew of the destroyed nuclear submarine Kursk
Tuesday nigt that the government would pay each family the
equivalent of an officer's salary for 10 years to compensate them
for their loss, Russian state television reported.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a closely controlled video account of
Putin's first journey to the northern submarine base from which the
twin-reactor submarine made its final voyage two weeks ago, Putin
also met with Irina Lyachin, the widow of the Kursk's skipper,
Capt. Gennady Lyachin, his daughter, Dasha, and unidentified
relatives in the captain's apartment in Vidyayevo.
</P>
<P>
   No audio account of the conversations was broadcast, and Lyachin
sat upright and attentive on a couch with her daughter at her side
as Putin was shown speaking to her.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the apartment with Lyachin, Putin personally
motioned with his hand to a state television crew to stop filming
as he descended the grimy stairwell in the apartment building that
houses Russian officers and their families, at times without
adequate heat and hot water supplies. Some reports said there were
frantic efforts to clean the town before Putin's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vidyayevo is a dead town right now,'' one young woman told
state television earlier in the day. ``The houses are standing like
after a war. All of the windows are empty. Everything is robbed.
The mothers are walking like shadows through the town. People are
crying and the men don't raise their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he left Moscow, Putin declared that Wednesday would be a
national day of mourning and ordered flags to fly at half-staff.
Russian officials said he would fly to the deck of the cruiser
Peter the Great to cast a memorial wreath of flowers onto the
Arctic waters where the twin-reactor submarine went down on Aug. 12
after suffering a catastrophic series of internal explosions or
possible collision.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports said Tuesday night that family members had
petitioned the Russian navy to take them to sea so that they could
also participate in the memorial service on Wednesday and pay
respects to their loved ones, but navy commanders were reportedly
resisting this appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday night, Putin attended a two-hour session at a
meeting hall in Vidyayevo, the Kursk's home base near Severomorsk,
the headquarters of the Northern Fleet. Both cities are closed to
foreigners, and one Russian media organization, the independent
network NTV, said its permit to enter the city was rescinded,
presumably to prevent its correspondents from covering Putin's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   From the video accounts on state television, Putin's exchanges
with family members were mostly undiscernable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When will we get them back, dead or alive?'' one woman was
heard to shout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will answer as soon as I know myself,'' Putin was heard to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader, dressed in black, arrived on a military
plane in late afternoon and was greeted by top military officials,
as well naval commanders and Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov,
who is heading the investigation into the causes of the explosions
or collision that sank the 14,000-ton submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The encounters with family members represent the most sensitive
and politically volatile task Putin faces in dampening the
political crisis that has arisen over the loss of the advanced
attack submarine and its crew. Many family members have questioned
why the Russian government and its military commanders were not
able to assure the safety of their loved ones and why the navy
could not rescue them when tragedy struck.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews by state television earlier in the day, the wives
of some Kursk sailors pleaded for international donations to
continue the rescue operation in hopes that even one might still be
found alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told that the Norwegian rescuers can't keep working
because they are not being paid enough money,'' one unidentified
woman said. ``Maybe some companies, some big people,
philanthropists, will help us by giving money and maybe in 48 hours
we'll save these people, and happiness will come, at least one
person will come out of this submarine alive and will tell the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin did not travel to Severomorsk with his usual contingent of
Russian news organizations. That reflected the concern of his
advisers who were afraid that emotional outbursts and
recriminations directed at Putin and broadcast to the nation might
prolong the crisis and perhaps threaten the agenda of economic and
political reforms he is said to be planning for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Putin arrived by military plane to the region where
dozens of secret submarine bases are located along the fjords of
the Kola Peninsula, Norwegian and British deep sea divers abandoned
their search and rescue work. The crew's bodies remain in the
Kursk's wrecked and flooded hull under 350 feet of water, but the
Norwegians and British said they might be back with different
equipment if they can conclude a contract with Russian officials.
That contract would cover the cost of penetrating the hull in a
complex operation to recover the remains of the sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Russian navy officials offered to cut giant holes in the hull of
the Kursk in order to make entry to the vessel easier and safer for
divers involved in the recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Kudrin said the Russian government
was prepared to finance the full cost of the crew recovery and a
complex and dangerous salvage operation whose estimated cost has
already reached $100 million.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, environmental organizations urged Russia to
move quickly to salvage Kursk's two atomic reactors because of the
threat that radiation could leak into the Barents Sea and its
abundant fishing grounds. Experts in both the U.S. and Russian
navies asserted that Kursk's reactor compartment would adequately
contain any radiation leaks for years, but Alexander Nikitin, a
former Russian naval officer who disclosed the dumping of
radioactive wastes at sea by the Russian navy, warned on Monday
that the Kursk's reactors could begin leaking radiation in a matter
of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With winter approaching in the Arctic waters, there were
conflicting estimates of whether Russia would be able to recover
the crew's remains and finish the salvage this fall, before fierce
storms and ice flows set in.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to solve the mystery of how the Kursk sank also
continued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Rutskoi, former vice president and now governor of the
Kursk region, for which the submarine is named, asserted Tuesday
that the attack boat was carrying an experimental torpedo that was
to be test fired during the maneuvers in which Kursk was operating.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk had on board a ``new torpedo and two civilian
engineers,'' said Rutskoi, a former war hero and leader of a 1993
parliamentary uprising against former President Boris Yeltsin. ``It
is necessary to investigate this aspect, and if a new torpedo was
really being tested on the submarine, it is a crime,'' he
continued, arguing that test firings of new weapons should not be
conducting during crew training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Chechen rebellion in southern Russia offered
their own explanation Tuesday, suggesting that a ``kamikaze''
fighter from the Northern Caucasus was among the crew and triggered
the disaster.

<P>
   DETROIT _ The Firestone tires that have been failing on Ford
Explorers have fairly low weight-carrying capability for a vehicle
of the Explorer's size, particularly at the low inflation pressure
recommended by Ford Motor, publicly available technical
specifications for the tires and the Explorers show.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone officials have said several times over the
last two weeks that the recalled 15-inch tires are losing their
treads at high speeds partly because drivers are overloading their
vehicles. But this can be easy to do in an Explorer: its
recommended maximum payload for passengers and cargo is 750 to
1,310 pounds, depending on the model. Four people, plus luggage,
can exceed the lower end of that range, particularly if they use
the roof rack and the rear cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer is at least as heavy as any of its main rivals in
the mid-sized sport utility market, and has been several hundred
pounds heavier in some model years, notably 1996, the vintage that
has produced the most crash claims. Yet Ford's rivals typically use
either larger tires or recommend higher tire pressures for their
models.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the size of a tire or its pressure allows it to carry
more weight safely, provided motorists do not exceed the maximum
pressure recommended by the tire maker.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevrolet Blazer, for example, uses the same size tires as
the Explorer. But General Motors recommends that the tires on all
its mid-sized sport utilities be inflated to 35 pounds per square
inch, compared with just 26 for the Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the combined weight-carrying ability of the Blazer
tires is 1,100 pounds greater than the Explorer tires. The
recommended maximum payload for a Blazer is 930 to 1,330 pounds,
which four adults and their luggage are less likely to exceed.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda Passport, Nissan Pathfinder and Mitsubishi Montero
Sport have the same recommended tire pressure as the Explorer. But
the Passport and the Pathfinder use larger tires, allowing them to
carry more weight. The Montero Sport has even smaller tires than
the Explorer, but Mitsubishi recommends that its customers raise
the pressure in the rear tires before carrying heavy loads _ a
recommendation that Ford has not made for the Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has chosen larger tires with higher pressures for its next
generation of Explorers, which will go on sale in January. The new
tires, chosen several years ago, will be able to carry considerably
more weight than the current ones, and will give the new Explorer a
recommended payload of 1,100 to 1,500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials defend their choice of the recalled tires, saying
they meet tire industry guidelines for carrying weight. Ford also
questions Bridgestone/Firestone's assertion that overloading has
contributed to tire failures in the United States, although the
automaker acknowledges that tires did fail on Explorers overseas
that became overloaded when owners installed third rows of seats
and used the vehicles as shuttle buses.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also contends that with the Explorer or any other truck, it
is the responsibility of owners to check weight labels posted on
the inside of the doors and then limit the weight put inside, with
particular attention to not putting too much weight at the back of
the vehicle. ``It provides you on the label the gross vehicle
weight rating _ you can't load it so that you exceed 3,000 pounds
on the rear axle either,'' said Lee Carr, a vehicle dynamics
engineering consultant on the Explorer and former Ford engineer to
whom Ford referred questions on the Explorer tires.
</P>
<P>
   But safety experts have long questioned how many sport utility
customers think of their vehicles as trucks, much less check the
weight ratings on the label. Carr acknowledged that people who
switched to Explorers from cars might not be accustomed to checking
weight ratings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said the best evidence for the
adequacy of the current tire size and pressure lay in the
performance of Goodyear tires that were installed on nearly half
the Explorers built in the 1995, 1996 and 1997 model years.
Goodyear has not had any reports of problems with these tires, said
Bill Hopkins, Goodyear's vice president for global product
marketing and technical planning. Harmon said Ford had received
just one report of a tread separation involving a Goodyear tire on
an Explorer, but the incident did not result in any injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials have been consistent in pointing to quality
problems in the Firestone tires, while contending that their design
decisions did not cause the failures. Reluctant to antagonize their
biggest customer, Firestone officials have said little to question
this.
</P>
<P>
   But John Lampe, an executive vice president of
Bridgestone/Firestone, said this evening that concerns about the
tires' ability to carry the Explorer's weight safely had been one
reason for the tire maker's recommendation two weeks ago that
Explorer owners begin inflating their tires to 30 pounds per square
inch. Ford has since said that a range of 26 to 30 pounds is
acceptable to the automaker's engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's decision on Monday to temporarily close two Ford Ranger
pickup factories to make more replacement tires available for
Explorers highlighted the unusual fact that the Ranger and the
Explorer still use the same tires.
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer was introduced as a variation of the Ranger in late
1990, and was an immediate best-seller. Over the years, the
Explorer has grown bigger and heavier, because many people use it
as a luxury family car and choose practically every option,
including four-wheel drive even if they plan no off-road driving.
Yet most Explorers still share the tires of a small pickup that
weighs half a ton less.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Ford executives expected only a few customers to
choose four-wheel drive, and were taken by surprise that most
drivers want the option, which adds 220 pounds to the vehicle's
weight. Ford makes the key components for the four-wheel-drive
systems at a factory in Bordeaux, France, that has been so
backlogged that the automaker has maintained a charter fleet of
jets for years just to ferry them to its Explorer assembly plants
in Louisville, Ky., and St. Louis, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice problem to have,'' said Steve Von Foerster, the
chief program engineer for the Explorer. ``People want it so bad
that you have to rent your own fleet of 747's.'' With a profitable
model, airlifting heavy auto parts is cheaper than shutting down
the assembly plant, but an automaker does it only as a last resort,
after greatly underestimating demand for an option.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles need tires that can support considerably more than
their own weight plus the payload because they lean on the tires on
one side when going around curves, and because the weight of cargo
and passengers is seldom evenly distributed.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Ford Explorer weighs 4,000 to 4,400 pounds. Four
15-inch tires of the type and inflation pressure now being recalled
can support a total of 7,012 pounds at a pressure of 26 pounds per
square inch, according to the tire industry's Tire and Rim
Association guidelines. At a pressure of 30 pounds per square inch,
which Firestone now recommends, the tires can support a total of
7,525 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the similarly sized Chevrolet Blazer weighs roughly
4,000 pounds or a little less. It has the same size tires but,
because of a higher inflation pressure, the tires can support a
total of 8,112 pounds.

MICROSOFT ASKS SUPREME COURT TO SEND ANTITRUST CASE TO APPEALS
COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. made a final plea Tuesday to the Supreme
Court to send its antitrust case to a federal appeals court for the
``onerous task'' of reviewing the record instead of hearing the
appeal directly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's plea came in a legal brief that answered a filing
last week by the Justice Department, which urged the Supreme Court
to hear the appeal directly. A fast-track appeal directly to the
top court, the government said, was in the national interest
because waiting for the appeals court to act could ``irreparably
harm competition'' in the computer industry and could result in
justice being ``denied through delay.''
</P>
<P>
   In its filing Tuesday, Microsoft focused on the arguments that
the case is extremely complex and that the trial judge made a
series of factual and procedural errors.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who heard the
lawsuit, ruled earlier this year that Microsoft was a monopoly that
had repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. He ordered
that the company be split in two, an order he later shelved pending
appeals. Microsoft is appealing both Jackson's ruling and his
breakup order.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft clearly plans to ask that Jackson's work be given a
detailed review on appeal _ a task, the company says, that would be
handled best by the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings in this case,'' Microsoft stated, ``are not the
product of even one level of impartial decision-making.'' In its
filing, Microsoft said that Jackson's handling of the trial and his
ordering of a breakup without separate hearings on sanctions ``cast
serious doubt on the reliability'' of his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say it is difficult to assess whether the Supreme
Court will hear a direct appeal of the Microsoft case. The court
will decide by the opening of its next session, in October, if not
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Under the stewardship of William H. Rehnquist, who became chief
justice in 1986, the Supreme Court has been aggressive in limiting
its case load, legal experts say. In the late 1970s and early
1980s, they note, the court routinely decided nearly twice as many
cases as in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft lawsuit, they add, is an extraordinary case.
The antitrust Expediting Act of 1903, which was amended in 1974,
permits direct appeals to the Supreme Court of antitrust cases
brought by the government. Until the 1974 amendment, such appeals
always went straight to the Supreme Court, but the revision of the
Expediting Law let the court decide whether to take an appeal
directly.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1974, the government has rarely asked for a direct appeal.
The last time it did so was nearly 18 years ago, when the Supreme
Court agreed to hear two appeals to the AT&AMP;T antitrust ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts point to the ``institutional forces'' in the
Microsoft case that might prod the Supreme Court to take a direct
appeal. The U.S. solicitor general and the Justice Department have
made the request, and Jackson has certified the case for fast-track
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be hard for the court to say no,'' observed Andrew
Gavil, a professor at the Howard University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, however, says that saying no would be the appropriate
choice. Although the company's brief said that ``no one is more
anxious than Microsoft to see this case brought to a prompt
conclusion,'' it went on to explain why it thought its case was
different from the AT&AMP;T case.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T case, Microsoft said, did not involve a review of a
complex factual record _ a sharp contrast, in the company's view,
from what would be required in the appeal of its own case.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing last week, the Justice Department made a spirited
argument for direct appeal. ``The stakes in this case for the
national economy are immense,'' the government said. ``If this case
does not qualify for direct review under the Expediting Act, it is
difficult to imagine what future case would.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft addressed those statements in its reply Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is: a case in which the nature of the issues
presented and the state of the record make it suitable for direct
review by this court,'' the company said. ``AT&AMP;T was such a case;
this case is not.''

IT'S TIME FOR DODGERS TO REBUILD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The time has come for the Los Angeles Dodgers to take that
difficult, humbling and controversial step, one that will raise the
hackles of some fans and is always accompanied by a white flag.
</P>
<P>
   Fire sale.
</P>
<P>
   It's come to that point. A dozen reasons can be cited for the
team's malaise, but the statute of limitations on kvetching about
Pedro Martinez, Mike Piazza and the Dodger Blue massacre of 1998 is
about to run out. It's time to move forward, and the reality is
that this team as currently assembled isn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   That means retrench, putting the biggest names on the ballclub
in the showcase window -- 2000 MVP candidate Gary Sheffield, lone
wolf pitcher Kevin Brown, longtime Dodger Eric Karros and
first-year Dodger Shawn Green -- and not just the usual suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be tough seeing Sheffield leave, now that he's finally
comfortable in L.A.? Yes, but no tougher than seeing Piazza traded.
Isn't it risky trading a No. 1 pitcher like Brown? Yes, but perhaps
not if one can get three pitchers in return. Would it hurt to see
Karros move on, the last remnant of five straight rookies of the
year? Yes, but we're used to that pain.
</P>
<P>
   These are the toughest kind of decisions, and also the most
controversial. Teams like the Padres, Marlins and White Sox were
scorched by fan and media criticism of their fire sales, but the
reality is that they have all survived and built a new foundation
from the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   What's more enjoyable, watching a team with a $90 million
payroll floundering around .500 and sharing space in baseball's
middle ground with the Marlins (payroll: $19 million), or watching
teams like Oakland ($32 million) and Chicago ($31 million) emerge
as playoff candidates a few years removed from their own fire sale?
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, watching a team crumble from the expectations of
high-priced players with long term contracts, or a team rebuilding
around a nucleus of young players with upside?
</P>
<P>
   There's no guarantee that opponents will step up boldly for any
of the four highest-priced Dodgers. Thanks to the generous Kevin
Malone, three of the four players make more than the going rate for
superstars, and all have multiyear contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But they would draw some interest. And baseball's recent past is
encouraging for those teams willing to take this step.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, for example. No one projected a Mariners division title
or playoff berth without Randy Johnson and Ken Griffey, but the
young players they received in trade -- pitchers Freddy Garcia and
John Halama, outfielder Mike Cameron -- have contributed, and they
used the salary savings to sign free agents Aaron Sele and John
Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   The A's weren't expected to overcome losing Mark McGwire. But
while the three pitchers Oakland obtained haven't contributed
directly, the A's used their pitching depth to make subsequent
deals for Terrance Long and closer Jason Isringhausen. They also
had a plan, what with young players like Dirtbag Jason Giambi, Eric
Chavez, Miguel Tejada, Ben Grieve, Tim Hudson, Ramon Hernandez and
Adam Piatt all maturing at about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox and owner Jerry Reinsdorf were condemned for
trading Roberto Hernandez and Wilson Alvarez to the Giants in 1997
for prospects. But one of those prospects is White Sox closer Keith
Foulke, one of six players obtained in minor trades that have
contributed to the White Sox's A.L. Central lead -- Jon Garland,
Bobby Howry, ex-Dodger Paul Konkero, Sean Lowe, Bill Simas (Angels)
and Chris Singleton.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres were roasted for their distress sale in the early
'90s, but they rebounded and made it to the 1998 World Series. Even
the Marlins, who discarded every member of their 1997 World Series
champs -- Charles Johnson, Gary Sheffield, Edgar Renteria, Robb
Nen, Moises Alou, Livan Hernandez, Kevin Brown -- have emerged from
their fire sale.
</P>
<P>
   They're a credible .500 team with a modest $19 million payroll
and good, young pitchers eberywhere, like Ryan Dempster, A.J.
Burnett, Brad Penny, Braden Looper, Jesus Sanchez and several
others waiting in the farm system.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, of course, have no farm system, or so CEO Bob Daly
and Malone will tell you. They said Fred Claire and Tommy Lasorda
left the team bare of products, a specious argument considering the
team turned out five rookie of the year winners in the mid-90s. If
the Dodgers are so bare, then why did Malone trade the franchise's
best minor league lefthander, Randy Dorame, in the Tom Goodwin
deal?
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the first products of the Malone regime are
two-to-three years away from contributing, that suggests a target
date of 2003, and I can't imagine fans tolerating two more seasons
of 2000-brand baseball.
</P>
<P>
   So if it's tough decisions that need to be made, giving up ten
games in 2001 to gain 20 by 2002, then so be it. Let the changes
begin.
</P>
<P>
   Shop the Fantastic Four to Boston, Cleveland, St. Louis, Texas
and both New York clubs. Several of those teams could use a
left-fielder like Sheffield. Cleveland and St. Louis would love a
Kevin Brown. Trade at least one of them for a three- or four-player
package of prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Send good guy Todd Hundley where he belongs, to the A.L. where
he can DH, in exchange for a solid prospect. Make whatever deals
necessary to move Devon White, Tom Goodwin, Mark Grudzielanek,
Carlos Perez, Terry Adams, Gregg Olson, Chad Kreuter, Kevin Elster,
Antonio Osuna, Jim Leyritz, F.P. Santangelo and other
Malone-acquired dross on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Keep Jeff Shaw after testing the market. Give the catching job
to Paul LoDuca and/or Angel Pena and shortstop to Alex Cora. Keep
Adrian Beltre. Keep Darren Dreifort and Chan Ho Park, and maybe
even Ismael Valdes because he's too young to quit on. Promote all
of the young pitchers at Albuquerque. And reassign Malone to player
development, where he belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Is this tough? Yes. But no tougher than watching the Dodgers of
2000 stumble around baseball's equator. If a fire sale would help,
then let's break out the matches.

THE ULTIMATE `SURVIVOR' SURVIVAL GUIDE

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, a little perspective: When ``Survivor'' debuted May 31 on
CBS, the Dallas Stars were still alive in hockey's Stanley Cup
playoffs, ``Mission: Impossible 2'' was the No. 1 movie at the box
office, and Walter Matthau and Sir Alec Guinness were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, time flies when you're vicariously stranded on an island.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night brings the two-hour finale of ``Survivor,''
along with a cast reunion/post-mortem that is likely to give CBS
its biggest ratings bonanza since Hawkeye said goodbye to B.J. in
the closing episode of ``MASH.''
</P>
<P>
   Heck, maybe bigger. This has been the show of the summer,
dominating TV and dividing the country into two camps, the fanatics
and people who insist that they'll never watch the show _ but even
the latter group probably has some idea who Kelly, Richard, Rudy
and Susan are.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the show-avoiders will probably break down Wednesday,
their curiosity getting the better of them, and check out what all
the fuss is about. But walking into ``Survivor'' at this juncture
can be like trying to understand the rules of, say, cricket. So,
with both fanatics and newbies in mind, we present the ultimate
``Survivor'' survival guide.

   OUR STORY THUS FAR ...
</P>
<P>
   Back in the spring, CBS dumped 16 people on Pulau Tiga, an
island in the South China Sea. They were allowed some material
luxuries _ including, apparently, makeup and razors _ but were
largely stripped of the necessities like, say, a roof, a fridge and
a bed. They had to make their shelters and forage for most of their
food.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 were divided into two tribes of eight, the Tagi
(portrayed as squabbling, back-stabbing, devious) and the Pagong
(friendly, mellow, good-timey). Each week, the tribes were issued
two challenges, often in the form of elaborate, Rube Goldberg-style
games: a reward challenge (for a home comfort) and an immunity
challenge. The tribe that lost the immunity challenge gathered in a
``tribal council'' and voted one of its members off the island.
</P>
<P>
   When the island members dwindled to 10, the tribes were merged
into one and given the Pottery Barn-esque name Rattana. The
challenges became individual events, and immunity ensured that a
contestant survived till the next episode. For example, Kelly, the
22-year-old river guide, has dodged bullets for two consecutive
episodes by winning the immunity challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's episode starts with the Final Four, who face two
more immunity challenges and three more tribal councils. In the
final tribal council, the last two plead their cases to a ``jury,''
made up of the last seven people voted off the island (including
Wednesday's two evictees). The person who makes the most convincing
case wins and snags a million bucks. The rest go home a few pounds
lighter, unless a diet consisting of rice, bugs, rats and manta
rays makes you gain weight. Don't cry too hard for the losers,
though; they get consolation prizes that would pay off most
people's credit-card debts.

   SURVIVE YOURSELF
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few audience-participation tips to get you in the
spirit for Wednesday's ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   What to wear: Women should favor bikinis, tankinis, sarongs,
scarves, occasional gimme caps _ and good running shoes. For men,
the style is much simpler: shorts, T-shirts, tank tops, gimme caps
_ and good running shoes. For men, shirts are optional; if you want
to be like the recently ousted Sean _ although we can't fathom that
_ sport a nipple ring. If you want to emulate Richard, walk around
almost naked _ but retain your black dress socks. Clothes from
Target, one of the show's sponsors, are preferred.
</P>
<P>
   What to eat: Rice, bland seafood. Other items are suggested for
immunity challenges below.
</P>
<P>
   What to drink: Water _ and none of that fancy bottled stuff,
either. We'll accept beer, but only if it's Bud Light, one of the
show's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Decorating tips: Remove all furniture from your TV room and sit
on logs, or stretch out on hammocks. Occasionally throw water on
guests to simulate island storms (it's even better if you do it in
front of a high-speed fan). Tiki torches and mosquito netting are
optional.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   CHALLENGE YOURSELF
</P>
<P>
   You can use these games for reward challenges or immunity
challenges. For reward challenges, we suggest that you have
prepared a slice of pizza, a barbecue sandwich, one beer or some
other similar food item that only the winner can eat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turn off the air conditioner. Last person to complain about
the heat wins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sit through the Reebok commercials. The last person to laugh
or express shock at the envelope-pushing humor wins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give everyone remote controls programmed for your TV set. The
last person to channel-surf wins. Women have an unfair advantage,
but hey _ life's not fair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drink a full glass of the beverage of your choice during each
commercial break. The last person to use the restroom wins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shoot suction-cup darts at host Jeff Probst when he shows up
onscreen. The person who comes closest wins _ although in a way,
everyone does.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS FOR: Eating a bug or a fried rat. Or watching
someone else do it.
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLE-EXTRA POINTS FOR: Correctly guessing the people who will
be kicked off, in order.
</P>
<P>
   POINTS OFF FOR: Walking around naked, having an irritating
voice, being lazy or sporting a nipple ring.

MITSUBISHI MOTORS ADMITS CONCEALING COMPLAINTS ABOUT DEFECTS SINCE
'77 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Mitsubishi Motors admitted Tuesday that it had
systematically concealed customer complaints about tens of
thousands of defective automobiles since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The admission by Mitsubishi, Japan's No. 4 automaker, came a
month after its top executive had denied accusations that it had
covered up repeated instances of problems that included faulty fuel
tanks, fueltank caps, clutches, crankshafts and brakes.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the admission, the company announced recalls based on
defects found in 88,000 cars and trucks, adding to a recall of
532,000 vehicles announced last month. The recalls, which are
expected to cost the company about $69 million, mostly affect
vehicles sold in Japan but include 50,000 vehicles exported to the
United States the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that the defects caused any serious or
fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. and Japanese law, automakers are required to notify
the government about defects reported to them by customers. By
ignoring this requirement, Mitsubishi had avoided potentially
costly recalls, which are considered especially humiliating for a
Japanese auto company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sincerely apologize to the drivers of our cars,'' said
Katsuhiko Kawasoe, president of Mitsubishi. ``My job is to work to
regain the public's trust in this company.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how such a pattern of deception could have gone
on for so long without the knowledge of high-level executives.
</P>
<P>
   But Kawasoe, who said he had no knowledge of the coverup until
it was documented in an internal investigation submitted to the
government Tuesday, promised that the company would punish those
who were directly responsible. He also said he and other top
Mitsubishi executives would take a salary cut to acknowledge their
accountability. Kawasoe said, however, that he did not intend to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation found that Mitsubishi employees would
repair the defects but would mark the customer complaints with the
initial ``H'', short for ``hitoku,'' which means conceal, or
``horyu,'' which means defer or hold, the internal investigation
showed. None of these complaints were reported to the government.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan's Transportation Ministry said it was studying
possible penalties for Mitsubishi because of the coverup, including
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what kind of sanctions the company might face in
the United States. But the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said Tuesday it was interested in how Mitsubishi had
handled safety information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have asked Mitsubishi if any of the activities in Japan
have a bearing on vehicles sold in the United States,'' said Tim
Hurd, a spokesman for the safety administration in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The admission of a coverup could further damage the already
troubled image of Mitsubishi, maker of such models as the Montero
sport utility vehicle, Galant sedan and Mirage compact, at a time
when it is trying to stimulate sales through alliances with
DaimlerChrysler, the German-U.S. automaker, and Volvo of Sweden.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mitsubishi is the second major Japanese manufacturer to confront
a recall scandal in the past two weeks. Bridgestone/Firestone has
been the object of intense negative publicity since the company
announced Aug. 9 that it would replace6.5 million potentially
dangerous tires, most of them on sport utility vehicles sold by
Ford Motor Co. in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Mitsubishi's admission Tuesday Kawasoe visited the
Transportation Minister, Hajime Morita in Tokyo, apologizing in a
deep bow that was widely reported in the Japanese media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole state of affairs is, in a word, the result of a lack
of respect for rules and regulations on the part of the company
officers and employees involved,'' Kawasoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month when rumors of a coverup first began to circulate,
Kawasoe had said they were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors turned into a scandal after Transport Ministry
officials, evidently acting on an anonymous telephone tip,
discovered a pile of customer complaints in a company locker room
during an inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of hiding evidence that could lead to a recall in
Japan is not new. Recalls, particularly for automakers, are
considered an enormous humiliation. Japan's automotive
manufacturers are acclaimed year after year for the superior
quality and durability of vehicles, often beating their American
competitors in consumer tests.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji Heavy Industries was fined in 1997 for repairing defective
vehicles without reporting the defects to the government, which
could have led to a recall.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a law that prohibits such coverups, the Road Vehicles
Act, was toughened after the Fuji Heavy's violation. But the
monetary penalty is still light. Although the steepest fine was
quintupled to 1 million yen, that is only about $9,200 at current
exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi said the recalls of vehicles exported to the United
States cover leaking break fuid in the Montero, a potentially loose
chassis joint on the Galant and and a potentially loose engine
shaft on the Mirage. Owners will be notified by mail.
</P>
<P>
   The negative publicity of Mitsubishi's coverup could compound
its overall problem of weak sales at home and abroad. The company's
domestic sales in the first six months of this year fall 3.2
percent compared with the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Motor Corp.'s sales, meanwhile, rose 5.3 percent and and
Honda Motor Co.'s sales rose 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Mitsubishi also has taken a beating, particularly
in the past few weeks as rumors of the coverup frightened
investors. The shares fell 2.1 percent Tuesday to 429 yen or about
$3.94, and are down 15 percent from their high for the year of 497
yen reached early last month.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi's competitive problems were a major reason why it
agreed to an alliance with DaimlerChrysler, which took a 34 percent
stake in the company under a deal signed less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler officials in Japan and the United States
declined to comment about the coverup. But Karin Funke, a
spokeswoman for the company at its headquarters in Stuttgart, was
quoted by Dow Jones newswires as saying it would not affect their
relationship. ``This is a matter that concerns Mitsubishi alone,''
she was quoted as saying.

AFTER BELFAST VIOLENCE, PROTESTANT MILITANT IS TAKEN BACK INTO
CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
  By   ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Confronting a wave of violence among Protestant
paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland, British officials ordered
the re-arrest on Tuesday of one of the province's most notorious
Protestant militants, 11 months after he had been freed under the
1998 Good Friday peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Johnny Adair, was seized in a car on the Protestant
Shankill Road in Belfast as British troops returned to the city's
streets one day after two men were shot to death in an increasingly
violent feud between Protestant ``loyalist'' organizations.
Witnesses said Adair was ordered out of the car and told to lie on
the ground before being driven to a prison outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   British officials depict the fighting between the loyalist
paramilitaries as a narcotics-fueled turf war tied to what Peter
Mandelson, the senior British official in the province, on Tuesday
called ``the dark side of Northern Ireland's society, the mafia
culture created by decades of paramilitary conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Adair, who at the time of his release had served five and a half
years of a 16-year sentence on terrorism charges, is a leading
figure in the Ulster Defense Association, which has been locked in
conflict with another loyalist group, the Ulster Volunteer Force.
Ideologically, all of Northern Ireland's loyalist groups support
continued British rule, but they are bitterly divided among
themselves over personality and territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The two men killed on Monday were said by the police to be
members of Adair's organization. The police said the killers fired
nine bullets into the men as they crossed a road to their car.
There was speculation that Adair's arrest would increase pressure
among his followers to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1999, Adair was freed from the high-security Maze
prison under terms in the peace deal enabling convicted terrorists
to be released provided they refrained from violence. But the
agreement also permits their so-called good behavior license to be
revoked if they are thought to be fomenting violent actions.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the arrest, Mandelson, Britain's Northern Ireland
secretary, said: ``My priority is public safety and I cannot give
freedom to an individual intent on abusing it. I am satisfied that
this particular individual has breached the terms of his license.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he told reporters: ``We should be absolutely clear that
what we are witnessing has nothing to do with the peace process.
It's nothing more or less than squalid, murderous gang warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's killings, at least 10 people were hurt and a
number of buildings set ablaze. BBC television reported tonight
that some residents of the Shankill Road area were boarding up
their homes and leaving in anticipation of further clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Belfast police said on Monday that the army was returning to
the city's streets as ``a short-term measure.''
</P>
<P>
   British soldiers withdrew from Belfast after the 1998 peace deal
but troops returned briefly last month after the authorities banned
a Protestant march through a Catholic area of the city.

STILL GRASPING FOR NIJINSKY'S ELUSIVE LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL GESMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Just over 50 years after his death
in London, events around the world are reaffirming the apparently
boundless fascination with the dancer and choreographer Vaslav
Nijinsky, whose brief career ended at 29 because of the mental
illness that gripped him the rest of his 61 years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In March, a comprehensive Nijinsky exhibition, including his own
drawings and paintings, began touring European museums.
Nijinsky-themed plays ran this past winter and spring in Tokyo,
London and Scottsdale, Ariz., and in May the Royal Ballet performed
``L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune,'' his 1912 debut as a choreographer, and
a controversial re-creation of his 1913 ``Jeux.'' The Nijinsky
season continued on July 2 when the Hamburg Ballet gave the
premiere of John Neumeier's homage, ``Nijinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   The mental illness that culminated in a breakdown in 1919 froze
Nijinsky's image in perpetually radiant youth, an
early-20th-century Jim Morrison or Bruce Lee. A virtuoso of
unprecedented caliber, an unabashedly erotic interpreter of
gender-bending roles, a choreographer of revolutionary ballets, a
scandalously open bisexual, a self-styled ``philosopher of
feeling,'' a madman _ Nijinsky left a rich yet enigmatic legacy
that still eludes full understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Nijinsky created his own system of dance notation, which was
finally deciphered in 1984, but he recorded the steps only for
``Faune.'' Before being dropped from the Diaghilev Ballets Russes
repertory, ``Jeux'' and ``Le Sacre du Printemps'' (1913) received
fewer than 10 performances each in Paris and London, and ``Till
Eulenspiegel'' (1916) received just 23 during the 1916-17 United
States tour. Despite numerous imaginative reinterpretations over
the decades, these last three ballets were long presumed lost,
leaving scant evidence for assessing Nijinsky's choreography, which
was largely dismissed until books by Lincoln Kirstein and Richard
Buckle in the 1970s gave it an elevated and, according to some,
inflated stature.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1971, Millicent Hodson, an American student who wanted
the exercise of choreographing ``in the style of'' Nijinsky, began
efforts to reconstruct ``Le Sacre.'' Ten years later she met and
married the British art historian Kenneth Archer, an authority on
the Russian painter and pantheistic philosopher Nicholas Roerich,
whose original costumes and set designs for ``Le Sacre'' he
subsequently recreated. Seven companies have produced the
Hodson-Archer reconstruction of ``Le Sacre,'' starting with the
Joffrey Ballet in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Hodson and Archer mounted their first (and so far only)
reconstruction of ``Till Eulenspiegel'' with the Paris Opera
Ballet, and in 1996 they presented a ``reconstruction after''
Nijinsky's ``Jeux'' with the Opera Ballet of Verona in Italy. But
their efforts had never been seen in England before the Royal
Ballet's staging in May of ``Jeux,'' alongside ``Faune,''
Bronislava Nijinska's 1924 ``Les Biches'' and Michel Fokine's 1910
``Firebird.''
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with this ``Diaghilev Legacy'' program, a reworking
of David Pownall's play ``Nijinsky: Death of a Faun'' was presented
at the Royal Opera House's Linbury Studio Theater. It starred the
dancer Nicholas Johnson, who commissioned the one-man drama and was
its original interpreter in 1991 and previously performed many of
Nijinsky's roles with the Royal and English National Ballets. He
also danced Nijinsky's ``soul'' in the 1975 BBC Omnibus documentary
``God of the Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nijinsky's journal, a quasi-mystical and undeniably disturbed
document written on the eve of his 1919 breakdown, said that
``Jeux'' was a veiled portrayal of Diaghilev's fantasy of a gay
threesome. But a nocturnal tennis match at Lady Ottoline Morrell's
London home in July 1912 also purportedly inspired the
``poeme-danse,'' the first ballet to treat contemporary life and
bisexuality and to resolve a love triangle as a menage a trois. His
imagistic scenario of a three-way courtship, drawing on
Bloomsbury's libertine manners and mores, also marked the first
time a choreographer had commissioned a score; Claude Debussy's
18-minute masterpiece was only recognized as such decades later.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jeux,'' a lost ball draws a man and two women from an
offstage tennis court into a secluded garden, where shifting games
of jealousy and desire are played out in ambiguous couplings and
triplings. The figures were possibly based on the painter Duncan
Grant and the Stephens sisters, the novelist Virginia Woolf and the
painter Vanessa Bell, who would later vie for Grant's attentions.
Another source may have been Nijinsky's three-way tennis games in
1908 with his sister, Bronislava, and his early lover, Prince Lvov.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary reviews did not disparage Nijinsky's morals, but
attacked instead his cinematically abrupt choreography with its
pioneering neoclassical juxtapositions of sportive movement,
Edwardian walks, conversational gestures, mothlike arm flapping and
period social dances like the waltz, tango and turkey trot. In the
end, the riotous scandal of ``Le Sacre,'' whose hotly anticipated
premiere followed two weeks later, overshadowed the more subtle and
sophisticated ``Jeux,'' which was later labeled Nijinsky's most
modest work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-seven years after the fact, how much credence should we
give a ballet reassembled from fragmentary evidence?
</P>
<P>
   Like other arts, choreography is exactingly detailed and
precise, but the methods of recording and reconstructing it remain
controversial and poorly understood. Critical assessments of the
Nijinsky restorations, typically focusing on the choreographic more
than the design aspects, often trip on these issues.
</P>
<P>
   This was certainly the case with the reviews in Britain, which,
unlike the more positive 1996 Verona notices, underplayed the
psychological incision and striking modernity of the revived
``Jeux'' in favor of superficial dismissals of its viability or
desirability. Some observers appreciate the Hodson-Archer
reconstructions as impressionistic interpretations, despite
questioning their authenticity; Judith Mackrell of The Guardian and
Jann Parry of The Observer were among those who applauded a
``Jeux'' that may be only partly genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't care if it wasn't 100 percent Nijinsky,''
said the Royal Ballet soloist and choreographer William Tuckett,
who set his own second ballet to Debussy's ``Jeux.'' ``This was not
a dryly intellectual or self-aggrandizing exercise. The
reconstructors were dedicated and meticulous in their research and
analysis but used feeling and intuition, too. They created
something genuine and valid in the spirit of the original. It was
completely fresh and stood absolutely in its own right, defying
historical categorization.''
</P>
<P>
   Using all available evidence _ in this case period photographs;
drawings by Leon Bakst, who designed the sets, and contemporary
artists; the Debussy piano score with Nijinsky's libretto notes;
accounts in the news media and memoirs, and conversations with
relatives and proteges of original participants _ the two ``ballet
archaeologists'' fix steps and positions to musical passages where
they can. To bridge gaps in the trail of evidence, Hodson uses the
logic of dance technique, her scholar's knowledge of the
choreographer's stylistic proclivities, exhaustive experimentation
and old-fashioned intuition.
</P>
<P>
   She carefully calls this process intervention as opposed to
invention, while stressing the need to breathe living stage appeal
into what might otherwise be museum pieces. The drawings she makes
(she is also a visual artist) to aid the reconstruction process
have been widely published and exhibited, most recently in May at
Gallery K in London. Hodson and Archer also assemble dossiers of
reading and visual materials to help the creative team _ for
``Jeux,'' the Royal Ballet principals Bruce Sansom and Deborah Bull
and the soloist Gillian Revie _ soak up the social and cultural
atmosphere of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Nijinsky's time is on display in the exhibition ``Nijinsky:
Legend and Modernist,'' which is intended to demythologize him and
clarify his career. It is a collaboration between the Dansmuseet in
Stockholm, where it was on view this spring, and the Musee d'Orsay
in Paris, where it will be shown from Oct. 23 to Feb. 18. Two
Nijinsky documentaries will have their premieres during the Paris
show.
</P>
<P>
   Nijinsky inspired more artistic interpretations than any other
dancer, and the exhibition showcases examples of these from public
and private collections, along with memorabilia and previously
unknown works. Also on display are many of Nijinsky's haunting,
circle-based drawings and paintings, made by the hundreds between
1916 and 1919 and resembling nonobjective Russian art of the same
period. The catalog essays, and the exhibition as a whole, argue
that Nijinsky's enigmatic diary and visual works, previously
dismissed as pathological, should be regarded as important
continuations of his modernist creativity once circumstances
separated him from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Neumeier, the artistic director of the Hamburg Ballet, has had a
longtime enchantment with Nijinsky. He began gathering the
memorabilia collection that forms the centerpiece of ``Nijinsky:
Legend and Modernist'' in 1975. A version of the exhibit opened at
Hamburg's Museum fur Kunst und Gewerbe on July 2, the same day the
Hamburg Ballet presented the premiere of Neumeier's ``Nijinsky.''
The homage begins with Nijinsky's last performance, set on a
meticulous re-creation of the actual recital hall, which was
recently torn out of the Suvretta Hotel in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
Characters from the dancer's life on and off the stage then
interact in a free-association of time, space and identity
comparable in form to his diary.
</P>
<P>
   Neumeier presents a Nijinsky gala every year, and the 25th was
given on July 16 with the Royal Ballet's ``Jeux'' cast as invited
performers. The Hamburg run of the Nijinsky exhibition ends
September 2.
</P>
<P>
   Two new plays and two forthcoming films signal that the
fascination with Nijinsky will not subside anytime soon. In
February, William Luce's ``Nijinsky,'' featuring leading Japanese
actors and the Tokyo Ballet principal Yasuyuki Shuto, had a
critically acclaimed, sold-out three-week run at the Parco Theater
in Tokyo, where it will return next year. An English translation
and European productions are planned for the play, which has
choreography by Gary Chryst.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-June at Arizona State University's Kerr Cultural Center
in Scottsdale, Kinga Nijinsky-Gaspers played her grandmother Romola
in Terry Earp's ``Madame Nijinsky _ Married to a God.'' Earp, the
wife of Wyatt Earp's great-grandnephew, based the one-woman play on
family recollections and Romola Nijinsky's books and letters. It
runs in Phoenix through Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   In film, the Australian director Paul Cox (``Vincent'') has in
production an abstract, 85-minute homage to Nijinsky featuring Sir
Derek Jacobi narrating pasages from the dancer's diary. The
American screenwriter Eva Burch's independent film, tentatively
titled ``Nijinsky's War,'' is scheduled to begin production next
year.
</P>
<P>
   For all the ferment, the direct record of Nijinsky's artistry
consists solely of black-and-white photographs, made with leading
photographers and aglow with an otherworldly quality. No film of
him performing is known to exist, but an intriguing concurrence of
anecdote, rumor and circumstance suggests that footage may someday
be found. Perhaps only then can Nijinsky's overpowering myth be
grounded in reality. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever since President Clinton appointed William
Cohen secretary of defense in 1996, Cohen, the only Republican in
the cabinet, has claimed to represent the bipartisanship needed to
manage matters of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Now he finds himself _ by all accounts reluctantly _ at the
center of a highly partisan debate over the state of the American
military. And it has left him in a highly unusual position:
defending the administration while at least indirectly underscoring
some of the Republican criticisms leveled against it.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cohen, who represented Maine in the Senate, launched
what amounted to a preemptive strike against criticisms by Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas that the Clinton administration was
responsible for a weakened, over-extended military.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen noted not only the budget increases approved by Clinton,
including the biggest pay increases for service members in a
generation, but also the fact, rarely mentioned by the Bush
campaign, that defense budgets started falling rapidly as the Cold
War ended _ when another Bush was president and the governor's
running mate, Dick Cheney, was secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts that followed, Cohen went on to say, reflected a strong
bipartisan demand for a ``peace dividend'' since the United States
no longer faced a threat from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``My constituents from Maine were demanding it, as were people
around the country,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign
Wars in Milwaukee on Monday, only hours before the governor, Cohen
offered a rebuttal _ of a sort _ to the criticisms that Bush has
repeated throughout his presidential campaign and accentuated since
the Republican convention three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Bush by name _ or for that matter Clinton or
Vice President Al Gore _ Cohen launched a lengthy, detailed defense
of the nation's armed services, arguing that they remained strong
and ready and had proved it during last year's war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Cohen left open the need for
improvement, suggesting that more work, and money, was needed to
meet the pressures on an ever busier military engaged in operations
from the Persian Gulf to the Balkans _ something Bush said he
intended to rethink, if elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can always do better,'' Cohen told the audience, ``and
national security is certainly a subject matter that is open to
debate and improvement. Hopefully that will be the case whatever
administration comes in next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the same audience Tuesday, Gore made that point
in a more overt, more partisan, more full-throated way. Gore went
so far as to say that Bush's repeated attacks on the state of the
military ``for political advantage'' threatened to undercut
American credibility in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not only wrong in fact _ it's the wrong message to send
to our allies and adversaries across the world,'' Gore said,
thrusting defense issues to center stage of the presidential
campaign for a second day.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's remarks, by contrast, have been more subtle _ and more
conflicted.
</P>
<P>
   While his remarks defending the armed services have sought to
counter some of Bush's criticisms, they have also highlighted
shortcomings in spending and readiness that have long been the
subject of complaints from Republicans in Congress and even some
uniformed leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As a Republican surrounded by Democrats, Cohen has always been
an oddity in Clinton's cabinet. He caused a minor stir when he told
Barbara Walters in April that he and his wife, Janet Langhart
Cohen, a Democrat, would ``in all probability'' vote for different
candidates. He later said, ``I indeed did not surrender my
Republican credentials when I agreed to serve in the
administration.'' Now he just declines to say whom he plans to vote
for.
</P>
<P>
   Long before he accepted Clinton's offer to be defense secretary,
Cohen had a reputation as an independent willing to cross party
lines to build consensus, particularly when it came to defense.
Aides in the Pentagon said he took seriously the president's
gesture of choosing a Republican, hoping to renew a bipartisan
spirit with his colleagues who control the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen himself once said in an interview that he had never sat
through a purely political meeting with Clinton and his advisers;
the discussions had always been on the substance of the issues. The
political discussions, presumably, began after he left the room.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's success as a bridge to the Republicans has been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Working with the Joint Chiefs of Staff two years ago, he
persuaded the administration to agree to a $112 billion increase in
defense spending over six years. He has also been the leading
administration advocate for building a limited national missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he has failed to win over Republicans in many
areas, like closing more military bases, and Republican criticisms
of Clinton's defense policies have only intensified in Cohen's
years as secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Cohen invited Bush to the Pentagon for a briefing on the
state of the nation's strategic nuclear arsenal after Bush pledged
to reduce the number of American nuclear warheads. The invitation
was curtly rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   However proud Cohen is of his accomplishments at the Pentagon,
he is clearly reluctant to weigh in on the political debate over
them now that the campaign is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   He winced when asked at a news conference at the Pentagon last
Friday to respond to Bush's criticism that morale in the ranks was
low. When reporters cornered him on Monday to ask about Bush's
remarks, he began by saying, ``Well, I want to keep my comments
strictly on the facts and the record and to stay out of the
politics as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House official insisted that no one had asked Cohen to
respond to Bush's criticisms, although Cohen's remarks clearly had
the criticisms in mind. ``When we think of somebody who can speak
for the vice president or the Democratic Party on military issues,
Bill Cohen is not the first name that pops in our head,'' one Gore
aide said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Gore's campaign aides sought a defense expert to
brief reporters on the issues the vice president raised Tuesday,
they had to reach back to Cohen's predecessor as secretary of
defense, William J. Perry.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was added to the list of Tuesday's VFW convention speakers
relatively late, defense officials said, and only because his wife
was receiving an award from the veterans. ``I am not here as a
Republican,'' Cohen himself said on Monday. ``I am not here on
behalf of the Democratic administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's posture reflects the fine line walked by men and women
in uniform, who are prohibited by law and by policy from
participating in overtly political events and thus carefully couch
any discussion of political points as strictly factual.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cohen's defense of the armed forces _ from noting the
increase in weapons procurement and to highlighting pay raises that
officials said have led to rising re-enlistment rates _ are seen by
some as an effective counter to Republican critiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't assail Cohen,'' one person in Gore's campaign said.
``He's a great surrogate for us. No one can accuse him of
politicizing the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   But that has a double-edge.
</P>
<P>
   When Cohen says that more can be done _ and spent _ it supports
arguments made by Bush's supporters. The same thing happened when
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton,
rebutted Bush's assertion during his presidential acceptance speech
in Philadelphia that two of the Army's 10 divisions were not ready
to fight a major war.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said that was not true, then pointed out that Clinton's
approval of a $112 billion budget increase fell far short of the
$148 billion the chiefs had said they needed.

PHONE STRIKE CONTINUES IN SIX EASTERN STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two days after more than 50,000 employees of Verizon
Communications ended a 15-day strike in New York and New England,
representatives for thousands of their colleagues continued to
haggle Tuesday with the company over details of a contract
proposal, prolonging the walkout in six Eastern states.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for Verizon employees in New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and Washington, D.C.,
discussed details _ like limits on mandatory overtime and the
definition of certain jobs _ with officials of the company, which
was formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons the strike has dragged on in this region
is the structure of the union. Most of the employees who returned
to work Monday are in the territory of the former Nynex, which Bell
Atlantic acquired in 1997, while the employees in the six-state
region stretching from New Jersey to Virginia are in Bell
Atlantic's original territory.
</P>
<P>
   In these states, customer service representatives have greater
representation in union locals, and one of the main concerns of
these employees heading into the strike was the large amount of
mandatory overtime. So while union negotiators from New York and
New England were pleased for the most part when Verizon agreed to
limit mandatory overtime to eight hours a week, negotiators in
these other states have pushed for an even lower amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're simply trying to arrive at the best possible
agreement,'' said Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the
Communications Workers of America, the union to which who have not
returned to work belong.
</P>
<P>
   About 14,000 members of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, the other union that was on strike, are mainly
in New England, while the bargaining unit for about 40,000
Communications Workers is rooted mainly in New York and New
England. The union put the number of remaining strikers at about
40,000, while Verizon said the number is closer to 35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the strike's protracted conclusion is the
priorities set by regional union leaders, like the definition of
cable splicers' jobs in Pennsylvania, which is where Vincent
Maisano, the lead negotiator for the remaining unit, is from.
Maisano has apparently made this issue and other details of the
proposed contract crucial, people close to the talks said. Maisano
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of support for Maisano and his fellow negotiators, the
union's national office in Washington asked union members in New
York to respect the picket lines formed by striking employees sent
there to put pressure on Verizon. But it appeared that most union
members in the region had returned to work as picket lines thinned
in New York, New Jersey and other states.
</P>
<P>
   As it tried to resolve the remaining issues in the strike,
Verizon, the nation's largest local and mobile telephone company,
also worked to complete orders for repairs and new service that
swelled during the strike. The company had about 73,000 outstanding
repairs and 200,000 orders for new service to fill as of Tuesday,
said Eric Rabe, Verizon's spokesman.

`YOUNGSTERS' REACH BROADWAY BEARING GIFTS: MUSICAL SCORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 27) 
 By BARRY SINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the 2000-01 musicals season has any unifying theme right now,
it is the youthful tilt among those songwriters _ experienced and
novice, alike _ who will soon be facing the music on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   David Yazbek, a composer and lyricist, is pushing 40. Among the
elders of Broadway's musical theater fraternity _ John Kander, 73;
Fred Ebb, 65; Cy Coleman, 71; Stephen Sondheim, 70 _ this makes him
a veritable teen-ager. Matthew Sklar and Chad Beguelin are even
younger, 26 and 30, respectively. Jeanine Tesori is 38 and Stephen
Flaherty is 39, pretty young, too, by Broadway standards, as are
Paul Gordon and Don Schlitz, who are in their 40s. Mel Brooks, of
course, is not.
</P>
<P>
   New work by every one of these younger creators, and Brooks,
will be on view over the next months, as at least seven musicals
with original scores make their way toward Broadway. Some are by
newcomers like Yazbek, a combination of indie rocker and former
Letterman gag writer, whose music and lyrics have helped transform
the popular film ``The Full Monty'' into a widely anticipated show
scheduled to open in October.
</P>
<P>
   Another eagerly awaited musical is by the Broadway veterans
Flaherty, the composer, and Lynn Ahrens, the lyricist, who are
following up their 1998 Tony Award for ``Ragtime'' with ``The
Seussical.'' Based on the Dr. Seuss books, it will have an
out-of-town tryout in Boston, before coming to Broadway in October.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the ever-youthful 74-year-old Brooks, who has
reworked his classic cinematic paean to bad taste and Broadway
musicals, ``The Producers,'' into a fully scored stage show, with
words and music (``Springtime for Hitler'' included) by none other
than himself. ``The Producers,'' its producers hope, will reach
Broadway in the spring, appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of younger musical theater writers this season,
however, is another signal that a new generation is reaching
Broadway. Two seasons ago, Jason Robert Brown's ``Parade'' was seen
at Lincoln Center, while last season it was the turn of Michael
John LaChiusa's ``Marie Christine.'' LaChiusa's second Broadway
musical last season was ``The Wild Party.'' Brown is 30 and
LaChiusa is 38.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are just wising up to the fact that they're
going to run out of revivals,'' said Ira Weitzman, a longtime
champion of new musical theater talent who helped bring in ``Marie
Christine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers are finally realizing that musicals don't just get
born somewhere where you can go shop for them,'' Weitzman said.
``And the coterie of new writers has become larger and more varied
in the kind of work they are doing. The more experimental composers
are still around but there is also a groundswell of young people
writing in a more pop vernacular. Despite the odds, a new
generation has come into existence on their own; a sub-community of
Broadway. There really is a healthy mixture of established and
emerging artists getting shots this season, an intermingling of
them. No one is even emerging anymore, everybody seems to have
emerged. There's just a lot more receptivity.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be reassuring to think that the modest increase in
American musicals with original scores expected on Broadway this
season (seven versus five last season and three the season before)
is in some way related to the imminent departures of ``Cats''
(Sept. 10) and ``Saigon'' (Dec. 31), those seemingly immovable
monuments to British musical theater know-how. But that is not
apparently so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it is the close of a chapter,'' Weitzman said. ``I
don't think it's cause and effect though. Yet something definitely
is being freed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schneider, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, had his
own interpretation: ``The most important thing when developing new
work is knowing you've got the right theater to take your work
into. We waited three years with `Lion King,' looking for just the
right venue, before the New Amsterdam finally made that show
possible. So, yes, you might say that the liberation of the
Broadway and Winter Garden theaters by ``Saigon'' and ``Cats''
could trickle down to encourage new work. But I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two songwriters who may not have to wait for a theater are
Beguelin and Sklar, neither of whom are neophytes, despite their
youth: Beguelin is a playwright and a lyricist-librettist whose
work has been produced Off Broadway; Sklar has been a conductor for
``Titanic,'' ``Saigon'' and ``Les Miserables.'' Their new musical,
``The Rhythm Club,'' which has a target opening date in February,
celebrates the doomed world of young swing music lovers in Nazi
Germany. The show recreates the sounds of the 1930s with a
contemporary spin.
</P>
<P>
   Tesori, a Tony nominee for her recent scoring of Shakespeare's
``Twelfth Night'' at Lincoln Center, has contributed six new songs
to ``Thoroughly Modern Millie,'' an adaptation of the 1960s flapper
film that its producers hope to bring to Broadway in the spring.
The show opens first at the La Jolla Playhouse in California on
Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz and Gordon are accomplished pop songwriters, who are
both making their Broadway debuts (both also declined to give their
exact ages). A Grammy Award winner for country-western crossover
hits (including Kenny Rogers' single ``The Gambler''), Schlitz has
written the music and lyrics for Mark Twain's ``Tom Sawyer,'' a
show expected to open on Broadway in April.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who has created songs for Bette Midler and Amy Grant,
among others, is the composer and lyricist for ``Jane Eyre,'' a
musical version of the classic Charlotte Bronte novel. Scheduled to
open on Broadway in December, the show had its world premiere in
Toronto in 1996 and its American premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse
last year. With its Gothic pop-operetta score, and a set by John
Napier, the designer of ``Cats'' and ``Sunset Boulevard,'' it
evinces vestiges of the British mega-model a la Andrew Lloyd
Webber.
</P>
<P>
   For Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization and
theatrical chain, nothing could be more sensible. ``I would love to
have seen `Cats' go on forever,'' said the longtime landlord of
``Cats'' and ``Saigon'' (and a ``Cats'' co-producer). ``Cats,''
Schoenfeld emphasized, ``was one of the saviors of the American
musical theater _ it produced a golden age.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, however, the same golden age that has inspired Mel Brooks
to go to Broadway. `` `The Producers' is my love letter to the
Broadway I loved that no longer really exists,'' Brooks said
earlier this month by telephone from London. ``From `High Button
Shoes' to `Guys and Dolls' and `A Funny Thing Happened on the Way
to the Forum.' Musical comedy. There hasn't been a down and dirty
musical comedy in forever. Nobody even uses the words anymore. I
lived for that. It's in my blood. I can't wait to go out of town
and find out what stinks and fix it up. I have too much respect for
Broadway to fool around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodgers and Hart and the Gershwins and Cole himself and Irving
himself,'' Brooks continued, referring to Cole Porter and Irving
Berlin. ``We're all old composers at heart. To write for Broadway
you have to be. It's just that some of us are older than others.
And the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   And Andrew Lloyd Webber?
</P>
<P>
   ``And Andrew Lloyd Webber,'' Brooks replied. ``Who doesn't write
many funny songs.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Other projects with interesting pedigrees are in the works,
though their chances of reaching Broadway this season are
uncertain. The new Kander and Ebb musical, based on the play ``The
Visit'' by Friedrich Durrenmatt, was to star Angela Lansbury. When
Lansbury withdrew because of the illness of her husband, the
producers began to search for a substitute. ``We are holding onto
our theater, the Broadway, for April,'' said the lead producer,
Barry Brown. ``But you don't just replace Angela Lansbury
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Another anticipated musical is the adaptation of the John Waters
cult film classic ``Hairspray,'' with music by Marc Shaiman, the
talented composer behind the recent hit movie version of the
animated television series ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Transforming movies into musicals has become something of a fad
on Broadway lately _ from ``The Full Monty,'' ``Thoroughly Modern
Millie'' and ``The Producers,'' which involve largely original new
scores _ to ``Saturday Night Fever'' and ``The Lion King,'' which
mainly reimagine existing soundtracks, as well as the now departed
``Footloose.''
</P>
<P>
   Musicals seem to be on the movie industry's mind, too. At least
three new Hollywood films this year are so billed: Lars von Trier's
``Dancer in the Dark,'' a winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes; ``O
Brother, Where Art Thou?'' by the Coen Brothers, and Baz Luhrmann's
``Moulin Rouge.''
</P>
<P>
   On closer inspection, none of these films really qualify as
original movie musicals in the classic MGM sense. ``O Brother,
Where Art Thou?'' is a retelling of Homer's ``Odyssey,'' set in the
Depression South with music of the era. ``Dancer in the Dark'' uses
numbers from ``The Sound of Music'' in what is otherwise a
nonmusical film.
</P>
<P>
   Luhrmann's ``Moulin Rouge'' is a bit different. In retelling the
story of Toulouse-Lautrec's bohemian life in Paris at the end of
the 19th century, Lurhmann draws on music from the 20th-century _
beginning with the can-can, but ranging through the Beatles and
Madonna. Much of it is sung by his stars, Nicole Kidman (who
reportedly is not dubbed), John Leguizamo and Ewan McGregor, among
others. Some of the movie's score is performed on the soundtrack by
contemporary musicians like Moby, Beck, U2, Massive Attack and
Fatboy Slim.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance _ the movie is scheduled to open in December _
the project looks like a step toward truly injecting today's pop
music into the American musical form. So far, though, only animated
features have engaged songwriters like Ahrens and Flaherty
(``Anastasia'') and Alan Menken (``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``The
Little Mermaid'') to create full scores entirely from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit standard bearers of musical theater continue to
develop new works very much from scratch. At Lincoln Center
Theater, workshops of two new musicals will soon be held: one with
a score by Harry Connick Jr. entitled ``Thou Shalt Not'' and based
on the Emile Zola novel ``Therese Raquin,'' directed and
choreographed by Susan Stroman (``Contact''); the other (as yet, at
least officially, untitled), composed by the ubiquitous Ahrens and
Flaherty, with a book by the equally ubiquitous Terrence McNally
(the librettist for ``The Full Monty'' and ``The Visit'').
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lincoln Center Theater has commissioned a new work
from Brown, who won a Tony Award for ``Parade.'' The show, ``The
Last Five Years,'' will be seen in the spring at the North Light
Theater in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Drama Dept. will present its first original
musical, ``The Big Time,'' a musical comedy about terrorism and
show business by Douglas J. Cohen (music and lyrics) and Douglas
Carter Beane (book), originally written by Beane as a screenplay
for the director Oliver Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Another new musical in June will be ``Once Around the City'' at
Second Stage by the brothers Reale, Robert (music) and Willie
(lyrics).
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Theater Club, which last season was frustrated by
mixed reviews in its desire to transfer its own ``Wild Party'' to
Broadway, will be producing three new musicals: ``A Class Act,''
built around existing show music by the late Edward Kleban, the
lyricist for ``A Chorus Line''; ``The New Yorkers,'' the working
title for a revue by two promising young talents, Stephen Weiner, a
composer, and Glenn Slater, a lyricist; and ``Time and Again'' a
chamber version of the musical based on the Jack Finney novel of
the same name that was first presented in 1995 at the Old Globe
Theater in San Diego. The score is by Walter (Skip) Kennon.
</P>
<P>
   The Joseph Papp Public Theater, which had its own problems with
the mixed reception of LaChiusa's Broadway version of ``The Wild
Party,'' has several musical projects in the works. These include
``Radiant Baby,'' with music by Debra Barsha, about the artist
Keith Haring, and ``Caroline or Change,'' a show with music by
Tesori and book and lyrics by Tony Kushner, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning author of ``Angels in America.'' Neither project is
expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal belief is that we are not going to be seeing
serious adult musicals on Broadway anymore, except as an
aberration,'' said Wiley Hausam, the associate producer for musical
theater development at the Public Theater. ``Broadway already is a
Disney family theme park. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if
Disney made an offer for all the Shubert and Nederlander theaters
one day. Audiences have become so much less sophisticated that I
worry for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical theater historian and author Ethan Mordden is more
blunt. ``Writing smart shows is no good with stupid audiences and
stupid critics,'' Mordden said. ``Lately, the shows Off Broadway
have been too smart and people are too dumb. The music is too
sophisticated. These are lazy people who just can't get a handle on
music in the theater because they don't want to work hard; they
don't know how to work hard, intellectually. Most are actually not
happy to be in a theater anyway. They've been told they should go,
so they do and then they find they have to think. `Think? You mean
I paid all that money and I have to think?'''
</P>
<P>
   For years, one of Broadway's greatest attractions was its flair
for presenting sophistication without pretension. To Yazbek of
``The Full Monty,'' that historic blend is the point. ``Don't be
too earnest,'' the 30-something Yazbek said, in defining his own
aesthetic ( Yazbek also refuses to give his exact age). ``Don't be
too `Oh, it's a musical, I have to express myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   The style apparently fit his future producers' vision for ``The
Full Monty,'' which had an earlier run at the Old Globe in June.
``I was desperate to avoid the kind of anthem-laden musicals that
are everywhere,'' said Lindsay Law, president of Fox Searchlight
Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Law was a producer of the film version of ``The Full Monty.''
After receiving what he called a surprisingly large number of
offers for the rights to make a musical of the film, Law decided
his company should produce the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked the composer Adam Guettel first and he passed,'' Law
said. ``Adam then proposed this guy he had once played with in a
garage band'' _ Yazbek.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who burn to do this,'' Yazbek said. ``People
who define themselves by the success or failure of their musicals,
as though they are baseball players or something. I don't know,
I've always just wanted to make music and put it out there. There's
definitely pop in my music, there's definitely jazz, and rock 'n'
roll, too. But the producers heard musical theater. And for that,
I'm glad.''
</P>
<P>
   The results, while far from certain, appear promising. As does
the hiring of Yazbek and his contemporaries. For now, a measure of
youthful unpredictability is quietly infiltrating Broadway.

Chancellor master at button pushing
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Here come Van Chancellor's Comets, poor souls. They
don't stand a chance. Give the WNBA trophy to the New York Liberty
right now. Start engraving the names of the new champions. Gather
up confetti and ticker tape and get ready for the parade.
</P>
<P>
   It's all over but the crying. But of course, these are all
crocodile tears we're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets are neither underdogs nor overrated on the way to
their fourth crown, but why let details get in the way of a good
sound bite and a bit of motivation? This is a three-time
championship team that looks more than capable of winning a fourth,
even with a couple of ring fingers tied behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Having swiftly dispatched the one team that seemed capable of
beating them _ the Los Angeles Sparks _ to win the conference
title, the Comets are playing their best basketball at the best
time. Superb efforts from point guard Janeth Arcain and inside
force Tammy Jackson have come at the right time. The Big Three _
Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia Cooper and Tina Thompson _ have been huge.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it won't be a walk in the park against the Liberty
when the Comets open the WNBA Finals on Thursday night, because it
never is when a title is on the line. But neither will it be the
doomed midnight walk through Central Park _ thugs and muggers at
every turn _ that Chancellor makes it out to be.
</P>
<P>
   But such has been Chancellor's way throughout the 2000 season,
sometimes even with good reason. The Comets had to begin the year
with a new point guard and a new center _ only the two most
important players on the floor for most teams. It was the perfect
opportunity for others to dismiss their chances and for Chancellor
to find a rallying cry: We're the underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks were considered champions in waiting. The Sacramento
Monarchs were considered huge threats to the Comets' reign.
</P>
<P>
   It's just what Chancellor wanted, much like this series against
the Liberty, which the Comets have defeated two times for the title
but against whom they've lost once this season.
</P>
<P>
   No opponent serves as better material for Chancellor to hem, haw
and poor-us his way to the crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, (the Liberty) have a big advantage over us,''
he said Tuesday. ``They think they can beat us. We've kept them
from getting the rings, and they know that. It's going to be
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, whatever works.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because Chancellor spent 19 years trying to win
Southeastern Conference championships at Mississippi while in the
same league as the dominant Tennessee Lady Vols. He's had practice
playing the role of underdog, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   But knowing what to say and when to say it has proved to be
Chancellor's greatest talent as a coach. Without Chancellor's
confidence-building and stroking, would Cynthia Cooper have become
the league's Most Valuable Player in 1997 and 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Rave all you want about Cooper's great talent, which is
undeniable. But when Coop began playing the game under Chancellor,
she was not destined for the Basketball Hall of Fame. Now, she is.
</P>
<P>
   And without Chancellor's handling of tragedy and heartbreak a
year ago, would the Comets have won the WNBA championship in the
wake of Kim Perrot's succumbing to cancer?
</P>
<P>
   He realizes when to be fiery, when to be compassionate, and when
calm waters need to be boiled into motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Through much of this season when the scepter of team leader was
being passed from Cooper to Swoopes, Chancellor handled the
transition and all the tensions that went with it directly and
honestly. Cooper and Swoopes' feelings for one another, or lack
thereof, could have dismantled hopes. But the drawling amateur
psychologist kept it all together.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Comets are getting along as well as ever, the
challenge has been finding a fire that could sweep Chancellor's
team through the playoffs yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Done. He spent much of Tuesday's post-practice media session
outlining all the things stacked against the Comets in this title
series, but he was talking as much to his players as reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The long trip by commercial airline: ``Man, that's just tough on
you. It takes seven hours to get there by the time you're through
traveling. It's exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   The first game being on the road: ``It makes (the Liberty) a
whole lot better. There's 15,000 people, 19,000 people it gets
their adrenaline flowing. I'm telling you, they're going to think
they're just a better team than us.''
</P>
<P>
   The officiating: ``(New York's) rebounding is what worries me
most. In a series like this, the longer you play, the less they
call.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Chancellor talk, you would think the Comets have to come
up with some kind of spectacular effort if they're going to again
wear the rings. But don't worry; they should. He always seems to
know which buttons to push.

FRANCE AND RUSSIA CHALLENGING KUWAITI OIL COMPANY'S REQUEST FOR
REPARATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A dispute pitting the United States against
Russia and France over Iraqi reparations to a Kuwaiti oil company
has for the first time stymied the work of a U.N. compensation
commission set up after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a claim of $21.6 billion submitted by the Kuwait
Petroleum Corp. for lost oil and gas sales resulting from Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, during which oil wells were destroyed
or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation commission, based in Geneva, proposed in June
that the Kuwait company be awarded $15.9 billion. Russia and France
objected, and no award was made.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say the United States is lobbying to line up support
for Kuwait before a vote on the issue, which may be held at the
commission's next meeting, late next month.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, all decisions by the commission have made been by
consensus on the advice of experts. The 15-member panel, made up of
representatives from Security Council countries, is expected to
award claims as income from Iraqi oil sales becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement adds another irritant to an already frayed
Security Council consensus on how to deal with the government of
President Saddam Hussein as economic sanctions imposed on Iraq
after its invasion of Kuwait a decade ago drag on.
</P>
<P>
   As a critical moment approaches in the efforts of the United
Nations to return arms inspectors to Iraq _ a key to lifting the
embargo _ the new dispute over war reparations reopens another
divisive debate in a second important area, the oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
   The program is an exception to the embargo under which Iraq is
permitted to sell oil to pay for the imports of essential civilian
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, now earning billions in oil sales thanks to the lifting
of all restrictions on oil exports last year just as prices were
rising, has always objected to the requirement that a third of his
oil income should go to compensate the many victims of his invasion
and occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the oil sales is also set aside for the Kurdish
regions of northern Iraq and to help pay for the arms inspection
program.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis rejected the oil sales program entirely until 1995,
because of the controls on how Iraq could spend the money. In the
first few years of the program, with oil prices low and limits on
how much oil Iraq could sell, the issue merely simmered. Iraq
continued to demand that sanctions be lifted to relieve the
hardships of people living under the embargo, but was never able to
challenge the reparations plan successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sums being set aside for compensation are rising into
the tens of billions of dollars and Iraq _ with the backing of
Russia and France, both of which are owed money by Iraq and hope
for more business in the future _ has become more active in
opposing the reparation payments.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Iraq compensation commission has paid more
than $8 billion in claims, mostly to individuals and small
businesses or other institutions hurt by the Iraqi invasion.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission has now begun to process claims from
petroleum companies, and the amounts being sought are significant.
Last year the Kuwait Oil Co. and the Kuwait Petroleum Corp. were
jointly awarded $2.3 billion for the loss of equipment and other
measurable assets.
</P>
<P>
   This year's much larger Kuwaiti request for the loss of less
tangible things, like thwarted sales, ran into objections from
France, which requested a delay to have its own experts review the
claim.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and diplomats said that the Russian objection was
more political, and that it raised the larger issue of the future
of the claims process.
</P>
<P>
   According to unofficial notes from the June meeting, provided by
panel officials, the Russians said it would be unacceptable to give
that much money to the Kuwaiti oil industry, whether or not the
claim was sound, while Iraqis were suffering from a trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians then said that they would like a review of the
level of Iraq's contribution to the compensation fund from its oil
revenues. The money now goes into an escrow account in Paris
managed by the United Nations, and any change in its allocation
would have to be made by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said they expected Russia to raise the issue next
month, when all aspects of policy toward Iraq will be open for
debate.

GEORGIA EXECUTION IN STAYED IN CASE OF YOUTHFUL OFFENDER 
</HEADLINE>
  By   RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Georgia Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the execution of
Alexander Williams, who was scheduled to be put to death in the
electric chair on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been on death row since 1986, when he was convicted
of the rape and murder of 16-year-old Aleta Bunch, whom he had
abducted while she was shopping at a mall in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was 17 when he committed the crime, and recently
several national and international groups, including the European
Union, have called on Georgia officials to spare Williams' life
because of his age at the time of the crime. Williams is also
mentally ill and takes antipsychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ecstatic, of course, but in a sense this stay is just
the beginning of the battle,'' said Mark Olive, Williams' appellate
lawyer. ``Now we have to convince the court to grant relief, not
just a reprieve.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim's mother, Carolyn Bunch, expressed distress at the
court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just torturing me longer,'' she said in a telephone
interview. ``I want to see an end to it. I want to see him put to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   The court gave no reasons for granting the stay, which is for an
indefinite period, until it has ruled on the merits of the claims
made by Williams' lawyer in an appeal filed a few hours before the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   There has not been an execution in Georgia since 1998, and the
Georgia Supreme Court has under consideration the question of
whether the use of the electric chair is cruel and unusual
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In their appeal, lawyers for Williams make two arguments that
will have a bearing on the cases of the 80 youthful offenders who
are on death row in 16 states. (Texas has the most, with 26,
followed by Alabama with 14.) One is that the execution of an
individual who was under 18 at the time of the crime is cruel and
unusual punishment; the second is that executing youthful offenders
is a violation of an international human rights treaty that the
United States has signed.
</P>
<P>
   To win on this first point the lawyers will try to show that a
consensus has developed against the execution of youthful
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Florida Supreme Court held that executing an
individual who was under 17 at the time of the crime violated the
cruel or unusual punishment clause of that state's constitution.
The court noted that a youthful offender had not been executed in
Florida in a quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
   In urging the Georgia Supreme Court to reach a similar
conclusion, Williams' lawyers argued that it is ``unusual''
punishment in Georgia because since 1983, just three juveniles have
been sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Supreme Court, in ruling in 1989 that
executing 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds did not violate the cruel
and unusual proscription of the Eighth Amendment, said that a
national consensus against such executions had not developed. At
the time, the court noted, of the 37 states that permitted capital
punishment, just 12 prohibited imposing it on individuals who were
under 18 when they committed the crime. Four more states have done
so since the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to international law, lawyers for Williams argued that
states are bound by the International Convention on Civil and
Political Rights, which bans the execution of anyone who was under
the age of 18 at the time of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Senate voted to ratify this treaty in 1992,
but it did so with a reservation: the United States retains the
right to impose capital punishment on anyone, except a pregnant
woman, including specifically a person who was under 18 at the time
of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' lawyers argue that this reservation is invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, these arguments reached the Supreme Court in the case
of a young Nevada man, Michael Domingues, who was 16 years old when
he committed a double murder. The Clinton administration, in a
friend of the court brief, argued that the United States was not
bound by the treaty, but the Supreme Court did not take up the
case.

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas aggressively defended
his sweeping tax-cut proposal Tuesday, saying it was both
responsible and easily affordable in light of federal surplus
projections. Bush produced an assortment of figures to show that
the plan would not require cuts in government spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to do a better job of making it clear,'' Bush told
reporters in a surprising admission aboard his campaign plane. The
remark came just one day after Vice President Al Gore, suddenly
resurgent in the polls, held an extensive discussion of his own
suggested tax cuts, which are less than half the size of the ones
proposed by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointed to projections by the Congressional Budget Office
that the federal government would run a surplus of about $4.6
trillion over the next 10 years, a figure that includes the Social
Security surplus. He said voters needed to know that the projection
represented money left over even after an expected growth in
government spending of about $3.3 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that after setting aside the Social Security
surplus to shore up that program for the future, he would have
roughly $2.3 trillion for tax cuts, new spending and debt
reduction. Bush's proposed tax cut would cost $1.3 trillion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as voters understand that, he said, ``People will buy
into the tax-relief package even more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not changing my opinion on it,'' he added, a defiant
declaration that, like the rest of his comments to reporters about
the surplus and tax cuts, was largely unprompted. ``It's the
absolute right thing to do for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's uncharacteristic decision to revisit calculations that
his campaign had previously outlined seemed to be an
acknowledgement of a potentially troubling political reality for
him. Many polls show that American voters by and large are not
hankering for an enormous tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore, who has proposed only about $500 billion in tax cuts
over the next decade, has been hammering Bush on the issue,
repeatedly claiming that Bush's plan unnecessarily coddles wealthy
Americans at the expense of fiscal prudence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said on Monday that Bush's tax cut would plunge the country
into deficits, and Tuesday, in a speech to veterans in Milwaukee,
the vice president added that it would ``wreck our good economy and
make it impossible to modernize our armed forces and keep them
ready for battle.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The burden on Bush to convince voters that his tax cut is
affordable was clear not only in his own remarks today but also in
those of Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., who fielded questions from
several reporters after a Bush rally in Peoria, Ill. LaHood had
introduced Bush at the event, a campaign stop that the governor
made on his way from Des Moines, Iowa, to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood said that while ``there's some appetite'' among voters
for Bush's suggested tax cuts, ``I think he should also be talking
about, `I want to be able to pay down the debt, too.' I think that
is problematic for people.''
</P>
<P>
   When LaHood was asked if Bush's proposed tax cut was too large,
both politically and practically, he said merely that it was ``an
ambitious proposal'' and that ``Congress will have some say about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's very ambitious, there's no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the 14-month course of his campaign, Bush has said
repeatedly that he is committed to paying down the federal debt,
but more often, when he talks about tax cuts, he simply tells
people that he wants to return their hard-earned dollars to them.
It is a pledge that predictably draws roars of approval from his
Republican base.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the numbers that Bush and his aides used today for
surplus and growth projections had been rounded off, they were
essentially valid, in line with estimates from the Congressional
Budget Office, and some economists and political analysts consider
Bush's tax cut to be reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   But others note, among other criticisms of his plan, that if he
succeeded in enacting the tax cut, it would be extremely difficult
to take it back and raise taxes in the event that the projected
surpluses did not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his advisers, for their part, say that Gore is the
candidate who is potentially endangering the economy by outlining
significantly more new spending than Bush has.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, they cited a report released recently by the National
Taxpayers Union, a conservative group, that estimated that Gore's
spending programs over the next 10 years would exceed the surplus,
at least if Gore did not touch the portion of that surplus
generated by Social Security taxes, as both he and Bush have
promised.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign's concern about charges that the
governor's tax cut is too large was evident both today and on
Monday in the aggressiveness of their responses to criticism by
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for the Bush
campaign, said that Gore had gone ``completely overboard'' and
grossly distorted the substance and effect of Bush's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes added that the vice president was ``trying to muddy the
waters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want the American people to know how much money's
available,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that while Bush was calling for tax cuts for
Americans at every income level, Gore's plan, targeted more
specifically at less affluent Americans, would leave 50 percent of
taxpayers, totaling 50 million people, without any tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would reduce federal tax rates across the income
spectrum, lowering the highest rate to 33 percent from 39.6 percent
and the lowest rate to 10 percent from 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth between the Bush and Gore campaigns about tax
cuts, spending and fiscal responsibility reflected a larger aim:
each candidate wants to be seen as the better, more prudent steward
of the economy, an issue forever at the top of many voters'
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers have long reveled in how well Bush did in polls
that asked voters which candidate they trusted more on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the recent surveys that showed Gore getting an
enormous _ and possibly temporary _ bounce out of the Democratic
National Convention also indicated that voters had at least
temporarily reassessed his ability to manage the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released on Sunday, 50 percent of
adults surveyed said that Gore would better handle the economy,
while 40 percent said Bush would. Before either party's convention,
a poll by the same organizations showed Bush with a 47 percent to
40 percent lead on the issue. The margin of sampling error was four
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of which candidate would better handle the
federal surplus, Gore led Bush by 48 percent to 41 percent in the
recent poll. In the one before the conventions, Gore trailed Bush,
38 percent to 49 percent.

A REPRIEVE OF SORTS FOR LAST 7 OF MIAMI'S FAMOUS STILTSVILLE
HOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ On a clear, hot day, with the sunlight
glittering off the water, the houses of Stiltsville seem to float
on a liquid horizon. A cluster of seven ramshackle houses built on
weathered pilings, the structures dot the shallow waters of
Biscayne Bay like shipwrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Cursed by environmental advocates, praised by others as a symbol
of a dying, free-spirited way of life, they have endured 70 years
of mildew, rot and hurricanes, and assaults by federal parks
officials who want them torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the beginning of the end of Stiltsville, just inside
Biscayne National Park, seems finally here.
</P>
<P>
   The occupants of the weather-beaten wooden structures, weekend
renters who use them mostly for parties and getaways, are being
evicted, federal parks officials said. The renters, some who have
been coming to the old houses for decades, have until Dec. 1 to
move out.
</P>
<P>
   The structures themselves will not be torn down but will be
opened to the public, perhaps as environmental education
facilities. But it is only a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   The houses would not be rebuilt if substantially damaged by
weather, said Linda Canzanelli, superintendent of Biscayne National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   That, say the people who want to keep them in the bay, means it
is only a matter of time until a storm wipes them from the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels awful,'' said Gail Baldwin, an architect who has had
a house in Stiltsville since the early 1970s. ``I feel sad for me
and very sad for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The houses are woven into the skyline and lore of Miami, a
romantic symbol of the region's waterfront culture _ and its
weirdness _ since the 1930s, when Eddie Walker, a local fisherman,
turned a barge grounded in the shallows into a one-story home.
</P>
<P>
   Other houses followed, and the community became a getaway for
the affluent. It has appeared in television shows including the
``Miami Vice'' series of the 1980s. Carl Hiaasen, a novelist and
columnist at The Miami Herald, used the house as a backdrop for one
of his popular novels, ``Skin Tight.'' In that book, the hero stabs
a man to death with the bill of a fish he had mounted on the wall
of his Stiltsville house.
</P>
<P>
   Once, there were as many as 25 houses, but fires (all the houses
were wood) and storms whittled their number to the remaining seven.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials have long regarded the houses as a nuisance. When
the section of Biscayne Bay containing Stiltsville became a
national park in 1968, homeowners signed long-term leases, some of
which have changed hands many times.
</P>
<P>
   Canzanelli said the decision to remove the renters but not the
houses was a compromise in the dispute between park officials and
the renters, who wanted the houses left alone.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a case of the federal government running longtime
homeowners who have nowhere else to go off the water but an
eviction of people who use the structures to tie up their boats,
watch the sunsets and lie under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Their use of the houses contributes to the fouling of the
shallow water, and endangers a fragile ecosystem coral and
seagrass, environmentalists have argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their lease is up,'' Canzanelli said. ``They don't own the
structures and they never owned the structures. There was always an
intention that, at the end of this lease, these structures would be
removed. We've gone an extra step to keep them for public use.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who lease the houses say it is just a ploy to prevent them
from keeping up the structures, which require regular maintenance,
and one that dooms the houses to destruction after the first strong
wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they eventually see the National Park without
Stiltsville,'' said Baldwin. ``My feeling is the whole thing is a
ruse to put the houses on hold, and get us out of there, They're
just going to let them deteriorate to the point that they're
unsafe, and then they'll have to tear them down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Canzanelli said the park service must maintain the houses to
keep them safe for visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have made the offer if there wasn't serious
interest in protecting the structures for public use,'' she said.

 &HT;    Ailing drkoop.com gets $20 million cash infusion
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN - Ailing Internet company drkoop.com Inc. has negotiated
a $20 million cash infusion from venture capitalists that will keep
it alive for perhaps another year but comes at a steep price.
</P>
<P>
   The investors have replaced the founders with a new management
team, will control the board of directors and could eventually hold
nearly three-fourths of the stock. They inherit a battered health
information site that last week attracted 680,000 visitors but
whose name is now associated with the this year's tech stock swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who gave his name
to the company but never took an active management role, will
remain chairman of the board. Founder Donald Hackett, who owns 20
percent of the stock, stays on the board but is out as chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The new team will be headed by venture capitalist Richard
Rosenblatt, 31, who becomes CEO and a board member. The new
investors will be able to appoint up to four new directors.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt's firm, Prime Ventures of Santa Monica, Calif.,
invested $3.5 million in drkoop.com, with the balance coming from
other firms, including J.F. Shea Ventures, Cramer-Rosenthal-McGlynn
Inc. and RMC Capital. Drkoop.com said the investment could rise to
$27.5 million if all options are exercised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Koop and I are extremely pleased to have recruited in
top-notch Internet talent to lead the company in its next phase,''
Hackett said Tuesday. ``We're just real happy that the expenses
have been reduced substantially and the cash infusion really will
provide a significant momentum for the business to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other Prime Ventures executives are also taking top
positions: Edward Cespedes, 34, president, and Stephen Plutsky, 31,
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hackett nor Prime Ventures would comment on the
company's direction. The company didn't say what will happen to
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million should solve drkoop.com's most pressing need,
though. On Monday, the company said it had run through the cash it
had left at the end of June and had tapped a line of credit for
$400,000 more last week.
</P>
<P>
   The company is spending between $1.5 million and $2 million a
month, meaning the new investment could last between 10 and 13
months.
</P>
<P>
   But significant challenges remain, including reviving a stock
that has flat-lined around $1 a share, defending against a raft of
shareholder lawsuits and an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and redirecting its strategy to reflect the new demands
of the stock market. Simply put, investors have put Internet
companies that rely on advertising on the critical list.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a new corporate strategy,'' said Eric Brown, an
e-health analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``To
just to take the same goal of (providing) health content to
consumers online . . . isn't going to work any better this time
than it worked the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the company should look for opportunities to merge
its health content with other Internet health care ventures, such
as new sites that allow consumers to shop for health plans and
health care a la carte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this happened early enough that people aren't
completely distrustful of the content,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock market has been unfriendly to e-health companies
recently. Shares in Healtheon/WebMD Corp., the biggest and
best-funded Internet health venture, are trading at a fraction of
their 52-week high and the company has begun layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Any new strategy could also involve cutting expenses. Last week,
Austin's mall.com Inc. received an infusion from a new venture fund
dedicated to rescuing troubled Internet companies, and immediately
cut half of its staff.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt started Prime Ventures after selling iMall, an
e-commerce services business, to Excite(at)Home for stock worth
$565 million.
</P>
<P>
   In just 10 months, Prime Ventures has invested in about 15
companies.One company in its portfolio, Boise, Idaho-based
sweepstakes site webMillion.com Inc., was sold in July for $20
million after less than a year in business.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Adcock, one of webMillion's founders, said Rosenblatt's
direction made the difference in landing the buyer, online
advertising firm L90 Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the breakthrough there,'' Adcock said. ``He really has
the ability to see value in things and really make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The new investors are well-protected if they can't make it
happen. In addition to getting control of one of the best-known
names on the Web, they will receive a hefty amount of preferred
stock that can't be traded now but which they ultimately will be
able to convert into about 57.1 million shares of common stock at
35 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The investors, drkoop.com's placement agent and merchant bank,
Commonwealth Associates, and the new management team will also
receive warrants to buy up to 40.7 million more shares at 35 cents.
</P>
<P>
   If all of those purchases take place, current shareholders _ who
hold about 34 million shares _ would see their investments
significantly diluted.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, other prominent dot-coms that have flirted with
bankruptcy have negotiated better rescues. Online grocer Peapod
Inc. received a $73 million bailout from Royal Ahold in June and
Bertelsmann agreed to buy online music retailer CD Now Inc. for
$117 million in July.
</P>
<P>
   But as the summer has dragged on, drkoop.com has looked more and
more distressed. Most of the top executives have left, quarterly
results have fallen way short of expectations, and the company has
faced legal and regulatory problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pretty much over a barrel,'' said Mark Mulcahay, an
analyst who follows drkoop.com for Pacific Growth Equities in San
Francisco. ``I don't think they were negotiating from a position of
strength.''

INTEREST RATES TO REMAIN STEADY, FEDERAL RESERVE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for rewriting thruout; story is now 600 words longer, moves
in 2 takes and is a reefer on Page 1)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reassured by evidence that wage and price increases
remain under control despite robust economic growth, the Federal
Reserve voted Tuesday to leave interest rates unchanged, but warned
that it might raise them later in the year if inflation creeps up.
</P>
<P>
   The decision displayed the Fed's confidence that the economy is
gradually moving onto a path of slightly more modest, though more
sustainable growth, but suggested that the central bank was not yet
sure that its campaign of rate increases was complete.
</P>
<P>
   The task of bleeding off any inflationary pressure without
ruining a business expansion is a tricky one under any
circumstances, and it has been especially complicated in this cycle
because, many think, some old rules have been rendered obsolete by
the changes that technology and globalization have brought to the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and policy-makers are increasingly certain that the
economy is capable of a substantially faster pace of
noninflationary growth than it was a few years ago, although there
is considerable debate in and outside the Fed about where the new
tipping point might be and how close the economy is to it.
</P>
<P>
   As it often has in recent years under its chairman, Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chose Tuesday to be patient but at the same time
to offer reassurances that it would move quickly at the first sign
of a threat from inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate
demand is moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of
the economy's potential to produce,'' the Fed's policy-making arm,
the Federal Open Market Committee, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the panel said, ``the risks continue to be weighted
mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision means that the Fed is likely to remain on the
sidelines for the duration of the presidential campaign. The
central bank's policy-makers are next to meet on Oct. 3. But the
bank has, over the years, tried to avoid taking any action on
interest rates in the weeks leading up to Election Day _ which
falls this year on Nov. 7. The Fed's first meeting after the
election is on Nov. 15.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The outcome of Tuesday's meeting had been widely expected by
analysts and investors, and there was muted reaction in the
financial markets after the announcement at 2:15 p.m. Stocks
finished the day slightly higher, with the Dow Jones industrial
average closing at 11,139.15, up 59.34 points. Bonds were little
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision left the Fed's benchmark federal funds target
rate on overnight loans between banks at 6.5 percent, where it has
been since May, when the central bank raised the rate by half a
percentage point. The Fed held rates steady at its subsequent
meeting in June.
</P>
<P>
   It also left unchanged, at 6 percent, its discount rate _ the
interest rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has pushed the federal funds rate up by 1.75
percentage points in six steps since June 1999 in an effort to tamp
down inflation pressure without snuffing out what earlier this year
became the longest business expansion on record.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said it was now unlikely that the Fed would raise
rates again this year. Others said inflation remained a threat and
that it would be a mistake to count the Fed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``As intoxicating as a soft-landing scenario is,'' said Carl
Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank in Chicago, ``we have
to remain sober for at least another couple of quarters before we
allow ourselves to imbibe of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter of the year, the economy grew at a 5.2
percent annual rate, compared with a 4.8 percent annual rate in the
first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures were well above what many economists think can be
sustained over the long run without igniting a spiral in wages and
prices. While it remains a moving target, the economy's
noninflationary speed limit now seems to be around or just below 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet inflation has edged up only slightly from very low levels,
in large part because the strong economic growth has been
accompanied by a surge in business efficiency, or productivity,
which improved at a 5.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Even as companies find themselves paying more to attract workers
in a labor market where unemployment is at 4 percent, and more for
raw materials or equipment, they are managing to cut costs in other
areas or improve efficiency by investing in new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Fed, there is a long-running debate about whether
productivity improvements can continue to outrun inflation
pressure. In keeping rates unchanged Tuesday, the Fed seemed to be
deferring the matter rather than trying to settle it.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Federal Open Market Committee noted that
economic indicators were showing ``that more rapid advances in
productivity'' had been forcing economists to revise upward their
estimates of how fast the economy could grow without igniting
inflation. At the same time, the committee said, productivity
improvements have been ``containing costs and holding down
underlying price pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   But the policy panel suggested that productivity improvements
were not a panacea and that the combination of low unemployment and
strong growth still had to be viewed as inflationary, especially to
the degree that strong demand for goods and services outstripped
the economy's ability to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, its statement said, ``remains concerned about the
risk of a continuing gap between the growth of demand and potential
supply at a time when the utilization of the pool of available
workers remains at an unusually high level.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the inflation warning in the statement was
intended to keep investors from concluding that the Fed was
signaling an end to this series of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in recent months, several Fed officials said they
hoped to keep Wall Street somewhat off balance to avert another
sharp run-up in stock prices. Within the Fed, the wealth generated
in the stock market is regarded as a primary driver of consumer
spending and overall demand, and another strong rebound on Wall
Street, it is feared, could push demand up to a level that would
inevitably fuel inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But Fed officials no doubt have other, more fundamental
inflation worries on their minds. Oil prices remain quite high, and
although their effect on overall consumer prices has so far been
somewhat muted, high oil prices could still feed through the
economy and accelerate inflation.
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern among some Fed officials that the
combination of 4 percent annual growth and 4 percent unemployment
will inevitably lead to wage increases that will outstrip
productivity gains and put upward pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan told Congress last month that he did not think the
Federal Reserve would have to drive unemployment higher to prevent
inflation. But some of his colleagues _ including Laurence H.
Meyer, the Fed governor most closely identified with the school of
economists who see a tight link between unemployment and inflation
_ are not so sure.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Securities and Exchange Commission has said it
will not take action against Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican Senate
candidate in New York, after conducting a two-month preliminary
investigation into whether he used inside information to make a
series of lucrative securities trades.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign released a two-sentence letter from the SEC on
Tuesday informing him that it had closed its inquiry and that ``no
enforcement action has been recommended.'' The SEC, which sent the
letter on Monday, would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Lazio said he was ``pleased that this matter has
been quickly settled.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the commission opened its inquiry into Lazio's trading
in securities of Quick &AMP; Reilly, a brokerage whose executives are
among his biggest campaign contributors. Lazio spent $2,300 on
speculative options trades in the company's stock in 1997, and in
less than seven weeks earned a profit of roughly $13,500, or nearly
600 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that Lazio, who has regularly bought and
sold stocks in recent years, engaged in such high-risk trading.
Lazio also made a 53 percent profit, or $6,900, in Quick &AMP; Reilly
stock in 1997 and 1998. Over all, he was far more successful in
Quick &AMP; Reilly securities than he was in any other since he became
a congressman in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said in June that he had not obtained inside information
from executives of the company. He said he was a modest investor
with average returns, and had put money in Quick &AMP; Reilly
securities because he believed the company was undervalued. Soon
after Lazio's investments, the company's stock soared when word
leaked out that Quick &AMP; Reilly was putting itself up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say I think that it was a good company and one that
got batted down, and I thought that was an opportunity,'' Lazio
said at the time. ``I never had a single discussion'' about the
stock with Quick &AMP; Reilly executives.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Quick &AMP; Reilly have given a total of at least
$35,000 to Lazio's campaign since 1995. Two of those donors, Peter
Quick and Christopher C. Quick, said they had never discussed the
company's stock with Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Besides prompting the SEC inquiry, Lazio's profits also focused
attention on whether a member of Congress with influence over Wall
Street _ Lazio serves on both the House Banking and Commerce
committees _ should be trading in the stocks of financial-services
companies. Lazio has also bought and sold stock in others with
business before his committees, including Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides have said he votes solely on an issue's merits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When word of the S.E.C. inquiry was disclosed in June, Lazio's
aides attacked it as politically motivated, noting that the
commission was controlled by appointees of President Clinton. The
aides pointed out that the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a
Democrat, had called for an inquiry, citing an article about the
trades in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the commission, while declining to confirm the
inquiry, said then that the commission was an independent agency.
Lazio did not repeat that allegation in his statement yesterday.
After the commission notified Lazio about the inquiry in June, he
said he would cooperate and provide the documents it was seeking.
Neither Lazio nor the commission would describe the documents or
detail any negotiations that were part of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The commission generally does not discuss investigations while
they are ongoing, but when it closes one without taking action, it
customarily sends a short letter to the subject. The letter is not
made public, though in this case, Lazio chose to disclose it.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is not required to finish its preliminary
inquiries within a specific time period. Still, it was undoubtedly
mindful that if the inquiry dragged on into the fall, it might
increasingly affect the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's trading recalled that of several other prominent
politicians whose securities profits have come under scrutiny,
including his Democratic opponent in the Senate race, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey
Democrat, and former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband was attorney general and then governor of
Arkansas in the late 1970's, Clinton turned a $1,000 investment
into nearly $100,000 over 10 months by trading in risky commodities
futures. An executive of Tyson Foods, which is regulated by the
Arkansas government, assisted her in the trades.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have cited those profits as an example of what they
called a pattern of questionable ethical behavior by Clinton.
Democratic leaders had sought to use the SEC inquiry to neutralize
any attempt by the Lazio campaign to criticize her over the
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate tried yesterday to portray the other as bringing
down the tone of the race. ``I hope Clinton will now join me in a
campaign about issues and finally abandon her tactics of personal
attacks and innuendo,'' Lazio said in his statement. ``New Yorkers
deserve better than her distortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Dunn, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, said:
``Hillary has been running a campaign of issues and ideas for over
a year. Now that the SEC probe is over, maybe Congressman Lazio
will come out of hiding and begin defending his record.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about the Quick &AMP; Reilly trades was gleaned from the
financial disclosure forms that Lazio is required to file with
Congress. Lazio has declined to release copies of his trading
records and tax returns, which would provide more detailed
information.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides, who have promised the tax returns for several
weeks, say they expect to release them in the coming days, and say
they are unremarkable.

LOW-KEY CHENEY TALKS IN CLASS, BUT DOESN'T MENTION VOUCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By   MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDLANDS, Calif. _ When Dick Cheney came to an elementary school
here on Tuesday to discuss the education policies of the
Bush-Cheney ticket, he brought along a secret campaign weapon: his
wife, Lynne Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Her role became clear almost the moment they arrived, as they
were ushered into that classic campaign photo-op: a classroom full
of eager children. But it was Mrs. Cheney who gamely worked the
crowd of fourth graders as she and her husband, the Republican
vice-presidential nominee, toured a computer laboratory in front of
the cameras. ``Looks like Windows, huh?'' she asked a student,
before rooting for several others who were playing a math game.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cheney, meanwhile, stood quietly in the center of the room,
his hands in the pockets of his pinstripe suit, smiling. After a
few moments, he turned to the teacher, Viola Perez, and made his
own brand of small talk: he asked her about the federal Title I
program for disadvantaged students and training for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cheney came to the school Tuesday to promote Gov. George W.
Bush's ideas on education: he called for maintaining high
educational standards and high expectations, keeping control of
schools at the local level and more resources for schools. The
campaign chose Kingsbury Elementary School as a backdrop because
school administrators from there traveled to Bush's home state of
Texas several years ago to study its education system and, in some
respects, to emulate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think education this year is probably going to be the single
most important issue that is likely to be addressed in the national
campaign this year, and that is as it should be,'' Mr. Cheney told
an education forum in the school library.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not address one of the more contentious education
issues: Bush's call for using vouchers to send children in poor
public schools to private schools, a move that Vice President Al
Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, opposes. The issue was
seized upon by a small band of protesters who stood outside the
school.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief news conference, Mr. Cheney was asked about whether
voters concerned about rising oil prices would be concerned that he
had worked for an oil company (``I was running an energy services
and engineering and construction company, not an oil company''),
whether he was too conservative to win in California (``Some of my
best friends are California conservatives'') and his views on
immigration (``We welcome legal immigrants.'')
</P>
<P>
   At times on Tuesday Mr. Cheney displayed some of the dry sense
of humor that he is known for. As he introduced Rep. Jerry Lewis, a
California Republican who joined Congress the same year Mr. Cheney
did, he said: ``I would also point out now Jerry has real influence
as the chairman of one of the key appropriation subcommittees, and
I'm striving to find a position of somewhat lower significance.''

RENO AGAIN REJECTS NAMING A PROSECUTOR IN GORE FUND-RAISING
INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: This is an added reefer story on the New York Times front
page) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rejecting the recommendation of a top Justice
Department investigator, Attorney General Janet Reno has decided
not to name a special prosecutor to investigate Vice President Al
Gore's political fund-raising activities in 1996, government
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the department's campaign finance unit, Robert J.
Conrad, told Reno in June that she should appoint a special counsel
to investigate whether Gore had been truthful with investigators
about his fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said Tuesday that Reno has apparently sided
with others in the department who have argued against choosing a
special prosecutor, a move that would have given momentum to the
criminal inquiry just as Gore's presidential campaign enters the
final months.
</P>
<P>
   One Justice Department official said that Conrad was alone in
his recommendation. ``No other prosecutor in this matter thought
that there should be a need for a special counsel,'' said the
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Reno, which may be announced as early as
Wednesday, is the latest chapter in a long-running and often bitter
internal debate in the Justice Department over how to deal with
Gore's role in raising money for the Democratic Party and the
national ticket in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be the third time that Reno has rejected a
recommendation to seek the appointment of a special prosecutor to
investigate Gore. In 1997 and again in 1998, Reno declined to ask a
special federal judicial panel to appoint an independent counsel.
She did so on those occasions over the strong objections of FBI
Director Louis Freeh and several senior Justice Department
officials. Reno also faced pressure to appoint an independent
counsel from Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, a career federal prosecutor from North Carolina who was
appointed last December to lead the Justice Department's campaign
finance unit, made his recommendation after a four-hour interview
with Gore conducted on April 18. It was the fifth time Gore was
questioned under oath about fund-raising issues.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said Conrad was dissatisfied with some
of Gore's answers in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's recommendation for the appointment of a special
prosecutor was based on Gore's responses in two areas: a
fund-raising appearance by Gore at a Buddhist temple in California
in April 1996 and fund-raising coffees for Democratic campaign
donors at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the vice president will no longer face a criminal
inquiry comes at an especially good time for the Gore-Lieberman
campaign. Buoyed by his performance at the Democratic convention
last week, Gore leads Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican
presidential nominee, in several national polls by margins ranging
from 1 or 2 percentage points to 5 points, even though none is
statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Conrad's recommendation was disclosed in June by
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., Gore decided to release the transcript
of the April interview, saying it demonstrated he had been truthful
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the truth is my friend in this,'' Gore said after
releasing the transcript on June 23. ``The truth, the full truth
and nothing but the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcript showed that Conrad, who posed most of the
questions, was clearly skeptical about some of the responses. And
it demonstrated that Gore bristled at some questions and showed
flashes of anger at others.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the interview, Gore insisted that the 103 coffee
sessions with campaign donors held at the White House in 1995 and
1996 were not ``fund-raising tools'' used to raise money for the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Conrad reminded Gore that an inquiry in 199., found that
those at the coffees from November 1995 to October 1996 contributed
a total of $7.7 million within one month of having attended them.
</P>
<P>
   During the questioning, Gore also said that he thought he had
attended only one of the coffee sessions. The Senate panel reported
that he had played host at 23 coffees and attended eight with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   When Conrad confronted the vice president with that
contradictory information, Gore said, ``That seems inaccurate to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, who was assisted in the interview by two FBI agents,
devoted most of the time to Gore's understanding of the principal
purpose of the Buddhist temple event.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad asked Gore about numerous memorandums from aides
suggesting that it was widely known that the April 29, 1996, event
at the Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif., was intended to
raise money for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were aware in late February, were you not, that there was
a goal of raising $108 million by the DNC?'' Conrad asked,
referring to the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a couple of months later there is a DNC-sponsored event
at the temple, and it didn't raise any fund-raising issues in your
mind?'' Conrad went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know this was a fund-raiser,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   Gore seemed to bristle at the line of questioning, snapping at
one point, ``I sure as hell don't recall having _ I sure as hell
did not have any conversations with anyone saying this is a
fund-raising event.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the interview, Gore inadvertently referred to the
temple luncheon as a ``fund-raiser.'' The vice president's personal
lawyer, James F. Neal, quickly advised Gore that he had misspoken.

 &HT;    Survivor winds up stunning summer tonight
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Lisa Sheehan-Hicks is saying a sad goodbye to her
summer fling tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like a first love. You never get it again,''
says the 26-year-old doctoral candidate in community counseling
from Carrollton.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS series ``Survivor'' has been like a summer romance:
short, intense, a little overheated and obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd find myself walking around, just thinking about
strategies, what everyone's odds are,'' says Ted Friedman, who
includes the show in his Media and Popular Culture class syllabus
at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who've never seen ``Survivor'' are aware of the
premise, so thoroughly has the series defined the summer of 2000.
Sixteen contestants _ a cross-section of applicants _ were left on
the South Pacific island of Pulau Tiga to fend for themselves and
every week vote off one member.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning tonight at 8, the two-hour finale will reveal the
final ``Survivor,'' who earns $1 million. The finale is expected to
draw 35 million to 40 million viewers, many of them at special
viewing parties.
</P>
<P>
   That's nowhere near Super Bowl levels but way ahead of TV's top
series such as ``ER'' and ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' CBS is
charging $600,000 per 30-second spot, more than than any series
earns during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' like last summer's ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' is a phenomenon that has sent shock waves through
the TV industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality shows,'' as they're called, are hotter than ever and
more legitimate. CBS has tried to piggy-back ``Big Brother'' _
based on a group of strangers living in a home amid a 24/7
Web-watching audience and five hours of primetime TV exposure each
week _ onto ``Survivor'' with limited success.
</P>
<P>
   And more reality clones are on the way, including ``The Chain,''
an NBC show in which a woman is chained to five men for a week and
eliminates them one by one (the genders are then switched).
</P>
<P>
   Also in the works are ``The Mole'' on ABC (10 contestants travel
the country doing different tasks as an undercover colleague tries
to sabotage their efforts) and ``Boot Camp'' (20 people endure
military-like training while competing for cash) on Fox. Both held
auditions in Atlanta recently.
</P>
<P>
   Finding players for such shows is easier than you'd think. Some
6,200 people tried out for ``Survivor;'' the sequel premiering Jan.
28 lured 50,000 applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Shows like ``Survivor,'' which pays big bucks to a few but don't
offer large salaries for cast members, are cheaper to produce than
traditional sitcoms (``Becker'') and dramas (``Providence'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people watch 'Frasier' but they don't talk about
it a lot,'' says Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the
Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University. `` 'Survivor'
is something you talk about, fantasize about what you would do on
the island.''
</P>
<P>
   And something that attracts a large online audience. Fan sites
sprung up like summer mosquitoes, and one, www.survivorsucks.com,
became ground zero for Sherlock-wannabes studying clues, trying to
figure out who would be the next castaway to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a moment in time,'' says Paul Sims, the Dallas-based
Webmaster of survivorsucks.com. ``It will never be like this
again.''
</P>
<P>
   How do we love ``Survivor?'' Let us count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   1. We love it as a mystery. Although the show was taped in the
spring and the winner's identity is known to about 100 people, the
secret has not leaked. (Players' contracts say they can be sued by
CBS if they blab and spoil the ending.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the loose-lipped competitive journalistic environment we
have today, it's nothing short of a miracle,'' Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few mysteries left in the world and this is one
of them,'' says Sims. ``Even with the Internet, there's been no
Deep Throat.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it's a whodunit _ a whowonit, perhaps _ every bit as
compelling as ``Who shot J.R.?'' 20 years ago on ``Dallas'' and
``Who killed Laura Palmer?'' 10 years ago on ``Twin Peaks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Figuring out the mystery angle is the biggest thing for me,''
says Jason Kotz, 29, a computer programmer in Kennesaw.
</P>
<P>
   2. We love it as a metaphor. ``It's kind of like the
workplace,'' says Friedman. ``What's most compelling is the
conflict between the need to work collaboratively and, at the same
time, compete as individuals. I've also seen people on the Web
discussing how graduate school is like 'Survivor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Says Mike Halterman of Pensacola, Fla., a 14-year-old who
created one of the many Internet fan sites: ``I just survived my
first week of ninth grade. Pulau Tiga? Bring it on!''
</P>
<P>
   3. We love it for its people. ``They did a brilliant job of
casting the show,'' says Jimmy Baron, a morning host on rock radio
station 99X, one of several Atlanta stations which talk about the
show incessantly. ``The characters are very well-defined, very
unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the talk on the Web and around water coolers has
centered on Richard Hatch, the manipulative corporate consultant
from Rhode Island whom viewers love to hate, and one of the final
four.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so interesting that a lot of the characteristics our
society seems to admire, they're bashing the heck out of Richard
for,'' says Sheehan-Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in our office is rooting for Rudy,'' says Amie Brown,
a recruiter for Management Recruiters of Cartersville, referring to
Rudy Boesch, 72, the show's ex-Navy SEAL. ``We go around talking
about 'Rudy sayings.' ''
</P>
<P>
   4. We love it for its insidiousness: ``We started out thinking
this was voyeurism, we were all peeping toms,'' Thompson says.
``But we all started grudgingly saying it's a good show. It's a
good old-fashioned soap opera with elements of a sporting event.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Atlanta fan Hilary Copp: ``When I first heard about it, I
was kind of horrified by its 'Lord of the Flies' aspect. Now I'm
ashamed of how drawn into the show I am.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling of being sucked in has led to a certain ambivalence
in many fans' obsessiveness. ``You know when you're screaming at
the TV and your spouse won't come in the room with you, there's
something really wrong,'' says Sheehan-Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   But now, it's time to say goodbye. Baron, of 99X, says he can
relate to the idea of ``Survivor'' having been our national summer
romance. ``You try to rekindle that during the year and it just
falls flat,'' he says. ``It was at the right place at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Thompson: ``I've talked to maybe 300 die-hard fans, and
almost everybody has the same response about 'Survivor II.' It's
not going to be the same.''

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT VOWS MAJOR EFFORT TO PROTECT VERMICULITE
WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government says it will begin an ``all-out effort''
to protect tens of thousands of workers who handle vermiculite from
exposure to asbestos, which often is found in the ore.
</P>
<P>
   They ``are determined to follow vermiculite products from the
earth to the final occupational use and to intervene if necessary
to assure that workers are not at risk,'' the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration and the Mine Safety and Health
Administration said in a joint statement issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came on the same day that the Environmental
Protection Agency issued its report on the risks to consumers who
use vermiculite in garden products.
</P>
<P>
   As the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported three weeks ago,
testing by EPA investigators in Seattle and contract scientists in
Washington, D.C., found small amounts of asbestos in 17 of the 38
products tested. Five samples ``contained levels that could pose a
potential for exposure,'' the agency reported. The health hazard to
home gardeners who use vermiculite material only once a year is
minimal, the report said, but risk could increase depending on the
frequency of use and the amount of asbestos in vermiculite being
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vermiculite may present more serious risks in an occupational
setting where the duration and frequency of exposures is likely to
be significantly greater,'' the report said, but later added,
``Occupational exposures were not evaluated as part of this
study.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement puzzled and angered some union officials and
researchers who read early drafts of the report that clearly showed
the EPA scientists had done preliminary evaluations of worker
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The occupational exposure calculations in the draft report
reflected extremely high risk. The early drafts cautioned that
workers using vermiculite daily faced an increased risk of cancer
from two additional cases for each 1,000 workers to one cancer per
100 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went down this road with EPA 20 years ago when they
concealed and ignored risks to vermiculite workers, and their
inspector general is investigating that absurdity. Now we've got it
again. The agency finds that workers are at significant risk of
contracting deadly diseases, but they pull it from the report they
made public,'' said Donald Judge, head of the AFL-CIO in Montana,
where the nation's largest vermiculite mine operated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell is going on with this agency? How much do we
have to study the issue of asbestos? How many thousand more workers
will have to die before the EPA does something to stop it?'' Judge
asked.
</P>
<P>
   EPA's Stephen Johnson says the scientists doing the study ``did
make some attempt to characterize the workers' risk,'' and those
risk assessments were present in the earlier drafts that were sent
to OSHA and other agencies for peer review of the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told that our preliminary analysis on workers were
based on calculations that were not based on (OSHA's) methodology,
and so we agreed, and we deleted it from the report,'' said
Johnson, who is deputy assistant administrator for the Office of
Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances.
</P>
<P>
   EPA's preliminary examination of occupational exposure was
crafted on how nursery and laboratory workers might use
vermiculite, but according to Commerce Department and industry
estimates, 200,000 or more other workers use vermiculite on a
regular basis, many in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of factories make fire-resistant wall board and sheet
rock using hundreds of tons of vermiculite. Every day at
construction sites throughout the country thousands of workers mix
bags of vermiculite with cement and plaster. Raw vermiculite is
poured into holes and stomped down by workers installing liners for
swimming pools. Smaller amounts are used by hundreds of other
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``OSHA and MSHA are committed to ensuring that workers' exposure
to asbestos in vermiculite is identified and addressed,'' the
agencies said.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA has asked the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health to evaluate worker exposure to asbestos in vermiculite
in processing operations and other work sites. MSHA is evaluating
worker exposure to asbestos in vermiculite mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we do not know if there's a hazard to workers, it is
important that we work together to assess the magnitude of
potential exposure to asbestos from working with vermiculite,'' the
statement said. ''What's more, it is not known if the problems
associated with vermiculite from the former Libby mine in Montana
are present in vermiculite found in other mines today, and this
will be investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, OSHA offered suggestions for concerned workers:
</P>
<P>
   _ They can first talk to their employers to determine whether
the vermiculite they're using has been tested for asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   _ If they're in a union or other worker's organization, they can
talk to the group's safety representatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ If they're still not sure, OSHA suggests that workers ``wet
the product down, don't work in closed areas without good
ventilation and avoid the dust which settles in the bottom of the
bags of vermiculite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The levels of asbestos varies considerably from one batch to
another,'' an OSHA spokesperson cautioned. ``Workers may be using a
batch of vermiculite that has absolutely no asbestos in it and
tests clean. But the next day, using the same material, they might
be working with vermiculite that is highly contaminated. The
asbestos contamination is so variable, and that's why it's so
important that more work be done on this problem.''

ABULFAZ ELCHIBEY, 62, FIRST DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Abulfaz Elchibey, a former history professor
who became the first democratically elected president of Azerbaijan
before fleeing into internal exile, died early Tuesday in a Turkish
hospital where he was being treated for advanced prostate cancer.
He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Elchibey's death was announced by his doctors at Gulhane
military hospital in Ankara, where he had been a patient for two
weeks. The doctors said he was also suffering from diabetes and
infections. Officials in Azerbaijan said his body would be flown to
the capital, Baku, for a state funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Elchibey was elected president in 1992, a year after the
collapse of the Soviet Union brought independence to the small
country on the Caspian Sea. Elchibey's yearlong tenure was marked
by his insistence that Russian troops and bases be removed from the
country and that a national currency, the manat, be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   But his brief term was also marred by economic upheaval and
military losses in the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, where
Armenian-backed forces claimed 20 percent of Azerbaijan and turned
about 1 million Azerbaijanis into refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Elchibey himself was forced to flee Baku in June 1993 when a
small uprising at a military base threatened to plunge the country
into civil war. He was succeeded as president by Geidar Aliev, the
country's communist boss under Soviet rule. Aliev cemented his
control later that year in an election that Elchibey denounced as
fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last month in Baku, Aliev said he had agreed to
assume the office of president at the personal insistence of
Elchibey.He quoted Elchibey as saying that Aliev was the only
person who could hold the country together and avoid a blood bath.
</P>
<P>
   Aliev was dismissive of his predecessor, describing him as a
professor who lacked the experience to run a country and deal with
the political complexities of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Elchibey was born on June 24, 1938, in the small town of Keleki
in the enclave of Nakhichevan, a section of Azerbaijan cut off from
the rest of the country and surrounded by Iran, Turkey and Armenia.
His original surname was Aliev, which he later changed to Elchibey,
which means envoy. The surname Aliev is shared by a great many
Azerbaijanis, and the two men were not related.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Baku as a 19-year-old student and studied Arabic at
the university. He later became a history professor. He was also an
active dissident and was jailed briefly in 1975 after protesting
Soviet policies in the region.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the national Popular Front party, he was swept
into office by anti-Soviet sentiment in June 1992. Unlike leaders
in neighboring Georgia and Armenia, he was successful in forcing
the removal of most Russian troops and bases from his country and
moving Azerbaijan away from Russian dominance. He realigned the
country with Turkey, an alliance that remains strong today. He also
changed the alphabet from Cyrillic to Roman.
</P>
<P>
   But Elchibey faced insurmountable difficulties in the heavily
Armenian section of western Azerbaijan known as Nagorno-Karabakh.
The military suffered stunning defeats at the hands of
Russian-backed Armenian troops and lost the region.
</P>
<P>
   Elchibey was driven from office in June 1993. He spent the next
four years in internal exile in Nakhichevan, coincidentally the
same province where Aliev went after the country's independence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Elchibey returned to Baku and tried to regain his
influence as a leader of the opposition movement. Though he
remained chairman of the Popular Front, he had little real power,
and opposition to Aliev has remained weak.

THE ULTIMATE `SURVIVOR' SURVIVAL GUIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   First, a little perspective: When ``Survivor'' debuted May 31 on
CBS, the Dallas Stars were still alive in hockey's Stanley Cup
playoffs, ``Mission: Impossible 2'' was the No. 1 movie at the box
office, and Walter Matthau and Sir Alec Guinness were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, time flies when you're vicariously stranded on an island.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night brings the two-hour finale of ``Survivor,''
along with a cast reunion/post-mortem that is likely to give CBS
its biggest ratings bonanza since Hawkeye said goodbye to B.J. in
the closing episode of ``MASH.''
</P>
<P>
   Heck, maybe bigger. This has been the show of the summer,
dominating TV and dividing the country into two camps, the fanatics
and people who insist that they'll never watch the show _ but even
the latter group probably has some idea who Kelly, Richard, Rudy
and Susan are.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the show-avoiders will probably break down Wednesday,
their curiosity getting the better of them, and check out what all
the fuss is about. But walking into ``Survivor'' at this juncture
can be like trying to understand the rules of, say, cricket. So,
with both fanatics and newbies in mind, we present the ultimate
``Survivor'' survival guide.

<P>
   OUR STORY THUS FAR ...
</P>
<P>
   Back in the spring, CBS dumped 16 people on Pulau Tiga, an
island in the South China Sea. They were allowed some material
luxuries _ including, apparently, makeup and razors _ but were
largely stripped of the necessities like, say, a roof, a fridge and
a bed. They had to make their shelters and forage for most of their
food.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 were divided into two tribes of eight, the Tagi
(portrayed as squabbling, back-stabbing, devious) and the Pagong
(friendly, mellow, good-timey). Each week, the tribes were issued
two challenges, often in the form of elaborate, Rube Goldberg-style
games: a reward challenge (for a home comfort) and an immunity
challenge. The tribe that lost the immunity challenge gathered in a
``tribal council'' and voted one of its members off the island.
</P>
<P>
   When the island members dwindled to 10, the tribes were merged
into one and given the Pottery Barn-esque name Rattana. The
challenges became individual events, and immunity ensured that a
contestant survived till the next episode. For example, Kelly, the
22-year-old river guide, has dodged bullets for two consecutive
episodes by winning the immunity challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's episode starts with the Final Four, who face two
more immunity challenges and three more tribal councils. In the
final tribal council, the last two plead their cases to a ``jury,''
made up of the last seven people voted off the island (including
Wednesday's two evictees). The person who makes the most convincing
case wins and snags a million bucks. The rest go home a few pounds
lighter, unless a diet consisting of rice, bugs, rats and manta
rays makes you gain weight. Don't cry too hard for the losers,
though; they get consolation prizes that would pay off most
people's credit-card debts.

   SURVIVE YOURSELF
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few audience-participation tips to get you in the
spirit for Wednesday's ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   What to wear: Women should favor bikinis, tankinis, sarongs,
scarves, occasional gimme caps _ and good running shoes. For men,
the style is much simpler: shorts, T-shirts, tank tops, gimme caps
_ and good running shoes. For men, shirts are optional; if you want
to be like the recently ousted Sean _ although we can't fathom that
_ sport a nipple ring. If you want to emulate Richard, walk around
almost naked _ but retain your black dress socks. Clothes from
Target, one of the show's sponsors, are preferred.
</P>
<P>
   What to eat: Rice, bland seafood. Other items are suggested for
immunity challenges below.
</P>
<P>
   What to drink: Water _ and none of that fancy bottled stuff,
either. We'll accept beer, but only if it's Bud Light, one of the
show's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Decorating tips: Remove all furniture from your TV room and sit
on logs, or stretch out on hammocks. Occasionally throw water on
guests to simulate island storms (it's even better if you do it in
front of a high-speed fan). Tiki torches and mosquito netting are
optional.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   CHALLENGE YOURSELF
</P>
<P>
   You can use these games for reward challenges or immunity
challenges. For reward challenges, we suggest that you have
prepared a slice of pizza, a barbecue sandwich, one beer or some
other similar food item that only the winner can eat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turn off the air conditioner. Last person to complain about
the heat wins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sit through the Reebok commercials. The last person to laugh
or express shock at the envelope-pushing humor wins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give everyone remote controls programmed for your TV set. The
last person to channel-surf wins. Women have an unfair advantage,
but hey _ life's not fair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drink a full glass of the beverage of your choice during each
commercial break. The last person to use the restroom wins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shoot suction-cup darts at host Jeff Probst when he shows up
onscreen. The person who comes closest wins _ although in a way,
everyone does.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS FOR: Eating a bug or a fried rat. Or watching
someone else do it.
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLE-EXTRA POINTS FOR: Correctly guessing the people who will
be kicked off, in order.
</P>
<P>
   POINTS OFF FOR: Walking around naked, having an irritating
voice, being lazy or sporting a nipple ring.

GEORGIA EXECUTION IS STAYED IN CASE OF YOUTHFUL OFFENDER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(REPEATING to correct hed)  By   RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Georgia Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the execution of
Alexander Williams, who was scheduled to be put to death in the
electric chair on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been on death row since 1986, when he was convicted
of the rape and murder of 16-year-old Aleta Bunch, whom he had
abducted while she was shopping at a mall in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was 17 when he committed the crime, and recently
several national and international groups, including the European
Union, have called on Georgia officials to spare Williams' life
because of his age at the time of the crime. Williams is also
mentally ill and takes antipsychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ecstatic, of course, but in a sense this stay is just
the beginning of the battle,'' said Mark Olive, Williams' appellate
lawyer. ``Now we have to convince the court to grant relief, not
just a reprieve.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim's mother, Carolyn Bunch, expressed distress at the
court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just torturing me longer,'' she said in a telephone
interview. ``I want to see an end to it. I want to see him put to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   The court gave no reasons for granting the stay, which is for an
indefinite period, until it has ruled on the merits of the claims
made by Williams' lawyer in an appeal filed a few hours before the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   There has not been an execution in Georgia since 1998, and the
Georgia Supreme Court has under consideration the question of
whether the use of the electric chair is cruel and unusual
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In their appeal, lawyers for Williams make two arguments that
will have a bearing on the cases of the 80 youthful offenders who
are on death row in 16 states. (Texas has the most, with 26,
followed by Alabama with 14.) One is that the execution of an
individual who was under 18 at the time of the crime is cruel and
unusual punishment; the second is that executing youthful offenders
is a violation of an international human rights treaty that the
United States has signed.
</P>
<P>
   To win on this first point the lawyers will try to show that a
consensus has developed against the execution of youthful
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Florida Supreme Court held that executing an
individual who was under 17 at the time of the crime violated the
cruel or unusual punishment clause of that state's constitution.
The court noted that a youthful offender had not been executed in
Florida in a quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
   In urging the Georgia Supreme Court to reach a similar
conclusion, Williams' lawyers argued that it is ``unusual''
punishment in Georgia because since 1983, just three juveniles have
been sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Supreme Court, in ruling in 1989 that
executing 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds did not violate the cruel
and unusual proscription of the Eighth Amendment, said that a
national consensus against such executions had not developed. At
the time, the court noted, of the 37 states that permitted capital
punishment, just 12 prohibited imposing it on individuals who were
under 18 when they committed the crime. Four more states have done
so since the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to international law, lawyers for Williams argued that
states are bound by the International Convention on Civil and
Political Rights, which bans the execution of anyone who was under
the age of 18 at the time of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Senate voted to ratify this treaty in 1992,
but it did so with a reservation: the United States retains the
right to impose capital punishment on anyone, except a pregnant
woman, including specifically a person who was under 18 at the time
of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' lawyers argue that this reservation is invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, these arguments reached the Supreme Court in the case
of a young Nevada man, Michael Domingues, who was 16 years old when
he committed a double murder. The Clinton administration, in a
friend of the court brief, argued that the United States was not
bound by the treaty, but the Supreme Court did not take up the
case.

CALCULUS, THE IN-THING, EARNS PERFECT SCORES FOR A HIGH SCHOOL
CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Don't ask a mathematician to define the hook of three
bang.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't know what you were talking about, unless he had
happened upon the Advanced Placement BC calculus class that Sue
Steckel taught last school year. Even so, he would have had to
decipher, through the students' laughter, the nicknames they
invented for the symbols and concepts of calculus.
</P>
<P>
   Giggling, covering her face as if to hide a heresy, Steckel
recalled: ``I tried to tell them over and over, `If you talk like
this to another mathematician, he's going to laugh at you.' They'd
say, `We don't care, it's our thing. It's our in-joke.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those insider names for the indefinite integral (which looks
like a hook) and the factorial symbol (a bang-like exclamation
point) were part of a distinctive strategy students developed to
handle one of the most difficult a high school courses: Advanced
Placement BC Calculus, the harder of two advanced placement
calculus courses. In the rare schools that offer it, it is avoided
by all but the most fearless in math.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this past year, at Manhattan's Friends Seminary, a private
high school, a group of four juniors and six seniors transformed
themselves into a team whose closeness became the key to their
success. They were not math nerds, their teacher insisted. There
was an actor, a musician, a budding fashion designer. Not all were
straight-A students.
</P>
<P>
   But, displaying teamwork and camaraderie unusual even in this
close-knit Quaker-run school, the class wrote calculus songs, acted
out calculus game shows, exchanged nightly phone calls and e-mails,
and cheered each other on so heartily that failure became
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   At year's end, not only did all of them pass the nationally
administered advanced placement exam, but all earned 5s, the
highest score possible on the exam. It was the first time in the
school's history that an entire class of so many students had
gotten 5s. Last year, only 38 percent of 30,000 students in the
nation who took the test earned a 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really extraordinary'' for an entire class to do so, said
David Arnold, head of the upper classes at the school. ``I've never
seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Sizer, former headmaster of Phillips Academy at Andover,
Mass., and a leader of the the Coalition of Central Schools, a
school reform movement, said successes like Steckel's class point
to the importance of small classes that emphasize teamwork. ``Most
schools, strangely enough, work the opposite of how the real world
operates,'' he said. ``Very little serious scientific research is
ever done by one person all alone, not talking to anyone. It's much
more common to help each other and feed off one another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious kidding around'' is another key to success, Sizer
added, noting that ``When things are fun, you pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   How do the students explain working so well together, eluding
both the detachment and the competitiveness that can plague high
school classrooms? Caleb Rabinowitz, a student who played a goat in
one of the class' calculus skits, said, ``We weren't stabbing each
other in the back trying to get 100s.'' Trying to describe the
calculus song he composed, Homer Steinweiss joked about its
content. ``Captain Hoo-oo-ook, Captain Hoo-oo-ook,'' he sang,
trailing off. ``It was meditative, like a mantra,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even errors were respected. ``No one was going around making
stupid mistakes,'' said Jenny Rothchild, one of two girls in the
class. ``When somebody made a mistake, everyone was like, `Oh, what
a good mistake.' And when we finished a really hard problem, Daniel
Terry would go, `That was good, we should clap for that problem.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Friends has long offered Calculus AB, the easier Advanced
Placement course covering one college semester, last year was the
first time it offered BC, the more difficult two-semester
equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Steckel had no idea how the BC class would
evolve. ``I told them at the beginning of the year, `I've never
taught this class before,''' she said. ``They felt chosen, they
felt special. I did play that up: `You guys are the hardest math
class we've ever taught.' You could almost see it in their faces:
`OK, we're going to get through this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the students were hardly grim in their determination. ``I
didn't feel like it was a thing we had to go through,'' Rabinowitz
said. ``We all signed up, knowing the dangers _ like a group of
explorers trekking through the Arctic.''
</P>
<P>
   Like an expedition, the class adhered to a strict schedule. ``If
you didn't learn this chapter one night, you'd have to do two
chapters the next night,'' said Rothchild. ``You'd blow off another
class' work, but there was no question of blowing off calculus.''
</P>
<P>
   No one remembers whose idea it was, but early in the year,
without prompting, the class split into three study groups.
Students said that greatly eased the pressure, hanging successes
and failures on the teams rather than on individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The nicknames were also spontaneous. Looking back, Steckel said,
it made sense that the students would attach affectionate terms to
math concepts. ``All that is a way of making light of something
that's really hard,'' she said. ``It's giving them ownership of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Steckel was never lenient, but ``I felt no great need to run
everything,'' she said. ``They were smart enough and old enough to
help run the class. Trust the kid, and the kid is going to take
more initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years old, her long hair clipped loosely back, the
informal, energetic Steckel looks almost like a high school student
herself. When she started teaching at Friends 10 years ago, she was
only a couple of years older than her students. When she applied at
Friends, she displayed an enthusiasm for a subject many teen-agers,
especially girls, try to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they said, `Why should we hire you right out of school?'
I said, `Because I think calculus is the neatest thing I have ever
seen,''' she said, gushing. ``I think it is so cool, I talk about
it at parties. I think it is like magic.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude played well with her students, as did Steckel's
use of material from eight different textbooks and her frequent
consultations with teachers at other schools.
</P>
<P>
   But she gave a lot of credit to the students for the success of
the course. She said they found pleasure in being together, and
funneled it into their work. Friends from outside the class looked
at them blankly when they told calculus jokes, but they didn't
care, she said. ``Some of it's about being willing to take a
risk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said that while the results were exceptional, the
classroom dynamics did not surprise him in a school that emphasizes
Quaker values of noncompetitiveness and openness and is regarded as
among Manhattan's dozen finest private schools.
</P>
<P>
   During the national exam, which is administered by the
Educational Testing Service, one student burst out laughing when a
problem reminded him of a class joke. Meeting together three months
later, students and teacher still chuckled about obscure references
to ``Jenny's closet of numbers'' (a term they invented to help
visualize different kinds of infinities) or ``an ant of negligible
height'' (which they used when describing an angle of elevation
viewed from ground level).
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the students will go on to college math courses, and
those who are seniors this year will take a class in math at New
York University. But some have other plans. ``It was a good period
of my life, my math years, but I guess I'll probably move on,''
said Steinweiss, a musician who is considering a philosophy major
at the State University of New York at Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the course's success has been good advertising for
the coming year, as 17 students have signed up and some are doing
summer work to prepare, Steckel said. The summer work made some of
last year's kids gasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're never going to be like us,'' Rothchild said.

PUBLISHER'S MOVE TO CRACK BEST-SELLER LIST IS NO MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Authors, agents and publishers often work hard to promote their
books in the hopes of winning a spot on The New York Times
best-seller list. Alan Nevins, a prominent literary agent with
Michael Ovitz's Artists Management Group in Los Angeles, took
promotion a step further last week by placing orders for at least
18,000 copies of his client's new book at a handful of small
bookstores that report sales to The Times' list keepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This order of books should be reported the week ending August
18th to The New York Times in the business category, as an off-site
author book signing,'' Nevins wrote in a fax to one bookstore,
putting the date in bold for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   Times editors involved with the best-seller list said Nevins'
effort would not influence their compilation, because unusually
large bulk orders are deemed suspect and are typically not counted.
But Nevins' activities seem likely to reinforce concerns among
publishers and bookstores about efforts to influence the various
best-seller lists artificially.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Nevins said manipulating the best-seller list was
not his intention when he sent orders worth more than $75,000 to
four Los Angeles bookstores for thousands of copies of the new
book, ``Hope From My Heart: 10 Lessons for Life,'' written by his
client Rich DeVos, the 74-year-old co-founder of the marketing
giant Amway.
</P>
<P>
   Nevins said he arranged the sales on behalf of companies that
distribute Amway products so they could resell the books at a
markup during their fall sales conferences. He said he arranged
special discounts from the publisher because of the size of the
orders, but Nevins declined to explain why he opted against the
even cheaper alternatives of buying through a book distributor or
directly from the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Land, a sales executive at the book's publisher, Thomas
Nelson Publishers, said that getting the book on the best-seller
list was indeed the motive for arranging the sales at bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of directing those sales through the stores was to
get the book a presence in the marketplace and get it on the list,
and give our marketing a jump start,'' Land said. He said he
believed that it was ``very common'' for business book authors to
arrange bulk purchases either from seminars they lead or companies
they run, directing the sales through stores in order to get on the
lists.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the stores involved say Nevins made his intentions
clear to them as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nevins' firm, Artists Management, issued a statement yesterday:
``We are concerned about the issues that have been raised. As a
matter of corporate policy, we don't condone or support any
activities that could potentially jeopardize the integrity of any
best-seller list. We have asked our outside counsel to conduct a
thorough fact-finding review of the matter and will take whatever
action is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevins' effort began last week with calls to the bookstores with
an unusual proposition involving DeVos' new book.
</P>
<P>
   Nevins offered to pay the stores in advance to order thousands
of books at deep discounts from the publisher, for direct shipment
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some bookstores played along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said `fine,''' said Mahri Kerley, owner of Chaucer's
Bookstore in Santa Barbara, Calif. Nevins sent her a check for
$25,200, instructing her to pay $22,680 to Thomas Nelson Publishers
for 6,000 copies of the book. At $3.78 cents a copy, that was a
considerable discount from the normal price to bookstores of about
$6.50 a copy. And the arrangement left Kerley $2,520 in profit
without the risk of stocking a single book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' she said. ``Who am I to turn it down?''
</P>
<P>
   Kerley said she happily reported the sales to The Times, knowing
that the best-seller list compilers would disregard the order as an
anomaly. But she did not tell that to Nevins. ``I figured that he
had to have that much brains,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Nevins' request, Dutton's Brentwood Bookstore, in Brentwood,
Calif., bought and reported sales of about 8,000 books. After
calling Dutton's for advice on Nevins' proposal, Chevalier's Books
in Los Angeles also bought and reported sales of 4,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew book signings aren't included'' in The Times'
calculations, said Linda Friedman, co-owner of Chevalier's.
</P>
<P>
   One bookstore balked at Nevins' request. ``I put my finger to my
nose because it stunk,'' said Karen Watkins, of Vroman's Bookstore,
in Pasadena, Calif., who received a fax from Nevins outlining the
same terms.
</P>
<P>
   She said she immediately reported to The Times and to the
American Booksellers Association that a scheme was afoot to
manipulate the best-seller list. ``I was stunned that he put
something like this in writing,'' Watkins said. No other
independents or any of the chains reported any orders at all for
the DeVos book.
</P>
<P>
   Nevins is not the first to try to influence The Times'
best-seller list. In 1995, Business Week reported that Michael
Treacy and Fred Wiersema arranged large purchases of their own
book, ``The Discipline of Market Leaders.'' The magazine said a
consulting company associated with the authors paid $250,000 to buy
10,000 copies of their book and funneled 30,000 to 40,000
additional purchases through corporate clients, all made at stores.
Times editors said the efforts might have influenced the book's
rank on the list, but not its appearance there.
</P>
<P>
   The Times does not disclose its survey methodology, a secrecy
that some critics say fuels speculation about potential
manipulations.
</P>
<P>
   Charles McGrath, editor of the Times Book Review, said that
although manipulating the list was not impossible, it would be
expensive and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kagay, The Times' surveys editor, said the paper relied
on reports from big chains as well as a constantly changing list of
hundreds of independent stores. The paper does not disclose the
stores' names, although people in the industry contend that they
are widely known. Nevins managed to call at least four stores that
report to The Times.

 &HT;    1,000 miles out at sea, Debby has a straight shot at South
Florida
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Hurricane Debby began stair-stepping up the Caribbean
Islands Tuesday, sparing the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico the
brunt of its 75 mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   And that left the fast-moving storm 1,000 miles of open sea on a
straight shot that would bring it near South Florida by Friday
morning, eight years and a day after Hurricane Andrew barrelled
into Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storm or hurricane watches could be posted in South
Florida by late afternoon today, National Hurricane Center
forecasters said. A watch means tropical storm or hurricane-force
winds are possible within 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do feel the effects of Debby, it would probably be
Friday morning,'' said hurricane center meteorologist Krissy
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Debby is likely to be a Category 2 storm, with winds of 105 mph
by late afternoon Thursday as its projected path reaches Andros
Island in the Bahamas, about 200 miles southeast of West Palm
Beach, Williams said. Hurricane force winds of 74 mph or more are
likely to extend 80 miles north of the center of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The official forecast track puts the hurricane anywhere from
Melbourne along the central Florida coast to south of Cuba by 5
p.m. Friday. But not all of the computer models agree on a track.
</P>
<P>
   One has Debby continuing on a more westerly path into the
Florida straits. Another has it turning north over the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   The storm is being guided by a high pressure ridge over Florida
and the eastern Atlantic Ocean, steering Debby on its
west-northwest path under the ridge. But a weakness in the ridge
over the Bahamas could allow the storm to veer more northward by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too early to tell,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Local and state emergency management officials moved to a state
of watchful waiting Tuesday, advising South Florida residents to
begin thinking of what last-minute preparations they should make.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it stays on our track, we've got Wednesday and Thursday to
prepare.'' said National Hurricane Center Director Max Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're watching real closely,'' said Palm Beach County
Emergency Management Director Bill O'Brien, who met with and made
calls to the Palm Beach County School Board, American Red Cross and
state officials Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Partial activation of the emergency operations center could come
today, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida Water Management District opened low pre-storm
water releases from canals in Miami-Dade County Tuesday. Water
levels in primary canals in counties farther north, including Palm
Beach, Martin and St. Lucie were within seasonal ranges so gates
were not opened yet.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Okeechobee is below normal level so no releases are
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Power &AMP; Light will not position crews until after the
storm hits. ``We've found it's better to wait until we really know
where it's going,'' said FPL spokesman Bill Swank. ``All the heavy
hurricane season preparation has been done and we did a dry run
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon Tuesday, local residents were keeping an eye on
Debby and beginning to make preparations for a possible landfall in
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   At the Publix supermarket on Southern Boulevard in West Palm
Beach, workers were stocking extra cases of bottled water that had
been shipped to the store earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the water business right now, that's a good
business to be in,'' one employee said. ``I'd hate to see what it
looks like'' today.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Franz of West Palm Beach was one of the few people
stocking up, buying 12 bottles of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left work early so I could beat the 5 o'clock rush,'' Franz
said. ``People are going to get home, watch the evening news and
come out here. It'll be packed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Home Depot on Lake Worth Road, Efrin Valle was
buying plywood to cover his carport. He said he and his family are
watching the storm, but aren't nervous, yet.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the reaction of most people Tuesday, said Jerry
Hester, Home Depot's sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been selling panels and plywood, but there's no panic
yet,'' Hester said. ``It's not anything more than an average day
right now. I would think the next day or two will be the big
days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean islands escaped with little damage. With winds up
to 75 mph, the storm was a Category 1 hurricane when it struck
Antigua, Anguilla and other small islands Tuesday morning. It then
made a slight _ but crucial _ turn to the north that meant populous
Puerto Rico and the vulnerable Dominican Republic could be spared
the worst.
</P>
<P>
   A 78-year-old San Juan man died Tuesday, Puerto Rican police
reported, when he fell off a roof as he tried to dismantle a
television antenna.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the storm caused a few power outages
but little damage. Airlines canceled flights, schools and banks
closed, storekeepers nailed plywood to windows, cruise lines
diverted ships and a major oil refinery was partially shut.

 &HT;    Georgia's high court grants stay in murder case to review
legality of electric chair
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The Georgia Supreme Court granted Alex Williams a stay
of execution Tuesday, apparently on the issue of whether the
electric chair is cruel and unusual punishment and not for the
major reasons put forth in the international outcry over his case.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 6-1, with Justice George Carley dissenting, in an
unusually swift response to an appeal filed only a couple of hours
earlier. Four of the justices gave no reason for the indefinite
stay, but Justices Carol Hunstein and Harris Hines said they voted
for it because the court is already considering the appeal of
another condemned inmate on the grounds the electric chair is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Carol Bunch, mother of the teen-age
model Williams raped and killed nearly 15 years ago. ``Now I'm
going to have to suffer through more nightmares for the next 90
days until they decide they're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of cruel and unusual punishment was part of the
appeal filed by attorneys from the Federal Defense Program. But its
chief points were that Williams was three weeks short of adulthood
when he killed Aleta Bunch, 16, in Augusta. His attorney gave the
jury no mitigating evidence, such as mental illness and abuse at
home; and allegations that he is now ``flagrantly psychotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was to have been executed at 7 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Williams' lawyers appeared before the Board of
Pardons and Paroles to beg for clemency and commutation of sentence
to life in prison. Their presentation apparently moved the
five-member board. A few hours later, the board called another
hearing today to hear Richmond County District Attorney Daniel
Craig and the victim's family.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour after that, the Supreme Court order was announced
and the parole board called off the meeting. Spokeswoman Kathy
Browning said the board would bow out of the case until the high
court rules. Should it lift the stay, she said, the board will
again take it up.
</P>
<P>
   The stay will remain in effect at least until the court issues
its ruling in the Troy Anthony Davis case, which was argued July
17. That decision must come by the end of its fall term in late
November.
</P>
<P>
   If the stay in Williams' case depends entirely on the question
of whether the electric chair is unconstitutional, then even a
favorable ruling in the Davis case would apparently leave Williams
facing death _ this time by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Harold Daniel, who made the presentation to the parole
board, said, ``I'm very pleased'' by the Supreme Court decision,
regardless of its reasoning. Ellyn Jaeger, director of public
policy for the National Mental Health Association of Georgia, had a
more mixed reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's good news, bad news,'' said Jaeger, whose
organization has been in the forefront of the movement to save
Williams. ``It gives us more time, and that's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said she would have preferred a ruling based on
Williams' mental state and the failure to provide treatment for him
before he committed murder. ``I don't understand how the state
would execute anybody with a profound mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, leader of the international protests,
``cautiously welcomed'' the stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously welcome any measure that spares the life of
Alexander Williams and do not want to diminish the importance of
the constitutional issues at stake here,'' Amnesty's U.S. Senior
Deputy Executive Director Curt Goering said in New York. ``However,
the most significant issues _ Williams' mental illness, childhood
abuse and lack of competent counsel _ seem to have been ignored in
a technical discussion concerning the method of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the papers presented to the parole board Tuesday were
affidavits and statements from five of the jurors who sentenced him
to die.
</P>
<P>
   All five said that if Williams' lawyer had brought out evidence
of his mental problems and abuse by his mother, they would not have
voted for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   One of those jurors, Stephen Dickson, accompanied the lawyers
into the hearing room Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known whether he spoke during the meeting, but in the
file left with the board was his affidavit urging ``those deciding
clemency to rectify my error and commute Alex's sentence to life in
prison without parole.''
</P>
<P>
   According to affidavits from other members of Williams' family,
his mother beat him regularly and fiercely, often for no
discernable reason.
</P>
<P>
   She also subjected him to bizarre punishments such as locking
him out of their house naked in broad daylight.

 &HT;    Pope unseats Costello as punter for Cincinnati
 &HT;    By Ken Sugiura
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Daniel Pope couldn't punt for Milton High in
Alpharetta, Ga. But he will be punting for the Cincinnati Bengals
this fall. Pope, who graduated from Milton in 1994 and went on to
punt for Alabama, won a job Tuesday, the deadline for teams to trim
their rosters to 65 players. When the Bengals released incumbent
Brad Costello along with three others, Pope was the only punter
left on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was my consistency,'' said Pope, who averaged 41.9
yards on seven punts this preseason. ``Plus, the fact that I can
hold (on field-goal attempts) helped.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals also will have a new kicker. They let go Doug
Pelfrey, who was the most accurate kicker in team history but was
18-for-27 last season. Instead, Cincinnati kept sixth-round pick
Neil Rackers from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have kept them if we didn't think they were pretty
good,'' coach Bruce Coslet said.
</P>
<P>
   Pope's path to an NFL job was not easy. He played linebacker and
long-snapped at Milton, then walked on at Western Kentucky but left
before the start of classes. He stayed home for a year, then walked
on at Alabama and waited three years before winning the starting
job.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he averaged 41.8 yards per punt as a rookie for
Kansas City before being let go in July. Costello averaged 33.8
yards last season for Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams, including the Falcons, made their moves during the
weekend or Monday. The biggest name Monday was probably Buccaneers
defensive tackle Brad Culpepper, who started the past four seasons
for Tampa and had 23.5 sacks the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Saints cut 13 players, and the Bears cut 14.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Bears' cuts was veteran defensive lineman Chris Mims,
who missed Monday morning's practice after reportedly oversleeping.
Offensive lineman Gannon Shepherd, an undrafted rookie from Duke
and Marist High, also was cut.
</P>
<P>
   Another notable cut was Broncos running back John Avery, who was
the Dolphins' first-round pick in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins placed wide receiver Lamar Thomas on injured
reserve with a fractured and dislocated hip. It is the second
consecutive season Thomas will miss with an injury. He suffered it
Monday night in a game against the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco placed running back Garrison Hearst, coming off
ankle surgery, on the physically unable to perform list. He must
sit out at least the first six games.
</P>
<P>
   The next deadline is Sunday, when teams must cut from 65 to 53
players.

FIRE FORCES LIMITS IN ACCESS TO MONTANA COUNTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs to change `close' counties to `restrict access' or
limiting movement in lede, grafs 5, 6 and 7, for clarity.) 
By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With some of the summer's worst wildfires burning vast
stretches of Montana, Gov. Marc Racicot is preparing to restrict
access at least 16 counties in the western part of the state, a
decision that would put some of Montana's most popular recreation
areas off limits until the fires are brought under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an extremely serious situation for us to be addressing
it in these terms,'' Racicot said Tuesday in an interview,
referring to an announcement he expected to make on Wednesday.
``It's so incredibly difficult for people who rely, in so many
ways, on this area for recreation and their livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana is one of several Western states in which officials have
taken unusual precautionary measures because of wildfires that have
now consumed 4.1 million acres in 11 Western states, and some 5.7
million acres in the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming last week declared his state a
disaster area because of wildfires and drought. On Monday, the
Forest Service closed the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, a part
of Clearwater National Forest in north central Idaho, and the
Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The expected decision by Racicot could include as many as 19
counties, which would effectively reduce access to the entire
western third of Montana to all but those who live and work in
areas that fire officials have determined are not in immediate
danger.
</P>
<P>
   It would also bring to 28 the number of counties that he has
restricted access to this month _ or half the state, which has 56
counties _ following an order two weeks ago to shut off all or part
of nine counties in central Montana. The Bureau of Land Management
has already closed federal land it controls in those counties.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions are intended to minimize the risk of injury
from wildfires that have been spreading rapidly by persistently dry
weather conditions and, for the most part, temperatures in the
upper 80s and low 90s. Racicot's orders so far have made exceptions
for some recreational areas, and the ones he is expected to issue
Wednesday are expected to do the same. Several major national
parks, like Yellowstone and Glacier, remain open.
</P>
<P>
   But limiting movement in areas like the Lolo National Forest and
the Bitterroot National Forest is one of several unusual elements
that reflect the seriousness of wildfires that are making this one
of the worst years in decades. There were 20,364 wildfires in the
West on Tuesday morning, with 79 large fires still burning across
almost 1.4 million acres in nine Western states.
</P>
<P>
   Resources have been so strained that for the first time, fire
management teams from other countries are assisting. Two
supervisory teams from Canada are at work, and a team from
Australia is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unprecedented,'' said J.D. Coleman, a spokesman for the
Northern Rockies Coordinating Center in Missoula, Mont. ``Never
have we been stretched so thin that we've had to bring in fire
management teams from other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Parman, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire
Center in Boise, Idaho, said that the firefighting force included
20,000 to 25,000 people, with about 1,200 more soldiers expected to
arrive later this week to join about 2,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   But the fighting force is comprised of more than veterans of
past fires and even scores of retired fire fighters who have joined
the efforts. Officials at the Fire Center estimate that as many as
9,000 college students may be on the lines, many of whom will have
to depart in the weeks ahead to return to classes. And in Wyoming,
42 prison inmates are working alongside professional firefighters
as part of a program that has been in effect since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are inmates who are about to be released or who have
earned the right to less security and are not a threat to
society,'' said Melinda Brazzale, a spokeswoman for the Wyoming
Department of Corrections. ``They are professionally trained by
another firefighter and go out and fight fires all over Wyoming and
in South Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazzale said the program had proved beneficial to both the
inmates and the state, which had saved more than $125,000 this year
by using them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a savings to federal and local agencies,'' she said.
``It's also a real benefit to the inmates to learn a saleable
skill.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to personnel needs, fire-fighting efforts this year
have been compounded by the growing number of private homes that
have been built inside forested areas, a trend that Racicot and
other officials said reflects the nation's vibrant economy. Many of
the houses are owned by retirees; others are second homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have completely changed how we go about fighting fires,''
Coleman said. ``So many people have come out West to burrow into
woods, draws and creek beds. They like being a modern-day pioneer.
But now we have to protect their homes, and with the volume of
fires and their complexity, it makes for such an unpredictable
situation.''

OFFICIALS RULE OUT SABOTAGE IN TWA FLIGHT 800 CRASH
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for rewriting thruout, new byline; story is now 200 words
longer)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening the final chapter in the longest and most
expensive crash investigation in its 33-year history, the National
Transportation Safety Board began a two-day meeting Tuesday to
review a draft of its final report on the cause of the crash of
Trans World Airlines Flight 800 over Long Island four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the five-member board, investigators said they had
reached the inescapable conclusion that the Boeing 747 was ripped
apart in midair when its center wing fuel tank exploded minutes
after it departed from Kennedy International Airport bound for
Paris on July 17, 1996. All 230 people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement, James Hall, chairman of the safety
board, said there was no evidence of a criminal act, despite
initial suspicions and trace amounts of explosive residue found on
three of the tens of thousands of pieces of the plane's wreckage.
He strongly condemned critics who maintain that the government is
hiding the fact that Flight 800 was downed by a missile or a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take exception to those who consistently distort the record
and persist in making unfounded charges of a cover-up,'' he said,
addressing spectators who included family members of the victims.
``They do a disservice to us all but most especially to you, the
TWA 800 families, who have suffered so much in this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Summarizing the conclusions of the four-year investigation,
Bernard Loeb, the director of the board's office of aviation
safety, said that the atmosphere in the fuel tank at the time of
the accident was easily capable of exploding with enough force to
bring down the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite extensive research and testing, investigators could
not determine exactly what ignited the fuel vapors in the nearly
empty tank, which had been heated to an explosive state while the
25-year-old jet sat baking in the sun for nearly three hours before
taking off. After ruling out several possible ignition sources,
Loeb said that investigators now believe that a short circuit sent
a surge of electricity into the tank through the wiring of a fuel
gauge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot be certain that this in fact occurred, but of all of
the ignition scenarios that we considered, this scenario is the
most likely,'' Loeb said.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the meeting, which was open to the public under a
federal sunshine law, was to let board members question
investigators about their 684-page draft report and make revisions.
The meeting is expected to conclude on Wednesday, when the board is
scheduled to vote to approve the final report and its safety
recommendations. The board plans to release abstracts of the report
immediately on its Web site, www.ntsb.gov. Internet users can
monitor the board meeting live on the site. The full report will be
made public in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the board's safety recommendations, relating to fuel
tank flammability, potential sources of ignition and the
maintenance of electrical wiring in older jets, were previously
proposed to the Federal Aviation Administration, which was closely
involved in the crash investigation. Indeed, the FAA said it had
already issued 37 directives to operators of a variety of aircraft
models in the wake of the crash, the most sweeping actions in its
history, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is now evaluating ways that the center fuel tank can
be kept cooler. It is also studying how to formulate a rule that
would direct aircraft operators to inject nitrogen into nearly
empty fuel tanks to prevent combustion. Investigators say that this
is the best way to prevent future explosions regardless of the
source of ignition.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the questioning by board members at Tuesday's meeting
seemed intended to try to dispel suspicions of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they considered the possibility of a bomb or
missile early on but ruled it out because none of the wreckage
showed the characteristic damage present after a high-energy
explosion. In addition, there were no holes in the fuselage large
enough to have been made by the impact of a missile, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators theorize that the traces of explosives found
on the three pieces of wreckage could have been placed on the jet
when it was ferrying troops during the Persian Gulf War, during an
explosive-detection exercise with bomb-sniffing dogs that occurred
about one month before the crash, or after the crash during the
salvage operation.

CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS CONSIDER BILL CAPPING ELECTRICITY RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mounting political concern over what many are
describing as deregulation run amok in the electricity market in
San Diego, which prompted a battle in the state Assembly Tuesday
over a bill that would place a broad cap on power costs in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the state utility commission narrowly approved a
partial rate cap for San Diego, the first city in California to be
deregulated, but many people said they believed it was too little
to help customers being hit with bills that have doubled or tripled
in just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, the bill, which was passed previously by the
state Senate by 28-0, had still not been voted on, and it was
facing resistance because of the expected costs to the state,
perhaps many hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But several legislative aides said late Tuesday that it appeared
that supporters of the measure did not have enough votes yet to
pass it, and that its fate was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, skyrocketing power rates in San Diego, the first
city in a pioneering state program, has suddenly become a source of
concern because of the unexpected rate increases. Deregulation was
undertaken because the Legislature believed it would prove an
antidote to what were already high power rates in the state,
roughly 50 percent above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deregulation plan, passed in 1996 with the expectation
that it would be phased in over many years, utilities had to sell
off their power generating plants and then purchase electricity
through a state-controlled exchange. San Diego was opened before
other cities because of a merger of its various utilities to form
Sempra Energy.
</P>
<P>
   But many critics have complained that the market was opened
before there was a sufficient supply of electricity available,
skewing prices upward. The strong economy and the added burden of
people turning on their air conditioners during summer added to
demand, and correspondingly, the jump in wholesale power rates,
which in turn have been passed along to retail consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the state, from Gov. Gray Davis to the chairman
of Sempra Energy, have accused some of the wholesalers of price
gouging, and the government has written President Clinton urging
him to initiate a federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is of the essence, Mr. President,'' the Davis wrote in
his letter dated Aug. 10. ``San Diego consumers have paid an
enormous price for deregulation in a market that no one believes is
functionally competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Golding, San Diego's mayor, said in an interview that she
supported deregulation, but that the timing had been so badly
planned that some sort of market intervention by government was
necessary to spare the city's economy major problems in what had
been its best economic expansion after suffering through a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, it takes a very long time to go from a bad
economic climate to a good one, but almost no time to go the other
way, and that's what I'm afraid could happen here,'' said Golding.
``I don't think this bill is the right long-term solution, but I
chose to support it because it is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the California Public Utility Commission narrowly
approved a measure that would cap power costs in the city, but only
for small businesses and residents who used 500 kilowatt-hours of
electricity per month or less. That left many people unsatisfied,
particularly since a variety of users, from public schools to high
technology companies that have boosted San Diego's economy in the
last decade, would see no improvement in their power bills.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the State Assembly to resume its debate of the new
bill, which is sponsored by two San Diego area legislators, state
Sen. Dede Alpert, and Assembly member Susan Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would rollback prices to their levels in June, before
rates began to skyrocket, order the state utility commission to
place a firm cap on rates at that level, and create a mechanism for
passing along excess profits to consumers. The bill would also
require an investigation of the increase in rates.

STOTTLEMYRE'S SEASON TO END EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, in the
midst of treatment for bone marrow cancer, returned to the team
Tuesday but said he would probably not be able to finish the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre has been preparing for a stem cell transplant, in
which cells cleansed by chemotherapy are reintroduced into his
body. Doctors have not told him exactly when that procedure will
take place, but whenever it does _ and Stottlemyre wants to have it
done as soon as possible _ he will not be able to return to his job
for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll make it through the season,'' he said.
``Everything they've done so far, I've been on the upper scale, on
the plus side. The things that have bothered me have bothered me a
lot less than they've bothered other people. The stem cell
collection, instead of taking three days, they probably had enough
in one day. I've just been lucky; I've reacted very favorably to
all the medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre intends to serve as pitching coach for the next
couple of days and to go on the Yankees' coming road trip, assuming
that his latest blood tests, scheduled for Wednesday, produce the
expected results. ``I feel good,'' he said. ``I came here today
with the doctors' blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who last coached Aug. 5, has watched all but one of
the Yankees' games on television and has spoken to manager Joe
Torre regularly. ``The game looks easier on TV,'' Stottlemyre
joked. ``There's been a lot of good things. A couple of negatives,
I guess _ the bullpen in a couple of games. The starters have been
pitching well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough sitting at home, watching on television. You're
used to watching the game from the dugout, and all of a sudden
you're confined to watching the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Connors, who has been filling in during Stottlemyre's
absence and will accompany the Yankees on the coming road trip, has
been keeping Stottlemyre's records in the same manner Stottlemyre
does; typically, each pitching coach keeps records in a style that
suits only him. ``Billy's been pretty much keeping me up to date,''
Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre decided not to talk to anyone who has had a stem
cell transplant until he was actually on the verge of having one
himself. Now, he said, he's ready to take that step of discussing
it with someone like Roger Neilson, the former coach of the
Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm curious about how some people rebound,'' Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   Torre believes that working helps Stottlemyre _ ``He was going
stir crazy,'' Torre said _ and that having Stottlemyre around helps
the Yankees. ``Any time you think of griping, you look around and
see Mel and all of sudden what you're griping about seems very
insignificant,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's Nagging Injury
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch continues to go through rehabilitation for his
right elbow at the Yankees' minor-league complex in Tampa, Fla.,
and could join a minor league team later in the week. But the pain
that has bothered him for almost a month continues to nag at him.
</P>
<P>
   With time running out on the season, there is a chance Knoblauch
will not be able to throw pain-free again before the playoffs. The
question, then, will be whether Knoblauch, who can hit without a
problem, can play second base with the pain.
</P>
<P>
   It is a question that Joe Torre will likely ask Knoblauch in the
next few days. ``I think that's probably the next step, to give him
a call and try to figure it out,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   If Knoblauch does feel that he can play with the pain, he could
be activated within a week. If he feels he needs relief, the
Yankees could pursue more substantive medical treatment, like a
cortisone shot, before he continues with his rehabilitation. If he
feels he cannot play with his current level of pain, then he could
be relegated to the role of pinch-hitter, pinch-runner and
part-time designated hitter _ sharing time with Glenallen Hill and
Jose Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   Torre is obviously hoping Knoblauch can play second base,
because of his importance as the Yankees' leadoff hitter; Knoblauch
would presumably be replaced in the late innings any time the
Yankees have a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Williams Ailing
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance that Bernie Williams, the Yankees' center
fielder, will join Knoblauch on the disabled list. Williams
strained the right side of his rib cage, and the Yankees intend to
be extremely cautious about his return, because if he comes back
too soon and exacerbates his injury, it could affect him deep into
October.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he hoped to play Wednesday. Torre said he did not
expect Williams to play for the rest of the homestand, which ends
Thursday. ``They've got me on a snail's pace,'' said Williams, who
was to play catch before Tuesday night's game against the Texas
Rangers at Yankee Stadium. ``If I take batting practice tomorrow
and I think I can hit, I might be able to convince them I can
play.''
</P>
<P>
   There are statistical goals within reach for Williams, if he can
play. With another 23 runs batted in, he will tie Mickey Mantle's
single-season RBI record for switch-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   No Justice
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also played their second consecutive game Tuesday
night without David Justice, who strained his neck, an injury that
is not considered serious. Ramiro Mendoza, on the disabled list
because of stiffness in the back of his shoulder, played catch
again Tuesday. The Yankees hope he will recover in time to rejoin
the team by the middle of next month.

TEXT OF FED STATEMENT ON RATES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open
Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel,
after its decision Tuesday to leave short-term interest rates
unchanged:
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided
to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy, keeping its
target for the federal funds rate at 6{ percent.
</P>
<P>
   Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate
demand is moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of
the economy's potential to produce. The data also have indicated
that more rapid advances in productivity have been raising that
potential growth rate as well as containing costs and holding down
underlying price pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the committee remains concerned about the risk of a
continuing gap between the growth of demand and potential supply at
a time when the utilization of the pool of available workers
remains at an unusually high level.
</P>
<P>
   Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability
and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently
available, the committee believes the risks continue to be weighted
mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures in the foreseeable future.

NTSB SAYS SHORT CIRCUIT LIKELY CAUSE OF TWA FLIGHT 800 EXPLOSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ The explosion that brought down TWA Flight
800 could have been triggered by less energy than is produced by
the static discharge of a person's finger touching a metal
doorknob.
</P>
<P>
   That surprising discovery was one of many that came from
hundreds of tests and countless hours of investigation over the
past four years into the crash that killed all 230 people on the
Paris-bound Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the many findings led investigators with the
National Transportation Safety Board to say here Tuesday that the
likely cause of the explosion was a short circuit in the jet's
aging wiring.
</P>
<P>
   An electrical surge likely found its way into low-voltage
fuel-indicator wiring in the center fuel tank, which ignited vapors
that had reached explosive levels as the jumbo jet sat on the
ground at Kennedy Airport before taking off for Paris, the board
was told during the first day of a two-day meeting that will cap
the most expensive, extensive and complex air crash investigation
in the board's 33-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that our investigation confirmed that the
fuel-air vapor in the center wing tank was flammable at the time of
the accident, and that a fuel-air explosion with Jet A fuel was
more than capable of generating the pressure needed to break apart
the center wing tank and destroy the airplane,'' said Dr. Bernard
Loeb, head of the NTSB's office of aviation safety.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member board will issue its final report on the
probable cause of the crash Wednesday, along with its
recommendations on what needs to be done to make sure what happened
to TWA Flight 800 does not happen again. Much more needs to be done
to reduce vapors in fuel tanks that can be ignited more easily than
once thought, the board was told.
</P>
<P>
   Jetliners are probably flying 30 percent of the time with fuel
tank vapors that could potentially ignite given the right set of
conditions, according to research by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Since the dawn of the jet age, and even before, the aviation
industry's fuel tank design philosophy, including The Boeing Co.'s,
has been to eliminate all possible fuel tank ignition sources.
</P>
<P>
   Loeb said that approach is not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded that this approach is seriously flawed because
experience has demonstrated that all possible ignition sources
cannot be reliably eliminated,'' Loeb said.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... It is not rational to believe that we can predict all
possible ignition sources. Therefore, the most effective approach
to preventing fuel tank explosions is to eliminate flammable vapors
inside fuel tanks in addition to attempting to eliminate ignition
sources.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA is looking into the feasibility of a ground-based system
that would pump inert nitrogen gas into a jet's fuel tanks as the
best way to prevent future fuel tank explosions.
</P>
<P>
   TWA Flight 800 exploded and fell into the Atlantic Ocean off the
south coast of Long Island some 11 minutes after taking off the
evening of July 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of Tuesday's meeting to hear the staff's report of
the crash, the board's chairman strongly ruled out theories that a
bomb or missile caused the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we found such evidence, we would have immediately referred
the matter back to the appropriate law enforcement authorities for
their action,'' Chairman Jim Hall said. ``Let me state
unequivocally, the safety board found no such evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   About 70 family members of those who died on Flight 800 attended
the hearing, including several who came from France.
</P>
<P>
   Hall described the crash as a ``tragic event that stirred strong
feelings and emotions throughout the country and throughout the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman acknowledged that early on it was easy for people
to believe that the crash was caused by a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, the events of the times _ the ongoing court trials
in the aftermath of the World Trade Center bombings in New York and
the heightened concerns about terrorism at the 1996 Olympic games
in Atlanta _ seemed to lend a certain credence to the notion,'' he
said. ``Certainly, the very nature of the event and its rarity led
some to question whether the crash of Flight 800 was really an
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was especially critical of those who have continued to
charge that the NTSB and other government agencies are involved in
a massive coverup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that a small number of people, pursuing
their own agendas, have persisted in making unfounded charges of a
government coverup of this investigation,'' Hall said. ``These
people do a grievous injustice to many dedicated individuals,
civilian and military, who have been involved in this
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   That investigation, he said, has uncovered and focused attention
on some important safety issues, including fuel tank protection,
the vulnerability of aircraft wiring and aging aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Loeb said investigators looked at numerous possible scenarios
for what caused the fuel vapors in the center tank to explode,
including a short circuit of a fuel pump, a bomb, a missile
fragment and even a meteorite. All of the theories were considered
unlikely, except for one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One ignition scenario that we could not deem unlikely ... was
that a short circuit involving electrical wiring outside the center
wing tank somehow transferred excess voltage to fuel quantity
indication system wiring leading to the center wing tank,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the voltage in the fuel quantity indication system
wiring is limited by design to a very low level, a short circuit
from higher voltage wires could allow excessive voltage to be
transferred to fuel quantity indication system wires and enter the
tank.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that ``we cannot be certain that this in
fact occurred, but of all of the ignition scenarios that we
considered, this scenario is the most likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Robert Swaim of the board's aviation engineering division:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to walk in here with a molten piece of wire and
say, `Here it is.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But investigators never found that piece of the puzzle.

IMMIGRATION SERVICE DROPS BID TO DEPORT BRONX STUDENT, 16 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Immigration and Naturalization Service on Tuesday
abruptly backed off an effort to deport a 16-year-old Bronx high
school student to Trinidad after an apparent mix-up involving his
family's residency papers.
</P>
<P>
   The student, Ricky Ramoutar, who moved to the United States at
age 3 with his family, received a terse INS notice at his Bronx
home in April ordering him to appear before an immigration judge.
If he failed to show up, the notice warned, he could be arrested
and jailed.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager had come to the agency's attention after playing
on an American junior chess team at the World Youth Games in Moscow
in 1998. The trip required permission from the INS.
</P>
<P>
   When he received the notice, Ricky Ramoutar said in an
interview, ``I was crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, his family's application with the INS for
permanent residency was pending, but the paperwork had been stalled
for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went in for the appointment, they told me they would
write me,'' said Ricky's father, Barminth Ramoutar. ``They never
told me there was any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Murtha, the boy's lawyer, said in an interview that after
the Ramoutar family came to the United States, the parents split
up. Barminth Ramoutar, a welder, married a U.S. citizen. In 1997,
based on that marriage, Barminth applied for permanent residency
status, seeking what is known as a green card for himself and his
two sons.
</P>
<P>
   When Ricky traveled to Moscow with the chess team from Middle
School 118 in the Bronx, he received written permission from
immigration officers. But that also brought the young man under
scrutiny. In April, they sent the ``notice of removal'' to his
apartment. Oddly enough, it applied only to Ricky, not to his
father or brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they said was, `Show us a reason he should not be kicked
out,''' said Murtha, an immigration lawyer. ``The reason he got
stuck in court was the trip to Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramoutars appeared for two interviews with INS officials,
and after that heard nothing about their application. Green-card
reviews typically take about 15 months to process, Murtha said.
</P>
<P>
   After he received the immigration notice, Ricky called Marley
Kaplan, the executive director of Chess-in-the-Schools, a New York
City program that had captured his interest. She said she was
shocked that the INS wanted to deport him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible thing that is happening to a great kid,''
Kaplan said. ``He goes off to represent the United States as a
champion, and this is what happens to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man had been on the Middle School 118 team that won
the national championship in Arizona two years ago. Kaplan has also
sponsored Ricky at the Roman Catholic high school he attends now.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing about Ricky's plight, Kaplan swung into action,
calling Sen. Charles Schumer's office and the news media. When the
Ramoutars appeared in immigration court in Manhattan on Tuesday
morning, the tiny courtroom was crowded with reporters and family
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha conferred with the INS lawyer, and the judge adjourned
the case until immigration officials could check on the status of
the Ramoutars' green-card application. By late afternoon, the
agency had changed its position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been looking into the specifics of the case,'' Mark
Thorne, an INS spokesman, said in an interview. ``We have asked the
immigration court to terminate these proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Murtha said the case was not over. The Ramoutars' application
for permanent residency was rejected on Aug. 16 because they did
not appear for another meeting with immigration officials, Murtha
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Ramoutar never received notice of a meeting or of
the denial of the green card. Murtha said he hoped that the INS
would reopen the review.
</P>
<P>
   Thorne said he could not comment on whether the INS would
reconsider.

AFTER NBA MEGA-TRADE COLLAPSE, EWING'S FATE IS UNCLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  By   MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Ewing is not battling only his aching joints
anymore. Public opinion is posting him up, telling him to leave
town. His own organization even planned a conference call on Monday
night to announce the separation.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, Ewing, the Knicks' franchise center,
survived yet another coup to his 15-year reign Tuesday. How long he
remains in New York is unclear, but the four-team, 13-player swap
that would have sent the 38-year-old veteran to Seattle is
officially dead.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Knicks, the SuperSonics and the Los Angeles Lakers
all entertained possibilities of separate deals that could
eventually cause Ewing to land in Seattle and Vin Baker and Glen
Rice in New York. The Lakers would secure a power forward to help
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant defend their title.
</P>
<P>
   But barring late-night negotiations among the clubs, nothing
seemed imminent Tuesday night. Ewing, moments away from ending his
long association with the Knicks on Monday and the subject of a
tabloid headline Tuesday that blared ``Good Riddance,'' remained a
Knick for another evening.
</P>
<P>
   A club spokeswoman said the organization had nothing to announce
late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with the Knicks trying to salvage a deal with the
SuperSonics, who were prepared to send Baker to New York for Ewing
in the proposed trade, which would have been the largest in NBA
history.
</P>
<P>
   But New York's interest in parting ways with Ewing was tied to
acquiring Rice from the Lakers, a Knicks team official said Tuesday
on condition of anonymity. Rice was one of two other prominent
players in the deal, along with Detroit's Christian Laettner, whom
the Lakers were trying to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors led to the demise of the four-team deal, none
more important than the Pistons' refusal on Monday night to take on
the contracts of seven marginal role players moments after the
Knicks, the Lakers and the SuperSonics had begun plans for a
conference call to announce the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Division among Pistons executives over adding at least three
contracts that had more than one year remaining on them led to
Detroit's pulling out of the deal. According to an Eastern
Conference official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, the
Pistons yesterday asked Scott Layden, the Knicks general manager,
to include Marcus Camby in a package. But Layden, the conference
official said, was not willing.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons, who spent much of Tuesday completing a trade that
would send Lindsey Hunter to Milwaukee for Billy Owens, showed
little inclination to get back involved in a four-team swap.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ewing was beginning to have mixed feelings about
ending his association with New York, a person close to him said.
The 12-time All-Star waived the no-trade clause in his contract
recently, essentially giving the Knicks approval to move him to
another team of his liking.
</P>
<P>
   After all the innuendo and speculation, it is not inconceivable
that Ewing will return for a 16th season in New York at age 38. The
Eastern Conference official implied that if the Knicks did not
receive what they believed was fair value for Ewing, a future Hall
of Famer, the club would most likely enter training camp with Ewing
on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not impossible,'' the official said. ``Would they welcome
Patrick back if things fell through? From what I hear, they would
do it with open arms. They're not letting him go for one player
who's not going to help them out as much Patrick already does.''

U.S. SENDING TROOPS TO TRAIN NIGERIANS FOR U.N. DUTY IN SIERRA
LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first American soldiers will arrive in Nigeria
Thursday to train Nigerian troops as peacekeepers for Sierra Leone,
though some contend there are concerns about instructing troops
from an army known for human rights violations that include
executions.
</P>
<P>
   The American soldiers, who are being rushed to Nigeria to be
there when President Clinton arrives for a visit Saturday, will
immediately start training and equipping a Nigerian battalion of
about 800 men, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, several hundred Americans are to train about 3,000
Nigerians, who will then be sent to serve under the United Nations
in Sierra Leone, in the throes of an eight-year civil war where
rebel guerrillas have specialized in chopping off the limbs of
civilian victims.
</P>
<P>
   But because Nigerian troops in Sierra Leone were accused by the
United Nations and human rights groups of executing alleged members
of the rebel Revolutionary United Front and that group's civilian
sympathizers last year, administration officials said they are
aware that training Nigerian soldiers will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was criticized for its failure
provide support for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone
when, despite a peace pact signed in July 1999 to end the conflict,
peacekeepers ran into trouble against rebels earlier in May. As a
result, the Clinton administration recently decided to help build a
regional force to fight under U.N. command.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's shift has been largely welcomed in Congress
as a sign of backing words of sympathy for Africa with some
military muscle. But some members of Congress have asked how the
American public would react if American-trained Nigerian troops,
using American equipment, commit human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels in Sierra Leone have proven particularly vicious, and
are skilled at using women and children as human shields, making
the task for forces fighting them complex, considering possible
temptations for troops to kill civilians to get to rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A report last year by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan detailed
some abuses by Nigerian troops in Sierra Leone, including the
execution of an 8-year-old boy for possessing a pistol, an
execution at a hospital and other ``summary executions of alleged
rebels or rebel sympathizers.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official who worked on the
decision to send the American troops said that there would be ``a
significant component'' in training the Nigerians that would
emphasize the rules of war. Referring to the Nigerian troops, he
added, ``The aim is not to de-toughen them, but to keep them
legal.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House International Relations Committee,
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., said he was pleased that the
administration had decided to take an active role against the
rebels. But, he said, ``In the past the R.U.F. has attacked women
and children and used them as human shields. Are we prepared for
the prospect of U.S.-trained and equipped forces facing that
situation?''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said that Clinton was not planning to meet
with the American troops in Nigeria. About 14 American soldiers
will arrive Thursday in Nigeria from their base in Germany. The
training will occur near Lagos, officials said, and Clinton will be
in Abuja, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian army's past human rights abuses in Sierra Leone
presented ``a sensitive issue,'' an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the fight to save the Sierra Leone capital, Freetown, from
being overrun by the rebels in early 1999, Nigerian troops were
known to have gone on a ``rampage'' when one of their soldiers was
killed, and soldiers had sought revenge by killing civilians, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon acknowledged the need to make training in human
rights a part of the mission, the official said, and one of the
most important elements in the American training would be to
instill discipline in the Nigerian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council recently strengthened the mission of
the peacekeepers in Sierra Leone, which should help define the
military goals of the Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian troops chosen to be trained by the Americans are
being closely monitored to weed out soldiers who have violated
human rights, another administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations will monitor the soldiers' activities in
Nigeria, but the senior U.N. representative in Sierra Leone,
Oluyemi Adeniji, is a Nigerian. That could make it difficult to get
unbiased assessments of the Nigerian soldiers, a State Department
official said.

RAUSCHENBERG,   THE IRREPRESSIBLE   RAGMAN OF ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 27)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPTIVA, Fla. _ When Robert Rauschenberg was a boy, his mother
used to make him shirts out of scraps of fabric. Collage shirts.
She even made herself a skirt out of the back of the suit that her
younger brother, Luther, was being buried in, because she didn't
want the material to go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   For his high school graduation present, Rauschenberg wanted a
ready-made shirt, his first. A decade or so later he made history
with assemblages of junk; sculptures and music boxes made of
packing crates, rocks and rope; and red paintings like ``Yoicks''
sewn from fabric strips.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on an August evening, Rauschenberg is home making oyster
stew to the dull murmur of a television set with the volume turned
low. He has a television on all the time. There's a television in
the studio. Sometimes he glances at the television as he cooks. He
cooks the way he makes art: ingredients change, spur of the moment.
He's an improviser, like his mother, resuscitating scraps.
</P>
<P>
   When he settled on this slender island off Florida's Gulf coast
30 years ago, he lived in a modest beach house and worked out of a
studio so small he couldn't get back far enough to see the big
paintings he was working on. So he built a wall away from the house
to lean the paintings against. He would scramble up to his kitchen
and look out the window, the only way to have a good view. ``I
thought it was magical,'' he says. ``There were only 500 people on
the island. At the time everybody in New York was making the big
migration to the Hamptons. Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg is now Captiva's biggest residential landowner. He
acquired the land by at first buying adjacent properties from
elderly neighbors, whom he let live rent free in their houses,
which he maintained for them. He accumulated 35 acres, 1,000 feet
of beach front and nine houses and studios, not counting the sheds
and service buildings. He has almost all that remains of tropical
jungle on the island. He has another studio, a 17,000-square-foot
two-story behemoth overlooking a swimming pool. His assistants call
it the Taj Mahal, a joke he doesn't find particularly funny.
Sometimes sea otters wander into the pool from the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg was first intimidated by the studio, pristine like
a vast operating theater, and hesitated before settling in. He took
a while to adjust to a new house, too, dawdling for months before
leaving his old place. The living room of the new house is the size
of the entire old house and empty except for pictures on the walls,
a couch at one end and, at the other, a Ping-Pong table next to a
galley kitchen, where he is cooking at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   At 74, he is an American institution, the paradoxical fact of an
anti-orthodox career. Nine people now work for him _ several of
them have been with him for 20 years _ and they include a computer
specialist, welders and fabricators. (``I hate the word
fabricator,'' he says, joking as usual. ``It means liar, doesn't
it?'') The materials he and his assistants now use reflect the
price of the art, his early work having been notoriously ephemeral,
to the distress of collectors who paid fortunes for it. By
contrast, the recent work is extravagantly durable.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a gardener who doubles as a frame maker, and a
secretary who helps with the plumbing. All are part of a small
industry and also ``a small family,'' in the words of
Rauschenberg's friend and assistant Darryl Pottorf, an artist who
designed the new studio and new house. Pottorf, whose brother,
Kevin, works here as well, has been around for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lousy boss,'' Rauschenberg says, looking at Pottorf.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not a boss,'' Pottorf says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I mean.'' Rauschenberg smiles, perhaps not for the
first time at this exchange.
</P>
<P>
   His latest show, ``Synapsis Shuffle,'' at the Whitney, like a
lot of his work in recent years, has not been too warmly received.
But, materials aside, he continues to make art the way he always
has, as if it were the equivalent of breathing, and he sustains an
optimistic equanimity toward the results. Jasper Johns once said
that no American artist has invented more than Rauschenberg.
Creatively, he is still the most irrepressible artist.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Synapsis Shuffle'' he asked a group that included Mike
Ovitz, Martha Stewart, Merce Cunningham and Mathilda Krim to make
their own configurations from among 52 new large photo-transfer
panels by him, everyone picking lots to establish the order of
selection. Chance and collaboration, the two biggest themes in
Rauschenberg's career, were linked with an element of irony, the
irony possibly having got somewhat lost, well, in the shuffle. ``I
wanted experts,'' he says, making quotation marks in the air. ``I
wanted people who were supposed to be experts to make art.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, he thought of having the first dozen taxi drivers
who stopped at the Whitney pick the panels. ``The museum asked me
about the lights, the floor, but a work like this has got to exist
on its own, with its own muscles and mistakes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Muscles. As with found objects and materials, Rauschenberg uses
words sneakily. At one point he mentions that when he used to play
Scrabble with his mother (she died last year at the age of 97) the
two of them accepted made-up words if they agreed that the words
ought to be in the dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Screwing things up is a virtue,'' he explains, partly about
Scrabble but also about ``Synapsis Shuffle,'' for which he set
rules, then allowed them to be broken, conceding that players could
trade panels or turn them to the wall. ``Being correct is never the
point. I have an almost fanatically correct assistant, and by the
time she re-spells my words and corrects my punctuation, I can't
read what I wrote. Being right can stop all the momentum of a very
interesting idea.''
</P>
<P>
   So with Rauschenberg you go with the flow. His flow. Serendipity
and also control: the essence of his art.
</P>
<P>
   He is garrulous, back-slapping, mildly naughty, more resilient
physically than he ought to be, adept at publicly disguising
whatever might be his temper or disappointment. These days he has a
half-dozen projects percolating. He's designing announcements for a
new Merce Cunningham performance. He just signed off on prints for
Al Gore's campaign, to raise money for the Democratic Party, and
for Hillary Clinton: elephants seen from the rear, a broom, a
donkey. ``No point being subtle,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He photographed the elephants in a Zurich animal park, the
donkey in Venezuela, years ago, when he was working on the
Rauschenberg Overseas Cultural Interchange, ROCI (a word-play on
the name of his old pet turtle, Rocky). The project was the
culmination of lifelong collaborative ambitions, ROCI being a
mammoth art chain-letter that toured the world. Hundreds of his
photographs from it and elsewhere are stockpiled in the studio by
country and date. He can recall photographs 30 or more years old.
As he needs them, pictures are got from the files, scanned into a
computer by an assistant, Lauren Getford, printed to spec and
stacked on long tables, where they wait, like his brushes and
containers of paint, to be used, or not, since he constantly
changes his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually work in a direction until I know how to do it, then
I stop,'' he says. ``At the time that I am bored or understand _ I
use those words interchangeably _ another appetite has formed. A
lot of people try to think up ideas. I'm not one. I'd rather accept
the irresistible possibilities of what I can't ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg has just finished a series for a show this fall at
PaceWildenstein in New York. He says it is about struggling against
what he knows how to do, about doing what's unnatural. The works in
the living room and around the studio belong to that series.
Meanwhile, two years' labor on a mural for a Renzo Piano cathedral
in Italy, commissioned by the Vatican, has gone for naught, he says
disgustedly. The Vatican, among other things, didn't like that he
represented God as a gold satellite dish. ``You know _ a halo, and
also something that hears everything, knows everything.''
Rauschenberg is perfectly sincere. ``The subject of the mural was
the Apocalypse, and I think I handled the destruction of the world
as gently as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Having once thought of becoming a priest, he may have had more
invested in this project than in others. He backed out rather than
even discuss changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you do will be an abuse of somebody else's
aesthetics,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Flashing on the television at that moment is Lauren Hutton.
Rauschenberg touches the screen. Hutton is the host of an annual
benefit he organizes for an abused women's shelter in Fort Myers,
Fla. Sharon Stone was the host last year. A framed photograph of
her is in the kitchen. Rauschenberg raises or donates hundreds of
thousands of dollars each year for charities for women, children,
medical research, politicians, artists. When added to the business
of what has become a major operation, a chunk of time _ too much,
you can sense he thinks _ now goes into being Robert Rauschenberg,
which is not the same thing as making Robert Rauschenbergs.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this is not what he had imagined 50 years ago, when it
seemed as if nobody wanted anything from him.
</P>
<P>
   Or almost nobody. The often reproduced photographs of him and
Susan Weil making silhouette negatives on blueprint paper,
Rauschenberg's breakthrough pictures, were for Life magazine in
1951. There was other media attention too. But the New York art
world after the war was in some ways even more circumscribed and
harder to succeed in than it had been during the war. Peggy
Guggenheim's gallery was closed. So was Stuart Levy's. Many of the
European artists who had waited out Hitler in New York, enlarging
the local culture, had returned to Europe. Duchamp was around but
lying low. ``Jasper and I broke into his privacy,'' Rauschenberg
says. ``Duchamp knew who we were because his wife knew everything
and everyone. She was his reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   There were just a few dealers representing new work: Betty
Parsons, Samuel Kootz, Sidney Janis, Charles Egan. ``Egan used to
open his gallery in the morning and head for the bar,''
Rauschenberg fondly recalls. ``You could go there at 9 at night and
it was still open and there was the art on the walls and nobody was
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was trying to give up European aesthetics then. That
was the struggle, and it was reflected in the fear of collectors
and critics. John Cage said that fear in life is the fear of
change. If I may add to that: nothing can avoid changing. It's the
only thing you can count on. Because life doesn't have any other
possibility, everyone can be measured by his adaptability to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg and Cage became friends not when they were at Black
Mountain College, as people think, but after Cage happened into
Rauschenberg's first show, at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1951,
and asked for one of the paintings. He was the only person who did.
Cage and Rauschenberg rendezvoused a year later at Rauschenberg's
loft, where, as Rauschenberg tells the story, the only place to sit
was on his mattress. Cage started to itch. He called Rauschenberg
afterward and said that he was going away for a while so
Rauschenberg should stay over at his place because Rauschenberg's
mattress must have bedbugs.
</P>
<P>
   At Cage's apartment, Rauschenberg decided he would touch up the
painting Cage had acquired, spur of the moment, as a kind of thank
you, painting it black, being in the midst of his all-black
paintings at the time. Then Cage returned. He was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both thought, `Here was somebody crazier than I am,'''
Rauschenberg recalls. ``That's why we got along so well. John said
I was natural Zen while he had to choose between studying Zen or
going to a psychiatrist, and Zen seemed like the better
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Cage also recognized what you might call the sympathetic music
in Rauschenberg's art _ the silence of the all-white paintings, for
example. Even the famous ``Automobile Tire Print,'' for which Cage
drove his Model-A Ford over a long strip of paper that Rauschenberg
unrolled outside his studio on Fulton Street in 1951, besides
taking a funny swipe at Barnett Newman's ``zip'' paintings, was a
``concrete'' score. At least, like a score, it was a printed
version of their performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mostly rejected by the visual art world,'' Rauschenberg
says about the early '50s. ``But this turned out to be very lucky
for me because my interest in life led me to be involved with
musicians and dancers and they became my friends. Not just John and
Merce but also Morty Feldman, Christian Wolff, Earle Brown. The
problems they were having, I thought, had a lot more to do with
painting than the problems of the people at the Cedar Bar, who were
just whining about how the latest collector in town had bought a de
Kooning instead of one of their paintings. The fastest way to
become unpopular at the Cedar Bar was to sell something.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-beam smile appears. ``The thing about the people I was
close to in my career is that they wouldn't have been survivors if
they didn't have a sense of humor. I remember one time John and
Merce were walking ahead of Morty and me, and I was asking Morty
how he was doing. `Haven't you heard?' Morty said. `I'm the toast
of two continents. Australia and Africa.' Those guys didn't get any
more encouragement than I did, but they just continued with a
vibrancy for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been kind of envious of them because they had
professions that depended on the moment. That's why I like dancers
and musicians _ because I feel that art can be like furniture,
static, clumsy. The whole point of collaboration is to counteract
that. For me, art shouldn't be a fixed idea that I have before I
start making it. I want it to include all the fragility and doubt
that I go through the day with. Sometimes I'll take a walk just to
forget whatever good idea I had that day because I like to go into
the studio not having any ideas. I want the insecurity of not
knowing, like performers feel before a performance. Everything I
can remember, and everything I know, I have probably already done,
or somebody else has.''
</P>
<P>
   The oyster stew turns out to be delicious, by the way.
Rauschenberg, still going, talking apropos of doing what other
people have already done, recalls an idea he once had for an
exhibition of paintings imitating different Abstract
Expressionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, the luxury, the excessive energy and the iridescent
glory of doing a Rothko,'' he says. ``Of course, it would have been
blaspheming, but can you think what it would be like to throw
yourself into that incredible mood? Then out of respect I decided I
wouldn't paint like Rothko or Franz Kline because I'd be in their
way and they in mine. That was also John's attitude. Cage always
said, There's enough room in the world so that nobody has to be
that close to another person.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Everything has its place, all things have their value, nothing
is extra. I Ching. Rauschenberg, having shared this philosophy with
Cage, nonetheless has trouble when he drifts briefly onto the
subject of Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen, the composers.
Each of them asked to visit Cage, and afterward each one denounced
Cage's music. Rauschenberg starts to weep suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was not the kind of person who would admit hurt because
he had enough spiritual belief to think that everything is as it
should be _ there is no tragedy. The thing with John is that he
didn't separate his work from his life because there was no
separation in his mind. He had no ambition because ambition implies
growth and he was full already. But I bet he was hurt because it is
hurtful to lose a friend.'' Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it has happened to me I have a few days of feeling, `How
could I be so gullible?' Then I realize gullibility is a desirable
state because it means I'm open. I'm Libra, and Libras are
gullible. We lean over backwards while we're walking upright.''
He's smiling again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're born an artist or not,'' he adds. ``I couldn't
have learned it, and I hope I never do because knowing more only
encourages your limitations. I wouldn't want to be any less
vulnerable than I am.''

WTO ALLOWS CANADA RECORD SANCTIONS AGAINST BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The World Trade Organization will allow the
Canadian government to impose more than $1 billion in trade
sanctions over the next five years on Brazilian goods to compensate
for Brazil's illegal aircraft industry subsidies, Brazilian
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the sanctions, to be officially announced next
Monday, are the largest trade retaliation award in the WTO's
five-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian and Canadian governments have both said that they
remain committed to reaching a negotiated settlement in the
dispute. Canadian and Brazilian officials are scheduled to meet
here Aug. 29 and 30. Three previous efforts to reach a deal failed.
</P>
<P>
   Canada had asked for $3.3 billion in trade sanctions over the
next seven years to retaliate against export subsidies given to the
Brazilian regional jet manufacturer Embraer, the country's largest
exporter. Embraer's Canadian rival, Bombardier, has argued for
years that Brazil's Proex export program, designed to compensate
for high interest rates here, amounted to a $2.5 million subsidy
per airplane.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the complaint, and a counter claim brought by
Brazil against Canadian subsidies for Bombardier, the WTO ruled
last year that both countries had violated international trade
rules and required each to abandon its subsidy program. In a
progress review earlier this year, the WTO found that Canada had
complied with the earlier ruling, while Brazil had not.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has said that it would dismantle the Proex program for
all new airplane orders, but would honor the subsidies on the $20
billion worth of aircraft already on order.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the sanctions the WTO will allow Canada to impose
was first reported in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo,
which placed the precise value at $1.3 billion, or $260 million a
year until 2005. Brazil's foreign relations minister, Luiz Felipe
Lampreia, said Tuesday that the figure was ``approximately''
correct.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO, which makes the rules for global commerce and resolves
disputes between member nations, has allowed retaliatory trade
sanctions on only a few other occasions. The largest award until
now was granted to Ecuador, which was allowed to impose $201.6
million in tariffs on European Union goods after the EU failed to
reform its banana-import system. &QL;

TV NOTES: `SURVIVOR' COUNTS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 14 weeks in which it became not only a huge television
hit, but also a real cultural phenomenon, ``Survivor,'' the CBS
summer reality program, comes to an end Wednesday night with a
special, two-hour finale.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday evening's program, one of the four contestants
who still remain in the competition on the Southern Pacific island
of Pulau Tiga will survive a vote by his or her island compatriots
to win a $1 million prize.
</P>
<P>
   The final episode of ``Survivor'' will be the culmination of a
stunning run in which it smashed ratings records, drew an audience
much younger than the one CBS normally does and turned many of its
original 16 castaways into stars. It has also launched a host of
imitators that are to be shown on other networks.
</P>
<P>
   As its castaways competed with each other under harsh island
conditions in which they dodged snakes, ate rats and bugs and built
their own shelters, ``Survivor'' became one of the few programs
that tens of millions of people made a point of being home for.
</P>
<P>
   Considering competition from the Internet and cable, that is a
rare feat for television, let alone during the lazy days of summer,
when viewing levels are at their lowest.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, ``Survivor'' was the most-watched series to be
shown during the summer in television history. Since its May 31
debut, it has been watched by a weekly average of 24.5 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Its audience has steadily grown. The first episode was watched
by 15.5 million people. Last Wednesday, ``Survivor'' was watched by
28.7 million. That episode's household audience was 23 percent
larger than the combined household audience of its five broadcast
network competitors combined. For CBS, the show's household rating
was more than double the one for an episode of ``Martial Law'' that
ran during the same time period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor's'' ratings have even dwarfed last summer's ratings
of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the ABC game show with Regis
Philbin as host that took the television world by surprise last
August by drawing an average audience of 14.3 million people. (Now
`Millionaire' draws close to 20 million viewers on a regular
basis.)
</P>
<P>
   CBS would not estimate how large its audience would be Wednesday
night. But the program is widely expected to draw its largest
audience yet. That expectation has allowed CBS to sell 30-second
advertisement spots for $600,000 each, more than those on ``ER,''
NBC's top-rated hospital drama.
</P>
<P>
   And CBS is apparently doing all it can to ensure that the
sponsors of Wednesday night's finale are not disappointed, with
much of today's schedule devoted to the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' will factor heavily in the ``Early Show,'' with
Bryant Gumbel as host, and CBS's ``Late Show With David
Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 p.m., CBS will run a half-hour ``Survivor'' preview
special on many of its owned and affiliated stations. The
``Survivor'' finale will itself be shown from 8 to 10 p.m. It will
be followed by a one-hour special in which Gumbel will interview
the 16 original contestants.
</P>
<P>
   That Gumbel will be host of the special reflects the show's
phenomenal status. Gumbel is an employee of CBS News, yet
``Survivor'' is managed by CBS's entertainment division.
</P>
<P>
   Girding for criticism that CBS is blurring the line between
entertainment and news, executives pointed out that plot twists
were being treated as legitimate news by other media organizations
throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel's role in the program has raised some eyebrows within CBS
News as well as in other network news divisions, especially because
the special is being directed by the two men who direct his morning
program. What's more, it is being produced by a former producer of
``Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' has often been featured by ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' and NBC's ``Today'' and has been the focus of the covers
of Time and Newsweek. Some newspapers have followed developments on
the program the way they would any other news.
</P>
<P>
   ``News is partly what interests people, and you can't be above
the news,'' said Steve Friedman, the executive producer of Gumbel's
``Early Show.'' ``This is what America's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Early Show,'' a production of CBS News, has seen its own
ratings fortunes grow along with those of ``Survivor'' by
interviewing contestants and running features on the program.
Wednesday morning it will again focus heavily on ``Survivor,'' with
profiles of the remaining contestants and a recap of the program's
highlights. Tuesday's ``Early Show'' also included segments about
``Survivor,'' including one in which a professional social planner
doled out advice for those who are giving parties celebrating the
program's finale.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that ``Survivor'' has been able to hold that kind of
audience interest is because the identity of the winner has been
closely guarded and has not leaked to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 contestants who initially began competing on the
island, four are left. They are: Richard Hatch, 39, a corporate
trainer from Rhode Island; Kelly, 23, a white-water guide from Las
Vegas; Rudy Boesch, 72, a retired Navy Seal; and Susan Hawk, 38, a
truck driver from Wisconsin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   CBS had hoped to build on ``Survivor's'' success with ``Big
Brother,'' another reality show in which contestants are forced to
cope with each other in a fabricated house. As in ``Survivor,''
contestants vote each other off the program. The last person
remaining when the program concludes next month will collect a cash
prize of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not enjoyed comparable success. Although it has often
done better for CBS than other shows that have run during its time
periods a year ago _ especially among younger people _ it is in no
way considered a runaway hit. ``Big Brother'' has been criticized
for lacking the sort of personal dynamics featured in ``Survivor,''
which is often praised by critics for a good mesh of strong
personalities, including Hatch, the corporate trainer who openly
plots with fellow contestants and has paraded on the beach naked.
</P>
<P>
   `Nightly News' Change
</P>
<P>
   NBC News has named a new executive producer for ``Nightly News
with Tom Brokaw,'' which had been without one last month when David
Doss departed for what were said to be opportunities in new media.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw's new producer is Jonathan Wald, who was the senior
producer for the program. It is said that Wald has news in his
blood. His father is Richard C. Wald, a longtime senior vice
president at ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Wald is taking over at a good time for the program,
which has been gaining against its closest competitor, ABC News'
``World News Tonight.'' For the week of August 14-18, the NBC
program was watched by 9.65 million people and the ABC program by
8.2 million.

INVOKING SUFFRAGISTS, MRS. CLINTON COURTS FEMALE VOTERS UPSTATE 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also NY-LAZIO-STOCKS, NY-MRSCLINTON-ADBOX) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Invoking the legacy of the suffragists at
every turn, Hillary Rodham Clinton sought Tuesday to portray
herself as a champion of women and working families and to bolster
her support in this city, where Susan B. Anthony once fought for
the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the Democratic Senate candidate, toured Anthony's
red-brick home, boasted of her own efforts to promote women's
issues like breast cancer and child care, and even appeared with
Ruth Dyk, 99, who once marched alongside the suffragists and
likened Clinton to them. ``If I've learned one thing, it's this:
New York needs a woman's touch,'' Dyk said while endorsing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In her latest campaign swing through this key electoral county,
Clinton seemed determined to show female voters that she was their
candidate. At a meeting with union members, she said she was a
working mother like many of those in the room. ``I know what it's
like when you have to worry about whether or not you're going to
make it to that school play because you're in one of those
interminable meetings,'' she said to laughter and clapping.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls have shown Clinton in trouble with various pockets of
female voters, particularly white women, and she has sought out
issues to shore up support. At the same time, her Republican
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, has aggressively pursued these same
groups of voters. Just last week, for example, he visited the
Women's Rights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls, the
birthplace of the women's suffrage movement.
</P>
<P>
   Although she never mentioned Lazio by name, Clinton Tuesday
repeatedly tried to distinguish herself by stressing her plan for
economic development in upstate New York and her support of issues
traditionally important to women, like education and health care.
She also advocated a woman's right to choose an abortion, and
further pledged that she would never vote to confirm a judge who
would try to make abortion illegal. ``I want you to know my
opponent does not have the same view of reality, the same vision of
the future, the same positions on the issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also supports the right to an abortion but is opposed to a
form of late-term abortion called partial birth by opponents and is
against public financing for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's efforts to focus on substantive issues,
several women continued to bring up personal details about
President Clinton's extramarital affair in the White House that led
to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Lowenstein, a registered nurse, said that she intended to
vote for the first lady but that many of her female friends would
not. ``I think the issue is the problems with Bill,'' she said. ``I
think, unfortunately, some women can't forgive her for not leaving
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nora Bredes, director of the Susan B. Anthony Center for Women's
Leadership at the University of Rochester, said that Clinton's
candidacy might make some women uncomfortable because it reflects
their own struggles to be both leaders and nurturers in a modern
world.
</P>
<P>
   And while Clinton was surrounded by a number of women Tuesday,
some of her most effusive supporters were men.
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Noto, a retired railroad worker, could not wait to line
up at the Marketplace Mall to shake her hand. ``She's a strong
woman, because she stuck by him,'' he said. ``A lot of people
wouldn't have had the courage and the strength. I told her that
four years from now, I'll vote for her for the White House.''

EPA: HEALTH RISK FROM VERMICULITE PRODUCTS LOW FOR HOME GARDENERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Home gardeners face little risk of getting cancer or
other asbestos-related diseases from occasional use of products
containing vermiculite, the Environmental Protection Agency said in
a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups criticized the agency's action, saying even
a potential risk should be avoided, and the products should be
labeled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asbestos has no place at all in gardening products,'' said
Alison Wise, an advocate for the Washington State Public Interest
Research Group, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. ``The EPA's
responsibility is to protect consumers from toxins, not rationalize
why they should remain.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA report found trace amounts of asbestos in 17 of 38
garden products tested, including measurable amounts in five of
those products.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also said the health risk to consumers was low.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday it had
``nothing to add to what the EPA has said. We concur that the
potential exposure to consumers seems too low to be a hazard,''
said CPSC spokesman Russ Rader. ``It appears that the primary
danger EPA found was the risk to workers using vermiculite and OSHA
will be addressing that.''
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't satisfy some consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government needs to stop passing the buck on this,'' said
Jon Stier, attorney with the National Environmental Law Center in
Seattle. ``Both the EPA and the CPSC appear to have jurisdiction on
these issues. They need to get together and start protecting the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Other advocates said consumers have a right to know what's in
the products they buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum they should be labeled so consumers can make a
choice,'' said Rachel Weintraub, staff attorney for WashPIRG's
national lobbying office in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA report stressed that consumers were unlikely to get
enough exposure to pose a health risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``These levels were very low and do not pose signficant health
risks,'' Susan Wayland, acting assistant administrator of the
Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances for the EPA,
said in a statement. ``However, we feel it is important for
consumers to be armed with this information when making their
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the EPA recommended that consumers
use pre-mixed potting soils, which are moist and less likely to
generate dust, instead of mixing their own using straight
vermiculite. In addition, the EPA suggested consumers could use
alternatives, including peat, sawdust, perlite, or bark instead of
vermiculite as a soil supplement. Vermiculite is used to add
lightness to soil and retain moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners using straight vermiculite should keep it damp, use it
in a well-ventilated area and avoid getting the dust on their
clothing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also concluded that consumers have no way of knowing
which vermiculite products are contaminated with asbestos. Even
those products that test negative in one sample may contain
asbestos because the asbestos may be distributed unevenly
throughout the product, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one garden-products company said it was reevaluating
its products based on the EPA's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the information we've had up until this report and on
our own independent testing, we had nothing to be concerned
about,'' said Robert Weaver, public relations director for the
Schultz Co. in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The national portion of the EPA report found asbestos at a level
that could pose a potential for exposure in five products,
including Schultz' Horticultural Vermiculite. The other products
with measurable asbestos were Earthgro's Best Vermiculite,
Hoffman's Vermiculite, and two samples of Ace Horticultural Grade
Vermiculite. In addition, 17 others contained trace levels of
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be reevaluating and looking at this report and looking
at our vermiculite product again,'' Weaver said. ``If the report
indicates some situation other than what we've been aware of in the
past, then we'll retest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scotts Co., which is the largest supplier of consumer lawn
and garden products in the country, said Tuesday that its products
are safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We test for asbestos, and it's not there,'' said Kerry
Bierman, vice president corporate communications for the Scotts
Co., headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The company gets its vermiculite from Virginia Vermiculite and
W.R. Grace Co.'s South Carolina mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confident that our products are safe,'' Bierman
said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for W.R. Grace &AMP; Co., which supplies vermiculite to
a number of garden products companies, said, ``Fundamentally, Grace
is pleased the EPA concluded there is no significant problem with
the horticultural products.''

WILL HACKETT FINALLY BEAT PATERNO?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ The last time USC coach Paul Hackett faced Joe
Paterno was the last time he saw Paterno face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   It was eight years ago in State College, Penn., and the Nittany
Lions had just thumped Hackett's University of Pittsburgh team
57-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kicked our butt,'' Hackett said. ``Simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   But things are never quite that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any coach in the country that wouldn't
be upset when you lose to a big rival,'' said USC director of
football administration Larry Petroff, an assistant to Hackett at
Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   That 1992 blowout is remembered as a symbolic final straw for
Pitt fans. Hackett was fired by Pitt shortly afterward, and the
Panthers fell off Penn State's schedule for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett says he isn't worried about flashbacks when USC
faces Penn State on Sunday in the Kickoff Classic. He believes he
has a fighting chance against the coaching legend this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett met Paterno three times in the heated Pitt-Penn State
rivalry and lost three times. But in all of those meetings, Hackett
felt like the junior varsity coach against the varsity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were far better than we were,'' Hackett said. ``He's the
king, because he's beaten everybody's butt for a long time. But all
three of my teams (at USC) were better than any of those Pitt
teams. It's a different time and place.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about all Hackett wants to say about his former nemesis.
While at Pitt, he never felt he had a chance on or off the field.
The fact more Pittsburgh-area players chose Penn State over their
hometown team was a source of frustration for Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Pittsburgh, there are more Penn State graduates than Pitt
graduates,'' Petroff said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the game was played at home, Hackett didn't feel as if
he had an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the game was played in Pitt, the crowd was like 50-50,''
Hackett said. ``It's a huge rivalry so it's more than just a game.
And what's always painful for Pitt is watching those people play
for Penn State who are players from the Pittsburgh area.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all forgotten, Hackett insists. This week, Hackett
stresses the Kickoff Classic is about ``the players, not Joe
Paterno.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to believe that he wouldn't gain an extra measure
of satisfaction from beating Paterno at least once in his coaching
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a very good relationship,'' said ESPN college
football analyst Beano Cook, who has lived in Pittsburgh for 46
years. Joe Paterno is sanctimonious. With Paterno, he had
everything going his way. Pitt was going through what they do every
so often. Hackett was a little over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paterno likes to lecture all the other schools. Coaches do not
like coaches who are sanctimonious.''
</P>
<P>
   As proof, Cook cites Penn State's 12-0 season in 1994, in which
the Nittany Lions didn't even earn a share of the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches didn't want to vote for him,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hackett has not spoken to Paterno in eight years, he
was briefly miffed last season when Penn State refused to send USC
tapes of its game with Arizona, a common courtesy between schools
that are scheduled to meet.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Hackett has discovered how difficult it is to obtain
information on the Nittany Lions, who are secluded in Happy Valley,
away from the press and pretty much anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the last school in the country that doesn't get
scrutinized,'' Cook said. ``They've got a docile press west of
Philadelphia. They're rooters as much as journalists. It's really
the last media in the country that's as much rooters as
reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a contrast to USC's practices at UC Irvine, where
fans can walk up and watch workouts on the campus' wide-open
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always the way he's been. He runs a tight boat and we
should take a lesson. We all can learn from that,'' Hackett said.
``He's been doing what he's doing for a long, long time. But we
also think it's important to allow our fans to come to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The seclusion of Penn State, which is about 80 miles northwest
from the state capitol of Harrisburg and 120 miles east of
Pittsburgh, definitely makes it easier for Paterno to answer
questions on his terms.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Hackett on Tuesday, he said, ``I think he was a very
good coach at Pitt but wasn't there long enough to have the impact
on the program he could have had. Paul's a very innovative coach
and has been his whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   That qualifies as an in-depth interview around State College.
</P>
<P>
   But Petroff, who was Pitt's recruiting coordinator, said it's a
misconception that Paterno is resented because of his stature or
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're battling against him in recruiting and on the
field, you can get that feeling,'' Petroff said, ``but coaches I
know that know him think he's a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So will it be any more special if Hackett gets to shake
Paterno's hand as the winning coach?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. This team needs to go back and win for this program,''
Hackett said. ``Joe Paterno is the opponent, but he is not the
issue.''

 &HT;    CLINTON PARDON WOULD BEST SERVE NATION(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By ROBERT ROBB(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - While the presidential candidates debate the future,
whoever wins may find that he must first close a chapter on the
past by pardoning President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The disquieting disclosure last week that a new grand jury has
been impaneled in the Clinton-Lewinsky affair felt like a new act
in a Greek tragedy that just will not end.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, however, prosecutors run amok, as the Clintonites
would have us believe. From the beginning, prosecutors have just
been doing their job, as defined by the courts and the Department
of Justice. And it will be hard for Clintonites to pin the partisan
Starr on new independent counsel Robert Ray, who until recently was
a registered Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Ray is assumed to be still investigating whether Clinton
committed perjury. Based upon the public record, it would certainly
seem that he did. You don't even have to get into the dirty details
of what precisely Clinton did with and to Lewinsky, and whether it
fit the definition of sexual relations he was handed, to reach that
conclusion. The man said he could not remember being alone with the
woman, for gawd's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has apparently decided that he has to wait until Clinton
leaves office to prosecute him. But if the evidence so dictates, he
has no choice but to proceed. That's his job.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ray has not closed this and all other open matters when
the next president takes office, whoever it is should pardon Bill
and Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The primary objection to such a pardon is that no man should be
above the law. But the entire purpose of giving the president and
the state governors pardon and clemency authority is to change the
course and outcome of criminal proceedings. Those who believe that
the law should always run its course should be advocating that
these powers be stripped. But, of course, there is no movement to
do that.
</P>
<P>
   The president and state governors are given the power to pardon
and grant clemency when, in their sole and unreviewable judgment,
either justice or a larger public purpose require it.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Clintons, the case for a pardon is justified
in some small part by the former, and in strong measure by the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   If Bill Clinton were simply citizen Clinton, and not President
Clinton, he would not now be under investigation. The Lewinsky
investigation derives from the Whitewater investigation. The feds
went hard after the owners of failed savings and loans and
deep-pocketed developers with defaulted loans to recover federal
losses from deposit guarantees. But the Clintons were minor,
passive investors in Whitewater, and had no deep pockets. And
Whitewater was only a marginal contributor to the failure of the
savings and loan in question. In ordinary circumstances, no federal
attorney would have given the role of the Clintons a second look.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was president, which triggered the execrable
independent prosecutor statute, with its endless resources and a
legal mandate to pull every string to see where it leads. And it
led to the president lying under oath about Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason to pardon the Clintons, however, is to serve a
larger national purpose. The Clintons produce an unusual amount of
vitriol within the body politic. The hate of them far exceeds any
rational reaction to what they have done. And there isn't, really,
a pro-Clinton faction any more; there are simply those who hate
those who hate the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal trial of either Clinton would bring the nation to a
boil. Bringing them to justice, given the nature of the charges
that likely would be brought against them, just isn't worth the
price the nation would pay in the process.

NEW CLINTON AD REVISITS LAZIO-GINGRICH TIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a new 30-second commercial, called ``Won't See,'' that
the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign began broadcasting statewide
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: The Clinton Team
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: This is a hard-hitting advertisement from
Clinton's campaign, intended to mock an advertisement Lazio
released last week heralding his record in Congress on housing and
education issues. This one, like Lazio's, opens with white text
against a black screen, with the printed words echoing what the
announcer is proclaiming, to the same patriotic music Lazio
employed. It shifts to a fuzzy, vaguely ominous picture of Lazio
with Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker _ the quality is akin
to that of a bank camera that has captured a bank robbery in
progress. It moves to a photograph of Lazio standing alone, as the
announcer, with a sharp, snide tone, lists votes Lazio cast
against, among other things, federal financing for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``The end to nursing home standards. The largest
education cuts in history. The slashing of Medicare by $270
billion. Who voted for all this? Rick Lazio. Four years as Newt
Gingrich's deputy whip. You won't see that in his ads. And you
won't see his recent votes against investing in 100,000 new
teachers and against guaranteed prescription drug coverage under
Medicare. With Rick Lazio, the more you know, the more you
wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The nursing home standards refers to 1995 legislation,
sought by some governors, to eliminate federal control over nursing
homes, handing control to the state. Lazio voted with House
Republicans for the largest tax cuts in education spending imposed
in the nation's history, though Lazio countered Tuesday by saying
that President Clinton had proposed even larger ones. The Medicare
cut is a question of what the definition of the word ``cut'' is:
Democrats call it a flat-out cut, while Republicans, more
accurately, call it a cut in the rate of growth in Medicare
spending. Lazio voted against a Democratic bill to provide
financing for 100,000 more teachers, but voted for a Republican
bill that did pretty much the same thing. He voted against a
Democratic bill that would have provided prescription drug coverage
under Medicare, though he supported a far more limited Republican
bill.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: With this ad, Clinton officially brings Newt
Gingrich, the former House speaker, back into her campaign arsenal.
She had initially invoked him when Lazio got in the race, and then
stopped trying to associate the two after her aides determined that
it was showing no sign of traction. After two months of using
various other attacks on Lazio, Clinton has come back to using
Gingrich as a way of portraying Lazio as conservative. The
advertisement is intended to turn Lazio's voting record, which he
has presented as a way of reminding voters of Clinton's lack of a
voting record, against him, on issues that polls have shown could
be decisive in the campaign ahead.

THE DEBATES; BUSH BLOOPERS; REFORM'S $12 MILLION QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE DEBATES: LET'S TALK
</P>
<P>
   In a brief telephone call on Monday, the chairmen of the Bush
and Gore campaigns began tentative negotiations on debates. Chris
Lehane, a spokesman for Al Gore, said the vice president's
chairman, William Daley, former commerce secretary, had spoken with
Donald Evans, an oil entrepreneur and longtime friend of Gov.
George W. Bush. They plan to speak again later this week. Bush has
said he is willing to debate Gore three times, but has not accepted
the dates, sites or formats of the October events proposed by the
bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. Gore's aides have
said he will accept those debate invitations as well as numerous
others. Daley has asked Alexis Herman, the labor secretary, and
James Johnson, the chairman of Fannie Mae, to help him in
negotiations with the Bush campaign, Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS: BUSH BLOOPERS
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, it happens to just about every candidate,
especially after long hours out on the campaign trail. And Monday
night, during a campaign stop in Des Moines, it happened to George
W. Bush. Just about every other sentence he uttered in a 15-minute
speech at a fund-raiser seemed to have a blooper in it. His first
slip of the lip came when he told his audience, ``When we carry
Iowa in November, it'll mean the end of four years of
Clinton-Gore.'' (He meant eight years, of course.) Next, outlining
his trade policy, he promised, ``I will work to end terrors,'' only
to catch himself and hastily make it ``tariffs and barriers.'' His
policy on national security: ``We cannot let terrorists and rogue
nations hold this nation hostile or hold our allies hostile.'' His
audience seemed not to mind the bloopers. He was cheered
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   THE REFORM PARTY: THE $12.6 MILLION QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   Asked to referee a Reform Party fight, officials of the Federal
Election Commission are preparing to decide, reluctantly, who
should get $12.6 million in federal presidential campaign funds,
Pat Buchanan or John Hagelin. Both candidates claimed the Reform
mantle at a raucous convention this month that ended with the party
dividing into two factions that nominated separate candidates:
Buchanan to represent the conservatives who have recently flooded
into the party, and Hagelin to represent believers in the kind of
governmental reforms that Ross Perot called for when he founded it.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this week, both men are expected to have formally
applied for the money, and the FEC will rule on each application
separately within 10 days of receiving it. It is possible that both
candidates will be eligible for the money, Darryl Wold, the
commission chairman, said Tuesday. He added, however, that federal
law did not provide any guidance in that regard, and so ``agency
attorneys are now analyzing what should be done in that case.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the six-member commission eventually rules, both sides
say the next stop will probably be in court. In fact, the two
factions are already in litigation. On Tuesday the chairman of the
Buchanan faction, Gerry Moan, sued Hagelin for claiming to be the
party's ``proper'' presidential nominee.
</P>

 &HT;    Arrest helps derail Toombs' Georgia hopes
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. - Georgia was prepared to accept basketball recruit
John Toombs as a partial qualifier until his arrest early Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs, from Carver High in Columbus, was arrested at McWhorter
Hall on misdemeanor charges of underage possession of alcohol and
simple assault. The dormitory houses mostly student-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia announced only hours after Toombs' arrest that he
wouldn't enroll at the school this fall, even though he could have
been admitted as a partial qualifier under SEC rules.
</P>
<P>
   According to a UGA Police report, an officer found Toombs
``covered in blood'' from cuts on his arm. The report said Toombs
was standing in front of a broken window in a dormitory room.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs, 6 feet 10, 250 pounds, was taken to a hospital for
treatment and was later booked in the Clarke County Jail. He was
released on his own recognizance.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Hesprich, a Georgia sophomore from Snellville, was
dismissed from the women's basketball team for her involvement in
the incident. Hesprich had intended to walk on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs, who signed with Georgia April 22, learned over the
weekend that he hadn't scored high enough on the SAT to be admitted
to school as a full-qualifier. He had earned a qualifying SAT score
more than a year ago, but the Educational Testing Service flagged
it because of an excessive increase. Toombs retook the test Aug.
15.
</P>
<P>
   A school official said Tuesday that Georgia had initiated
paperwork to accept Toombs as a partial qualifer. As a partial
qualifer, he could have practiced with the team this season, but
could not play in games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That decision is made by the university,'' Georgia athletics
director Vince Dooley said. ``Whether (his arrest) entered into
that or not, I can't say.''
</P>
<P>
   Toombs was expected to add depth to Georgia's frontcourt. Last
year, Toombs attended Crispus Attucks YouthBuild in York, Pa., a
prep school where he averaged 16 points, 12 rebounds.

NORTHRIDGE HAS FOUR CONTENDERS AT RUNNING BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Alan Taylor insists that it's business as usual in
the Cal State Northridge backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor - a returning sophomore - is one of four running backs
competing to be the Matadors' starting tailback. Taylor, Bruce
Molock, Terrelus Wright and Matt Hicks - who hasn't practiced yet -
are trying to catch the attention of first-year running backs coach
Daniel Escalera.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no tension back there,'' Taylor said. ``Everybody is
out there having a good time and trying to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Escalera readily discusses the attributes of each running back.
But at some point in the next 10 days, one must be singled out.
CSUN opens the season Sept. 2 at Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Escalera isn't worried about that. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of keeping the door open, so to speak,'' Escalera
said. ``I'm not looking for anybody now. I want to make sure the
guys know the offense. We'll sit down and talk about their
performances based on the scrimmages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to make sure the offense is installed and
we're able to execute it. The reps have all been about equal, to
tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as mastering the offense, Taylor probably leads that
category. Taylor saw limited action last season with 141 yards on
32 carries as one of two backups to Jaumal Bradley. Taylor thinks
CSUN could benefit from using more than just one featured back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a real strong backfield and a lot of talented
guys with different running styles,'' Taylor said. ``I think it
will be a stronger part of our offense. Once a defense gets used to
a certain runner, we know we can throw in another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is experienced, quick and changes directions well. He had
the longest run - 27 yards - in Saturday's scrimmage. Molock has
speed and the ability to get up field. Wright is tabbed as a hard
worker who's learning the offense quickly. Hicks, who transferred
from Air Force, is expected to make an impact once his paperwork is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We commented the other day that as a group, the running backs
performed the best in the scrimmage,'' CSUN coach Jeff Kearin said.
''Everybody brings something different to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: The Matadors made it through Saturday's scrimmage
without major injuries. However, defensive lineman Andy Zaldivar is
out with a high left-ankle sprain he suffered Friday and likely
won't play against Air Force. ... Offensive lineman Keith Kincaid
also is nursing a sprained ankle but is expected to return to
practice today. ... Defensive lineman Jason Nicastro sat out
Wednesday with a minor groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Double duty: It's possible quarterback Marcus Brady could punt
for the Matadors - but only in an emergency situation. CSUN should
excel in the special teams department with preseason All-American
Ethan Beck - who averaged 43.4 yards per punt last year. Ruben
Gomez - a transfer from Santa Barbara City College - is the backup
punter, and Brady and kicker Derek Brown practiced punting Tuesday.
Brady hasn't punted since high school but Kearin said he's
qualified to fill in if needed.

RENO AGAIN REJECTS NAMING A PROSECUTOR IN GORE FUND-RAISING
INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 15th graf, But Conrad reminded ... to fix typo in
1997.) 
By NEIL A. LEWIS and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rejecting the recommendation of a top Justice
Department investigator, Attorney General Janet Reno has decided
not to name a special prosecutor to investigate Vice President Al
Gore's political fund-raising activities in 1996, government
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the department's campaign finance unit, Robert J.
Conrad, told Reno in June that she should appoint a special counsel
to investigate whether Gore had been truthful with investigators
about his fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said Tuesday that Reno has apparently sided
with others in the department who have argued against choosing a
special prosecutor, a move that would have given momentum to the
criminal inquiry just as Gore's presidential campaign enters the
final months.
</P>
<P>
   One Justice Department official said that Conrad was alone in
his recommendation. ``No other prosecutor in this matter thought
that there should be a need for a special counsel,'' said the
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Reno, which may be announced as early as
Wednesday, is the latest chapter in a long-running and often bitter
internal debate in the Justice Department over how to deal with
Gore's role in raising money for the Democratic Party and the
national ticket in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be the third time that Reno has rejected a
recommendation to seek the appointment of a special prosecutor to
investigate Gore. In 1997 and again in 1998, Reno declined to ask a
special federal judicial panel to appoint an independent counsel.
She did so on those occasions over the strong objections of FBI
Director Louis Freeh and several senior Justice Department
officials. Reno also faced pressure to appoint an independent
counsel from Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, a career federal prosecutor from North Carolina who was
appointed last December to lead the Justice Department's campaign
finance unit, made his recommendation after a four-hour interview
with Gore conducted on April 18. It was the fifth time Gore was
questioned under oath about fund-raising issues.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said Conrad was dissatisfied with some
of Gore's answers in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's recommendation for the appointment of a special
prosecutor was based on Gore's responses in two areas: a
fund-raising appearance by Gore at a Buddhist temple in California
in April 1996 and fund-raising coffees for Democratic campaign
donors at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the vice president will no longer face a criminal
inquiry comes at an especially good time for the Gore-Lieberman
campaign. Buoyed by his performance at the Democratic convention
last week, Gore leads Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican
presidential nominee, in several national polls by margins ranging
from 1 or 2 percentage points to 5 points, even though none is
statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Conrad's recommendation was disclosed in June by
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., Gore decided to release the transcript
of the April interview, saying it demonstrated he had been truthful
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the truth is my friend in this,'' Gore said after
releasing the transcript on June 23. ``The truth, the full truth
and nothing but the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcript showed that Conrad, who posed most of the
questions, was clearly skeptical about some of the responses. And
it demonstrated that Gore bristled at some questions and showed
flashes of anger at others.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the interview, Gore insisted that the 103 coffee
sessions with campaign donors held at the White House in 1995 and
1996 were not ``fund-raising tools'' used to raise money for the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Conrad reminded Gore that an inquiry in 1997, found that
those at the coffees from November 1995 to October 1996 contributed
a total of $7.7 million within one month of having attended them.
</P>
<P>
   During the questioning, Gore also said that he thought he had
attended only one of the coffee sessions. The Senate panel reported
that he had played host at 23 coffees and attended eight with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   When Conrad confronted the vice president with that
contradictory information, Gore said, ``That seems inaccurate to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, who was assisted in the interview by two FBI agents,
devoted most of the time to Gore's understanding of the principal
purpose of the Buddhist temple event.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad asked Gore about numerous memorandums from aides
suggesting that it was widely known that the April 29, 1996, event
at the Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif., was intended to
raise money for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were aware in late February, were you not, that there was
a goal of raising $108 million by the DNC?'' Conrad asked,
referring to the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a couple of months later there is a DNC-sponsored event
at the temple, and it didn't raise any fund-raising issues in your
mind?'' Conrad went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know this was a fund-raiser,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   Gore seemed to bristle at the line of questioning, snapping at
one point, ``I sure as hell don't recall having _ I sure as hell
did not have any conversations with anyone saying this is a
fund-raising event.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the interview, Gore inadvertently referred to the
temple luncheon as a ``fund-raiser.'' The vice president's personal
lawyer, James F. Neal, quickly advised Gore that he had misspoken.

YANKS' RALLY IS WASTED AGAINST RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox have become like an
old married couple; the longer their race goes on, the more they
resemble each other. Every time the Yankees lose, it seems, so do
the Red Sox, and when the Yankees win, so do the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees just cannot seem to divorce themselves in the
American League East from the Red Sox. Their lead over Boston
remained at three games after they lost to the Texas Rangers, 5-4,
at Yankee Stadium Tuesday night and Boston was an 11-4 loser to
Anaheim at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro broke a 4-4 tie with a home run in the eighth
inning off Denny Neagle after the Yankees came back from a 4-0
deficit. John Wetteland pitched a perfect ninth for the save
against his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees won on Aug. 4; Boston did, as well. Each team
lost the next three games. The Yankees lost on Aug. 18 and the Red
Sox won, but the next day, the Yankees won and Boston lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and the Red Sox have had the same result on 13 of 18
days since Aug. 4, their records almost identical: Yankees 10-9,
Red Sox 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 4-0 before they even batted Tuesday night, the
Yankees tied the game with three runs in the sixth and one in the
seventh. Having thrown 119 pitches, the left-handed Neagle went out
to start the eighth inning and fell behind the left-handed-hitting
Palmeiro two balls and no strikes before Palmeiro launched a high
drive to right.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill backed against the wall, looked up, only to see
Palmeiro's 32nd homer carry over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle struggled with his mechanics in the first inning, often
pausing after bad pitches to repeat what his motion should have
been, how his right shoulder is supposed to turn or how he should
release his changeup. He fell behind in the count, kept getting the
ball up in the strike zone and generally needed his defense to bail
him out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees outfielders only hurt Neagle in the first
inning. Texas had runners at first and third with one out when
Palmeiro laced a line drive to center field, where Clay Bellinger
has been filling in capably for the injured Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Bellinger came in on the ball unsteadily as it fell in front of
him _ and then it skipped quickly past him, rolling almost to the
center-field fence. Both runners scored and Palmeiro reached third.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler pulled a hit to left-center to drive home Palmeiro,
and when left fielder Luis Polonia took a cautious route after the
ball, Kapler hustled into second base. Kapler subsequently scored
when Ricky Ledee pulled a single through the infield.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' 4-0 lead appeared insurmountable early because Rick
Helling was dominating the Yankees, throwing only 40 pitches in the
first four innings, retiring 17 consecutive batters after Polonia
doubled to lead off the first.
</P>
<P>
   There were two outs and nobody on in the Yankees' sixth, nothing
happening. But Polonia crushed a homer over the right-field wall,
waking the crowd. Derek Jeter walked and O'Neill hit a line drive
to right, the ball requiring about 1.1 seconds to reach the
screaming fans, the Yankees' 22nd home run in their last 10 games.
Three batters, three runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees resumed their comeback in the seventh, Tino Martinez
dumping a double into left-center and eventually scoring on Luis
Sojo's double to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees loaded the bases with two out. Tim Crabtree relieved
Helling and fell behind Jeter three balls and one strike. But
Crabtree came back, throwing a fastball past Jeter's swing to keep
the game tied at 4-4.

WORST FIRE SEASON IN YEARS FUELS DEBATE ON FORESTRY POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT McCLURE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WENATCHEE _ Blame Smokey Bear. Blame the U.S. Forest Service.
Blame the timber industry. Blame environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of blame to go around as the West sizzles
through its worst fire season in decades.
</P>
<P>
   And now the public faces some difficult choices in a
long-contentious debate. After nearly a century of mismanagement,
millions of acres of federally owned forests are dangerously full
of sick, spindly trees in unnaturally thick stands. Over the years,
federal investigators concluded in 1999, fires feeding on these
manmade forests have grown ``increasingly unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it: The cataclysmic blazes that charred
over 5 million acres this year _ plus another 25 million over the
past decade _ are no mere act of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncontrollable wildfire should be seen as a failure of land
management and public policy,'' the National Commission on Wildfire
Disasters warned. ``The fire situation will become worse rather
than better unless there are changes in land management... at all
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 1994, the same year that the cocoa-colored hills here
by Wenatchee, at the eastern edge of the Cascades in central
Washington, got mauled by some monster fires.
</P>
<P>
   Those blazes taught a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   They are proving this year to be a forerunner of the
conflagrations raging across 10 states. Now managers of the
Wenatchee National Forest are striving to set things right with
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been successful in doing the right things,'' said Sonny
O'Neal, supervisor of the Wenatchee National Forest. ``We just
haven't been able to do them on a large enough scale.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an arduous and expensive job that researchers say must be
taken on across the West. They say it will take decades _ and that
it must start right now.
</P>
<P>
   As she lay in bed one night in 1994, Christine Mallon was
bothered by the weird red glow over a distant ridgeline.
</P>
<P>
   The reddish cast to the night sky came from a day-old fire near
her home some 15 miles north of Wenatchee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is eerie,'' she recalls now of the hellish halo caused by
1994's Tyee Creek fire. ``It draws your attention.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, as the blaze descended on the Mallon household, the
family grabbed a few precious items _ photo albums, a guitar,
hard-to-replace tractor parts _ stashed them in the root cellar and
sped away, hoping for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, the fire would singe more than 200 square
miles, making it the biggest blaze in Washington in six decades. It
disgorged walls of flame that approached the height of the Space
Needle, sent columns of smoke as high as the cruising altitude of
some airliners, generated hurricane-force winds that snapped off
treetops. It spawned fire ``tornadoes'' that tossed embers a
half-mile or more, sparking more flames.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighting cost $44 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The Mallon home wasn't among them. In the years before the Tyee
Creek fire, the Mallons had cleared out many of the dinky trees
around their house and pruned lower branches on those that
remained. They removed fuel from the forest floor. An intentional,
highly controlled ``prescribed burn'' by Forest Service workers
finished the job.
</P>
<P>
   On a small scale, they had done what the Forest Service needs to
do on a massive scale. And it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire break worked to textbook perfection,'' Mallon
recalls. ``The fire was (burning treetops) and when it got to the
fire break (around her home), it went to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tyee Creek fire sprang from the very same pattern that
foresters say still endangers more than nearly 40 million acres of
low-elevation forests across the West:
</P>
<P>
   First, starting in the 1800s, the really big trees were taken by
loggers. Most of these were fire-resistant ponderosa pines.
</P>
<P>
   In their absence, sunlight penetrated to more of the forest
floor. Many more trees sprouted. Quite a few were firs, which are
less resistant to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early last century in the face of blazes that killed
hundreds of people and wiped out billions of board-feet of timber,
the U.S. Forest Service adopted an unyielding policy: Extinguish
all fires as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   What this strategy ignored is that some forests need fire.
</P>
<P>
   The low-elevation forests of the interior West grew for
millennia with blazes occurring every 10 to 15 years, on average.
Those fires killed off small trees. They consumed dead needles, old
decaying limbs and other fuel that accumulated on the forest floor.
They killed off saplings struggling to grow among the giant pines,
but left the older and more resilient trees alive.
</P>
<P>
   Today's blazes are different. In a forest where flames have been
unnaturally excluded, fire behaves in a whole different way.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1900s, many forest patches grew incredibly thick with
trees, all competing with each other for sunlight, nutrients and
water. Most, like half-starved humans, are a little unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Where you might have found 30 or 40 trees to an acre at the turn
of the century _ each two feet or more in diameter _ today you'll
see between 200 and 300 trees with an average width of perhaps five
inches.
</P>
<P>
   Because fire has been kept out of the forest for so long, the
forest floor is littered with fuel. The groundfire burns long and
hot.
</P>
<P>
   As it moves through the overcrowded, sickly forests, the blaze
engulfs the lower trunks of the thin trees, climbs up their limbs
and finally shoots out their crowns, killing the forest. In the
original forests, most fires bolted through quickly at ground
level.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what happened at the Mallon home in 1994. Ditto for
a section of woods up Mud Creek from there, where the Forest
Service had done thinning and burning work across a thin stretch of
forest. Today, an aerial photo shows a sliver of green running
through acres of trees that look like spent matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good stewardship,'' Mallon concludes, ``doesn't mean don't
touch it. Using a chainsaw isn't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Hoffman looks around: Charred stumps. Blackened tree
trunks. The brown needles of a dead ponderosa pine.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Hoffman is pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The district ranger for the Lake Wenatchee and Leavenworth
disticts of the Wenatchee National Forest also sees deer tracks,
rodent burrows with fresh trails and a raven swooping through the
open forest.
</P>
<P>
   Just 15 months ago, following selective removal of some trees,
this once-overcrowded forest was burned by Forest Service crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of trying to dismantle the risk,''
Hoffman explains. ``It's like there's a time bomb, and the clock is
ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the two districts he supervises, Hoffman figures, some
135,000 acres are counted as dangerously overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   So far he has managed to work through a cumbersome approval
process to thin 14,000 acres and burn 6,000 acres. Hoffman ticks
off a list of the checkpoints he must satisfy for each project:
Will it harm endangered species? Has the public had an adequate
chance to comment? Will the smoke violate the Clean Air Act?
</P>
<P>
   In several cases here, Forest Service plans to reduce forest
fuel loads were halted by environmentalists who _ like many across
the West _ support the concept but don't trust the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   One factor is administrative. The cash-strapped Forest Service
has trouble paying for the thinning work. But timber companies will
actually pay to do the work if enough large trees can be removed.
However, as federal auditors pointed out last year, that defeats
the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sweeten the pot with big trees to entice the big timber
corporations,'' says Pat Rasmussen of Leavenworth Audubon Adopt A
Forest, who has challenged plans for several timber cuts around
Wenatchee.
</P>
<P>
   In a backcountry area call Devil's Gulch, Rasmussen says, she
took the Forest Service plans and hiked up to the area to be
``thinned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where they had circled to do `thinning' was more of these
clumps with huge ponderosa pine trees,'' she recalls. ``We put up a
big fight... They were planning to take a whole bunch of really big
trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service spokesman Al Matecko said environmentalists
sometimes have been right on this count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dispute that,'' he said. ``That has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, fire ecologists say, some ``zero-cut'' groups
have challenged timber sales that, on balance, would have proved
helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Timber interests, for their part, would like to get more work in
the woods. The problem: Many or even most of the trees that need to
be removed to end catastrophic wildfires have little or no
commercial value. They argue for more thinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake we made wasn't to suppress fire,'' said Chris West
of the Northwest Forestry Association. ``But because we were
removing fire from the ecosystem, we needed to do a better job at
removing the fuel loads.''
</P>
<P>
   James Agee, a University of Washington researcher and leading
fire ecologist, says both the timber industry and environmentalists
share some of the blame for today's mess.
</P>
<P>
   For environmentalists, ``It's a simple message and it's been
very successful in fundraising _ demonize the timber industry,''
Agee said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in surveying loggers' work, ``I've seen what
they call `forest health' cuts that did not do what they were
supposed to... (creating) land that, after they got done with it,
looked worse than before from a fire standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   All involved agree that before the Forest Service can do this
job, it will have to win back public trust.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help any when the prescribed fire near Los Alamos
swirled out of control in the spring, grabbing national headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Now the issue is heating up politically. Presidential candidate
George W. Bush, House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republicans
have accused the Clinton administration of failing to allow enough
logging.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials respond that the crisis comes
from decades of mismanagement. It will take decades of bipartisan
effort to fix, they say.
</P>
<P>
   And environmentalists point out that the vast majority of this
year's fires happened in areas that were previously logged, not in
pristine backcountry wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the mid-1980s, national forests' plans were
geared mostly to satisfy timber companies by allowing them to take
big logs, said Bob Freimark, northwest director of The Wilderness
Society and a trained forester.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not rocket science. They wanted the big trees and they
wanted a higher level of them,'' he said. ``They were continuing
the strategy that got us into the situation where we are today.''
</P>
<P>
   Even under the current schedule for making forests safer, 10
million acres will remain at high risk of fire by 2015, the General
Accounting Office projected last year.
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators quoted fire ecologists' warnings from the
early 1990s that there was a window of only 10 to 25 years left
before ``widespread, long-term damage from such fires occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Senate has included $240 million in next year's
proposed budget, up from $70 million this year. And after President
Clinton's visit to see fires in Idaho earlier this month, his
administration started work on a new package that is bound to ask
for even more.
</P>
<P>
   Doing nothing also would prove expensive. In just eight years,
firefighting costs increased from average of $134 million a year in
1986 to $335 million a year in 1994. As of Tuesday, officials
reported they were spending about $16 million a day on firefighting
costs.
</P>
<P>
   It was only three decades after the Forest Service instituted
its no-burn policy that some foresters began questioning its
wisdom, said the UW's Agee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known about this for 60 years,'' he said, ``but it's
taken essentially 60 years of watching that old policy fall apart
to recognize that we went the wrong way.''

SO HOW BAD WERE METS? EVEN BELL GOT TO PITCH
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The first pitch came in at 47 mph, looping like a
rainbow, and Joe Vitiello let it go by. This was a pitcher he had
never seen before _ nobody in professional baseball ever had _ and
there was no scouting report.
</P>
<P>
   The next pitch came in at 78, also for a ball, and then Vitiello
looked at a strike. With a 3-1 count, he could not resist a 79-mph
heater, pulling it down the left field line, just foul. Finally,
ball four came in at 66 mph. Say this for Derek Bell, the Mets'
mop-up man in a 16-1 loss to the San Diego Padres: He knows how to
change speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Bell allowed five runs in the bottom of the eighth inning,
although one of them was unearned, coming when catcher Todd Pratt
dropped a pop-up. When Vitiello popped up to end the inning, Bell
lifted his cap to the Qualcomm Stadium fans, who saluted him. It
was absurd, and appropriate for a crazy day at the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, an outfielder, became only the third position player ever
to pitch for the Mets. As bad as his inning was _ five runs, three
hits, three walks _ Pat Mahomes had two that were worse. Bell
needed 36 pitches to get through the eighth; Mahomes needed 34 in
allowing five runs in the second, and 43 in giving up five more in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza had the day off, and Bell _
another starter _ was also supposed to. The game became a lost
cause early.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the fourth inning, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine
started pulling the starters who did crack the lineup. Robin
Ventura and Mike Bordick hit the bench. The Padres just hit,
period. San Diego, last in the National League West, has won six of
eight games this year against the wild card-leading Mets.
</P>
<P>
   No Mets starter in three years had allowed 10 runs in a start,
but Mahomes did Tuesday, and his performance spiraled out of
control in a hurry. With two outs and two runners on in the second,
Mahomes walked catcher Wiki Gonzalez to bring up the pitcher, the
rookie Adam Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   But Eaton is a good hitter, the only pitcher in the National
League with 30 at-bats and a .300 average, and he fouled off two
pitches with a 2-2 count. Mahomes lost the battle, walking Eaton to
force in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Dave Wallace came to the mound. Mahomes threw a
high fastball to Damian Jackson. Jackson pounded it into the
left-field bleachers for a grand slam. Padres 5, Mets 0, and more
to come.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, after Bordick had singled home a Mets run, Mahomes
walked leadoff man Ryan Klesko. The next batter, Phil Nevin,
launched a pitch into the second deck at Qualcomm Stadium, a perch
reached only by Mark McGwire this season and by just 14 Padres in
the stadium's 32-year history.
</P>
<P>
   One batter later, John Mabry whacked a ball into the second deck
in right field, the first hit to land there in the four years since
that deck was built. It was 8-1, and Mahomes still had a few
extra-base hits to allow. Ruben Rivera, Gonzalez and Eaton, the
pitcher, doubled in succession to bring in two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes allowed 10 runs on seven hits, walking five in four
innings; he has 57 walks in 80 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton, who left his start last Thursday with a stress
fracture in his right ribs, threw on flat ground Tuesday and will
do so again on Wednesday. He will throw a bullpen session on
Friday, and while the Mets have no plans to put him on the disabled
list, General Manager Steve Phillips said, they also are not sure
when he will start again. In the meantime, the Mets' bullpen will
be thin.
</P>
<P>
   After Mahomes left, Turk Wendell pitched the fifth, John Franco
the sixth and Armando Benitez the seventh. The two remaining
relievers _ Rick White, who was used as a pinch-hitter, and Dennis
Cook, who had worked two innings in losing Monday's game _ were
unavailable. The Mets were out of pitchers, and Bell started
warming in the right field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Bell pitched in the final game of the Little League World Series
for his Tampa, Fla., team, but he had never pitched in professional
baseball. Only three times in their history had the Mets used a
position player as a pitcher: Last season, on July 2 and Aug. 8,
when Matt Franco pitched against Atlanta and Los Angeles, and on
Sept. 26, 1992, when Bill Pecota pitched against Pittsburgh.

   ON THE SCREEN: Generic black-and-white film of police officers
in helmets using night sticks to beat demonstrators protesting the
Vietnam War in 1969. Several photographs of Gore in his Army
uniform, one with him sitting respectfully at his father's knee.
The music swells. Black-and-white picture of Gore taken when he
first ran for Congress, pointing to a detailed but indecipherable
chart. As the narrator talks of Gore's support for the war in the
Gulf War, the film bursts into color and action, with camouflaged
soldiers marching, Gore speaking to groups of people, hugging an
older woman and reading a book called ``Pond Life'' with children.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: Narrator: ``1969. America in turmoil. Al Gore
graduates college. His father, a U.S. senator, opposes the Vietnam
War. Al Gore has his doubts, but enlists in the Army. When he comes
home from Vietnam, the last thing he thinks he'll ever do is enter
politics. He starts a family with Tipper, becomes an investigative
reporter. Then Al Gore decided that to change what was wrong in
America, he had to fight for what was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran for Congress. Held some of the first hearings on
cleaning up toxic waste. Made the environment his cause. Broke with
his own party to support the Gulf War. Fought to reform welfare
with work requirements and time limits. His fight now is to ensure
that prosperity enriches all our families, not just the few.
Strengthen Social Security. Take on big drug companies to guarantee
prescription drugs for seniors. Hold schools accountable for
results. Tax cuts for working families and the middle class. Al
Gore. Married 30 years. Father of four. Fighting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: This is essentially a promotional biography. It casts
Gore's life decisions _ to enlist in the Army, for example _ in the
most positive light. One of the few assertions that the Bush
campaign challenges is the claim that Gore ``fought to reform
welfare with work requirements and time limits,'' saying that he
stood on the sidelines. Gore was not a major player in drafting the
plan offered by President Clinton or in the long debate, but he
became one by the end. When the Republicans sent Clinton a bill in
July 1996, Clinton held a cabinet meeting, during which some
officials voiced their opposition. Gore strongly urged Clinton to
sign the bill, which the president did.
</P>
<P>
   SCORE CARD: This feel-good film is an appeal to conservative
Democrats in swing states. It emphasizes Gore's parting with the
left wing of his party on important matters, from the Vietnam War
to welfare reform, and casts him as a ``fighter.'' The first image
sets him apart from the protests of the 1960s. And although the
narrator states that Gore had qualms about the war, the numerous
pictures of him in uniform, and the emphasis on his enlistment and
his support for the Gulf War send the message that he not only
supports the military but has a record of active duty in contrast
to Bush's part-time service in the Texas Air National Guard. The
commercial is an expanded version of a biographical film that Gore
ran earlier this year during the primaries, a reflection that Gore
still wants to convey his human side to voters. It also
encapsulates the positions he laid out in his acceptance speech at
the Democratic convention last week. As the first commercial of the
fall campaign, it sets an important marker for its positive tone
and the attempt to build on the perceived highlights of the
convention speech.

WHO WILL BE REALITY SHOW'S SOLE SURVIVOR?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the night we get our lives back.
</P>
<P>
   That's an exaggeration, of course _ it only seems like
``Survivor,'' CBS' phenomenally popular ``reality'' game show, has
dominated our lives since its May 31 debut on CBS. Really, most
people have lost only 12 hours _ less, if they taped the show and
fast-forwarded through the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But the show reaches its two-hour finale Wednesday night, and an
hourlong reunion of the 16 ``Survivor'' contestants follows, as CBS
devotes its entire prime-time lineup to the show of the summer.
This is when the show provides, to paraphrase another game show,
its final answer to the question: Who outplayed, outwitted and
outlasted the other contestants and scored a million bucks?
</P>
<P>
   Many of you may say the show never affected you at all _ that
you never watched it, and probably never will. Still, you couldn't
avoid it _ the players are on magazine covers, they're on talk
shows, they're making TV deals, they're considering offers to pose
for ``Playboy,'' they're making headlines when they get in trouble
with the law _ they're doing everything but bugging you during
dinner with telemarketing calls.
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations imitate the show, and their morning jocks yak
about it the next day. Web sites celebrate the show or denigrate
it, going as far as trying to spoil the ending. TV critics either
sing the show's praises or trash it as junk. Pundits pontificate
about voyeurism, reality TV and their own superiority to those of
us who have been suckered in. TV producers scramble to recapture
the show's magic, in shows like CBS' own ``Big Brother'' and NBC's
upcoming ``Chains of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals protests the show's
rat-eating scenes, advertisers drop $300,000 for a 30-second spot
on the show _ and $600,000 for a spot on the finale, which is
expected to earn CBS $35 million, according to ``Advertising Age.''
And the Nielsen rating service apparently has to reset its dials
every week, as the show averaged nearly 29 million viewers during
last week's episode. The other five networks combined drew only
20.7 million, according to Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   So for the holdouts who haven't jumped on the bandwagon, it's
time to break down and watch the final episode, like some people
only watch the World Series or the Super Bowl. And yet football and
baseball are easier to understand the first time around than
``Survivor,'' and they don't require the cumulative effect that
``Survivor'' needs to draw you in. Watch one episode of
``Survivor,'' and you're embarrassed; watch it over and over, and
you begin to root for certain people and decide which ones are
worms. And if the responses to our ``Survivor'' polls have been any
indication, everyone has picked a different worm.
</P>
<P>
   So let's go over this again, quickly, for the uninitiated. Back
in March, the show's producers dumped 16 people on an island in the
South China Sea, where they were to spend up to 39 days. During a
series of ``immunity challenges'' _ elaborate games of physical and
mental endurance _ and tribal councils, one contestant was voted
off the island every week (the series, based on a Swedish game
show, compressed three days of island living into every episode).
</P>
<P>
   And through the votes, we got to know the players on a
first-name basis. The first two episodes provided the ouster of
Sonja and B.B., both gone in a youthful rebellion against people
over 60; Ramona, who encountered illness, was ejected; competitive
women named Stacey, Gretchen, Jenna and the deceptively sweet
Colleen got bounced; Male contestant Gervase, charming but often
accused of laziness, was removed, along with the eccentric Greg,
the goofy Sean, sexist Joel and religious Dirk.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves four people who _ let's be honest here _ aren't very
nice. Or at least that's the way the show portrays them; former
players have often said that the show was edited to show only their
bad sides. But the four remaining players are Kelly, a duplicitous
23-year-old river guide; Susan, an abrasive 39-year-old truck
driver; Rudy, a grumpy 72-year-old retired Navy SEAL; and the most
Machiavellian of them all, Richard, a scheming 39-year-old
corporate trainer who has become the Survivor whom viewers most
love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the final four face two more immunity
challenges and three tribal councils. During the final tribal
council, the last two ``survivors'' remaining will plead their
cases to a jury made up of the past seven people voted off the
island _ including Wednesday night's two evictees. The jury has
been growing during the most recent episodes, and frankly, they
look a little ticked off.
</P>
<P>
   The winner gets the million bucks, and we get our lives back _
at least until January, when ``Survivor II'' plops another group of
contestants in the Australian Outback. Whether CBS can repeat the
initial ``Survivor's'' success is doubtful _ it resulted from one
of those happy collisions of an empty summer-TV landscape, a unique
premise and a more-charismatic-than-expected ``cast.'' But after
Wednesday night, many of us can say that we survived ``Survivor.''

AMERITRADE TAKEOVER RUMORS, POSSIBLY BY AMERICAN EXPRESS, FUEL
SPIKE IN SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer is supposed to be the slow season in the online brokerage
business, but this one has not been quiet in Omaha, Neb., the home
of Ameritrade Holding Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade, the fifth-largest online brokerage firm, was
contending with a deep slump in its stock price when its new chief
executive, Thomas Lewis, abruptly resigned two weeks ago. Since
then, Ameritrade's stock has been driven up by speculation that the
company will be acquired. That rise accelerated Tuesday, fueled by
a rumor that American Express Co. might buy Ameritrade.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, shares of Ameritrade rose 20 percent, to more
than $19, on the Nasdaq stock market. But without any sign of a
buyout, they dropped back to close at $17.06, up $1.13, or 7
percent, in the heaviest volume in five months.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for American Express and Ameritrade declined to
comment on the speculation, although Dow Jones Newswires reported
that an Ameritrade spokesman had said that the company was not for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were skeptical about the likelihood of an imminent
buyout by American Express, but several have said that they
consider Ameritrade a takeover target, especially in the wake of
Lewis' departure. The company has said little about the
resignation, except to describe the reason for it as personal. J.
Joe Ricketts, the company's founder and chairman, is acting as
chief executive while the company searches for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Appleby, an analyst at Robertson Stephens, said he
considered American Express a possible buyer because it had shown
interest in an another online brokerage, ETrade Group. Neither
American Express nor ETrade would comment on whether they had
discussed a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby said he expected Ameritrade to earn about 85 cents a
share next year. The company's stock is trading at 20 times that
estimate and Appleby said American Express could pay as much as 30
times earnings in a stock-for-stock acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   But Appleby said he did not see American Express, a
premium-brand company better known for its charge cards than its
brokerage operation, as an ideal match for Ameritrade, which
heavily advertises its trading commissions, which are as low as $8.
``I would prefer to see consolidation within the industry, rather
than from outside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What American Express and Ameritrade do share is a willingness
to give away stock trades to attract customers. Late last year,
American Express began offering free online stock purchases for
people who keep at least $25,000 in an account. Earlier this year,
Ameritrade quietly matched that offer by creating a separate,
pure-electronic brokerage firm called Freetrade, which does not
charge commissions on some online trades. Both companies are also
running investing contests on their Web sites this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those similarities, some analysts said they thought
Ameritrade was a better fit for a bank or brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm of the opinion that three to five years from now, most
banks, if not all banks, will have some sort of online brokerage
capability,'' said Matthew Vetto, an analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``If you're looking for critical mass in a pure-play
broker,'' he said, Ameritrade is the most attractive choice.

CHARLES PIERCE, 78, LILCO CHIEF WHO CHAMPIONED SHOREHAM NUCLEAR
PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles R. Pierce, a former chairman of Long Island Lighting Co.
who championed the disputed Shoreham nuclear power plant only to
see the project upend his 34-year association with the company,
died Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   He was 78 and lived at Lloyd Harbor, near Huntington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A precise cause of death has not been determined, according to
Peter Connell, the director of the Connell Funeral Home, which is
handling the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as a bomber pilot in World War II, Pierce obtained
a law degree from Columbia University and in 1949 joined Lilco as a
young recruit in the utility company's legal division. He steadily
rose through the ranks and was named president and a director in
1974. Four years later, he was selected chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Pierce earned a reputation for smoothing the way
for power plants that local residents did not want in their
backyards. But it was the Shoreham project that rapidly became most
associated with Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   The project, in Shoreham, 55 miles east of Manhattan on the
North Shore, had been undertaken before Pierce even rose to the
level of president. It was originally scheduled to begin operation
in 1978, at a cost of $77 million, but delays and numerous cost
overruns plagued the project.
</P>
<P>
   By 1982, with resistance to the project growing, Pierce took to
the airwaves with a series of strongly worded radio commercials in
favor of Shoreham. The advertisements lasted almost two years and
brought Pierce widespread public recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the project and its cost overruns, Pierce had long
attributed Shoreham's problems to regulatory, construction and
financial requirements that he considered unnecessarily stringent,
as well as to design changes resulting from ``the lessons learned
from Three Mile Island.'' That was the site of a nuclear power
plant accident near Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's tough stance on the Shoreham controversy, which
included a refusal to compromise with critics of the project, began
to cause some Lilco directors discomfort. In 1984, Pierce and other
managers most identified with Shoreham resigned under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the magnitude of the Shoreham debacle became
clear. The plant never opened, yet the project lifted electric
rates, monopolized the talents of hundreds of engineers for more
than a decade and drained more than $5.5 billion from the economy.
And in the end, it destroyed Lilco, a company where failure was
long considered impossible. In May 1998, Long Island Lighting Co.
was dissolved after 87 years.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce is survived by his wife, Virginia; two daughters, Theresa
Kelly and Janet Duncan; and one son, Charles R. Jr.

A. REYNOLDS MORSE, 85, A DALI COLLECTOR
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Colo., Fla., Ohio, Mass.)  By ROBERTA SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A. Reynolds Morse, a wealthy businessman and collector whose
passion for the work of Salvador Dali resulted in the founding of a
popular small museum, died on Aug. 15 at a nursing home in
Seminole, Fla. He was 85 and lived in St. Petersburg, Fla., where
he and his wife, Eleanor Reese Morse, with help from the state,
founded the Salvador Dali Museum in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Morse was born in Denver in 1914 and graduated from the
University of Colorado in Boulder with a degree in geology. He
received a master's degree from the Harvard Business School in
1939.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1941, while working for the Reed Prentice Corp., makers
of plastic injection molding machines in Worcester, Mass., Morse
was sent to Cleveland to set up a branch office. There he met
Eleanor Reese, the daughter of a Cleveland businessman. They first
saw Dali's work in a traveling Museum of Modern Art show in 1941
and were immediately drawn to it. When they married in 1943, they
bought their first Dali, ``Daddy Longlegs of the Evening _ Hope!''
(1940), as a wedding present to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year they had three more Dalis, all from the early 30s.
``We plunged instead of hedging,'' Morse said, ``and after a while
I was becoming known as the nut who was backing a dark horse. Or
vice versa.'' They embarked on a sometimes turbulent friendship
with Dali and his wife, Gala.
</P>
<P>
   The Morses said they bought only works that they were in love
with, even when Dali himself advised them to get others. They
amassed nearly 100 paintings and more than 1,000 drawings,
watercolors, prints and objects, as well as film and designs for
clothing, furniture and ballet sets. Their holdings include not
only numerous paintings from the late 1920s and early 30s, widely
considered Dali's best period, but also examples of his precocious
early work and epic late paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Morse published seven books on Dali, who died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   By 1971, the collection had outgrown the Morses' modest
farmhouse outside Cleveland, and they opened a Dali museum in a
wing of the Injection Molders Supply Co., which they had founded in
1949 in Beachwood, Ohio. By the mid-70s, again cramped for space
and fearful that estate taxes would force the dispersal of the
collection, they began to search for a permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   Museums were put off by the restriction that the collection be
kept intact. In 1980 the Morses gave the collection to the city of
St. Petersburg and the state raised and spent $2 million to
renovate the marine equipment warehouse that Morse selected over
more impressive structures.
</P>
<P>
   The museum opened in 1982, and attendance since then has
quadrupled, to about 225,000 visitors in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Morse is survived by his son, Brad, of
Chagrin Falls, Ohio, and two grandsons.

NEW JERSEY OFFICIALS TO REVIEW 4TH-GRADE TEST  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey officials released a new round of standardized test
scores Tuesday for public school students in the fourth- and
eighth-grades, but would not disclose the results for fourth-grade
language arts literacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the writing section of the test, students' scores were so low
that the state Education Department's Language Arts Literacy
Assessment Committee will review the test scores and the grading.
</P>
<P>
   In the language arts test as a whole, students appeared to be
able to read and comprehend the material and answer multiple-choice
questions, said David C. Hespe, the state's education commissioner.
But in the writing portion, where students could score from zero to
four points, almost 75 percent scored one point or less on several
items, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few students received a score of three or four on a scale of
zero to four,'' Hespe said. ``This is not what we expected this
year, and it signals a potential problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The test, known as the Elementary School Proficiency Assessment,
was taken by 80,000 fourth-graders during the 1999-2000 school
year.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and administrators have criticized the test, saying it
is too long and its instructions are not always clear.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers have also expressed concern about the grading of
the tests. The writing portion is scored by Measurement Inc. of
Durham, N.C., whose employees are college graduates but are not
required to have a teaching background.
</P>
<P>
   The department plans to release the language arts scores, with
modifications if necessary, in September.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-grade science scores did not change significantly
from the previous year, with 57.3 students ranked as proficient,
32.3 ranked as advanced proficient and 10.4 percent as partly
proficient, the lowest category. Fourth-grade students improved in
math, with 49.6 percent in the proficient category in the 1999-2000
school year, compared with 47.5 percent in the previous year.
Students in the advanced proficient category rose from 18.2 percent
in 1999 to 21.7 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 75,000 eighth-graders in public schools scored well
in science and language arts, with more than 80 percent scoring in
the proficient or advanced proficient categories. In math, 67.3
percent demonstrated proficiency, scoring in the proficient or
advanced proficient categories, compared with 68.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A complete district-by-district breakdown of the scores will be
released in December.

MINOR QUAKE GIVES NEW YORK TOWN MAJOR SCARE, BUT NO DAMAGE  
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL, N.Y. _ The dogs knew it was coming.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the night, Michael McDonough's three Maltese
terriers began barking frantically. McDonough, who had been sound
asleep in bed, rolled over and looked at the clock, which said
1:45. And that is when it hit _ an earthquake in the suburbs north
of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like thunder, but not quite thunder,'' McDonough said.
``I woke up, looked at the clock, and heard that noise like a bang,
a big, loud bang or a rumble and then a little rumble after that,
and you could feel the house shaking and the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   For miles around Putnam County and across the state line in
Fairfield County, Conn., Tuesday morning's tiny earthquake _ with a
preliminary magnitude of 2.5, according to the National Earthquake
Information Center _ jarred people with a few brief seconds of
terrifying sound and force.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of frightened people called 911, local police
departments or the county sheriff. But officials said Tuesday that
there were no injuries and no reports of damage. Many people
thought their boilers had exploded. Several said they had looked
out a window to see if a car had crashed into their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Buck, who works at the Carmel public library, was
awakened by the jolt. In the fuzziness of sleep, she said to
herself, ``If I didn't know better, I'd think this was an
earthquake.'' Her four daughters, also stirred out of bed, thought
someone was setting off fireworks at a farm down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing of it is, at that time of morning, everybody was
probably kind of asleep,'' said Waverly Person, a geophysicist at
the earthquake center. ``And waking people up, it was probably kind
of frightening, even thought it was what we call a really minor
earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Minor earthquakes are from 3.0 to 3.9,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes are unusual in the New York area, large quakes even
rarer. But numerous small earthquakes have occurred over the years,
including one in 1985 that was 4.0 on the Richter scale, a
measurement of magnitude no longer widely used by seismologists.
Several people who remembered that earthquake said that this one
did not even come close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that one,'' said Schweitzer. ``I lived in an
apartment building in Mount Vernon. My dresser danced across my
bedroom in that one. That was scary.''
</P>
<P>
   This quake has been the talk of Carmel, a town of more than
31,000 people that is the Putnam County seat, and of neighboring
towns like Kent and Patterson. The shock was even felt in Danbury,
Conn., about 15 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a big topic of conversation,'' said Eric Schweitzer,
the night manager of the Carmel Diner Restaurant downtown. ``I went
to the supermarket. Everybody was talking about it.''

GALAXY LOOKS FOR BIG-GAME VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There is a pattern developing over the years that
has Los Angeles Galaxy defender Paul Caligiuri concerned.
</P>
<P>
   His team's resume includes two MLS title-game losses and a
setback in the U.S. Open Cup quarterfinals last season.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Galaxy had a chance to draw closer to Western
Division-leading Kansas City at the Rose Bowl but allowed the
Wizards to escape with a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
   Against Chicago on Saturday, the Galaxy had a chance to
strengthen its grip in the MLS playoff race, but the Fire walked
away with a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight at Cal State Fullerton, the Galaxy will meet Chicago for
the second time in five days, this time in the U.S. Open Cup
semifinals. Another big loss in a big game is something the Galaxy
needs to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows we've never won a championship, but we get so
close,'' Caligiuri said. ``Again this season, we've shown signs of
not winning the big games when we have had the opportunity. Our
last two against K.C. and Chicago is just another example.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Galaxy wins tonight, it will advance to the U.S. Open Cup
final Oct. 22 against either New York/New Jersey or Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big test,'' Caligiuri continued. ``We want to use
this U.S. Open Cup to change our fans' minds and our minds that we
can win big games and ultimately a championship.''

NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR LIMITS AID TO NEWARK ARENA TO $75 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Story is also moving on sports wire.)

<P>
   NEWARK _ The long-awaited bargaining over state aid for a new
sports arena here has begun in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gov. Christie Whitman said Tuesday that state and other
taxpayer assistance should not exceed $75 million. That figure is
well below the $123 million in state aid that the YankeeNets, owner
of the New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils, has said in recent
weeks is the minimum needed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the teams' owners have said they would also need
$25 million in aid from the city to relocate from the state-owned
Continental Arena at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The $325 million arena for the two teams is to be built in
downtown Newark; officials hope it will impell the city's
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the Whitman administration's view on the limits of
public contributions, Mike Torpey, her chief of staff, said in a
letter to the YankeeNets owners that any contributions from city
and county government would result in an equal reduction in other
state aid to those municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   But what many characterized in private as a tough opening stand
by the governor, was nevertheless viewed with gratitude in public
by the Newark, Essex County and YankeeNets officials who support
the arena proposal; they applauded it as a first sign of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a step in the right direction, and the right direction
for us is Newark,'' said Harvey Schiller, the chairman and chief
executive of YankeeNets.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe James, the mayor of Newark, said the governor had taken
``a leadership role in keeping professional sports in New Jersey,''
and James Treffinger, the Essex County executive, called Torpey's
letter ``a very positive first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Torpey, in an interview, said the letter set ``the parameters of
further negotiations,'' although he cautioned that the $75 million
in assistance alone was likely to run into trouble in the
Legislature, which he characterized as not eager to support
professional sports complexes in Newark or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was released on the day that the YankeeNets completed
the $176 million purchase of the National Hockey League's New
Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   One of the intentions of the letter from Torpey, said other
officials familiar with the politics of the arena negotiations, was
to serve notice to the YankeeNets that they should not try to use
local elected officials to help wring more money out of taxpayers,
and to confine their negotiations to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Since the New Jersey Nets were acquired three years ago by a
group led by Raymond Chambers the group has hoped to help
revitalize Newark by relocating there. But Whitman had said that
the state would not contribute anything unless the arena had two
sports teams to make it economically viable, a condition that was
met with the acquisition of the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to the YankeeNets, Torpey held out yet another
opportunity to the two teams to remain at the Meadowlands arena,
saying that the teams could be housed in a new arena there for less
money: $250 million that would include the same $75 million in
state assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no harm in us keeping the alternative of the
Meadowlands on the table,'' he said in an interview. ``But
ultimately they have made it clear that it is their desire to go to
Newark.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Texas touts increase in insured children
 &HT;    Critics say state still has a long way to go
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By POLLY ROSS HUGHES
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Texas leads the nation in uninsured children, but a
children's health official told lawmakers Tuesday that it is
catching up faster than other states.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 80,000 children _ 17 percent of those eligible in the
state _ have enrolled during the first five months of the
Children's Health Insurance Program, state CHIP director Jason
Cooke told the Texas House Appropriations subcommittee on health
and human services. Of those, 12,500 were from Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   ``After five months, that compares very favorably with other
states,'' Cooke said, ``both in terms of where they were after five
months and in terms of how many months it took them to get to where
we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with nearly 1.4 million uninsured children in Texas, the
state has much further to go, two Houston Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   Census data released in March shows 25.4 percent of the children
in Texas are uninsured compared with 15.4 percent for the nation
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we've actually lost the most ground was kids who were
covered by Medicaid,'' said Eva de Luna, analyst at the
Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Medicaid rolls for children have fallen mostly because the
family lost some other kind of public assistance and they thought
that meant Medicaid as well,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, a member of the committee, said
``extreme barriers'' make it hard for families who erroneously fell
off the Medicaid rolls to restart the insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike CHIP, which requires filling out an application and
mailing it in, the poorer families eligible for Medicaid must make
appointments for face-to-face meetings every six months and prove
they don't own a car or have other assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've accomplished our goal until we've enrolled
people who are eligible for Medicaid, which is the lower income
group,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 600,000 children in Texas eligible for Medicaid but
not enrolled in it. The state has enrolled only 2,000 of them
during the last five months, Cooke said.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP is for children of the working poor who do not qualify for
Medicaid. Texas lawmakers in 1999 passed CHIP legislation to cover
children in families that earn up to 200 percent of the federal
poverty level. That's $33,600 for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Participating states share the cost of the Children's Health
Insurance Program with the federal government. Texas is using
proceeds from its settlement with the tobacco industry to pay its
share of the program costs.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston on Tuesday, state Sen. Rodney Ellis joined Republican
Harris County Judge Robert Eckels to unveil 400 billboards
promoting CHIP. Ellis said he believes Texas should &UR;  &LR; use its own
funds to increase coverage for children of the working poor who are
not yet eligible for CHIP.
</P>
<P>
   Of the state's 1.4 million uninsured children, about 300,000 are
not covered by either Medicaid or CHIP because their families earn
more than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, state officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to join about 10 other states around the
country to do better than that,'' Ellis said. ``In Texas, because
we have the youngest population of the 50 states, it's incumbent
upon us during the best of times to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooke told lawmakers, however, that the state is making
considerable progress in drawing uninsured children into the
program.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas has 17 percent enrolled in CHIP after five months,
California had 7 percent, Florida 8 percent and Michigan less than
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile it took California more than twice as long _ 11 months
_ to reach 17 percent of its goal and Florida reached that
percentage after a full year, he added.

STRONG BULLPEN, PALMEIRO'S CLUTCH BLAST LIFT RANGERS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every once in a while, almost out of the blue, the
Texas Rangers put together one of those games that provide, as
Diana Ross used to sing, reflections of the way life used to be.
</P>
<P>
   They'll get a well-pitched game from their starter, a flash or
two of great defense, a clutch hit from one of their big hitters
and, perhaps most importantly, their once dominant relievers will
come in and shut down the other team.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got a little bit of all that Tuesday night,
combining it into a 5-4 victory against the New York Yankees at
Yankee Stadium. The victory was only the Rangers' second against
the Yankees this year, but it gave them a reminder of that almost
forgotten feeling of a pennant race and playoff pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we haven't played well all year, but this isn't like
we're running a high school team out there,'' reliever John
Wetteland said. ``We all know what to do. It's a matter of putting
things together. Tonight we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Rafael Palmeiro broke a 4-4 tie with an
eighth-inning home run off Yankees starter Denny Neagle, and
Wetteland closed it out with a 1-2-3 ninth inning. That finished
off 21/3 scoreless innings from the bullpen that started with Tim
Crabtree blowing away Derek Jeter with a full-count fastball with
the bases loaded, two outs and the game tied in the seventh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the key right there,'' Palmeiro said. ``That's the game
right there. If he gets a walk or a hit, we lose that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree, coming with nothing but fastballs, got behind 3-1 in
the count before coming back and striking Jeter out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some pretty good battles in the past,'' Crabtree
said. ``That was one of those moments that reflected back to the
last couple of years to being in the playoffs against them. You've
got the game on the line and the stands are really loud. It was a
real exciting atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   One the Rangers once knew but only rarely to get to feel again.
Usually it's on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to (trainer) Danny Wheat about that before the
game,'' Wetteland said. ``I've never pitched for myself and I've
never really thought about personal stats and numbers. But
career-wise, August and September are usually my best months, but
that's usually because of the pennant race. It's an intangible you
can't reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   This night appeared to belong to Rick Helling, who gave up a
leadoff double to Luis Polonia in the first, then retired 17
consecutive hitters. Armed with a 4-0 lead, Helling looked
unbeatable. But Polonia got him with a two-out home run in the
sixth, then Jeter walked and Paul O'Neill ripped a two-run shot to
make it a 4-3 lead. Doubles by Tino Martinez and Luis Sojo in the
seventh tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty close to as good as I can pitch for 52/3
innings,'' said Helling, who was helped by some excellent defense
from third baseman Mike Lamb and shortstop Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree helped out Helling by striking out Jeter, and then
Palmeiro put the Rangers ahead leading off the eighth with his 32nd
home run of the year. Palmeiro also had two singles and is 6-for-12
in his past three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he may be getting into a groove where he really
gets hot,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a few spurts, but they've lasted short,'' Palmeiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers know the feeling. Glimpses of the past usually don't
last long. nn

CHINESE EXPATRIATES GIVE U.S. MEDAL HOPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former President Richard Nixon mixed table tennis
and politics with his famous ``Pingpong Diplomacy'' tour to China
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But first things first, let's differentiate between pingpong and
table tennis. Better yet, let U.S. Olympic team member David Zhuang
explain it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pingpong is a game, table tennis is a sport,'' said Zhuang,
who represented the U.S. at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and is headed
to the Sydney Games as one of America's top players.
</P>
<P>
   Pingpong is a tranquil way of spending an afternoon in the
garage with a friend or family member. Table tennis is a fast-paced
game of chops (backspin hitting), loops (topspin hitting) and
blocks (a defensive technique against topspin attacks).
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends say, `Oh, you play pingpong, I grew up playing
pingpong. I can beat you,' '' Zhuang said. ``But then they'll see
me playing at my club, and they realize that table tennis is a
whole different sport.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a sport that's been dominated by the Chinese since
table tennis made its Olympic debut at the 1988 Seoul Games. Of the
12 medals awarded since in men's and women's singles and doubles
since 1988, China has won nine golds.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the world has a long way to catch up, though the
world's No. 1 men's player, Vladimir Samsonov, is from Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. has never medaled in the Olympics, and its best hopes
for Sydney are with Chinese-born athletes who have become U.S.
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Representing China in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Gao Jun was a
silver medalist in doubles with her partner Chen Zihe.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1992 World Cup doubles tournament in Las Vegas, she met
an American citizen named Frank Chang. They fell in love and were
married in 1993. She was granted citizenship in 1997, but her
release from the Chinese Olympic Committee took more than two years
to be finalized, keeping her out of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult because I couldn't participate in so
many events,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gao became eligible to represent the U.S. shortly before the
1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and promptly won
gold in singles and helped the Americans to a team gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Now 31, Gao ended 1999 ranked 24th in the world, tops among U.S.
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gao could medal on the men's side,'' said U.S. men's
player Todd Sweeris.
</P>
<P>
   Gao has been a boon to USA Table Tennis. She has worked with
younger players to help the U.S. develop a stronger program.
</P>
<P>
   Now she seeks another Olympic medal representing her new
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard (watching the Atlanta Games on television),''
Gao said. ``I kept hoping and hoping until I was there. Now, I can
go to Sydney. I'm very happy.''

   NEW YORK _ The city's new Coney Island stadium for a
minor-league Mets franchise will cost up to $8 million more than
previous estimates, and the project continues to provoke bitter
sniping between its biggest booster, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and
its most vocal opponent, Howard Golden, the Brooklyn borough
president.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremonial groundbreaking Tuesday on Surf Avenue, where
construction of the 6,500-seat ballpark is well under way in the
shadow of Coney Island's storied parachute drop, Giuliani said the
city would spend as much as $39 million on the project _ more than
25 percent above its previous budget of $31 million.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani defended the additional cost, saying it was necessary
to ensure completion by the scheduled opening day in June. That
deadline, a year earlier than previously set by the city, means the
Coney Island stadium, like a counterpart on Staten Island, will be
completed before the mayor leaves office at the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn stadium has been a longstanding matter of
contention between the mayor and Golden, who for years strenuously
promoted a grander sports and recreation complex for the site. And
Tuesday's ceremony brought them no closer together. Several top
City Hall aides and Guy Molinari, the Staten Island borough
president, joined Giuliani at the ceremony, but Golden was not
invited and did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that the city administration continues to
implement a sweetheart deal that offers little economic benefit to
Brooklyn, but is a windfall to professional baseball,'' Golden said
in a statement released immediately after the event. ``Taxpayers
deserve more for this huge public investment than an outrageous
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coney Island and Staten Island minor-league ballparks, which
are being paid for with more than $100 million in city money, have
been championed by the mayor to foster economic development in the
boroughs outside Manhattan. The Staten Island stadium, budgeted at
$71 million and under construction along the St. George shoreline,
just west of the Staten Island Ferry Terminal, is to be used by a
minor-league franchise of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Staten Island project will be the most expensive
minor-league ballpark in the country, it has caused little upset,
while the battle over the Brooklyn stadium has nettled Golden for
more than a year. He has also maintained that its price is too high
and that the caliber of baseball it will bring, with a Single-A
minor-league franchise, to the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, is
beneath the dignity of the borough.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Golden was not invited to the event, Giuliani angrily
replied: ``Why wasn't he here? Because he is against this project.
I can't imagine why.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of a 20-year lease between the city and the Mets,
the minor-league franchise will pay up to $520,000 a year, based on
attendance, for use of the stadium. While the current home of the
Mets' minor-league team in Queens sometimes draws fewer than 1,000
fans, the mayor said that he hoped a new stadium would attract
larger crowds, and that if the stadium were at least half full for
each game next year, he would be satisfied. In addition to lease
payments, the city would receive half the advertising revenues that
are generated by the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani also sought to dismiss the points raised by Golden
and other critics who say that the Coney Island project will
provide a windfall for the Mets. Giuliani insisted that it would
lead to sweeping economic development along the neighborhood's
tawdry beachfront and commercial blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ballpark will do for Coney Island what Disney did for
42nd Street,'' Giuliani said, referring to the investment by the
Walt Disney Co., backed by city tax incentives, in a Times Square
theater and store in the early 1990s. He said the city would prompt
further Coney Island development by paying for a Little League
field close to the new stadium, for repairs on the rusting
framework of the parachute drop, and for incentives to lure new
stores to the quarter-mile stretch of Surf Avenue between the
stadium site and the historic Nathan's hot dog emporium.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani declined to say which of those projects, if any,
would be completed before he left office.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Michael Carey, the president of the city's
Economic Development Corp., which is in charge of the stadium
projects, said that the cost of the Coney Island field had grown
because advancing its deadline meant bringing in more workers and
materials at a time when both are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   He said the city and the Mets had agreed to seek a corporate
sponsor for the stadium, embracing a model of corporate support
established by several professional sports organizations around the
nation as well as on Staten Island. Although no such sponsor has
been found, Carey said he expected a company to pay for the right
to include its name in that of the new Coney Island stadium, and
that the arrangement would probably yield as much income as the
$400,000 a year that the Richmond County Bank has agreed to pay to
have the field in St. George named the Richmond County Bank
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Carey also said that the city and the Mets would select a name
for the minor-league team from ideas submitted by the public.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One suggestion was made immediately Tuesday at the ceremony by
Joan Hodges, the widow of Gil Hodges, the former Brooklyn Dodger
first baseman and Mets manager. ``I respectfully submit the name of
Gil Hodges,'' said Hodges, whose presence was apparently intended
by City hall to evoke the splendor of professional baseball in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who followed Hodges to the microphone, was effusive in
his praise of her husband, who died in 1972, but stopped short of
seconding her nomination. Without referring to the naming process
of Coney Island's new club, he said that Gil Hodges ``truly
deserves to be in the Hall of Fame,'' an honor not yet bestowed.

STUDY SAYS WIVES' NAGGING GOOD FOR HUSBANDS' HEALTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wives, it's OK to nag. In fact, it may even be
good for a man.
</P>
<P>
   When a wife works too many hours to nag her husband about
wearing sun block, eating right and other healthful practices, his
health suffers, a new study released Tuesday says.
</P>
<P>
   That's because wives are more likely than husbands to remind
their spouses about keeping healthy habits and taking medications,
the survey concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Wolfson couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``She keeps me healthy,'' Wolfson said of Tobye, his wife of 55
years. ``Sometimes I feel nagged, but how else would I know she
loves me?''
</P>
<P>
   The retired grade-school teacher said his wife helps keep him
away from greasy steaks, and they stay active together by dancing,
walking and other exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But when a wife works more than 40 hours per week, she tends to
pay less attention to her husband, and his day-to-day health lags,
said University of Chicago sociology professor Ross Stolzenberg,
the study's lead researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw in the study was a fully institutionalized set of
gender attitudes and expectations that we learn from the time we're
children,'' Stolzenberg said. ``Men are taught that it is not
masculine to worry about health issues while women take on a
nurturing role.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on a three-year Americans Changing Lives
survey of 2,867 husbands and wives by the University of Michigan
and funded by the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Stolzenberg said that in cases in which wives worked a 40-hour
week, it did not have a negative impact on their spouses' health.
But anything more than 40 hours tended to reduce the husbands'
overall health by up to 25 percent over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   He speculated that was because society has become accustomed to
the 40-hour week and has developed a set of eating, sleeping and
exercise customs to adapt in a healthy way.
</P>
<P>
   But in the opposite situation, when the man works more than 40
hours per week, it generally had no negative effect on the wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be true,'' said Karina Ortiz, a 35-year-old office
worker. ``But I think people are just getting more healthy overall,
and it's more because just knowing someone cares about you that
makes you feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Jimmy, 38, said one example of how his wife keeps
him healthy is by encouraging him to call in sick and see a doctor
when he is sick, two things he would normally try to avoid if on
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``She urges me to do it,'' he said, ``otherwise I probably
wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Stolzenberg found in his study, husbands tend to be
socialized to not perform health and social-emotional monitoring
and management for anyone at all, not even themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys are taught to put themselves in harm's way by playing
games like football,'' Stolzenberg said. ``The games girls play are
often different and less violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Felt, who has been married to Dolly Arond for 21 years,
said he would not be as active if he were on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out together instead of just staying at home,'' he said.
``I mowed the lawn this morning because she reminded me to, where
if I were alone, I would probably just get a condo.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way wives keep their husbands healthy is by keeping them
out of bars and other single-life social activities, Arond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for me, he might go out drinking,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin White, a single 27-year-old contractor, said he already
takes good care of himself and doesn't believe getting married will
improve his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would really make a difference,'' he said.
``I work out and eat pretty good now, like a lot more people are
doing these days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sam Liberman a retired painter and bike shop owner who has
been married for 47 years, had the perspective of experience from
which to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, my wife has been nagging me since I met her,''
he said. ``But I know it's for my own good, and I'd probably miss
it if she ever stopped.''

L.A.'S MOST FAMOUS NEIGHBORHOOD GETS STAMP OF APPROVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood hasn't had a cancellation like this
since ``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States Postal Service is earning raves for giving
Tinseltown its own postmark, or rather, giving much of L.A. a
Hollywood postmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted. I've always felt that the most famous community
in the world should have its own postmark,'' said Johnny Grant,
honorary mayor of Hollywood. ``We haven't had one in about 52
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant expended a considerable amount of shoe leather trying to
convince the Postal Service, which is more fond of lumping places
together, to recognize the entertainment capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The marking, approved by the service's L.A. District Manager Al
Iniguez, will read, ``Los Angeles/Hollywood, CA'' with a cluster of
five stars and an overlay reading, ``Home of the Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite unique,'' said Larry Dozier, spokesman for the
Postal Service in Los Angeles. ``Many cities and neighborhoods have
requested their own postmark'' but residents of those places
usually have to be content with a postmark named after the big
sorting facility the mail goes to after it leaves their local post
office.
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando Valley mail usually is postmarked ``Santa
Clarita,'' the sorting facility where Valley mail is sent.
Residents of Beverly Hills, 90210, and most coastal communities get
a ``Marina del Rey'' postmark.
</P>
<P>
   But after Thursday's unveiling ceremony at the Roosevelt Hotel
on Hollywood Boulevard (``It's in Los Angeles,'' said a directory
assistance operator), mail from all ZIP codes beginning with 900
will get the new LA/Hollywood postmark. That, of course, will
include Hollywood's 90028 code, Dozier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious to us that the federal government and the U.S.
postmaster realize that Hollywood exists and it's leading the way
to cityhood,'' proclaimed Gene La Pietra, founder of the movement
to separate Hollywood from the city of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was pleased with the new postmark, he said it
wouldn't be enough to stop the secession movement.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp., said the new mark would help promote business
all over the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a cute thing. `Hollywood' definitely has some
zip.''

NEWEST MISS DEAF AMERICA HAS PASSION FOR PRINTED WORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To win the Miss Deaf America crown, Lauren Teruel
drew on her lifelong passion: reading.
</P>
<P>
   The California State University, Northridge, graduate won the
coveted crown from a field of 25 national competitors after
translating into American Sign Language a book from her childhood,
Shel Silverstein's ``The Giving Tree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My father used to read me a different story every night,'' she
said Tuesday through an interpreter. ``And I mean literally every
night. He'd sit down and sign it to me, making sure I understood.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the 22-year-old Teruel is scheduled to make her
first local appearance since winning the Miss Deaf America title
last month. She'll present ``The Giving Tree'' to children during
Sign Language Story Time at Borders Books and Music in Northridge,
not far from her alma mater in the suburban San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to serve as an example of how the hearing-impaired can
succeed in any situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show the older generation in the deaf community that
they're leaving things in good hands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Teruel graduated in May from CSUN with a degree in English. She
now works at the school's National Center on Deafness in a program
to improve post-secondary school education for the
hearing-impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Since the NCOD opened in 1962, CSUN has been a magnet for deaf
and hard-of-hearing students, drawn to its educational outreach for
the hearing-impaired. Through the work of NCOD, the university has
grown to be the pre-eminent mainstream institute of higher learning
in the country, offering services to nearly 300 students, according
to Nina Treiman, a counselor at NCOD.
</P>
<P>
   While studying there, Teruel made use of both a sign language
interpreter and a closed captioner, as well Internet chat rooms to
interact with her classmates.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning Miss Deaf America's vivacious personality leaves a
lasting impression on those who cross her path. Treiman remembers
fondly how Teruel stood out from the rest of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We draw some of the best and brightest students from all over
the country, and Lauren was definitely one of them,'' Treiman
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   While she was studying at CSUN, Teruel first became interested
in the pageant. She attended the National Association of the Deaf's
1998 conference as a member of CSUN's College Bowl team, and
watched another Northridge alumna, Amy Wong, win the crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admired a woman who could stand up in front of a crowd like
that with so much poise,'' Teruel said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she entered a preliminary competition, and won the
Miss Deaf Illinois title in her native Chicago. From there, she set
her sights on going all the way. To do so, she had to perfectly
polish herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women are judged across a broad spectrum of categories
including community service, academics, current events, knowledge
of deaf culture and more,'' said Jennifer Yost, youth programs

TAKING THE TEST NYC TEACHERS MUST TAKE _ AND PASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS figures in penultimate graf)

   It was pouring rain and I was seriously sleep-deprived the
morning I took the Liberal Arts and Sciences Test, New York state's
main certification exam for teachers. I had signed up for the
four-hour test on a whim, but when my alarm clock blared at 6:45
a.m. on July 15 _ a Saturday, no less _ I rued my bright idea.
</P>
<P>
   I was not looking to switch careers. As an education reporter
covering New York City schools, I had grown curious about the test,
which I had written about several times in my first year on the
beat. In one front-page story, I had reported that nearly a third
of the city's teachers had failed the certification exam at least
once. Yet several experienced teachers had told me the test was
ridiculously easy.
</P>
<P>
   I yearned for the truth. So on that rain-soaked morning, I
dragged myself to Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn to see
for myself. For the record, I had not taken a standardized test
since 1986, as a high school senior hoping to boost my College
Board scores.
</P>
<P>
   At Murrow, I waited in line behind hundreds of other New Yorkers
anxious to prove they were fit to teach. Some, I knew from my
reporting, had failed the test repeatedly yet were still working as
uncertified teachers, the kind the state is pressuring the city to
get rid of.
</P>
<P>
   But at least they came prepared. Everybody but me, it seemed,
had a fistful of sharpened No. 2 pencils. I had just one, which I
unearthed in a frantic search of my apartment the night before.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only way I was poorly prepared. While others
spent weeks poring over test prep manuals, I took a single practice
exam. The questions had rattled me. You needed to remember the five
pillars of Islam, understand osmosis and know whether barbed wire
was invented before the telephone, to name a few. The math was so
beyond me that I skipped five questions altogether; it harked back
to trigonometry class, which I had not thought about since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Arts and Sciences Test is the most general of three
exams that teacher candidates have to pass to get a state teaching
license. It supposedly measures your knowledge of basic math and
science, history and the arts and humanities. It also asks you to
read and answer questions about literary passages and newspaper
articles, makes sure your grammar is correct and tests your writing
skills with an essay assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. As it turned out, though, the real thing was
considerably less taxing than my practice test. The exam was
tedious and long, with 80 multiple-choice questions plus the essay,
and more than a little frustrating. I can't reveal the actual
questions, because the state asked me not to. But I will say that
some questions _ especially those that asked me to interpret works
of art or literary passages _ seemed to have more than one right
answer. On others, I was convinced that none of the supplied
answers was right.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the math was much more manageable than I expected.
You basically had to know how to multiply, divide, read graphs and
do simple algebra equations. Determining the original price of a
sale item given the rate of discount, for example. Or calculating
someone's wages based on a sales commission.
</P>
<P>
   I also breezed through the section testing communications
skills. Analyzing newspaper excerpts, weighing objectivity,
interpreting figurative language and identifying grammatical and
structural errors came easily. But by the time I got to the essay
section, I was thoroughly burned out and my pencil was worn to the
nub. Moreover, the assignment _ to opine on whether the rich should
be taxed at a higher rate than the poor _ made my eyes glaze over.
</P>
<P>
   I ignored the test booklet's instructions to carefully outline
my essay on scrap paper first. I just started writing, breathlessly
making the case for a higher tax rate as if I was dashing off a
newspaper article on a crushing deadline. Afterward I sped home for
a long nap, and put the rather dismal experience out of my head
until my scores arrived in the mail this week.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: I passed, with a scaled score of 284 out of a
possible 300. (You need at least a 220.) But on closer examination,
my results made little sense. I got a perfect score, 300, on the
science and math section _ bizarre, considering that I failed out
of pre-calculus in high school and never took another science
course after 10th-grade chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I am mortified to report that my worst score _ a 260
_ was on the essay.
</P>
<P>
   What all this says about the state certification exam, I'm not
sure. If my experience is any indication, it's not the best measure
of someone's academic strengths and weaknesses. And, as with all
standardized tests, your performance might depend more on your
state of mind the day you take it than on your intellectual
prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not a bad idea to make sure teachers can figure
percentages, form a scientific hypothesis, recognize symbolism in a
a short story and, yes, write a well-organized essay. If I were in
charge of the test, I'd probably make it a little tougher _ there's
just no excuse for someone like me to get a perfect score in math.
</P>
<P>
   But that could prove disastrous. Of the 4,315 people who took
the exam on July 15 in New York City, a whopping 59 percent failed,
according to the state. That compares with a 26 percent failure
rate for the 4,293 people who took the test elsewhere in the state.
Although it is not perfect, the exam seems a necessary gatekeeping
device for a profession whose purpose, after all, is imparting
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   I approve, and hope that I never have to take it again.
