<HEADLINE> Keegan Tells English Boys to Concentrate on Own Squad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- England coach Kevin Keegan warned
his boys on Thursday that they should focus on improving their own
squad instead of taking too much attention of what happened in the
German camp.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said in Spa, Belgium: "We've got to ignore everything
that's going on with them. If we cause them problems and there are
divisions it will work to our advantage then. They will only
become important factors if we do our job right.
</P>
<P>
"But it is not something we are thinking about and we certainly
won't be changing anything we do because of it."
</P>
<P>
Striker Oliver Bierhoff is set to miss the game because of
injury. At the same time, the 39-year-old Lothar Matthaeus caused
a stir in the camp when he asked German head coach Erich Ribbeck
to send him back home. Ribbeck refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said, "Germany offer us a different challenge to
Portugal but we have been working hard all week to prepare for it.
"
</P>
<P>
"We've learned lessons from the Portugal defeat and it's up to
us to go out there and put them into practice."
</P>
<P>
England will meet Germany in Group A in Charleroi on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Ties Turkey 0-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Sweden played to a 0-0 draw with
Turkey on Tursday and Italy qualified for the qurterfinals in the
Euro 2000 Group B match at the Philips Stadium, Eindhoven, the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The result also gave Turkey its first-ever point in a European
championship final. Italy have won both its matches, beating
Turkey 2-1 and Belgium 2-0.
</P>
<P>
The two teams who had lost their opening match maintained a
small chance of going through in Monday's final Group B game by
sloughing towards a draw.
</P>
<P>
In a dour physical game both sides fielded teams featuring
four changes but the newcomers - including striker Henrik Larsson
for Sweden - failed to make any impact.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, who lost its opening game 2-1 to Belgium, had most of
the possession but was unable to break down an uncompromising
Turkey defence which played without any frills.
</P>
<P>
Sweden immediately put pressure on Turkey and forced a good
chance in the 3rd minute. Off a short freekick, Kennet Andersson
curled a 25 meter (yard) shot around the wall and it took a good
save of Rustu Recber to deflect it in a corner.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later Suad Kaya, was giving a yellow card for
kicking the ball away.
</P>
<P>
In the 8th minute, Turkey had its first and only chance of the
opening half. Hakan Sukur drifted a cross into the penalty area
and instead of blasting the ball, Umit Davala tried to finesse it
with the inside foot and sent it flying over.
</P>
<P>
Little was seen of the Turks as an attacking force other than
one volley high and wide by Umit Davela in the eighth minute and a
71st minute shot by substitute Sergin Yalcin which was parried
well by Magnus Hedman only for Okan Buruk to fire the rebound high
over the bar.
</P>
<P>
But even with Sweden's Larsson and Fredrik Ljungberg doing
their best, creative play was at a premium.
</P>
<P>
The game in front of 33,000 subdued fans got a brief jolt
because of controversy in the 41st minute when Fredrik Ljungberg
claimed his foot was clipped by a defender just when he aimed to
shoot after rushing through the Turkish defense with only Rustu to
beat.
</P>
<P>
Dutch referee Dick Jol shrugged off his vehement protests.
</P>
<P>
The second half started off even worse, with neither of the
two teams able to make the least impression on the opposing
defense.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Turkey's substitute Sergen Yalcin rifled a 24-meter (
yard) shot in the 72nd minute, and Swedish goalie Magnus Hedman
could only bounce it back into the path of Okan Buruk. Okan, who
scored Turkey's first-ever European championship goal against
Italy, this time steered the rebound over.
</P>
<P>
After that, both sides started packing their defense ever more
to avoid defeat.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Israel Fail to Reach Air Traffic Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Israel failed to reach
agreement on the number of flights between the two countries and on
the flight paths between Cairo and the Palestinian-ruled Gaza city,
an official from the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations that ended on Thursday in Tel Aviv,
Egypt rejected an Israeli demand that the current five flights be
increased to nine between the airports of Cairo and Tel Aviv, said
the official who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
The tourist flow between the two countries does not need an
increase of flights to such an extent, especially as 30 percent of
the current flights' capacity are not used, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel, on its part, refused to change the routing of flights
linking Cairo to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Egypt wants flights between Cairo and Gaza to use an air
corridor 48 kilometers north of the town of el-Arish in northern
Sinai.
</P>
<P>
Israel rejected the request and asked Egypt to use a route 16
kilometers to the north of the town, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided to study the matter again, although no date was
set for the next session of talks.
</P>
<P>
Under interim agreements reached between the Palestinian
National Authority and Israel, the Jewish state is in charge of
security control of the air space of the Palestinian self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian delegation was headed by General Mamdouh el-
Bagouri, director of the Air Traffic Control Department of the
Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority, and the Israelis were led by
Neri Yarconi, head of Israel's Civilian Aviation Authority.

southwestern Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place around 9:30 a.m. (0830 GMT) in a market
on the outskirts of Mascara, 360 kilometers southwest of the
capital city of Algiers.
</P>

President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to the fundamentalist Islamic groups
of the countries.

<HEADLINE> Russian Media Tycoon Released After Written Pledge  EDS-Updated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Vladimir Gusinsky, the Russian
media tycoon arrested Tuesday and later charged with massive
financial fraud, was released late Friday, the Prosecutor General'
s office announced.
</P>
<P>
The release came after a written pledge by Gusinsky not to
leave town, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting the press
office of the Prosecutor General's Office.
</P>
<P>
"A senior prosecutor of the Russian Prosecutor General's Office
has found it possible to satisfy a motion by lawyers Pavel
Astakhov and Mikhail Burmistrov, who represent the interests of
defendant Vladimir Gusinsky, and release him on his written pledge
not to leave," the press office said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the prosecutor's office had taken into account
the fact that Gusinsky had been awarded the Order of Friendship in
1994, which was proved by appropriate documents, making him
eligible for release.
</P>
<P>
Gusinsky is the CEO of Media-MOST Holding that includes a
number of newspapers, radio stations and TV channels. The media
outlets are believed to have angered the authorities by their
unfriendly contents.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the office said that Gusinsky was "suspected of
committing... large-scale misappropriation by a group of persons
through deceit, abuse of trust and abuse of power, fraud."
</P>
<P>
It said that investigators believe Gusinsky, along with some
leaders of the federal government firm Russkoye Video, "extracted
property worth no less than 10 million U.S. dollars from
government ownership."
</P>
<P>
Gusinsky's arrest by the Prosecutor General's Office has
prompted widespread outcry in Russia across the political spectrum,
but President Vladimir Putin said in Berlin that there are no
reasons to think that the Prosecutor General's Office had "acted
unlawfully" although he did not think the arrest necessary.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I am in rapture over these developments. But I can
't say they disturb me (in talks during visits abroad)," Putin
said at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Berlin is the second stop of Putin's current trip abroad. He
will go to Moldova later Friday.
</P>
<P>
Putin repeated that the Prosecutor General's Office does not
answer to the president. "I don't think the Prosecutor General's
Office should have necessarily detained Gusinsky. But there are no
reasons to believe that it acted unlawfully," the president said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Announces Israeli Withdrawal From Lebanon EDS-Updated with remarks by U.N. special envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday announced the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in full
compliance with a relevant Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
Annan told a press conference here, "I am delighted to tell
you that the United Nations force in Lebanon has today reported to
me that Israel has withdrawn from the country in full compliance
with Security Council Resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
Annan started the press conference, previously scheduled for
10:45 EST and held some two hours later, after he conveyed this
information to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Lebanon have waited more than 22 years for this
moment," he said. "We must all admire the fortitude with which
they have borne this long ordeal."
</P>
<P>
"This is a happy day for Lebanon, but also for Israel," he
said. "It is a day of hope for the Middle East as a whole, and it
is a day of pride for the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"It shows that U.N. resolutions, when fully implemented by all
parties working together, can be the building blocks of peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is now closer to peace than it has been in decades,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan's announcement cleared the way for the 4,500-member U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to be strengthened and deployed
in the border area. It also helped restore the Lebanese Government
's authority over the evacuated territory.
</P>
<P>
"The main task will now be to help the Lebanese Government and
armed forces assume their responsibility along the border and
throughout the area from which Israel has withdrawn," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced its pullout on May 24. U.N. map experts and
others have since been checking that all Israeli troops and
officials have withdrawn behind the international border
demarcated in 1923.
</P>
<P>
"I trust the international community will also be quick to
assist Lebanon with the task of reconstructing the economy in the
south and rebuilding its link with the rest of the country. This
will help move the whole country closer to peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
"I also hope that the implementation of Security Council
Resolution 425 will be seen by all the peoples in the region --
especially Syrians, Palestinians and Israelis, as well as Lebanese
-- as an encouragement to move ahead faster in negotiating peace
treaties based on earlier Security Council resolutions: 242 and
338," he said.
</P>
<P>
Those resolutions, enshrining the formula of "land for peace,"
form the bedrock on which the 1991 Madrid formula for achieving a
just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East was built.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that he hoped the Lebanese army would now deploy
its forces in the area evacuated by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special representative for the Middle East, Terje
Roed Larsen, told the same press conference that the Lebanese
Government had told the United Nations it "would respect the
decision of the United Nations as concerns the Israeli withdrawal.
"
</P>
<P>
"Let me thank the leaders of Lebanon, Israel and Syria ...for
the cooperation they extended to the United Nations over the last
few weeks," Annan said. "I would also like to thank the
governments of Egypt, Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia for their
support, as well as the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Annan left immediately after his press conference for the
Middle East to meet the leaders in the region and to see what the
United Nations can do to consolidate and build on today's
achievement.
</P>
<P>
The trip, along with Friday's announcement, was delayed a day
after Israeli soldiers fired shots near a United Nations team
visiting one of the last remaining unchecked border sites. Israeli
authorities Thursday expressed regret over the incident.

<HEADLINE> Mine Collapse in Peru Buries Four Miners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Four miners died after they were
buried under rocks and dirt in a collapsed tunnel more than 300
meters below the surface in the Casapalca mining complex in Peru's
central Andean zone, the mining company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Other four workers saved their own lives when they abandoned
the tunnel where they were working with the victims, escaping
through a vertical duct that leads to the surface.
</P>
<P>
The first investigation says that the collapse was caused by
water filtration that weakened the walls of the mine.
</P>
<P>
The rescue brigades of the company and the National Police
worked for more than 20 hours to rescue the bodies of the miners.
</P>
<P>
A police report shows that more than 600 miners have died in
this country in the last eight years because of collapses,
explosions, and flooding of the mining complex tunnels.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government floated a
new emission of public debt bonds for 105 million euros (100
million U.S. dollars) in Italy, Switzerland, and Germany, said
Friday Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
Colombia floated for the first time on June 8 foreign public
debt debentures in European currency for 200 million euros (190
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Those 190 million dollars, plus the 100 million dollars issued
Thursday, will enter the country on June 30. Colombia paid an 11
percent rate of interest to investors in both emissions.
</P>
<P>
The bonds reopening price was 99.95 points above the price of
the original launching. That better price, according to the
finance minister, shows the good performance of the bond since its
arrival in that market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Civil Rights Panel Accuses New York Police of Racial Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights has found that the New York Police Department improperly
use racial profiling to stop and question people.
</P>
<P>
The commission, in a report released here Friday, said this
police tactic can lead to racial tensions and "tragic and
unnecessary" incidents like the shooting of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
Diallo, a black immigrant, was shot and killed in New York on
February 4,1999, by four police officers in rampant firing. The
four officers were acquitted earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The report found that blacks and Hispanics were stopped and
questioned by the police far more frequently than the whites.
</P>
<P>
"They simply stop who they think they should stop," said Mary
Frances Berry, chairwoman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
"The New York Police Department needs to be careful not to
engage in racial profiling of this sort," she said. "It not only
violates the law but undermines respect for the police and can
cause deadly altercations, as in the tragic and unnecessary police
shooting of Amadou Diallo."

HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Minister of Information,

Zimbabwean people to shun political violence which has claimed
about 30 lives before the parliamentary election on June 24 and
25.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that Zimbabweans should not be

<P>
He said the anti-Zimbabwe blocs together with independent and
foreign media ought to pay more attention to social and economic

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Extend Military Aid to Kyrgyzstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will grant a military aid of
1 billion U.S. dollars to Kyrgyzstan, the country's Anatolia News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey made the pledge under a military cooperation agreement
signed in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek on Friday by Head of Logistic
Department of the Turkish General Staff Unal Ozsipahioglu and
Kyrgyz Deputy Defense Minister and Chief of General Staff Nuredin
Comoyev.
</P>
<P>
The agreement defines that Turkey will help train Kyrgyz
military units and extend to the Kyrgyz army 1 billion dollars
worth of equipment and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
Ozsipahioglu said at a press briefing that Turkey's main goal is
to help Kyrgyzstan fight against terrorism and maintain security.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) had become a
provider of military training to many countries in the Balkans,
Middle East and the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
In a major foreign policy overhaul, Turkey has recently declared
that relations with European and Asian countries are one of the two
top priorities of its foreign policy and Turkey is determined to
act as a pivotal player in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem mounted a diplomatic
drive in the Caucasus and Central Asia earlier this month. After a
visit to Azerbaijan, he also travelled to Kazakhstan and
Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
In Bishkek on Monday, Cem reportedly offered Turkey's
cooperation in combating radical religious terrorist organizations.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Withdrawal Incomplete Unless to Recognized Border: Lebanese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said
Friday the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon is not overall if
the withdrawal line is not delimited according to international
recognized border.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud stressed that the border will never be changed, local
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a statement released on Friday that
Lebanon urges the implementation of the U.N. Resolution 425 calling
for Israeli unconditional withdrawal and supports U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan's May 22 report recommending the reinforcement
of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
</P>
<P>
He questioned what he termed as the U.N.'s impatience towards
the verifying process along Lebanese-Israeli border, saying "
Lebanon has waited for Israeli withdrawal for more than 22 years,
why can't they wait for more days," Lebanese National News Agency
(LNNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan in a news conference in the U.N. headquarters in
New York Friday confirmed that the Israeli forces had completely
withdrawal from south Lebanon in accordance with the demands of the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and carved up a border strip as
a so-called "security zone" in 1985 to allegedly protect its
northern area from cross-border attacks by Lebanese Muslim
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted resolutions 425 and 426 after
the Israeli invasion, demanding immediate and unconditional
Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state decided earlier this year to pull out from
Lebanon by July 7. However, it completed withdrawal of its troops
from south Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon claimed that some areas along the borderline are still
occupied by Israel and insisting that its deployment in the south
will be done only after the U.N. confirmation of full Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and Lebanese teams in charge of verifying the Israeli
withdrawal on Friday entered the Abbassiyeh village along Lebanese-
Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL took over the four-square-kilometer village and will
permit villagers and local people to enter it in a few days, LNNA
said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, U.N. officers and their Lebanese
counterparts inspected eastern part of the border on helicopters.
The work at the Israeli side was ended several days ago.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to arrive here next Monday to discuss with
Lebanese leaders on verifying the withdrawal and reinforcing
UNIFIL.

BAGHDAD, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq fired surface-to-air missiles
at U.S. and British warplanes flying over southern Iraq on Friday,
a military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British war planes were repulsed back to their
bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the official Iraq News Agency
quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British planes have been patrolling the so-called
no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq they imposed in the
wake of the 1991 Gulf War, triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
and often bomb so-called targets in Iraq, causing heavy civilian
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize the zones, which are not specifically
covered by any United Nations resolution.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: DRC Peace Process Faces Grave Challenges (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Amid continuing inter-
ethnic clashes in several provinces and heavy fighting between
Ugandan and Rwandan forces in the diamond trade center of
Kisangani, the United Nations Security Council Friday began two-
day talks with all conflict parties on the latest developments in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The talks, held at the invitation of the president of the 15-
nation Security Council, is a welcome chance for all the parties
to undertake a serious re-evaluation of the deteriorating
situation in the central African country, which has been locked in
the many-sided conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The event is also "an opportunity for the members of the
Security Council to make it clear to the parties that their
assurances of support for the peace process and guarantees of
security and freedom of movement can no longer be taken at face
value, but must be reflected in their actions," U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan said in his written report to the Security
Council, released here earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers or high-ranking government officials from
six African countries, involved in the conflict, and DRC rebel
representatives met with Security Council members in open and
closed-door meetings to see what role the world body can play in
promoting the much-stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the on-going hostilities on the ground, the talks
kicked off against the backdrop that the Lusaka Cease-fire
Agreement, signed in July last year, was repeatedly violated, the
United Nations has difficulties in deploying its enlarged
peacekeeping forces in the country, and the inter-Congolese
dialogue, one of the key elements in the peace process, is yet to
start.
</P>
<P>
"The resumption of hostilities in Kisangani between Rwanda and
Uganda has drastically aggravated the situation and seeks to toll
the bell for the Lusaka accord," the president of the Security
Council, Jean-David Levitte of France, said at the Thursday open
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It is unjustifiable for two foreign armies to be fighting on
the soil of a third country, a war which had resulted in at least
300 people dead and 1,200 wounded," he said. "The presence in the
country of the Rwandese and Ugandan forces is becoming a major
source of insecurity."
</P>
<P>
Yerodia Abdoulye Ndombasi, minister of state for foreign
affairs and international cooperation of the DRC, said, "War, and
the mere presence of uninvited foreign forces, imply that no one
can guarantee the needed safety of United Nations forces."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations sees the assurances and guarantees of
safety and security, and uninhibited freedom of movement as a
precondition for the deployment of U.N. peacekeeping forces in any
target country, including the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The complexity of achieving any consensus was underscored when
Ande Bumaya, the Rwandan foreign minister, said that Rwandan
troops could not leave without security guarantees that ethnic
Hutu rebels would stop using the DRC as a base for attacking his
country.
</P>
<P>
The renewed fighting has made it more difficult to recruit
peacekeeping forces to go to the DRC because the duty had become
more dangerous, diplomatic sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, in a resolution unanimously adopted in
February, authorized the dispatch of 5,537 peacekeepers to the DRC,
but there has been a mounting reluctance to commit them to
monitoring a cease-fire that has yet to take hold.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special representative for the DRC, Kamel Morjane,
told the Security Council Friday that the troops earmarked for
peacekeeping in the African country were not nearly enough, and
said an extra battalion was needed just to prevent new fighting
over Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, one-third of the DRC population, or 16 million
people, critically need food, more than 1.5 million are displaced
and 5 million are completely or partially isolated from their
traditional supply routes.
</P>
<P>
A fearful outbreak of cholera looms large as people have no
access to clean drinking water in addition to the high infection
rate of AIDS disease.
</P>
<P>
Keeping in mind an ambitious program for peace in Africa, the
United Nations, following its setback in Sierra Leone, is pushing
hard to get its peacekeepers in place in the DRC, and considering
possible peacekeeping operations in the border area between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, which fought a border war over territorial
disputes.
</P>
<P>
"Only once all signatories of the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement
have demonstrated genuine commitment to its terms and
determination to fulfill the obligations they assumed therein, can
the United Nations hope to succeed in assisting them to do so,"
Annan has said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Progress in Peace Process in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday welcomed the development that the Somalia National
Peace Conference has moved into its second phase, and hoped it
paves the way for substantive inter-Somalian talks about the
political future of the African country.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here through Annan's spokesman, said, "The
Secretary-General was encouraged by the news that the Somalia
National Peace Conference has moved into its second phase. He
welcomes this development and hopes that it paves the way for
substantive talks among representatives of all sectors of Somali
society about the political future of their country."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief "also hopes that it will lead to an agreement
on the formation of a transitional arrangement that would
safeguard Somalia's sovereignty and prepare the ground for a
lasting settlement," the statement said. "The Secretary-General
urges all Somalis to join and support the Djibouti peace
initiative."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General takes this opportunity to commend the
tireless efforts of President Ismail Omar Guelleh of Djibouti to
help bring about a political resolution to the Somalia conflict,"
the statement said. "He reiterates his support for the process and
looks forward to a successful conclusion of the deliberations in
Djibouti."
</P>
<P>
Somalia has had no central government since 1991 opposition
politicians joined forces to oust President Mohamed Siad Barre.
They then turned on each other, carving the country into militia-
controlled fiefdoms. But if the peace talks succeeded, the
warlords could find their power eroded.
</P>
<P>
An initiative, proposed by President Guelleh, calls on the
warlords to turn their factions into political parties, commit to
a complete and verifiable disarmament, submit to the primacy of
law and respect the creation of a police force.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMERICK, Ireland, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Asia-Europe
Young Leaders Symposium (AEYLS) ended Friday in Ireland's mid-
western city of Limerick, with the central theme of the four-day
symposium being the knowledge society: challenges and
opportunities for Asia-Europe partnership in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium held at Limerick University, over 100
delegates from 25 member countries of the Asia-Europe Meeting (
ASEM) discussed the evolution of the knowledge economy, e-commerce,
electronic government, education in the knowledge economy and
Asian and European perspectives on corporate cultures and
organizational strategy.
</P>
<P>
The annual AEYLS is one of the follow-up activities of the
first ASEM in 1996 in Bangkok. It was established to bring
together young leaders from Asia and Europe to promote mutual
understanding between the two regions. The first AEYLS took place
in Japan in 1997. Subsequently, symposia were also held in Austria
(1998) and South Korea (1999).
</P>
<P>
These symposia play a key role in the ongoing efforts of 10
Asian countries (Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam), the
15 European Union countries and the European Commission to develop
a greater level of mutual understanding and cooperation.

<P>
ROME, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The international community must
modify its Balkan policies or risk turning Serbia into a European
equivalent of Iraq, Italian Foreign Undersecretary Umberto Ranieri
warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting aimed at boosting Italian-Austrian collaboration
in the Balkans, Ranieri said that the main problem in the Balkans
remained Serbia, and that "without its involvement, the
possibility of creating stability is uncertain."
</P>
<P>
Noting that sanctions had failed in their purpose of weakening
the Serbian leader's hold on power, he warned that "we can't run
the risk of a new Iraq in Europe."
</P>
<P>
While admitting that there were some encouraging developments
in the Balkan situation, Ranieri insisted that "elements of
instability and fragility are creating fresh concerns" and pushed
for the swift application of projects and measures contained in
the Balkan Stability Pact.

<HEADLINE> Italian Births Up in 1999, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Italy, the nation with the lowest
birth rate in Europe, saw a slight rise in its population in 1999
thanks to increases in the birth rate and immigration, the
national statistics bureau Istat said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Istat data, which is based on population figures from
December 1999, also showed that women outnumber men and that
Italians are leaving the major cities to live in smaller
communities.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that total residents in Italy numbered 57,679,
955.
</P>
<P>
Of that figure, 51.5 percent were women, as opposed 48.5
percent men, the greatest concentration of women being in the
south.
</P>
<P>
There were 96,398 live births registered in 1999, up from 91,
635 in 1998 but the number of deaths continued to outstrip the
number of births by 33,841, Istat said.
</P>
<P>
However, it stressed that the number of registered immigrants
climbed by 101,181, thereby pushing up the overall population by
67,340.
</P>
<P>
It said that the number of births were highest in the
northeastern and northwestern regions, and lower in the southern
and island regions.

<HEADLINE> Russian Media Tycoon Charged With Massive Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Vladimir Gusinsky, the Russian
media tycoon arrested Tuesday, was officially charged with massive
financial fraud, his lawyer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gusinsky's arrest by the Prosecutor General's Office has
prompted widespread outcry in Russia across the political spectrum,
but President Vladimir Putin said in Berlin that there are no
reasons to think that the Prosecutor General's Office had "acted
unlawfully" although he did not think the arrest necessary.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I am in rapture over these developments. But I can
't say they disturb me (in talks during visits abroad)," Putin
said at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Berlin is the second stop of Putin's current trip abroad. He
will go to Moldova later Friday.
</P>
<P>
Putin repeated that the Prosecutor General's Office does not
answer to the president. "I don't think the Prosecutor General's
Office should have necessarily detained Gusinsky. But there are no
reasons to believe that it acted unlawfully," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The Prosecutor General's Office said Tuesday that Gusinsky was
"suspected of committing... large-scale misappropriation by a
group of persons through deceit, abuse of trust and abuse of power,
fraud."
</P>
<P>
It said that investigators believe Gusinsky, along with some
leaders of the federal government firm Russkoye Video, "extracted
property worth no less than 10 million U.S. dollars from
government ownership."
</P>
<P>
Gusinsky is the CEO of Media-MOST Holding that includes a
number of newspapers, radio stations and TV channels. The media
outlets are believed to have angered the authorities by their
unfriendly contents.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the heads of MOST media groups appealed for a
meeting with former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the Interfax
news agency reported, quoting Alexei Venediktov, editor-in-chief
of Ekho Moskvy radio.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian media, Gusinsky was one of the oligarchs
who had played an important role in helping Yeltsin win the 1996
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
"We will be asking for a meeting with pensioner Boris
Nikolayevich Yeltsin, the person who said, while introducing
Vladimir Putin, 'Under his rule everything will be as under my
rule. Under his rule the freedom of speech will be preserved, all
civil liberties will be preserved,'" Venediktov told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The senior executives of the Media-MOST Holding have termed the
events surrounding Gusinsky as "a political affair," said Yevgeni
Kiselyov, the head of NTV, a television outlet under MOST.
</P>
<P>
"It is an attack on the freedom of speech, an attack on the
mass media," Kiselyov said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the statements that Gusinsky's arrest only
involves his business activities and has nothing to do with mass
media.
</P>
<P>
"Gusinsky's business is to let people, society, express
themselves freely on any issue, appeal to the powers that be, vent
their disagreement," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Cosmonauts Prepare for New Mission to Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian cosmonauts have started
training for the next mission to the country's aging Mir space
station at the Gagarin training center near Moscow, the Interfax
news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement coincided with the return to earth earlier
Friday of the station's 28th mission, which was considered by some
as probably the last one to the 14-year-old space station.
</P>
<P>
The current trainees for the 29th mission include Salizhan
Sharipov and Pavel Vinogradov, and the possible standby crew will
probably include Talgat Musabayev and Yuri Baturin, former
presidential national security advisor and Defense Council
secretary. Baturin has made one flight to Mir already, Interfax
said, quoting Pyotr Klimuk, chief of the Gagarin training center.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the next mission is tentatively slated for the
end of next November.
</P>
<P>
The landing module carrying the crew of the 28th mission,
Sergei Zaletin and Alexander Kalery, landed at 4:44 a.m. Moscow
time (0044 GMT) Friday in the target area -- 44 kilometers outside
of Arkalyk, Central Kazakhstan, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Zaletin and Kalery arrived at Mir on April 6, ending the space
station's seven-month unmanned flight. The vacancy was mainly a
result of financial difficulties. Mir will again be operating in
an automatic mode after Zaletin and Kalery's departure.
</P>
<P>
The planned 29th mission might be aborted if the "Energy"
rocket corporation that operates the station fails to raise enough
funds.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Holds Military Exercises Near Chechen Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Georgia launched large-scale
military exercises Friday in the country's eastern Telavi district,
in the immediate vicinity of the Chechen section of its border
with Russia, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The exercises involve two army brigades as well as border
guards and Interior Troops, Interfax said, citing Dzhoni
Pirtskhalaishvili ,chief of the General Staff of the Georgian
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The scenario of the exercises implies the discovery by army
intelligence helicopters of enemy saboteurs trying to reach the
border and their destruction by artillery and infantry.
</P>
<P>
At the final stage, Interior Troops would try to seek and
destroy individual saboteurs escaping the main strike.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers, which involve more than 1,000 servicemen and 200
reservists, will last until June 20.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate unanimously
Friday passed the electronic-signature bill that had just been
approved before the House, giving a signature or record sent
through cyberspace the same legal weight as an ink-on-paper
document.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation approved 87-0 by the Senate, business
could strike a deal or make a contract with the click of a mouse
and consumers could close a mortgage or buy insurance without ever
leaving their home.
</P>
<P>
The bill could revolutionize banking by letting buyers close
mortgages and car loans 24 hours a day, says Jerry Buckley of the
Electronic Financial Services Council, a lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
By August, online brokerage DLJ Direct will let clients open
accounts and receive statements online, senior vice president
Michael Hogan says. He says the firm now spends as much as 8.50 U.
S. dollars on each paper package.

<P>
The White House has indicated that President Bill Clinton will

<HEADLINE> Annan Announces Israeli Withdrawal From Lebanon EDS-Writethru with more quotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday announced the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in full
compliance with a relevant Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
Annan told a press conference here, "I am delighted to tell
you that the United Nations force in Lebanon has today reported to
me that Israel has withdrawn from the country in full compliance
with Security Council Resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
Annan started the press conference, previously scheduled for
10:45 EST and held some two hours later, after he conveyed this
information to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Lebanon have waited more than 22 years for this
moment," he said. "We must all admire the fortitude with which
they have borne this long ordeal."
</P>
<P>
"This is a happy day for Lebanon, but also for Israel," he
said. "It is a day of hope for the Middle East as a whole, and it
is a day of pride for the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"It shows that U.N. resolutions, when fully implemented by all
parties working together, can be the building blocks of peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is now closer to peace than it has been in decades,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan's announcement cleared the way for the 4,500-member U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to be strengthened and deployed
in the border area. It also helped restore the Lebanese Government
's authority over the evacuated territory.
</P>
<P>
"The main task will now be to help the Lebanese Government and
armed forces assume their responsibility along the border and
throughout the area from which Israel has withdrawn," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced its pullout on May 24. U.N. map experts and
others have since been checking that all Israeli troops and
officials have withdrawn behind the international border
demarcated in 1923.
</P>
<P>
"I trust the international community will also be quick to
assist Lebanon with the task of reconstructing the economy in the
south and rebuilding its link with the rest of the country. This
will help move the whole country closer to peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
"I also hope that the implementation of Security Council
Resolution 425 will be seen by all the peoples in the region --
especially Syrians, Palestinians and Israelis, as well as Lebanese
-- as an encouragement to move ahead faster in negotiating peace
treaties based on earlier Security Council resolutions: 242 and
338," he said.
</P>
<P>
Those resolutions, enshrining the formula of "land for peace,"
form the bedrock on which the 1991 Madrid formula for achieving a
just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East was built.
</P>
<P>
"Let me thank the leaders of Lebanon, Israel and Syria ...for
the cooperation they extended to the United Nations over the last
few weeks," Annan said. "I would also like to thank the
governments of Egypt, Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia for their
support, as well as the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Annan left immediately after his press conference for the
Middle East to meet the leaders in the region and to see what the
United Nations can do to consolidate and build on today's
achievement.
</P>
<P>
The trip, along with Friday's announcement, was delayed a day
after Israeli soldiers fired shots near a United Nations team
visiting one of the last remaining unchecked border sites. Israeli
authorities Thursday expressed regret over the incident.

<HEADLINE> Somali Children Celebrate African Child Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Somali children
Friday celebrated the African Child Day with colorful games in a
major gathering in the Lugino Stadium in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The event, which was sponsored by Somalia's Peace Net and the
Coalition Women for Grass Roots (COGWO), saw children in the
war-torn country given t- shirts with the message "We're the
Future Leaders" at the back.
</P>
<P>
Games, rope pulling and hitting the potluck were all part of
the fascinating competitions displayed for the children while
cheering crowds of adults witnessed the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 1,500 children from six schools gathered around
the Inter-SOS headquarters marking the African Child Day in Jowhar
town, 90 kilometers north of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
It is not that all celebrations have been fulfilled as planned.
A well programmed commemoration in Merca town, 120 kilometers
south of Mogadishu, ended up in a total failure after one of the
headquarters of the international aid agencies operating in town
was attacked with a hand grenade Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Even though no one was hurt in the attack, the loud explosion
near the Italian aid agency COSV has terrified the aid agencies,
especially four international expatriates who arrived there for
the three-day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
For precaution, the four expatriates were immediately flown
back to Nairobi in an emergency on a special flight arranged for
them.
</P>
<P>
The aid agencies were not disappointed only by the grenade
attack, a musical band in preparation for the event was also told
to stop playing their music Thursday night, something that angered
the musicians and the agencies equally.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the failure for the commemoration of the African
Child Day in some parts, the Somalis are still very happy that a
government might be around the corner now after more than ten
years of uncertainty and civil war.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Imams in the mosques of Mogadishu Friday blessed
Djibouti President Ismail Omar Ghelleh and the international
community supporting him for the establishment of a government for
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
During the prayer speech, Imam Abdulleh Weheliye Golfaley asked
the Somalis to forgive each other and put their support behind the
Djibouti initiative so that insecurity will be dealt with and all
public services including schools for the children will be
restored.

HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Defence Forces said
Friday that 43 Rwandan prisoners of war captured in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will be repatriated to

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Down in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. housing starts dropped 3.9
percent in May from their level the month before, falling to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.592 million units, the
Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The dip was larger than had been expected by analysts, who on
average had predicted a 1.8 percent decrease, suggesting that
rising mortgage rates are cutting into demand.
</P>
<P>
Last month's housing starts were the lowest level since 1.56
million units in June last year.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
last June to slow the speeding economy and keep inflation from
escalating. As a result, mortgage rates have kept rising, with the
average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hitting 8.5 percent
in May, up from 7.15 percent in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe volatility in the stock market also has
contributed to some of the slowing by making people feel a little
less in the buying mood.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction has been an engine of the vibrant economy
and even with higher interest rates, activity has remained healthy.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's report, housing starts were mixed throughout the
country. In the West, starts declined 13.6 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 374,000 units. In the Midwest, they fell
by 8.9 percent to a rate of 339,000 units.
</P>
<P>
But in the Northeast, housing starts rose 5.6 percent to a rate
of 151,000 units. In the South, they went up by 2.8 percent to a
rate of 728,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, starts of single family homes fell 5.4 percent in
May to a rate of 1.25 million units, the lowest level since April
1999. But starts of apartments, condos and other multifamily
housing went up by 2.1 percent to 342,000 units.
</P>
<P>
New building permits, a sign of future construction activity
fell a bigger-than-expected 4.3 percent in May to a rate of 1.49
million units. Many analysts were forecasting a 1.9 percent
decline.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Says Lebanese Border Check Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. forces in south
Lebanon have visited all points of the border to confirm the
departure of Israeli troops, U.N. officials said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the officials, who quoted U.N. military sources in Lebanon,
said some of the points were inspected by helicopter, and Lebanese
army experts still wished to visit "a few of them" on foot.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the United Nations has to delay the official
announcement of the Israeli withdrawal, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had previously scheduled a
news conference for 10:45 EST to announce the Israeli withdrawal,
but his spokesman's office announced the cancellation of the press
conference minutes beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the U.N. chief will give a press conference late
Friday morning, the spokesman's office said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that they expected Annan to leave New York for
London later Friday, before starting a week-long tour of six
Middle Eastern countries. The trip is expected to begin with a
visit to Iran Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We think he will go, with or without an announcement of the
verification," the officials said. Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard
and a group of journalists left New York for London Thursday night.

UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday continued a two-day meeting to seek the withdrawal of
combatants from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and discuss
how the United Nations can play a role in the peace process of the
central African country.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Council, after the Thursday beginning of the
talks, urged visiting foreign ministers from a half dozen African
countries, involved in the DRC conflicts, to join in seeking a way
out of the desperate conflict that continues to devastate the
biggest country in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Council went into open session with foreign ministers and
diplomats from six African countries which signed a peace accord
on July 10 last year in Lusaka, capital of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The agenda for the meeting included two open sessions of the
Security Council and a series of closed-door meetings and
bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Council members began studying a draft
resolution that would give Rwanda and Uganda four months to
withdraw its forces out of the DRC, formerly known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda back rival factions opposed to President
Laurent Kabila, while Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe backed the
Kabila Government.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Hopes to Enhance Economic Ties With China: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan
said here Friday that there are bright prospects for Croatia-China
relations and he hopes to strengthen bilateral cooperation in
various areas, particularly in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
"Croatia hopes to develop extensive cooperation with China in
the economic field," Racan told Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC), at a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Croatia has advantages in the pharmaceutical, machine-building
and tourism industries, where the two countries can establish
joint ventures, Racan said, adding that Croatia also welcomes
Chinese investment in the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Croatia and China will make
concerted efforts to implement various bilateral accords on
cooperation in the economic and trade, scientific and
technological, cultural, maritime transport and customs areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Croatian premier also reiterated that his
government will continue to adhere to its one China principle.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Li Peng elaborated on China's
stance toward problems that still exist in regions of the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
China has no private interests in the region, and is willing to
maintain and develop friendly cooperative relations with all the
countries in the regions and treat them equally without
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that all the countries in the regions could solve
various problems left over from history through dialogue, live in
harmony and enjoy common development, the top Chinese legislator
said.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade cooperation is an important part of Sino-
Croatian relations, he said. Despite low bilateral trade volume,
he said, bilateral trade and economic relationship boosts huge
potential and have a good prospect.
</P>
<P>
Li hoped that the two countries can make joint efforts to find
out the needs of both sides and the possibility of cooperation,
encourage and support contacts and cooperation of enterprises
from both countries.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Croatia can surely achieve new accomplishments
in foreign economic cooperation on basis of its resources and
geographical advantages.

<HEADLINE> France to Transform Part of Algerian Debts Into Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- France will transform 400 million
francs (58 million U.S. dollars) of debt owed by Algeria into
investment, the French Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached between Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika and French Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry
Laurent Fabius during their meeting in Paris on Friday.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to reinforce economic cooperation between France
and Algeria, create a club of French and Algerian businessmen, and
let Algeria profit from all French financial aid programs.
</P>
<P>
The French decision will have to be approved by the Paris Club,
the group of donor countries concerned with Algeria's loans and
debts, and French officials expect the club to give it a green
light by the end of the month.

<HEADLINE> 10 Civilians Killed in Mindanao Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 civilians have been
killed in ongoing clashes between the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF)and a Christian vigilante group in Palimbang, Sultan
Kudarat province in the southern Philippines, a TV report said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report of the ABS-CBN television, two of the
dead are Muslim women who were allegedly tortured and raped before
they were killed. Some corpses of the victims, mostly Christians,
lay half-buried in the ground.
</P>
<P>
The report said the villages of San Roque, Milbuk and
Sinangkapan,the only Christian-dominated areas in Palimbang, were
heavily damaged by the ongoing conflict.
</P>
<P>
Government troops and MILF rebels have been locked into fierce
battles in Mindanao since April this year, resulting in heavy
losses on both sides. About 500,000 civilians were forced to flee
their homes due to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Some vigilante groups composed of Christian civilians are
reportedly fighting against MILF rebels to support the government'
s operations in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
A military report said Friday that government forces overran
another camp of the MILF in Lanao del Sur province on Thursday. It
was the 12th MILF camp captured by the military since April.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, two MILF major camps -- Sarmiento and Bushra,
the forward and rear defenses of Camp Abubakar, the largest MILF
camp,were also overran by government forces after days of bloody
battles.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 government troops are now deployed around Abubakar,
a 10,000-hectare camp in Matanog, Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF has been fighting for an independent
state in Mindanao for more than two decades, a request which has
been repeatedly rejected by the Philippine government.

<HEADLINE> Regional Workshop on Dangerous Chemicals Trade Closes in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- An African regional
awareness-raising workshop on the Rotterdam Convention on the
Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure on hazardous chemicals and
pesticides in international trade closed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 20 African countries attended the three-day
workshop, the second in a series of workshops to be held around
the world.
</P>
<P>
During the workshop, the delegates were addressed the concerns
over the risks resulting from uncontrolled trade in extremely
hazardous chemicals and pesticides led to the adoption of the
Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent procedure in
September 1998, in which 163 countries are actively participating.
</P>
<P>
The Convention controls the trade in hazardous chemicals such
as Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and Polybrominated Biphenyls
(PBBs) used by industry, and harmful pesticides such as Lindane,
Parathion and DDT.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are 29 pesticides and industrial chemicals
included in the PIC procedure that have either been banned or
severely restricted in a number of countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the PIC Procedure, these chemicals and pesticides
should not be exported from any PIC member country unless agreed
by the importing country.
</P>
<P>
The Convention is implemented on a voluntary basis until its
entry into force when the 50th nation signed the treaty. The
Interim Secretariat is jointly provided by the U. N. Environment
Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that additional industrial chemicals and
pesticides will be added to the PIC procedure.

<HEADLINE> Angola Blames Border Instability on Rebel Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Vice-Foreign Minister
George Chicoty blamed the rebel movement led by Jonas Savimbi for
the recently unstable situation at the border with their east
neighbor Zambia.
</P>
<P>
According to Friday's official newspaper Jornal de Angola, the
diplomat said that the situation at the common border is now
normalized, considering the frame of bilateral relations between
Angola and Zambia as "good."
</P>
<P>
To George Chicoty, the unstable situation along the border was
mainly due to the lack of dialogue between the departments of
defense and security of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he "completely" ruled out any possibility that the
incidents were caused by the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA), saying
that "We are worried that someone, in this case the rebel movement,
used our army uniforms, penetrated into the Zambian territory,
created disorder and later on accused the FAA of such acts.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister also said that he appreciated the suggestion
mentioned by the Zambian government to hold the next meeting of
the two countries' joint commission for peace and security on June
26.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government was quoted in May by the press as
saying that the Angolan army had crossed the common border and
committed disorder in the Zambian territory. But the Angolan
government then refuted the report.

<P>
Bouteflika, who arrived here Wednesday, will discuss with CRIF
leaders relations between the one million-strong Algerian
community in France and the 700,000-strong Jewish community.
</P>

About 200,000 French Jews are originally from Algeria and were
part of the "pieds-noirs (black feet)" French families who were
forced to return to France after Algeria won independence in 1962.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika Thursday met with the famous French-Algerian singer
Enrico Macia and the brother-in-law of former President Francois
Mitterrand, Roger Hanin, both of whom are Jews who once lived in
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika has appealed to French enterprises, including those
of the former "pieds-noirs," to invest in his country which
strongly needs economic and technical help.
</P>
<P>
The CRIF hopes that Algeria can play a role in the Middle East
peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador of the Republic of
Kazakhstan to China, Kuanysh Sultanov, said today that Kazakhstan-
China relations have been developing well, and mutually beneficial
cooperation in political, economic and trade areas will achieve an
even greater success in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that during Kazak President
Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to China in November last year, the
two countries signed a joint statement on promoting cooperation in
the 21st century, thus laying a solid foundation for the further
growth of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two countries also signed a joint communique
on the comprehensive settlement of border issues.
</P>
<P>
He said Kazakhstan held several seminars in Beijing, Shanghai
and Hong Kong to attract Chinese investment last year. Trade
volume between the two countries reported a record of 1.1 billion
U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, experts from both countries
have held consultations on the exploitation of water resources of
border rivers, he said. There is great potential for the two
countries to boost cooperation in areas of energy, transportation,
fertilizer, iron ore, steel, textile and agriculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an oil and natural resources accord in
1997. The construction of pipelines linking the two sides will
increase Kazakhstan's capacity of exporting oil many times over to
China, the ambassador said. Meanwhile, the construction of
railways along the Eurasia Continental Bridge will facilitate
China's export to Europe.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the forthcoming Five-Nation Summit (China,
Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan) in Dushanbe,
capital city of Tajikistan, early next month, Sultanov said that
leaders of the five countries are expected to discuss regional
security and sign a joint statement.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Clones First Goat from Adult Body Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists working in the
Northwest University of Agriculture and Forestry Science and
Technology have cloned the first live goat from adult body cells
in the world, Zhang Yong, a professor with the university
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The goat, named "Yuanyuan", 36-cm long, 30-cm tall and
weighting 2.8 kgs, was born at 12:58 pm today. The baby goat was
cloned using ear cells of an adult goat, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
In cloning the goat, scientists adopted different technology
of nuclear transfer from that used to produce Dolly the sheep, the
world's first cloned animal born in 1997 in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
From December 1999 to January, scientists removed some cells
from the ears of an adult goat, collected some oocytes of goat
from a slaughterhouse and cultivated them for future use.
</P>
<P>
They later injected the nucleus of the donor cells into an
enucleated oocyte to develop into embryos which were then
implanted into the surrogate mother goat.
</P>
<P>
Another cloned goat will be born at the end of June. Similar
cloning technology has been used to clone a cow. The surrogate
mother cow has got pregnant, Zhang said. Chinese scientists will
do genetic analysis on "Yuanyuan" soon.
</P>
<P>
Cloning research is listed as one of the key projects by the
National Natural Science Foundation of China.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Committed to Bringing IT Benefit to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government keeps
on improving the information infrastructure in Hong Kong and
promotes awareness of information technology (IT) to ensure that
the public will be able to enjoy the benefits brought by IT
development.
</P>
<P>
IT can assist in the delivery of social services, and the users
are able to obtain social services and improve quality of life by
utilizing IT, said Cheng Yan-chee, acting director of information
technology services, at a seminar on how the development of IT
will benefit users of social services Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has undertaken various initiatives to
provide the necessary information infrastructure to support the
use and development of IT to ensure that members of the public
will benefit from the development of IT.
</P>
<P>
"The government has introduced measures to encourage more
competition and lower the cost of using telecommunications
services by the public, which will eventually lead to easier and
more frequent use of IT in the community," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
In the latter half of this year, the government will launch the
first phase of the Electronic Service Delivery scheme under which
members of the public can obtain public services through the
Internet or other electronic means 24 hours a day and seven days a
week.
</P>
<P>
To encourage and facilitate young people to use IT, the

<HEADLINE> HK Gov't Funds Air Quality Improvement Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Committee of
Legislative Council of Hong Kong Friday approved a new commitment
of 725.52 million HK dollars (about 93.02 million U.S. dollars)
for providing a one-off grant to encourage diesel taxi owners to
replace their vehicles with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that the grant to assist taxi
owners to replace their diesel taxis with LPG taxis forms part of
the overall strategy to improve air quality.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to start taking in applications for the grant in
August this year. We believe that the package of incentives that
we are offering is sufficiently attractive," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A one-off grant of 40,000 HK dollars (about 5,128 U.S. dollars)
would be provided to each diesel taxi that was replaced by a LPG
one, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Diesel vehicles are the dominant source of air pollution at the
street level, accounting for 98 percent of the respirable
suspended particulates (RSP) and around 80 percent of nitrogen
oxides (NOx) emitted by vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that to protect public health, it was
necessary to adopt all practical measures to reduce harmful
emissions.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 18,000 diesel taxis in Hong Kong,
contributing about 26 percent of the RSP and 12 per cent of NOx
emitted by the entire vehicle fleet.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that replacing all diesel taxis with LPG
taxis would reduce RSP and NOx emissions by up to 25 percent and
six percent respectively from the existing vehicle fleet.
</P>
<P>
"As regards the LPG filling facilities, our target remains to
provide a capacity sufficient for about 8,000 taxis by the end of
this year and for the entire taxi fleet by the end of 2001," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Work against Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia issued a statement
Friday vowing to preserve the ecological environment, better use
natural resources and reclaim more land in the anti-desertification
campaign.
</P>
<P>
This was to mark the World Anti-Desertification Day which falls
on June l7, the official Saudi News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the Pasture and Plant Administration of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Water said desertification is one of
the detrimental environmental problems which badly impact human
food resources, health and life style.
</P>
<P>
Most land in Saudi Arabia suffer from the aching desertification
reality owing to little rain, high temperature, occasional draught
periods, over grazing, and illegal logging, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
As early as the l960s, the kingdom began working to maintain,
develop and manage local natural resources by drafting relevant
strategies, establishing specialized bodies, training national
personnel, and enacting necessary regulations taking into
consideration the private social, economic and environmental
conditions of the country.
</P>
<P>
Climatic changes, and overuse and mis-management of natural
resources are the main causes of desertification, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
To better manage the pastures, preserve and develop ecological
environment, and better use the water resources, a special pasture
and animal production research center was jointly set up by the
Saudi Ministry of Agriculture and Water and the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization in northern Saudi Arabia to monitor
grazing activities there, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Saudi Ihsaa province, 4,500 hectares of land was
covered with 11 million trees to protect the residential areas and
farm land against desertification. Besides the green expansion and
economic benefit, the place has developed into a big national park,
it added.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.9
percent in May, the highest rise since November 1998, when the CPI
was 1.3 percent, the Central Bureau of Statistics said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The surge, which was slightly above expectations of a 0.8
percent increase, was mainly attributed to a rise in housing prices
following the recent depreciation of the Israeli currency, the
shekel, against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economists say the Bank of Israel will not hurry to
reduce its key lending rate when announcing its monetary policy for
July later this month.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government has launched an emergency
assistance project to help small farmers in the quake-hit zone to
restore production.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Husnu Yusuf Gokalp said Wednesday that the
project, which is supported by the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), is geared at assisting small farmers by
providing basic agricultural inputs at a cost of 1 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project's second aim is to provide initial assistance in the
rehabilitation process of the food production system in order to
maintain food security in the region, which suffered two
devastating earthquakes last year.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel would prefer that its permanent economic
pact with the Palestinians take the form of a free trade agreement,
under which Israel would cease providing customs services for the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
A free trade agreement would allow the Palestinians to set and
levy their own customs rates. The movement of goods between Israel
and the Palestinian-rule areas would be duty-free, but imports from
other nations would be liable to customs duties.
</P>
<P>
It has also been decided that Israel will accept any monetary
position taken by the PNA, and will not oppose the minting of
Palestinian currency.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The exports of textile products from the Southeastern
Anatolia Project (GAP) region in the first five months of 2000
totalled 124 million U.S. dollars, reported Anatolia News Agency on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Southeastern Anatolia Exporters' Union said
Friday that the revenues include 54 million dollars in thread, 61
million in cotton fabric and 8 million in various other textile
products.
</P>
<P>
The goods were exported to Syria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel
in the Middle East and countries elsewhere in the world. The
Turkish goods, which are in greatest demand are carpets, synthetic
thread and cotton thread.
</P>
<P>
GAP covers eight provinces in a region bordering Iran, Iraq and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The flight of textile industries from Israeli Arab
villages to neighboring countries and a recession in construction
are fueling a crisis in the Israeli Arab economy, according to an
expert panel.
</P>
<P>
"An economic infrastructure must be created to allow the Arab
economy to integrate fully into Israeli economics as a whole," said
the panel of four Jews and three Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The panel also suggested attention be paid to encouraging the
Arab sector to break out into new fields, especially in the
information and communications industries.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Hopes Economy to Rebound by Yearend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Friday that after two years in office, he finds his job "very
challenging" as he hoped that the country's economy would fully
rebound before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"In my two years (in office), we have overcome the financial
crisis and our economy is in place. There are more to come," he
said after launching a housing program in the northern Cavite
province.
</P>
<P>
The country's GNP (gross national product) grew by 3.6 percent
in 1999 and the president hoped it will increase by at least 4.5
percent this year with the fully recovery of the industry sector.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Cavite, the president said, he will just be
doing his job and would not waste his time listening to criticisms.
</P>
<P>
Estrada renewed his commitment that before he bows out of
office in 2004, he will see to it that the masses, including
teachers, soldiers, policemen and overseas Filipino workers, will
have their own decent shelter.
</P>
<P>
He commended Presidential Adviser for Housing Leonora de Jesus,
who is also the chairperson of the Housing and Urban Development
Coordinating Council, for putting the government's mass housing
projects in place.
</P>
<P>
Mass housing is one of the Estrada administration's centerpiece
programs, alongside food security, peace and order, the fight
against graft and electoral reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government aims to provide 350,000 households
with shelter every year.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this target, the government has reduced interest
rate from 11 to nine percent for socialized housing loans. It has
also extended the amortization period for socialized housing loans
to 30 years from 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Issue ID Cards to Fishermen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- In a first such move to protect
marine fish resources, the Bangladeshi authorities have decided to
issue identity cards to fishermen for fishing in the Bay of Bengal
after their proper training, the United News of Bangladesh
reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 fishermen from seven coastal upazilas (counties) of
Satkhira, Khulna and Bagerhat districts have already been imparted
training under the Sea Fish Management Project.
</P>
<P>
The training program focused on issues like preservation of sea
fishes, fishing laws, adverse effects on sea fishes caused by
indiscriminate catch of shrimp fry, post-collection maintenance of
shrimp fry and vessel license.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates, there are about 7,000 professional
fishermen in the Bagerhat district alone, some 370 kilometers
south of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
In the same district, there are also some 30,000 non-
professionals who illegally catch shrimp fry everyday in the bay
and its connecting rivers, using over 500 engine-boats.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the project hoped that to issue ID cards to the
fishermen would be very helpful in keeping the illegal fishermen
at bay.
</P>
<P>
Apart from training program, some other package programs aiming
to boost fish production in the country are also being carried out
in the region.

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of Meeting Deficit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday it can keep within its target deficit of 62.5 billion pesos
(1.56 billion U.S. dollars) this year despite going slightly
beyond its budget shortfall projections for the first five months.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Jose Pardo of the Department of Finance said that the
Estrada administration will continue to impose fiscal discipline
to curb unnecessary spending in an effort to keep within the
deficit target.
</P>
<P>
He said these cost-cutting measures include a directive of
President Joseph Estrada last month which imposes a five percent
cut on the budgets of all government departments.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there will be fiscal discipline. We have to tighten
our belts, which was already ordered by the president," Pardo said
in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The cuts, Pardo noted, will not affect the delivery of public
services and exempts the Department of National Defense, which, he
said, needs funds to address the conflict in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pardo said the government is hopeful that it will
get the needed development assistance from donor countries when it
meets with their representatives this weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to Pardo, some 25 donor countries will be represented
in the consultative group pledging session this weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the damage caused by the Mindanao conflict,
the Philippines remains capable of meeting its economic targets
for this year.
</P>
<P>
Mainly due to the Mindanao conflict, the government's budget
gap ballooned to 34.11 billion pesos (853 million U.S. dollars) as
of May,which was 1.465 billion pesos (36.6 million dollars) higher
that the government's five-month deficit ceiling.

<P>
According to the Friday announcement, the majority of the C&AMP;A
stores will close at the end of the year. Three distribution
centers will also go, plus the stores in Dublin, with a loss of 4,
800 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Neil McCausland, C&AMP;A's UK managing director, said: "This is a
sad and difficult decision for the company, C&AMP;A has been part of
Britain's High Street for over 75 years."
</P>
<P>
Observers were surprised at the severity of the announcement
from C&AMP;A, but warned there could be other casualties in the
retailing market.
</P>
<P>
The UK union leaders have condemned the decision, saying, "It
is disgraceful and shocking to treat staff in such a cavalier way.
"
</P>
<P>
The General and Municipal Boilermakers Union (GMB) warned that
C&AMP;A's decision could lead to thousands of other job losses in
warehousing, transport and at the company's suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Bill Connor, general secretary of the shopworkers' union, said:
"It is unlikely that the company could get away with such a move
in countries such as Germany and Holland, where labor relations
are much stricter."

<HEADLINE> Canada's TSE Index Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE)
300 composite index hit a record high of 10,110.56 points at the
close Thursday, topping the 10,000 mark for the second time in the
past three months.
</P>
<P>
The country's benchmark index rose 138.5 points, or 1.39
percent, on volume of 127.8 million shares worth 3.32 billion
Canadian dollars (about 2.26 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Rounds of buying in heavy-hitter Nortel Networks Corp. did the
lion's share of the work because the telecommunications equipment
maker represents nearly 32 percent of the index's overall value.
</P>
<P>
Nortel's announcement of a contract of 200 million U.S. dollars
to provide cellular equipment and services to Bellsouth's mobile
phone unit pushed Nortel's share price to 99.40 Canadian dollars (
about 67.72 U.S. dollars), up 5 Canadian dollars (about 3.4 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The TSE's second most heavily weighted stock, entertainment and
liquor conglomerate Seagram Co. Ltd., rose 3.10 Canadian dollars (
about 2.11 U.S. dollars) to 91.50 (about 62.34 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The TSE's record close was also a result of a number of
favorable conditions, including steady domestic economic growth
and recently released data showing there may be a pause in
interest rate hikes.

<HEADLINE> New Offshore Oilfield Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A new offshore oilfield in north
China started pumping out crude today.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Qikou 17-2 oilfield covers 9.1 square kilometers with
a reserve of 16.55 million tons of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Bohai Qikou 17-2 is expected to yield 300,000 tons of crude
annually for the next 15 years. Two pipes with a total length of
61.5 kilometers will pump oil into a plant in Tanggu, a district
of Tianjin Municipality neighboring Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Bohai Petroleum Co. has invested 1.3 billion yuan (about 157
million U.S. dollars) in the oilfield. The oilfield will yield 45
million cubic meters of natural gas each year.
</P>
<P>
Bohai Qikou 17-2 is among the first offshore oilfields
developed in China. China decided to develop six smaller offshore
oilfields as well.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China to Play Key Role in Economic Globalization (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noting that information and technology have become key factors
of global competition, Richard Li, chairman of the Hong Kong-based
Pacific Century Group, said China has become the fastest growing
information technology market in the Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the Chinese government's move to
give science, technology and education a more important role will
accelerate the development of China's Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
Inequality in the process of globalization has become a major
concern for developing countries. While meeting with foreign
representatives, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said the aim of the
conference is to promote cooperation for the establishment of a
new world order that is fair and reasonable.
</P>
<P>
His words received warm response from the representatives. Many
shared the opinion that China's integration into the world economy
would give developing countries a bigger voice in the world and
help build a prosperous and stable new century.
</P>
<P>
Though the prospects for China in economic globalization are
bright, well-known Chinese economist Wu Jinglian warned that the
Asian financial crisis has clearly indicated the danger associated
with economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
For China to benefit from the process, he said, the country
must accelerate its domestic reforms and step up the establishment
of a market economy mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Only by doing this will China's goal of becoming a "near
developed country" be realized by the middle of the 21st century,
wu added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China will take a more positive
attitude toward participating in economic globalization in the
next decade, said Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the solemn pledge on behalf of the Chinese government
at the 21st Century Forum -- Conference 2000, organized by the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee. The three-day conference concluded today.
</P>
<P>
Noted statesmen and economic experts at the conference said
that China's role in economic globalization will have a far-
reaching impact on the world.
</P>
<P>
Since the reform and opening up program was initiated in 1979,
China has been actively involved in economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1998, the Chinese economy has been growing at an
average 9.7 percent annually, the highest growth rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
After 14 years of negotiations, China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, Chinese minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation said at the conference that the 10th meeting of the
China working group will be opened soon in Geneva, which will
finalize legal procedures for China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that once China is admitted into the WTO, the
share of its foreign trade in global trade will double in five
years to reach seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew, senior minister of Singapore, predicts that China
's current efforts to integrate its economy into the global
economy will make it "one of the most important players in the
global exchange of goods, services, capital, talent and ideas in
the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Mickey Kantor, former U.S.
Secretary of Commerce said the largest developing country in the
world and the largest developed country should play a positive
role in economic globalization.

<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The relationship between rich and
poor countries must be adjusted for the sake of sustainable
development, a Chinese economist said here today.
</P>
<P>
Xu Gengsheng, a research fellow with the Institute of World
Economy and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
made said this at the just concluded "21st Century Forum"
sponsored by the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's top
advisory body.
</P>
<P>
If a better balance isn't struck, the consequences of economic
globalization will not be acceptable, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past few decades, some countries did
business with developing countries in the name of "international
aid" and "economic and technological cooperation," but in fact,
they were exploiting and looting developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the rich countries are getting richer while the
poor, poorer," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee Member of CPPCC said the prevailing
ideas about economic globalization actually represent the national
interests of developed countries to the neglect of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said "economic globalization" means that through extensive
cooperation between rich and poor countries.
</P>

"The old international economic order should be changed and

<P>
Xu said an out-of-date idea holds that "aid" and "cooperation"
are favors bestowed by developed countries to developing countries.
Historically, developed countries became developed by relying
mainly on their colonies, and the poverty of developing countries
is a result of the exploitation and oppression by developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries now have the obligation to reconsider their
history and help the people who were subject to their exploitation
and looting develop their economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The former minister said that from another point of view, the
domestic market in developed countries has reached a saturation
point, and developing countries are the greatest potential market
for developed countries.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, he said, helping developing countries is also
necessary for developed countries if they want further their own
growth.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that most developing countries are still in the initial
stage of economic development and the people have a low level of
education.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, that does not mean the workforce there are
not able to implement the advanced technology of the West.
</P>
<P>
He said developed countries are shortsighted when they restrict
exports of advanced technology to developing countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Resumes Verification of Israeli Withdrawal on Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. and Lebanese teams of experts
Friday resumed their work of verifying Israel's withdrawal from
south Lebanon, a day after Israeli soldiers fired warning shots
over their heads, Oriental radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers Thursday shot over the heads and near the feet
of U.N. and Lebanese officers verifying the withdrawal, forcing U.
N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to cancel a news conference in New
York at which he was scheduled to announce an authentication of the
pullout, the local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has apologized for the incident, calling
it "a mistake that will not be repeated in future," Al Nahar
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud, Annan conveyed Israel's apology for the incident to him,
who blamed Israel for slowing down the verification process, said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and the United States have been showing impatience over
Lebanon's insistence on demarcating the border meter-by-meter,
which has taken a much longer time than anticipated for the
certification of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud has instructed the Lebanese officers to examine every
meter of the border before a Lebanese endorsement of the withdrawal
is rendered.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss said at a cabinet
session Thursday night that his government "is determined to extend
fullest cooperation to help the United Nations fulfill its post-
withdrawal role in south Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
U.N. peacekeepers will be deployed at the Israeli-Lebanese
border when verification of Israel's May 24 withdrawal is complete.
</P>
<P>
"And the density of the Israeli mine fields left behind was
largely to blame for the time-consuming verification works on the
Lebanese side of the border," Hoss added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon accuses Israel of having encroached on its territory at
several places by moving the border fence in stages during its 22-
year-long occupation of the country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet May Delay Meeting for Coalition Talks: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
may postpone his weekly cabinet meeting from Sunday to Tuesday to
leave more time for persuading the rebellious Shas party back to
the coalition through talks, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-Orthodox religious Shas party is the third largest
party with 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset (Parliament) and the
biggest partner of Barak's One Israel in the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Shas' policy-making Council of Torah Sages announced Tuesday
that the party had ordered its ministers and deputy ministers to
submit resignation letters to the cabinet and the resignation will
take effect 48 hours thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Barak's possible decision to postpone the cabinet meeting was a
tactical move to leave two more days for the ongoing talks between
One Israel ministers Yossi Beilin, Haim Ramon, Binyamin Ben Eliezer
and Shas ministers Eli Yishai and Shlomo Benizri.
</P>
<P>
Initial signs showed that the talks, which had a marathon
session from late Thursday night to 3 a.m. early Friday, had made
progress to resolve their disputes.
</P>
<P>
Shas's Knesset faction leader Yaish Yair Peretz told Israel
Radio after the negotiation session that there was progress in the
talks indeed.
</P>
<P>
The major contention point between One Israel and Shas is Shas's
financial demands for its debt-ridden education network. The
insatiable Shas has added new items onto its demand list, asking
for a say in the peace talks with Arab countries and legalizing its
private radio stations.
</P>
<P>
A reconciling draft agreement between One Israel and Shas
reportedly will give some 20 million shekels (about 4.9 million U.
S. dollars) in assistance to Shas's school system and legalize at
least two of Shas' pirate radio stations.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two sides will resume Saturday night after
the Jewish Shabbat holiday. Barak himself will meet with Labor and
Social Affairs Minister Eli Yishai, Shas' leader, on Friday
following the breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Avraham Shochat, Justice Minister Beilin, and
Minister in Prime Minister's Office Ramon, all of One Israel
faction, are also scheduled on Saturday to meet with Education
Minister Yossi Sarid, leader of Meretz party.
</P>
<P>
The secular Meretz, archrival of the religious Shas in Barak's
coalition, is against any further concession to the rebellious
Shas. But Sarid's approval will be needed to finalize any
agreements with Shas.
</P>
<P>
If carried out, Shas' pullout from the government will reduce
Barak's control in the Knesset from 68 majority at present to 51
minority, a crisis to endanger Barak's peace efforts in the talks
with the Palestinians and other Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's MSC Development Ahead of Schedule: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Multimedia Super
Corridor (MSC) development is well ahead of schedule, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the MSC as being "rather developed," he said it has
already attracted 34 multinational and world-class companies and
334 other smaller MSC companies.
</P>
<P>
The Multimedia Development Corporation has set a target of 50
world-class companies and 500 other small companies within the MSC
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
However, not all of them are located in Cyberjaya, the MSC's
heart, he told reporters after the inauguration of the Motorola
Software Center in Cyberjaya near the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Some of them are now located in other areas of the MSC, which
spans an area of 15 km by 50 km stretching from the Kuala Lumpur
City Center to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said all the MSC companies would shift to Cyberjaya
and its surrounding areas once the infrastructure in these areas
are fully developed and put in place.
</P>
<P>
Many people are keen to participate in the MSC International
Advisory Panel (IAP), he said, adding that their presence in the
IAP would be very useful because they are representing different
ideas and centers and would give guidance as to what else Malaysia
could do with the MSC.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the 10 million U.S. dollar investment by Motorola
Inc in its software center in Cyberjaya showed the company's
serious commitment to invest in Malaysia and its continued active
support for the MSC.
</P>
<P>
He lauded Motorola as a "very good" corporate investor in
Malaysia for the last 20 years, saying: "This investment by
Motorola is a strong belief by the company that the MSC can
prosper and excel."

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Grain Production Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican grain production for
this year's harvest is estimated at 1.5 million tons, less than
the initial target of 1.8 million tons, the local daily reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The drop of 16.6 percent is blamed on floods that hit the
southern and the central regions in February and March.
</P>
<P>
According to data collected by the National Food Security Early
Warning System, Mozambicans planted about 3.89 million hectares,
but lost 198,000 of these in natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique plans to harvest about 1.16 million tons of maize,
234,000 tons of millet and 115,000 tons of rice during the present
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The second season planting is drawing to an end, and the
harvest from these late sowings in the flood-effected areas will
hardly be sufficient to overcome the dependence on food aid.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of seeds is to blame for the inadequacy for the
second season planting. The Mozambican Agriculture Ministry
managed to distribute about 60,000 kits of seeds, but in some
cases they failed to arrived in time.
</P>
<P>
To preserve what has been harvested, the Early Warning System
is calling for an improvement in storage facilities, because of
the prevailing moisture in the flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the constraints, the present harvest is described
as good in several provinces, particularly in the fertile north,
which was unaffected by the floods.

<HEADLINE> National Security Integral Part of S&AMP;T Globalization: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- As a developing country, China
will always view national security as an integral part of science
and technology globalization, Vice Minister of Science and
Technology Xu Guanhua said this week.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a speech at the 21st Century Forum --
Conference 2000, which was organized by the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee and
closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Xu noted that S&AMP;T globalization has reached a new stage in the
worldwide economic development.
</P>
<P>
"S&AMP;T globalization has expanded the implications of state
security especially information security and brought challenges to
state information and technical security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must strengthen the IPR (intellectual property right)
protection of relevant technologies, enhance the national security
awareness of relevant personnel and prevent the technologies from
flowing out through irregular channels," he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the security concern, the vice minister said China will
continue its opening policy and actively participate in S&AMP;T
globalization, otherwise, "it will be impossible for China to make
full use of international S&AMP;T resources to accelerate its S&AMP;T and
economic development."
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, the best way for China and developing
countries to do this is to adopt a positive attitude, which will
enable them to make full use of opportunities offered by
globalization while avoiding disadvantages associated with it.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that if China is to meet the challenge of
globalization, it must increase its S&AMP;T input, train a high-
caliber contingent of scientists and technicians, and upgrade the
international management level of Chinese enterprises.

<HEADLINE> SOEs Urged to Give Priority to Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- "Seeking Truth," a leading
biweekly magazine in China, today published an article written by
Vice Premier Wu Bangguo calling for state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
to give priority to improving their management.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the central leadership has always attached great
importance to the issue, the vice premier urged greater awareness
of the situation, and that a series of guiding principles and
policies of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the
State Council on deepening the SOE reform and strengthening their
management be carried out to the fullest.
</P>
<P>
The circumstances surrounding SOE reform and development should
be recognized so as to better understand the needs for tighter
management, the senior official said. As SOE reform deepens, some
SOEs are encountering greater difficulties and the living
standards of their staff are declining, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He urged SOEs to overhaul their management systems in
accordance with the modern corporate system, stressing the
importance of strengthening supervision over leaders of SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, SOEs should strengthen their internal management
mainly in areas of production cost, funds, and product quality,
the vice premier said.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Focus on Confidence Building in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government assured
the public Friday that it will focus on confidence building
measures in Mindanao as it works to forge a peace agreement with
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said that while the
government will not tolerate terrorist acts by the MILF, it is
willing to be patient if the MILF shows sincerity in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"We expect this to be a long process. We know this will not be
easy," Zamora said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the problem has been around for almost 30 years,
when the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) attacked Jolo in
1972.The MILF traces its origin to the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
The government forged a peace agreement with the MNLF in 1996,
with the group accepting the government's offer of autonomy in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Jose Pardo of the Department of Finance said some
Church leaders offered to exert influence on communities in the
south.
</P>
<P>
"United, we will succeed in this effort to make a difference
in Mindanao," Pardo said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada met Wednesday with leaders
of various Catholic Church groups as well as the Bishops-
Businessmen's Conference.
</P>
<P>
Pardo, who was present at the Wednesday meeting, said the
government is networking with bishops and non-government
organizations to uplift the economic and spiritual well-being of
Mindanao residents affected by the conflict.
</P>
<P>
While the Estrada administration has committed to pursue peace
in Mindanao, it has also made clear that it will not allow the
MILF to break the law and continue violating a 1997 ceasefire
agreement it forged with the government.

line is estimated at 38.4 billion yuan. The total length of the
gas pipeline, including both the trunk and branch lines, will
reach 8,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Once the line is completed, the related projects in the east
will be built. Their total cost is nearly 70 billion yuan, the
expert said.
</P>
<P>
In line with China's gas development strategy, a comprehensive
gas pipeline network will take shape nationwide in the 21st
century, linking gas production bases in the west with the
developed areas in the Yangtze River and Zhujiang River delta
areas in the east, as well as with the industrial bases in the
northern and northeastern parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Project to Pipe Gas From West to East (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China's huge energy project to
pipe gas from west to east, expected to cost as much as the Three
Gorges Project, will be launched in early 2001 and should end by
2003.
</P>
<P>
A major gas pipeline with total length of 4,200 kilometers will
be built with initial 120-billion yuan investment for the project,
according to Huang Yicheng, chairman of the executive council of
the China Energy Research Society (CERS).
</P>
<P>
The project, as the first major component of developing the
country's western regions, will start from the Tarim Basin in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and end in
Shanghai, running through the provinces Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi,
Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to send gas from the country's major
gas production bases in the western and central parts to the
economically-developed Yangtze River Delta areas as well as the
eastern regions.
</P>
<P>
Huang said natural gas will play a very important role in the
country's energy development strategy for the 21st century, with
gas utilization accounting for eight percent of China's energy
consumption instead of the present two percent.
</P>
<P>
He expects the country's peak annual gas output in the new
century to hit between 110 billion and 130 billion cubic meters,
with production centering on the rich gas-bearing regions of
Xinjiang and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Call for New World Financial Order (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of developing
countries attending the 21st Century Forum -- Conference 2000 in
Beijing have called for the reform of the international financial
system and the establishment of a new world financial order amidst
the process of economic globalization
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the three-day conference which concluded here today,
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, said the monopoly exercised by a handful of developed
countries in making rules must be changed.
</P>
<P>
The international community must work together on a new
international economic and financial coordination mechanism, based
on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, that takes into
consideration the opinions of the developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the role of the International Monetary Fund, Dai suggested
that the world organization focus on two issues. First, IMF should
have an early warning mechanism to prevent financial crisis.
Second, it should provide liquidity assistance in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Il Sakong, chairman of the Institute for Global Economics, the
Republic of Korea, said financial globalization is primarily
responsible for the rapid spread of the Asian financial crisis
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the daily exchange trading volume in the
globalized financial market hits nearly two trillion U.S. dollars,
and that "only a small portion of the total is directly related to
real economic activities, and the rest are purely financial."
</P>
<P>
According to him, these speculative funds pose a strong threat
to the world financial market, especially to those relatively
small and weak emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
"The global economy today is still under the hold of old
international financial structure, based on an institutional
foundation laid more than half a century ago. Naturally, the world
today needs a new global financial structure to deal appropriately
with new challenges posed by the financial globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sakong noted that decisive actions should be taken in three
critical areas: short-term capital flow, private-sector
participation in crisis prevention, and resolution processes and
exchange rate system for key currencies.
</P>
<P>
As today's uni-polar world complicates global decision-making,
he suggested that special efforts be made to set up a closer
regional co-operation to help reduce potential financial systemic
risks, including regional macro-economic policy coordination,
collaborative monitoring of volatile financial flow and the better
use of regional monetary institutions supplementing the role of
the IMF.

<TEXT>
<P>
Virabongsa Ramangkura, former Thai Deputy Prime Minister,
accused capital-heavy developed countries of putting pressure on
capital-weak developing countries to open their capital market,
thus exposing them to the flood of international capital flow and
causing the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that in the process of globalization, developing
countries should reserve stable policy tools such as exchange
rates, interest rate, and prices. Otherwise, "instability will be
the result."
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, partial liberalization of the capital market
and flexibility, or the Buddhist principle of 'following the
middle path' is the most appropriate policy guideline," he said.
</P>
<P>
The former official said developing countries should adopt
market liberalization with partial capital controls depending on
their size, development level and their political, social and
cultural constraints.
</P>
<P>
Ramangkura called for the establishment of an Asian Monetary
Fund (AMF), which he said would have a better understanding of the
economic management, business culture and practices of Asian
countries than the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank-IMF system "had served quite well for almost 55
years until the recent Asian economic crisis. Both have lost their
credibility. The search for a new and better system, or
modifications of the existing system, is badly needed," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the creation of an AMF need not dilute the
importance of the IMF; with close co-operation and coordination,
they would be complimentary.
</P>
<P>
Ramangkura also suggested reforms be made in the Asian
Development Bank, which he said is only a copy of the World Bank
and whose role in preventing crisis and restoring crisis-hit
economies had proved minimal.
</P>
<P>
The reformed ADB would be more capable of analyzing the
regional economy and could give constructive recommendations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jusuf Wanandi, a senior fellow of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, Indonesia, also advocated the reform of the
IMF, saying that its governance is unrepresentative and not
adequately reflecting the distribution of global economic power.
</P>
<P>
Whereas the IMF today is largely governed by the G-7, mainly by
the U.S., he supported the greater role of institutional
governance and surveillance of the international monetary system
by the G-20, consisting of the G-7 and a group of significant
developing economies such as China and the Republic of Korea.

<HEADLINE> China's Internet Economy to Expand in 21st Century: Experts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Internet economy will
expand rapidly in the 21st century if the country takes advantage
of the net's potential and adopts right policies, said experts
participating in an ongoing international conference here.
</P>
<P>
"China can share advanced but inexpensive technology, fully
utilize potential advantages, catch up with and exceed the cutting
edge of advanced technology and promote the modernization of China
's economy," said Liu He, executive deputy director of the State
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
The country should rethink its development strategy for the
software industry and enhance its international competitiveness,
Liu told the 21st Century Forum -- Conference 2000, which was
hosted by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that in the process of promoting the development of
the network economy, "China should concentrate on taking a path
different from that of the United States."
</P>
<P>
For example, China can rely on the Internet to promote the
development of the western region of China, improve the quality of
professional staff there through long-distance education and step
up efforts to develop some distinctive data banks so that the
western region is closely linked with the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Liu added that China "should use as much new information and
network technology as possible and build new digitalized cities as
soon as possible."

<P>
On the basis of international cooperation, the country should
continue to develop its own intellectual property and standards
for building an information infrastructure for its economy.
</P>
<P>
"China can take a distinctive road to create its own
information system which conforms to international practice," Liu
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Duan Yongji, president of the Stone Group, a Beijng-based
information technology enterprise, held that the new economy
characterized by information, knowledge and the Internet will
eventually need new rules of governance.
</P>
<P>
It will also provide a chance for "re-shuffling," Duan said. As
long as China seizes the opportunities, it will gradually shorten
the distance between its existing capabilities and advanced levels.
</P>
<P>
Duan also called on the information industry businesses to sort
out the structural flaws and establish a scientific business
management system.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the conference, Richard Li, chairman of the
Hong Kong Pacific Century Group, noted that human resources will
play a vital role in future competitions.
</P>
<P>
It's very encouraging that the Chinese government has begun to
implement its strategy of revitalizing the nation through science,
technology and education, he said.
</P>
<P>
This, along with the liberalization in the telecommunications
sector and reform measures to encourage competition, will benefit
the development of China's Internet economy, he noted.

<HEADLINE> China Should Speed Up Industrialization: Scientist (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Despite its great achievements
over the past five decades, China is still in the early stage of
industrialization and more effort is needed to speed up the
process, according to a noted Chinese scientist.
</P>
<P>
In an article published in the latest issue of the weekly
magazine "Outlook", Song Jian, president of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, wrote that China has entered a completely new phase
of development and stands at a crucial point when historical
choices must be made.
</P>
<P>
It is very encouraging to note that the country has departed
from the short-supply economy, ranking among the top countries in
some major agricultural and industrial outputs, the leading
scientist said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, China ranks as the world's top producer of steel,
coal, cement, chemical fertilizer and televisions, and the second-
biggest producer of electricity and chemical textiles. And over 95
percent of its agricultural and industrial products are over-
stocked domestically.
</P>
<P>
However, "these are no reasons for us to feel content," the
scientist said, adding that the country is still in the initial
phase of industrialization and that the future work won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China's productivity is quite low
compared with the world's advanced levels. Most of the country's
products are turned out with backward technologies, costing more
energy and materials while lacking competitiveness in world
markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
While the low-end products are over-supplied at home, China
yearly has to import over 140 billion U.S. dollars-worth of
products, ranging from high-end textiles to computer chips, said
Song, who is also vice chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Song said that it is generally held in economic circles that
industrialization is the prerequisite for modernization,
especially in developing countries. And manufacturing is the major
force behind industrialization,
</P>
<P>
"Without a powerful manufacturing capacity, a country will have
no hope of becoming an economic power," the scientist stressed.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's manufacturing capacity lies mainly with the
medium-sized and large State-owned enterprises. Therefore, it is
of utmost importance that the country revitalizes the enterprises
through upgrading of technology and efficiency, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
The author noted that the past five decades of development laid
a solid basis for China's industrialization. However, it will take
several more decades for the country to fully realize its
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
With about one third of the country's gross domestic product
being turned into fixed capital investment this year, it can be
predicted that a large-scale industrialization drive will be
carried out in the country in the new century, the scientist
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Aftershock Jolts Indonesia's Bengkulu Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 5 on the
Richter Scale jolted Bengkulu, capital of Indonesia's Bengkulu
Province on Friday at about 07:02 local time (00:02 GMT), Antara
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But no casualties were reported due to the aftershock.
</P>
<P>
It said that the quake's epicenter was located in the Indian
Ocean about 241 kilometers southwest of Bengkulu.
</P>
<P>
The province continue to be shaken by tens of aftershocks
almost every day following the deadly quake that measured 7.9 on
the Richter Scale on June 4.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 quakes measuring more than 4 on the Richter Scale
and 1,827 light aftershocks have jolted the province since the
first powerful which killed at least 130 people and injuring more
than a thousand of others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international aid continues to flow into Bengkulu.
It was reported that more than 10 countries have so far extended
aid in the form of personnel, medical supplies or equipment for
victims of the quake.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is prone to earthquakes as it is situated at the
Pacific"Ring of Fire", a string of volcanoes and earthquake zones
that stretch from Mexico to New Zealand.

It was a positive response to the Governor General John Ini
Lapli who urged them to seek a peaceful end to country's ethnic
crisis, according to the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
In a spontaneous reconciliation gesture, fighters from both
sides put down their weapons and had a meeting at a frontline
checkpoint near Alligator Creek, on the outskirts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
AAP quoted a Malaitan Eagle Force MEF leader as saying that "
After seeing them wave to us, we left our arms and walked toward
their bunker.
</P>
<P>
"They sent militants to meet us ... we hugged each other and
shook hands. Some of us shed tears. We felt love for each other."
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that peace must be immediately restored (and) that
the government must give us amnesty to create a pathway to lasting
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two ethnic military groups have fought for 18 moths over
land rights and it led to a coup by MEF on June 5.
</P>
<P>
When the meeting ended, the fighters took up their guns again
and vowed not to disarm until a peace deal was reached.

<HEADLINE> Shark Fin Soup Excluded from Thai Airways' Menu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai Airways International Public
Company Limited (THAI) announced here Friday that it has cancelled
shark fin soup service on board THAI First and Royal Executive
Class on all international flights in support of the national
environmental and ecological preservation policy.
</P>
<P>
"THAI decided to exclude shark fin soup from our on-board menu
as part of our commitment towards environmental protection of
Thailand's flora and fauna," Bhisit Kuslasayanon, THAI's executive
vice president, was quoted as saying in a press release.
</P>
<P>
According to the recent environmental report, some 60,000
Pacific sharks were killed every year to satisfy human appetite
for shark fin soup, which is considered as delicacy in Asian
cuisine, he said.
</P>
<P>
This consumption behavior has resulted in a dramatic decline of
shark population over the years, and consequently causes
irreversible damage to the fragile marine ecosystem. The United
States House of Representatives voted to ban shark finning on June
6th, 2000, according to the press release.
</P>
<P>
"We immediately responded to passenger concern and acted in
support of world wide conservation efforts," Bhisit said.
</P>
<P>
Shark fin soup has been withdrawn from THAI's in-flight menu
from June 10th.
</P>
<P>
Other choices of dishes will be served as the alternatives
which are "equally delicious and pose no threat to the environment
", the press release said.

<HEADLINE> VAT Hike to Hit Middle, High Income Earners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A 3 percent increase in the Value
Added Tax (VAT) set in a newly released government budget will hit
middle and high income earners in Kenya, newspapers here reported
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo announced the VAT rise on
Thursday when presenting the budget plan for the 2000 to 2001
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister reduced the tariffs on imported raw
materials from 10-15 percent to 5 percent or from 5-20 percent to
2 percent in a bid to protect and stimulate the development of
local industry.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Friday that the delicate balance between
the VAT rise and tariff cuts on raw materials will benefit the
manufacturing sector but hit high income-earners hard.
</P>
<P>
The emergency measure to remove the duty on imported generators
is also a boost to the industry given current power cuts have
disrupted normal operations in the factories, local media reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy has been in the doldrums partly due to an aid
suspension by the International Monetary Fund since 1997.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Waives Duty, VAT on Imported Generators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has now
zero-rated duty and Value Added Tax (VAT) on all electrical
generators as well as wind and solar-powered ones.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to alleviate the energy crisis associated
with the current power rationing due to prolonged drought in the
country, the East African Standard newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Duty, tax and import declaration form fee exemption will be
provided for imported equipment and parts for the rehabilitation
of generators and for emergency power supply.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Power and Lighting Company also encourages
institutions and companies with generators of over 100 KVA
(kilovolt-ampere) capacity "to self-supply rather than use grid
power", said the report.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers under bond for export will be allowed to buy
"residual fuel oil free of duty", while export processing zone
enterprises can import duty free fuels for their stand-by
generators.
</P>
<P>
So far, the prolonged drought has put about 22 million Kenyans
on the verge of starvation and caused other problems like power
cuts and water crisis.

<HEADLINE> Love Letters of Romanian Poet Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 93 love letters written by
Romania's famous poet Mihai Eminescu made their public debut
Thursday, after being sealed in a safe over a century.
</P>
<P>
A collection of the letters, written between 1874 and 1883 to
his lover, Veronica Micle, was published by the Polirom publishing
house.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that the letters, kept in a Swiss bank
by Veronica's offsprings, were of great value to Eminescu
researchers.
</P>
<P>
Eminescu, who was born in 1850 and died in 1889, was considered
by Romanians as "the greatest poet in Eastern European history"
for his creation of a school of poetry that dominated Romanian
thought and the expression of Romanian writers and poets at the
end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Romanian government declared the year 2000 "the Eminescu Year"
to commemorate his 150th birthday.
</P>
<P>
Eminescu fell in love with Veronica at first sight in 1872 and
it is believed that he drew much inspiration from her love.

<HEADLINE> Subsidies to U.S. Steelmakers Detrimental to Economy: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A new study released Thursday
has found that government subsidies to large U.S. steel companies
in the past 30 years have damaged the economy.
</P>
<P>
The economic damage of protecting a handful of these steel
companies has been widespread, negatively affecting American steel-
consuming industries and the overall economy, according to the
study conducted by the American Institute for International Steel
(AIIS), an organization comprised of steel importers, exporters
and related enterprises.
</P>
<P>
American steel producers have been granted a total of more than
21 billion U.S. dollars in federal, state and local subsidies at
the expense of U.S. taxpayers over the last 30 years. These
subsidies have come in the form of pension bailouts, tax loopholes,
cheap loans, environmental exceptions, overpriced government
procurement and outright grants, the study found.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. steel industry was largely isolated from foreign
competition throughout the first half of the 20th century. Rather
than making investment to develop innovative products and lower-
cost production technologies, the big steelmakers sought higher
profits through price collusion, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Total steel industry revenues in 1998 were only 0.41 percent of
the U.S. gross domestic product.

<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite his backdown on oil price hikes earlier this week to
end the nationwide strike, President Olusegun Obasanjo Friday
insisted that the removal of subsidy for petroleum products should
go forward in the future as the only solution to stabilize the oil
sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
Post Express:
</P>
<P>
-- The Nigerian government Wednesday designated the sum of 7,
628 naira (about 76 U.S. dollars) as the new minimum monthly
salary for servicemen in the armed forces, as against the 7,500
naira (75 dollars) minimum wage for the public servants in the
government.
</P>
<P>
The Punch:
</P>
<P>
-- Nigeria's Niger Delta area has in the past 40 years made a
cumulative production of about 19 billion barrels of crude oil,
thus making the area one of the world's leading petroleum yielding
region.

<HEADLINE> Endangered Crescent Spring Refilled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The water level of the Crescent
Spring, at the foot of Mingsha Hill near Dunhuang in northwest
China's Gansu Province, rose 12 centimeters in the two-week period
ending June 12, marking the welcome end of 100 years of continuous
descent.
</P>
<P>
Named for its half-moon shape, Crescent Spring, 25 km from the
Mogao Grottoes, is surrounded by sand dunes but never fills up
with sand, even when a strong wind blows. The spring water is
always clear and tranquil.
</P>
<P>
But the water level of the famed natural spring has gradually
dropped in the past 100 years due to population growth and the
loss of underground water.
</P>
<P>
According to monitoring data, the spring's water level had gone
down nine meters by 1998. The speed of descent accelerated from a
dozen centimeters a year in recent years to the present 40 cm. Now,
the area of the spring has shrunk by half, down to 5,000 square
meters.
</P>
<P>
Scholars in many countries worry about the phenomena and fear
that this unusual bit of scenery will disappear from the desert,
and threaten the safety of the world-renowned Mogao Grottoes, said
Wang Xudong, a cultural relics expert with the Dunhuang Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government started rescue measures for the spring
as early as 1976, Wang said. In April of this year, the Lanzhou
Hydrological Center started a project to replenish underground
water feeding the spring.
</P>
<P>
As a result, an estimated 1,000 tons of water have seeped into
the spring each day, curbing the rapid drop of the water level.
Hydrogeologists are searching for ways to balance the rise in the
lake water and the seepage of underground water and how to control
the loss of underground water.
</P>
<P>
"If the problem is solved once and for all, it will give us a
frame of reference for desert improvement and will aid the
protection of the Mogao Grottoes," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Centennial Discovery of Dunhuang Caves (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG, GANSU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The unexpected discovery
of a sealed cave full of Buddhist sutras and treasures in rock
grottoes in the northwest China province of Gansu 100 years ago
astounded the world and created a famous branch of learning --
Dunhuang Studies.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang once again becomes the focus of the world as a series
of exhibitions, symposiums, and performances based on Dunhuang art
will be staged in the city starting from June 22 to mark the 100th
anniversary of the discovery of the Sutras Cave.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizing committee, more than 100 scholars
from a dozen countries will attend the coming great event
delivering over 150 papers on Dunhuang Studies.
</P>
<P>
The sutras, documents, the fine and unsurpassed frescos,
sculptures inside the Sutras Cave have in the past 100 years
attracted numerous visitors from across the world.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang once was an important caravan stop on the ancient Silk
Road, and a main passage for cultural exchanges between the east
and west in ancient times. The Dunhuang culture combines together
the local culture, central China culture, ethnic cultures in
western China and foreign cultures.
</P>
<P>
The Sutras Cave was accidentally found by a Taoist priest when
clearing the sand in the No. 16 grotto. The cave, sealed for 850
years, contains more than 50,000 pieces of relics dating between
the 4th century and 11th century.
</P>
<P>
Since the corrupt government of late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911)
had no ability to protect the relics, western big powers took the
advantage of the weak point.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign careerists and explorers from Russia, Britain, the
United States, Japan, and other countries came to the Mogao
Grottoes of Dunhuang, and stole away large number of hand-copied
sutras and printed sutras, exquisite embroidery objects, colored
sculptures and documents. Only some 7,000 to 8,000 pieces of
relics were left in the Sutras Cave.

<P>
Chinese scholars Luo Zhenyu and Wang Guowei first published
works on Dunhuang Studies in 1910. Starting from the 1920s,
Chinese scholars Liu Fu, Xiang Da and Wang Chongmin went to London
and Paris, to copy down and photograph the Dunhuang documents.
They published a group of materials on Dunhuang Studies after they
came back.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang Studies, because of their rich contents and great
values, have attracted scholars and researchers not only from
China, but also from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
China initiated the Dunhuang Art Research Institute in 1944,
and expanded related study to the grottoes art. With that, the
protection of the Mogao Grottoes began.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of new China, especially since the
implementation of reform and opening up over the past more than 20
years, Dunhuang Studies have entered a boom period.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang Research Academy, the biggest organ of this kind in
the world, was set up in 1984. Ever since then, Dunhuang Studies
have covered all subjects relating to the documents of the Sutras
Cave, architecture of Dunhuang grottoes, frescos, history and
culture of Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
Academic exchanges in this regard have been frequented since
the 1980s. There are symposiums sponsored by the Dunhuang Research
Academy, concerned organizations from Hong Kong and Taiwan,
Chinese scholars going abroad for academic exchanges and artistic
exhibitions, and foreign scholars coming to China for related
study and exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholar calls for "Moral Guideline" in Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A scholar from China's Beijing
University said today that "moral guidelines" should be strictly
adhered to in the process of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Ming, director of the university's Institute of
International Relations, made the appeal in a speech at the 21st
Century Forum -- Conference 2000, organized here by the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the concern that in today's society, moral
principles are often ignored by people in the pursuit of money, a
situation which might lead to disaster for mankind in the
increasingly interdependent society.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the performance of the hedge funds during
the Asia financial crisis received a lot of criticism. Also at the
World Trade Organization annual meeting in Seattle last December,
people showed deep concern for moral issues, especially people
from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He also quoted the 1999 report of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), which reminds people of the
seriousness of the potential world crisis and argues that more
attention should be paid to human beings, not just to profits.
</P>
<P>
The report sends the warning that if the market's major players
get out of control, the moral standard would be severely
threatened, and world justice and human rights would be sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
"The trends of globalization have raised a great obligation for
all of us. A moral guideline should be set to accompany the
economic interactions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yuan suggested that full discussion of this should be
encouraged at the UN assembly, the UNDP and the UN human rights
commission.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more dialogue should be encouraged between
developed countries and developing countries, between the "haves
and have nots," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Mining Industry Should Open Further: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China's mining industry should
open up more to meet the challenges and opportunities brought by
economic globalization, the country's former minister of Geology
and Mineral Resources said today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xun made the remarks at the ongoing "21st Century Forum",
which focuses on topics in economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
As the mining industry provided 95 percent of the energy
resources for the country's development, he said, study of the
impact of globalization on China should include the study of this
industry.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that China invite more international capital for
non-oil and non-gas resources including gold and silver.
</P>
<P>
Facing the more-complicated globalization of the mining
industry, China should build an orderly market with a favorable
environment for international investment, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging big mining companies to list overseas is an
effective way to develop China's mining industry, he said.

new stage.
</P>

profound changes, relaxation still remains as the general trend,
and the pace towards multi-polarism and economic globalization is
speeding up.
</P>
<P>
The global society aspires in the 21st Century to establish a
just and rational new political and economic order and seek a more
stable environment, Qian said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Chief Considers Reshuffle as Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Denying of political nuance in the current military reshuffle,
Widodo said, " mutation in the TNI is not an extraordinary thing.
It could happen any time. Please, don't make any perception,"he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
For the third time since President Abdurrahman Wahid took
office in October last year, the TNI on Friday morning announced a
massive tour of duty involving 122 officers in the Army, the Navy
and the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
It seems the current reshuffle was dominated by the Army which
involved 60 high-ranking officers.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Army Special Forces (Kopassus), five regional
military commanders and governor of the Indonesian Military
Academy(Akmil) were among those who underwent a transfer of duty.
</P>
<P>
Earlier rumors said that incumbent Widodo would also be
replaced by Air Force Chief of Staff, Marshal Hanafi Asnan, but it
was not proven as the two were not included in the list of
officers who underwent a tour of duty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, following a major reshuffle in the military, rumors
also has been spreading that President Wahid would also launch a
cabinet reshuffle soon.
</P>
<P>
The Kompas daily Friday wrote that Wahid had held a special
meeting with Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputeri, Speaker of
the House of Representatives (DPR) Akbar Tandjung, and Deputy
Speaker of the People's Consultatives Assembly (MPR) Matori Abdul
Djalil to talk on a possible forthcoming cabinet reshuffle.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Retrench Over 30,000 Public Servants in new Financial Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is to
retrench over 33,000 public servants in the public service and
other public institutions in the new financial year from July 2000
to June 2001.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Chris Okemo, who delivered the budget speech
in the Parliament here Thursday, said that the civil servants will
be proceeding on leave in July and August and their retirement
package will be ready by October.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the average retrenchment package for
each person will be about 240,000 Kenyan shillings (around 3,200
U.S. dollars), and some on the lower scale will receive less,
while others on higher grades will take home more.
</P>
<P>
The move will cost the government a total of 6.8 billion
shillings (about 90 million U.S. dollars) in compensation, but
save the government more than 3 billion shillings (about 40
million dollars) annually, said Okemo.
</P>
<P>
However, Okemo noted this is the first phase of the
retrenchment program and more will follow in the next financial
year in line with the government' s medium term expenditure
framework.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring process of the public service will raise
productivity so that it can effectively facilitate private sector
activities, Okemo added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin on
Thursday wrote respectively to leaders of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea to hail the success of
the inter-Korean summit.
</P>
<P>
In the letter to DPRK leader Kim Jong Il, Jiang said the summit
itself and the achievements it has made serve as a manifestation
of the long-cherished national aspiration of the DPRK people to
put an end to separation and achieve national reunification at an
early date.
</P>
<P>
"The summit, at the same time, is also the result of the
decision made by leaders of the North and the South proceeding
from their fundamental national interests and with statesman's
vision and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
"I heartily rejoice at the complete success of the North-South
summit and hereby extend my warm congratulations to General-
Secretary Kim Jong Il, the Workers' Party and the DPRK government.
"
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president reiterated that the DPRK and South Korea
are the main parties involved in the affairs of the Korean
Peninsula. China actively supports the consistent position of the
North and the South to achieve independent and peaceful
reunification through dialogues and negotiations, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
China will, as always, continue to work actively for the
maintenance of peace and stability on the peninsula, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the letter to Kim Dae-jung, Jiang said the inter-Korean
summit was a major event of historical significance. The meeting
produced constructive achievements and thus made valuable
contributions to peace and stability on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his delight and extended his congratulations
to Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the improvement of the North-South
relations serves the fundamental interests of the two sides and
the common aspiration of the Korean nation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that this summit meeting will mark a
good beginning of better mutual understanding and trust as well as
deepened exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in
various fields, leading to the eventual realization of independent
and peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Japan Eyes 24-Hour Military Medical Team For PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has drafted
a plan which allows doctors from a hospital of Japan's Self-
Defense Forces (SDF) to take turns to be on duty at the prime
minister's official residence for 24 hours a day in case the
premier falls suddenly ill, the Kyodo news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plan was drafted because of the lack of preparedness on
April 2 when then Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi suffered a
stroke at the official residence, where there was no medical staff,
and had to be taken to hospital in his secretary's van, the report
quoted government sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi died in hospital on May 14.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government envisions building a temporary
infirmary next to the official residence where doctors from the
SDF Central Hospital will be stationed, the report said, adding
that a permanent infirmary will be installed in the new prime
minister's official residence which is now under construction.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the prime minister's emergency-care system, the
Japanese government is also studying a proposal to include a
qualified paramedic in every team of the premier's bodyguards, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The plan is aimed at providing better medical treatment on a
daily basis, during emergencies, and when the prime minister is on
domestic or foreign trips.
</P>
<P>
On domestic and foreign trips, the government would designate a
local hospital at each destination, which would contact the
premier's physician-in-charge if the premier fell ill or suffered
injury, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Qualifications for Chinese Citizens to Receive Legal Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- About 400,000 Chinese citizens
have received legal aid provided free by the government since the
system was formally began in 1996, according to incomplete
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, those who are in need of legal aid far exceed the
number of 400,000 in China. What qualifications are needed for a
Chiense citizen to get the aid?
</P>
<P>
One general prerequisite: an applicant must convince legal-aid
providers that he needs the help of legal-aid system to safeguard
his legal right because that is beyond his economic ability.
</P>
<P>
In criminal cases, criminal defendants can get legal aid at any
time if he applies for it. And for criminal defendant who might be
sentenced to death but has not retained a defender, the people's
court will, regardless of the financial conditions of the
defendant, appoint a lawyer to defend for him.
</P>
<P>
Besides, legal aid is guaranteed for foreigners and stateless
persons involved in criminal cases and have to stand trial in
China.
</P>
<P>
Priorities of legal aid are given to such special groups as the
blind, deaf, dumb, minors and aged. And the courts will designate
lawyers for criminal defendants who are of above groups but have
not retained defenders for themselves.
</P>
<P>
In civil cases, the legal matter of claiming compensation by
the blind, deaf, dumb, minors and senior people for an act of tort
is listed in the legal aid scope.
</P>
<P>
However, legal aid providing is limited by such external
factors as the lack of fund and personnel. In present China, only
88 percent of all qualified legal-aid applicants actually received
legal aid.

<HEADLINE> China to Celebrate Discovery of Sutras Cave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China is to hold a series of grand
ceremonies in July in Beijing and northwest China's Gansu Province
to mark the centenary of the discovery of the Sutras Cave and the
formation of Dunhuang Studies.
</P>
<P>
In 1900, a Taoist priest, Wang Yuanlu, discovered a cave at
Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang where contained more than 50,000 sutras,
documents and paintings of nearly 10 dynasties ranging from 4th to
the 11th century.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the activities is to improve the research and
protection of Mogao Grottoes and make the history of China and
Central Asia better known by people in other parts of the world,
said Zhang Tianli, deputy secretary-general of Gansu Provincial
Government.
</P>
<P>
A conference will be held at the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing on July 6 to commemorate the two occasions.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition on Duanhuang Arts, the largest of its kind ever
held in the country, is to be held at the Museum of Chinese
History between July 4 and August 31. Apart from relics of the
Sutras Cave, the exhibits include pictures and duplicates of
relics of the Sutras Cave preserved abroad for many years.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony will be held in Gansu on July 29 to commend Chinese
and foreign individuals and research institutes and organizations
which have done outstanding achievements in Dunhuang Studies.
</P>
<P>
An international symposium on the discovery of the Sutras Cave
and the establishment of Dunhuang Studies will be held between
July 29 and August 3. Some 200 Dunhuang experts from a dozen of
countries and regions will exchange views on new discoveries and
development of Dunhuang Studies in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang, popularly known as the Thousand
Buddha Caves, were carved out of the rocks stretching for about 1,
600 meters along the eastern side of the Mingsha Hill, 25 km
southeast of Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
A Tang Dynasty inscription records that the first cave in the
Mogao Grottoes was made in 366 A.D. Despite erosion and man-made
destruction, the 492 caves are well preserved, with frescoes
covering an area of 45,000 square meters, more than 2,000 colored
sculptured figures and five wooden eaves overhanging the caves.
</P>
<P>
According to archaeologists, it is the greatest and most
consummate repository of Buddhist art in the world. The United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
listed the Mogao Grottoes on the World Heritage List in 1987.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales of consumer goods
jumped by 11.5 percent in May over one year earlier, registering
the highest growth rate since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) here today, retail sales surged to 263.69 billion
yuan in May.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales rose by 2.5 percent in May over April.
</P>
<P>
NBS said that the consumer goods market was in a vigorous phase,
largely due to a seven-day holiday around the May 1 festival.
</P>
<P>
Revenue of domestic tourism soared to 18.1 billion yuan during
the holiday, four billion yuan more than in the National Day
holiday in last October. The May 1 holiday contributed two
percentage points to the monthly growth of retail sales in May.
</P>
<P>
According to NBS, the growth was unbalanced: Retail sales in
cities surged by 12.6 percent over the previous month, 2.7
percentage points higher than the growth in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> China to Regulate Intermediary Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
enhance regulating intermediary services as part of its effort to
strengthen management and administration this year, Minister of
Finance Xiang Huaicheng said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told an international symposium on intermediary services and
development of the market economy held in Beijing that China is
moving more quickly to develop an intermediary sector that is in
line with both local conditions and international practice.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by the Chinese Institute of
Certified Public Accountants. This was the first large-scale
activity of international exchanges that the organization held
since it was merged with other two major associations of
intermediary services, namely associations of certified property
assessment agents and certified taxation agents.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants is now in
charge of nearly 300,000 people with professional qualifications
and tens of thousands of intermediate agencies.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that China is now regulating the process of
certifying professional agencies, cutting off the links between
some intermediate agencies with government and regulating the
activities of the government and professional associations to
supervise and administrate the sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that as China gets closer to joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO), it will gradually open up the service sectors
such as legal, accounting, taxation and consulting services.
</P>
<P>
China is modifying its laws and regulations so as to eliminate
obstacles to international trade and foreign investment in the
intermediary service sector and lift the services to international
standards.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Legislature Promotes Rule of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of
Provincial People's Congress of southwest China's Sichuan Province
is busy revising local laws and regulations to be ready for the
country's grand plan to develop the west, a senior official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The provincial legislature is also planning to promulgate 15
local laws on environmental protection and other areas, said Meng
Junxiu, vice-chairman of the standing committee of the provincial
people's congress.
</P>
<P>
This is only part of the most recent efforts made by the
Sichuan legislature in promoting the rule of law in the province,
Meng said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997, the provincial legislature adopted a resolution
on promoting the rule of law, and enforced it afterwards by
formulating a more comprehensive legal framework, and
strengthening supervision over the government, court and
prosecution bodies.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, more than 80 percent of the people's deputies, from
provincial down to township level people's congresses, were
organized to assess the work performance of government officials,
judges and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
As a result, procuratorates redressed 250 mishandled cases and
meted out punishments to 161 prosecutors for their mistakes.
Courts across the province corrected 500 misjudged lawsuits and 51
top level court officials have been replaced.
</P>
<P>
And today, a redress mechanism for misjudgment and injustice
has been instituted in all the courts and procuratorates in the
province, and complaint centers targeting judicial unfairness are
emerging throughout the province, Meng said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
verification team is expected to resume its work on the Lebanese
border Friday, after it was abruptly interrupted Thursday when an
Israel Defense Force (IDF) unit fired five shots at the team, in
what was called a "stupid" mistake.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was scheduled to brief the
Security Council about the verification team's mission Friday,
leading to speculation that UNIFIL would complete its confirmation
of the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon Friday morning. Annan
is expected to visit Lebanon on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The meeting Thursday night between the ruling bloc of One
Israel and Israel's religious ultra-Orthodox Shas party on
legitimizing Shas' pirate radio stations ended in disagreement,
prompting sources in One Israel to say that their impression was
that Shas was looking for every possible way to leave the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Still, despite the crisis atmosphere, the feeling in One Israel
was that the breakdown of the talks was "tactical" and that by
Sunday morning -- when Shas cabinet ministers are supposed to
submit their letters of resignation at the cabinet meeting -- it
will be possible to reach an agreement that will avert such a
development.
</P>
<P>
Shas decided on Tuesday to leave the coalition in protest
against the government's failure to meet their demands on school
funding.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman, celebrating his 76th birthday
Thursday, said he believes peace will be achieved with Syria "
within my lifetime." He also expressed the hope that Bashar al-
Assad, the would-be president of Syria, will bring a change in
Syrian policy and attitude toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that because Bashar has not been through the same
wars as his father and other leaders in the region, he would be
more pragmatic in dealing with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will visit the
Middle East at the end of next week to see if conditions are yet
ripe for a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The long-expected summit will be hosted in Washington by
President Bill Clinton to complete the framework agreement for a
permanent settlement.
</P>
<P>
Barak has urged Clinton to convene the summit as soon as
possible, arguing that the time has come to have the highest level
deal on the thorny issues.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy in Cyprus to Prepare for More Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General's special
advisor for Cyprus Alvaro de Soto has arrived here to prepare for
the new round of proximity talks between the island's two
communities.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, upon his arrival Thursday night
at the Larnaca airport on Cyprus' southern coast, de Soto refrained
from any comment of substance, saying "the purpose of my visit here
is to prepare for the proximity talks."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkish invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island country in the wake of a failed pro-
Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is pushing for reunification of Cyprus under a
bicommunal bizonal federation formula but all efforts have so far
failed.
</P>
<P>
De Soto has conducted two rounds of proximity talks between the
two communities, in December 1999 and in February this year, with
the aim to pave the way for meaningful negotiations leading to a
comprehensive settlement on Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks is scheduled to begin on July 5 in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Saturday de Soto will have contacts with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, and others.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, the new chief of Mission of the U.N.
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, Zbigniew Wlosowicz, arrived here to
assume his duties.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to accompany de Soto to his meetings here in the
next three days. De Soto is scheduled to leave Sunday.

ANKARA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in Turkish newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
YeniBinyil (New Millennium):
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, very much worried about
tensions between the three partners of the coalition government,
said "Turkey has just grabbed a fine opportunity. Now this may be
destroyed. If early elections are held, everything will be upside
down. Relations with the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund will be damaged."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit warned that those responsible for this development will
be unable to defend themselves before the public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Chairman of the Turkish Central Bank Gazi Ercel said that the
decisive attitude of the politicians had paved the way for the
success of the economic program and that economic stability had in
turn paved the way for the political stability.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants a political crisis in this stable economic
atmosphere," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Upset by the U.N. Security Council decision to extend the
mandate of the U.N. force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) Wednesday, the
Turkish Cypriots were weighing up the next steps to be taken.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council's decision to drop an addendum,
pacifying the angry Greek Cypriot authorities, has angered the
Turkish Cypriot side prior to the forthcoming third round of Cyprus
proximity talks, slated to start in Geneva on July 5.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Overseas Debt Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The increase in total overseas debt arose from an increase in
corporate sector borrowing and a falling New Zealand dollar.
</P>
<P>
Changes in the value of the New Zealand dollar contributed an
estimated 3.8 billion NZ dollars (1.8 billion U.S. dollars) to the
rise in New Zealand's total overseas debt.
</P>
<P>
From April 1999 to March 2000, New Zealand's corporate sector
overseas debt rose 7.7 billion NZ dollars (3.65 billion U.S.
dollars) to 92.7 billion NZ dollars (43.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
While corporate sector overseas debt continues to rise,
official sector overseas debt is falling. During the period
official sector overseas debt reduced 1.5 billion NZ dollars (710
million U.S.dollars) to 16.4 billion NZ dollars (7.76 billion U.S.
dollars),comprising 15 percent of total overseas debt.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of New Zealand's total overseas debt to the total
value of exports of goods and services now stands at 329.4 percent,
down from 336.5 percent a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Austria Welcomes EU Resolution on Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas Klestil
Thursday welcomed a European Parliament resolution which called
for steps to solve the Austrian problem, a press release from
Klestil's office said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution concerning the upcoming European Union (EU)
summit in Feira, Portugal, asked Portugal, the current EU
president, to evaluate the relationship between Vienna and its 14
EU partners and, with the unanimous approval of all EU commissions,
to find a "acceptable solution" to sanctions against Austria.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was approved in Strasbourg, France on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Austria's 14 EU partners imposed sanctions against it when it
formed a new government on February 4 incorporating the ultra-
right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres told Reuters on
Wednesday that the EU would not change its attitudes drastically,
but might "open a door" for solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told Austrian
television that the 14 countries were holding consultations about
the sanctions, which he said have become "an obstacle" in
bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company to Provide Digital Distribution of Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. companies said
Thursday that they will form a joint venture to provide digital
distribution of films along with support services. They aim to
begin trials of the delivery system in early 2001.
</P>
<P>
The move combines Qualcomm Inc., a wireless communications
company, and Technicolor, a major film printing and distribution
company.
</P>
<P>
"This new entity will combine the two companies' complementary
strengths to create an open, standards-based end-to-end
distribution solution for digital cinema," said Lanny Raimondo,
Technicolor's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, to be called Technicolor Digital Cinema,
would compete against a similar venture combining computer
networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. and Qwest Communications
International Inc., which showcased their digital movie
distribution technology earlier this month when they beamed sci-fi
animated epic "Titan A.E." over an Internet-based network.
</P>
<P>
Film studios are backing digital cinema, which results in
higher quality movies and lower distribution costs. But so far,
wrangling over who -- studios or theater owners -- would pay the
high costs of installing projection systems in theaters has
delayed deployment.

<HEADLINE> Train Derails in U.S., Leaking Acid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Six cars of a freight train
were on fire and one leaked sulfuric acid after the 17-car train
derailed near Colton, a city 80 kilometers east of Los Angeles,
Thursday, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department said
crews are also investigating a possible breach of the California-
Nevada gasoline pipeline, which runs near the tracks outside
Colton.
</P>
<P>
"When the train derailed it broke the cement of a containment
area that protects the pipeline," spokesman Dave Dowling said. "We
don't know at this point if there was product in the pipeline, if
it was involved, if it was leaking or even if there was a breach."
</P>
<P>
So far no injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
Dowling also said that one tanker car was believed to be
carrying diesel fuel and the other was holding sulfuric acid.
</P>
<P>
Televised reports showed a plume of smoke rising from one of
the tankers, but fire officers said it was from a small grass fire
that was quickly put out. Some sulfuric acid leaked, but the spill
was described as minor.
</P>
<P>
There was no plan to either close the freeway or to evacuate
nearby homes, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Digital Divide More Economic Than Ethnic in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 15 (Xinhua) -- There is a gap in U.S.
Internet usage among various ethnic groups, but the biggest gap
exists between the rich and the poor, according to a study
released Thursday by an American research company.
</P>
<P>
Jupiter Communications' research found that less than half of
American households with average annual incomes of less than 15,
000 U.S. dollars, which represents 19 percent of the total U.S.
population, will have entered the Internet population by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The wealthiest households, those with incomes of more than 75,
000 dollars, will continue to represent the biggest single segment,
with 15 million such households online by the end of 2000, the
study said. That figure will approach 20 million in 2005. The
poorest segment, those with incomes of less than 15,000 dollars,
will represent only 3 million online households, growing to 9
million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Ethnically, 60 percent more white households are online than
African-American households are. While African-American and
Hispanic-American segments have the lowest Internet penetration,
at 30 percent and 33 percent in 1999 respectively, they have each
exceeded critical mass.
</P>
<P>
Jupiter forecasts that 4.6 million African-American households
will be online by the end of 2000, compared with 3.8 million
Hispanic- American households and 2.2 million Asian-American
households.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by market analysis firm Forrester Research came
to a similar conclusion. It found that ethnic background alone
does not explain the existence of a digital divide. Although a
combination of factors determines if a consumer is online, income
is the strongest predictor. Other drivers of Internet use include
age, education and technology optimism, the firm said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Prosecutors Continue Investigating Soeharto: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The investigation into Indonesian
former president Soeharto will be continued despite a pledge that
he will return his assets to the state which has been illegally
amassed during his 32 years in power, an official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, spokesman of the Attorney General'
s Office Yushar Yahya said that although Soeharto and his family
will return their assets to the state, the investigation into him
keeps going on.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of law," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
But Yahya said that the Attorney General's Office has not
received any official report on the talks between the government
representatives with Soeharto's family on the planning of asset
restitution.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received any official report on such a plan (asset
return). Just wait the official statement from the government," he
said responding on reports contained by news media that Soeharto
and his family are going to return their fortune to the state.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that President Abdurrahman Wahid has appointed
Minister of Mines and Energy Soesilo Bambang Yudhoyono as a sole
negotiator in talks with Soeharto's family on a plan of asset
return and the negotiation between the government and Soeharto's
family is on the way.
</P>
<P>
The president assured that the talks would not affect the legal
process against Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
But lawyers representing Soeharto's family denied that any
conversation between the two sides (the government and Soeharto's
family) had occurred.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old Soeharto, who has been named as a suspect in
the investigation, stepped down as president amid massive student
protests and economic crisis in May 1998.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Prime Minister on Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Friday stressed that globalization, now a fact of
life, is not inherently destructive but what is destructive is the
abuses which globalization make possible.
</P>
<P>
Sharing his view on globalization with participants at the
Millennium Leaders Summit for the International Meetings Industry,
he said one clear and obviously bad encounter with globalization
is the recent Asian financial crisis where rapid flows of capital
across borders brought about exchange rate instability, countries
losing money, businesses being destabilized and masses of people
becoming poor, he said when opening the summit.
</P>
<P>
"The only people profiting from this particular manifestation
of globalization were the currency manipulators. Other than this
groups of very, very rich people, no one really gained. Millions
of people lost their jobs and billions of dollars of hard-earned
wealth vanished," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said "the question that begs to be asked is whether
globalization must result in periodical massive economic turmoil
for the whole world. Cannot there be a way to design and regulate
globalization so as to benefit the poor while not impoverishing
the rich? Indeed, cannot the rich further enrich themselves
without causing economic turmoil and impoverishing the countries
targeted ?"
</P>
<P>
He said the hedge funds discovered that they could actually
influence fluctuations in exchange rates by pushing the value of
currencies up or down simply by selling or buying a particularly
currency.
</P>
<P>
Blaming the recent economic and financial turmoil entirely on
manipulation by hedge funds, Mahathir said they had made use of
free unregulated markets to make money for themselves alone and in
the process strangled real businesses, including the tourist
business.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was of the view that economic turmoil could be
prevented if "we are prepared to recognize the culprits and
regulate their activities."
</P>
<P>
However, the world was apparently not yet ready to name the
culprits and act against them, he told the participants.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Millennium Leaders Summit for the International
Meetings Industry which opened here Friday will address five key
issues: globalization and regionalization, industry recognition,
education, technology as well as standards and best practices
facing the global meetings, incentives, conferences and
exhibitions (MICE) market.

<HEADLINE> Asia Becoming Popular in Hosting International Meetings: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 16 (Xinhua) -- As the Meetings, Incentives,
Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE) industry experiences positive
growth worldwide, Asia is becoming increasely popular and enjoys a
good share of the market, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
With the increase in the MICE traffic to this region, Malaysia
is positioning itself to gain from this opportunity by offering an
attractive range of convention services and the necessary
infrastructure, he told participants of the Millennium Leaders
Summit for the International Meetings Industry which opened here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the MICE industry, a sub-sector of the tourism industry,
has a significant role in the economy with its worldwide value
estimated at 280 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"It is a rapidly growing industry which provides significant
economic and employment benefits to the city and country that
hosts the meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
In competing for international tourists, meetings or conference
travelers are among the most sought after target groups as they
spend three times as much as tourists, he added.
</P>
<P>
He believed now that Malaysia has made a convincing economic
recovery, prospects for a strong upturn in the meetings industry
would even be much brighter.
</P>
<P>
Apart from strong economic growth, factors which have a
positive impact on the development of the MICE industry include a
stable political situation and attractive investment opportunities
which would draw foreign investors and businessmen to the country,
he said, adding all these are evident and present in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the three-day meeting will address five key
issues: globalization and regionalization, industry recognition,
education, technology as well as standards and best practices
facing the global MICE market.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Prepare Report on Combating Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar held a workshop here
Thursday on the preparation of a national report on the
implementation of the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (
UNCCD).
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the country's National Commission for
Environmental Affairs, is to inform the parties to the UNCCD on
the situation of Myanmar with regard to the measures taken for the
implementation of the convention at national level, said official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar Friday.
</P>
<P>
The UNCCD was adopted in June 1994 in Paris, France, and
Myanmar acceded to the convention in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
To combat desertification, Myanmar has launched a national
project of greening nine critical districts of the arid zone in
central part of the country since 1994, which was later extended
to 13 districts in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has rich resources in forestry and although there is no
area in the country that can be strictly called a sandy desert,
the central part of the nation is hot and dry and is referred to
as the dry zone.
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of Myanmar's land area are covered with forest,
of which 18.6 percent are reserved and protected public forests,
and the country is planning to increase the area to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 30,375 hectares of forest plantations are
established annually.

<HEADLINE> Uganda-Rwanda Conflicts Hard to End (by Ding Qilin, Wang Shangzhi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The situation appeared calm over
the past five days in Kisangani city, northeast of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), following a six-day fighting between
Ugandan and Rwandan troops.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting, triggered by an attack on and destruction
of a vehicle of the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) on June
5, left at least 150 civilians dead and 1,114 others wounded,
according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops, based in Kisangani, the third
largest city of the country to support rival rebel factions
fighting against Congolese President Laurent Kabila, also combated
each other in early May, killing at least 50 civilians.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the two countries and army chiefs of the two
former allies agreed to demilitarize the Kisangani city and troops
would be withdrawn 100 meters away from the city center after the
early May clashes.
</P>
<P>
However, only a month later, the UPDF and the Rwandan Patriotic
Army (RPA) went into clashes again.
</P>
<P>
During the six-day fighting, quite a few cease-fires were
brokered or announced. The United Nations brokered a cease-fire
last Thursday, which was agreed upon by Rwandan President Paul
Kagame and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni. But it was
violated just hours later after rival armies exchanged artillery
fires and fought fierce street battles near the city center.
</P>
<P>
The UPDF declared a unilateral cease-fire with the precondition
that the U.N. observer team would establish presence on its side
before the cease-fire was agreed on by multi-parties. The
unilateral cease-fire was again not carried out.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the U.N. team in Congo was deployed between
Rwandan and Ugandan forces, stationing themselves on both sides of
the Tchopo bridge in the Kisangani city center. The team moved in
after the UPDF's pullout from the bridge to the original base at
Kapalata, seven kilometers north of the bridge, but the RPA
claimed that the UPDF was driven out of the city center.
</P>
<P>
Guns are at last silent in the city now, but the conflicts
between the two countries may take a different form.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Rwandan President Kagame openly attacked Ugandan
President Museveni for the first time, accusing him of being "part
of the problem in Kisangani." On his part, Museveni described
Rwandan leaders as "frivolous and egoistic" and Rwandans as "
drunkards", according to local media.
</P>
<P>
Both the Ugandan and Rwandan leaders said the fighting in
Kisangani was stupid and regrettable.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the rivals have said, the conflicts between the two
former allies are far from being over, and their relations can
hardly improve in the near future, observers here say.

<HEADLINE> Health of Romanians Deteriorates Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The health of the Romanians is
deteriorating sharply as the cardiovascular and cancer-related
mortality rates are increasing rapidly, a report of the WHO said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 50 percent of the Romanians under the
age of 64 died of cardiovascular diseases or cancers, and more
than 85 percent of those above 65 were killed by the same diseases.
There is also a high rate of deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis or
heptatocirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
The infant and maternal mortality rate in Romania is one of the

eight times as high as the average of European Union countries,
the report said.

<P>
The report said the declining health of the Romanians is not
only a result of the country's worsening living and medical
standards, but also closely related to the bad habits of life of
the Romanians.

Romania now has one of the largest smoking population in
European countries, and its liquor and tobacco consumption has

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy to Buy 222 New Jet Fighters over Next Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy will spend 8.96
billion U.S. dollars to buy 222 new F/A-18E/F jet fighters from
Boeing Co. over the next five years, the Defense Department said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The versatile, carrier-based "Super Hornet" attack jets are the
biggest military aviation program for the Navy and Boeing. All 222
planes are to be delivered by September 2006.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy plans to spend 45 billion dollars purchasing 548
of the upgraded version of F/A-18s over the next decade. The total
cost, including development, is estimated at 47 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In February, the Navy said the new F/A-18E/F fighter, designed
to replace the Navy's current F-18C and aging F-14 attack jets,
had passed flight tests with the highest marks and that the Super
Hornet would be ready for deployment in two years.
</P>
<P>
The new model plane features longer range, more advanced
weaponry and better defense against enemy ground fire and air
threats.
</P>
<P>
"The Super Hornet is the cornerstone of future naval aviation,"
Navy Chief of Operations Jay Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy hopes to put the first Super Hornet squadron
aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's HCB Dam Complex Chairman Calls for Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Privatization is the best solution
to the deficit problem of the Cahora Bassa dam and hydroelectric
complex (HCB) in the western province of Tete, HCB Chairman
Antonio Veiga Anjos said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar marking the 25th anniversary of the
operation of the company, Anjos said it is better to privatize the
HCB than keep it as a public company.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 percent of the shares in the HCB, which was founded in
the 1970s and is now reportedly worth 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, is
owned by Portugal, with the remaining 18 percent belonging to
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Cahora Bassa is designed to sell electricity to South Africa,
the largest buyer, and Zimbabwe. Only a small amount of its power
is being consumed in Mozambique, supplied to towns in the central
and northern regions.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of Cahora Bassa has never been proposed. The
original idea was to hand over the dam to the Mozambican side when
the country pays off its debts.
</P>
<P>
But this transfer has not happened as the HCB cannot sell power
to its main client, the South African electricity company of Eskom,
because the transmission lines have been always destroyed by
Renamo rebels.
</P>
<P>
"I think the question of ownership is not important," Veiga
Anjos said. "What is important is whether Cahora Bassa can make
contribution to the development of Mozambique in this increasingly
globalized world."
</P>
<P>
Veiga Anjos added that the HCB, which has been fully operating
for only two and a half years during its 25-year existence, has
not fulfilled its main objective of "stimulating the development
of Mozambique and the Zambezi valley."

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Hikes One-Month Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia hiked the interest
rate on its one-month paper by an unusually sharp amount, sending
the rate to a five-month high amid concerns over the weakness of
the rupiah currency, the Indonesian Observer reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said its weekly auction of one-month
certificates (SBIs) produced a weighted average interest rate of
11.32 percent versus 11.13 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
Usually, the rate changes by only a few basis points from week
to week. The jump in the benchmark SBI rate took it to its highest
level since January 12, when the rate was 11.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
SBI rates have generally been on a downward trend since peaking
at more than 70 percent in 1998 at the height of the country's
economic crisis. But rates have been pushed up in recent weeks to
help defend the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The move did give the currency a boost on Wednesday, lifting it
to 8,495/8,525 to the U.S. dollar versus 8,580/8,595 in late local
trade on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian currency of rupiah plunged into a six-month
lowest level of 8,500 per U.S. dollar recently.

<P>
Of the 621 projects, 390 are now in commercial operation around
the country providing over 56,000 direct and indirect employment
opportunities, the official told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Some of these projects will be set up in the Southern province
to ease the acute unemployment problem in the south region of the
country.
</P>
<P>
These projects were partly responsible for the decrease in Sri
Lanka's unemployment rate to 8.6 percent last year from 13.6
percent in 1994, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A steady decline in unemployment in recent years has been a
reflection of the rapid economic growth and the resultant growth
of employment opportunities in projects using the attractive
incentives offered by the Sri Lankan government, the official said,
adding that the incentive package introduced through the 1995
Budget was primarily aimed to meet challenges in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> (rpt) E-signatures Bill Passed by U.S. Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Striking a deal or making a
contract online will soon be possible after U.S. Congress passed a
bill that gives electronic-signatures the same status as ink-and-
paper signatures.
</P>
<P>
The electronic-signature and record keeping bill, passed 426 to
4 by Congress on Wednesday, will make it easier for both companies
and consumers to do business online.
</P>
<P>
For instance, computer users would be able to take out
mortgages, buy insurance, even enter a binding contract with their
roofer without ever leaving their home, signing a piece of paper
or waiting for back-and-forth of mailed paperwork.
</P>
<P>
And business negotiating contracts with each other could enter
binding agreements without having to send paper documents
overnight.
</P>
<P>
"Approval of this legislation will ensure that American
businesses and consumers can take advantage of the digital
revolution," says Rick Lane, the U.S. The technology that allows
for secure e-signature and Internet technology. He calls the
measure "a historic step for e-commerce and the future of the
American economy."
</P>
<P>
The technology to allow for secure e-signatures is still being
developed, however. Among the approaches are encrypted numeric
coding devices and fingerprint or iris scans attached to computers
that verify a person's identity.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to pass the bill later this week.

TIRANA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense Minister Sergio
Mattarella signed a memorandum on national defense cooperation
with his Albanian counterpart Luan Hajdaraga here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers said at a joint press conference that the
memo stressed the intention of the two countries to strengthen
defense cooperation and specified areas and contents for future
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the memo, the Italian Defense Ministry will shift its
military assistance to the Albanian army from the only focus on
the defense sector as it did in the past to facilitating the
reform and modernization drive of the Albanian troops.
</P>
<P>
The Italian side will also help Albania build runways at Vlore
and Pishkore, upgrade an Albanian air-force college and supply
necessary facilities to Albanian peace-keeping troops dispatched
to the Balkan region, Hajdaraga said.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit to Albania, Italian Minister
Mattarella also inspected Italian peace-keeping troops in Durres
and met Albanian President Rexhep Meidani and Prime Minister Ilir
Meta.
</P>
<P>
This is the first Italian cabinet minister that has visited

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Faithfully Implement OAU Peace Plan: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will faithfully
implement the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement proposed by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"When we accepted the OAU peace proposal, we meant it; and we
will implement every comma of that document faithfully," Meles
said, briefing local diplomatic corps here.
</P>
<P>
Meles made the remarks one day after his cabinet announced
acceptation of the OAU peace proposal aimed at ending the two-year-
old border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
An Ethiopian government spokesperson said Thursday that Foreign
Minister Seyoum Mesfin is to return to Algiers on Sunday to sign
the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement under the auspices of the
OAU.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, which accepted the OAU peace proposal last week, will
also sign the peace document this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been at war due to border disputes
since May 1998. On May 12, a new round of heavy fighting between
the two countries broke out along their 1,000-kilometer border.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the OAU's sustained mediation, foreign ministers of
the two countries held their second round of talks in Algiers
between May 29 and June 10 after their first round failed about a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
According to Meles, following the signing of the cease-fire
document, the two sides will start negotiations on a comprehensive
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said Ethiopia expects the negotiations will address
effectively the issues of border demarcation and delimitation on
the basis of colonial treaties and applicable international laws.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of demarcation and delimitation comes only
after we have a comprehensive peace agreement," said Meles.
</P>
<P>
"We also expect the issue of compensation, not reparation,
would be addressed adequately and quickly within the context of
the peace agreement," the prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> KFOR Searches for Weapons in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led peacekeeping force
in Kosovo (KFOR) Thursday started searches for weapons in the
Drenica Valley, center of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian separatist
fighters, a KFOR spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The cordon and search operation, launched by the British-led
peacekeepers stationed in the central sector of Kosovo, started at
5:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) and is expected to last at least two days,
Captain Katherine Hurley said.
</P>
<P>
Around 300 British, Finnish, Norwegian and Czech troops
entered designated search zones, sealing off villages before
combing them for weapons depots, she said, adding "This is
possibly the biggest planned operation we have had" in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The weapon searches came after ethnic violence flared up in
recent weeks in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province troubled with ethnic
conflicts and policed by NATO-led troops since the end of the
military bloc's 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Eight Serbs were killed and more than 20 others injured in
recent attacks. KFOR peacekeepers, especially British soldiers,
have also been targets.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a bomb was left outside Pristina's U.N. police
station, just 30 meters from the headquarters of one of the
British regiments that make up the KFOR peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
KFOR made sweeps of small towns near the provincial capital
Pristina earlier this week, including Serb communities,
discovering 12 rifles, a rocket launcher, two grenades, four
bayonets, two machine gun tripods and more than 3,000 bullets.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Tour Mideast to Assess Summit Chances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will return to the Middle East for the third
time in a month to assess the feasibility of a summit between
Israeli and Palestinian leaders and President Bill Clinton, the
State Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary will go in about 10 days to determine if a
summit would be useful or whether we need to continue talks,"
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said to reporters at a
briefing. "It will be an assessment to determine if we are ready,
close enough to go to a summit," he added.
</P>
<P>
Boucher said that U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross will go back
to the Middle East early next week after the Israeli-Palestinian
talks here wind up in a few days.
</P>
<P>
The decision for Albright to return to the Middle East was made
after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday blast Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak for lacking the desire to work for peace.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here Wednesday evening, held a three-hour
discussion with Clinton at the White House earlier Thursday to
assess the Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators began "final status"
negotiations at two U.S. air force bases in the Washington area on
Tuesday, but on Wednesday the talks hit an impasse on issues over
Palestinian prisoners and a third Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Following the Clinton-Arafat summit, the two sides have agreed
to restart the suspended peace talks and carry on through this
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Council Ask For Athletes' Personal Olympic Targets </HEADLINE>

<P>
JAKARTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) has urged 11 sports organizations, whose athletes
are preparing for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney in September,
to set maximum targets in the quadrennial event.
</P>
<P>
"By August, athletes must be able to set the highest targets
they expect to reach in the Olympics. They should also achieve the
maximum technical and physical conditions needed to compete in the
event," executive training program director Imron Z.S. was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Imron pointed to women's tennis player Wynne Prakusya, who is
still expecting a wild card from the International Tennis
Federation and the International Olympics Committee, saying that
KONI would not insist upon her reaching the Olympics main draw.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have high expectations for her to win any medals as
it has been difficult for her to qualify. But she must set her own
target anyway," he said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Hadi Nazri, deputy in charge of athletes'
development at the Badminton Association of Indonesia, said the
association (PBSI) was considering a changeover in its officials'
composition in July.
</P>
<P>
"After we evaluate our team's performances in the Thomas and
Uber Cup championships, we will study the possibility of the
changeover, which will include the team's coaches," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hadi declined, however, to name any officials to be replaces.
</P>
<P>
He also said PBSI would stage weekly simulations for the
Olympic-trained shuttlers beginning in July.
</P>
<P>
"The simulations might be held each Friday in Jakarta. But we
have yet to decide whether we will use the indoor stadium or the
indoor tennis courts at the Senayan sports complex," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said PBSI would send non-Olympics qualifiers to compete in
the Thailand Open badminton championships which start on July 2
while the qualifiers would focus on their performances in the
Indonesia Open from July 19 to 23 at the Senayan stadium here.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Strengthens Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Investment in environmental
protection in this Chinese capital is expected to exceed 100
billion yuan (12 billion U.S. dollars) between 1998 and 2007,
accounting for more than four percent of the city's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) for the ten-year period.
</P>
<P>
For the first five years during the ten-year period, Beijing
will inject 46.6 billion yuan into the environmental protection
endeavor, to reduce pollution in air and water, and facilitate
garbage disposal and industrial restructuring, said Yu Xiaoxuan,
deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection
Administration.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the city has already taken 82 concrete measures to
bring clean rivers and blue sky back to the capital.
</P>
<P>
Clean energies such as natural gas have been put into household
use in the downtown area, while the city started as of 1999 to
adopt a higher standard for automobile emissions, phasing out
about 50,000 outdated automobiles.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive project aimed at reducing water pollution has
also been completed, disposing of 1.784 million cubic meters of
silt, laying out 45.3 kilometers of sewage pipes, and greatly
improving the water quality in the rivers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing invested more than ten billion
yuan in environmental protection in 1999 alone, accounting for 4.5
percent of the city's GDP. The city has put on a much-improved
look as a result of the intensified pollution control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will focus its environmental protection efforts on air
pollution reduction in the future, according to Yu Xiaoxuan. To
meet the goal, the city plans to increase its investment in that
regard to 56 billion yuan between 2003 and 2007.

<HEADLINE> New Plan Unveiled to Tackle Deserts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
unveiled a new environmental plan to reduce desert areas and
prevent dust storms in north China, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science and Technology has divided the target
areas into four different ecosystems and come up with four
corresponding strategies to address the problems.
</P>
<P>
The four ecosystems are the capital circle, the agriculture and
animal husbandry belt, the grassland belt and the desert and oasis
belt.
</P>
<P>
According to the strategies, the capital circle which includes
Beijing, Tianjin municipalities and Zhangjiakou and Chengde in
Hebei province will be planted with more trees, grass and flowers
over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the ministry's plan is to basically control
desertification in the capital circle by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture and husbandry belt includes the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region and provinces of Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi and
Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
In addition to planting more trees, shrubs and grass,
cultivation of high-yield crops will be increased to use more land
for pastures in the area.
</P>
<P>
As to the grassland belt which spans mainly Inner Mongolia,
efforts will be made to increase grass coverage by limiting
grazing, and man-made fodder industry will be encouraged to
protect existing grasslands.
</P>
<P>
The desert and oasis belt includes Qinghai and Gansu provinces,
Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions and western
Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
More shelter forests will be planted around farm and pastures,
residential areas and along roads and railways, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's 4.8 Percent Growth Insufficient for Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is expected to
achieve a 4.8 percent economic growth in the 1999/2000 financial
year, which ends on June 30, but it is still not enough to
alleviate poverty, the government has said.
</P>
<P>
Tabling a three-year economic development plan before the
National Assembly, Nassor Malocho, minister of state in the
President's Office, said in Dodoma Wednesday that at least a rate
of 6 percent to 7 percent in the coming years could help alleviate
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's development blueprint dubbed Vision 2025 recommends
that at least an 8 percent GDP growth rate is necessary if efforts
to eradicate poverty by 2010 are to be realized and 12 percent for
complete eradication in 2025.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that half of Tanzania's 30 million population
live below the poverty line surviving on an income of less than 0.
65 U.S. dollars per day.

<HEADLINE> Fall Webworms Threaten Trees in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Fall webworms, a United States
indigenous pest, are on a rampage in north China's port city of
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The hot, dry weather has created prime conditions for the
reproduction of the plant-eating white moth with black-spotted
wings.
</P>
<P>
"If we lose the first battle against the first generation of
fall webworms by the end of this month, we will lose everything,"
said Chen Jingang, an official with the municipal gardening
administration.
</P>
<P>
The first case of fall webworms in Tianjin was reported in 1995.
The worm has not yet met its natural enemies in the Chinese city
where it has lived for so short a time. Some bird species will not
touch the worm, which has been found mainly inhabiting the Chinese
ash, and trees in the city's residential quarters.
</P>
<P>
The fall webworm is listed as one of the world's six most
dangerous pests. Each worm can lay up to 10,000 eggs. Though it
has only a one-month life span, the worm can eat its way through
an abundance of tree leaves, grass, and other plants.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is now trying to kill the webworm eggs with pesticides
and other chemicals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A new list of medicines covered by
government-subsidized medical care has been released by the
Ministry of Labor and Social Security, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Patients who rely on government subsidized-medical care are
limited to using these approved medicines, unless they are willing
to pay for those not on the list.
</P>
<P>
"The medicines on the list are efficient and affordable," said
Wang Dongjin, vice-minister of Labor and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
The medicine list was drafted by the State Council, and seven
ministries, including the ministries of Finance and Health, as
well as the State Drug Administration and the State Administration
of Traditional Chinese Medicine, also contributed to the list.
</P>
<P>
Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine on the list
have been divided into two classes, the report said.
</P>

get and effective in curing common illnesses, while the 586 class
B western medicine are more expensive.
</P>
<P>
There are 135 class A Chinese traditional medicine and 440
class B on the list.
</P>
<P>

hospitals to ensure that all people on government subsidies can
get the medicine they need and can afford.
</P>
<P>
For class B medicines, provincial governments are allowed to
increase or decrease medicine prices by 15 percent according to
their own economic conditions.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Forced to Retire at Queen's Club Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- American tennis player Andre Agassi
suffered a pre-Wimbledon injury scare when he hurt his back and
had to retire from the Stella Artois Championships at Queen's Club
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The world number one had taken the first set 6-4 in his third-
round tie with Italian Gianluca Pozzi when disaster struck.
</P>
<P>
Agassi - playing in the Stella Artois Championships for the
first time in his glorious career - was looking comfortable enough
early in the second set.
</P>
<P>
But on break point at 1-1 he fell awkwardly at the net and hurt
his back.
</P>
<P>
He got up to take the game only to then lose his own service.
</P>
<P>
He received treatment on court for the three minutes that are
allowed, and played on, with Pozzi holding serve to go 3-2 up.
</P>
<P>
It was then that the top-seeded American decided he could not
play on, and was forced to retire.
</P>
<P>
Fears that the injury may force Agassi to miss Wimbledon -
where he finished runner-up to Pete Sampras last year - were
quickly dispelled by tournament officials after he was diagnosed
with lower back spasms.
</P>
<P>
A tournament spokesman said: "Andre received treatment on court
from ATP trainer Doug Spreen and is receiving further treatment
for muscle spasms from medical staff here. Tournament doctor John
Gaynor and Spreen are both confident he should be fine for
Wimbledon, and he will be assessed over the next two to three of
days."
</P>
<P>
Agassi said: "To be fit for Wimbledon I need to address this
right now. But my feeling is to trust what the medical staff here
are saying, which is that I should feel better in two or three
days."
</P>
<P>
"When something like this happens you are in suspense as to how
bad it is and what is going to happen. There was a sharp pain
which was increasing and there was no way I could rotate or hit my
shots properly. There was the risk of doing more damage and that
is not in my game plan at this stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of Agassi leaves the way much clearer for second-
seed Sampras to retain the title he won last year, when he beat
British number one Tim Henman in the final.
</P>
<P>
Sampras breezed past French qualifier Michael Llodra 6-1, 7-6
to book a quarter-final showdown with fellow American Bob Bryan -
conqueror of Tim Henman in the second round.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Says Israeli Withdrawal Incomplete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
said Friday evening that "Israeli has not completely withdrawn from
south Lebanon," People's Sound radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said in a statement to the press that U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan "can not announce the end of the withdrawal
according to (U.N.) Resolution 425," which calls for Israel's
unconditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hoss' remark was a response to Annan's statement made earlier in
the day in New York, in which the U.N. chief confirmed that Israel
had fully withdrawn from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting eagerly for the announcement of a full Israeli
withdrawal to the international border so that the border fence can
go ahead," Hoss said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said Israel still occupies Lebanese territory at some parts
of border. "The Lebanese expert team that worked with U.N. officers
in inspecting the borders observed that Israeli military posts are
still situated inside Lebanese borders and several pieces of
Lebanese lands are under Israel's control," Hoss added.
</P>
<P>
Annan is scheduled to visit Lebanon on Monday as part of his
Middle East trip. He will talk with Lebanese leaders on verifying
the Israeli withdrawal and reinforcing the U.N. peacekeeping force
in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Army Warns against Further Religious Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Alex Ogomudia, the army's General Officer commanding
one Mechanized Division, which is stationed in a camp near the
city, said that the force had been ordered to deal ruthlessly with
troublemakers, against the backdrop of a resurgence of violence in
the city.
</P>
<P>
"Troops in Kaduna are battle ready. It is better to keep peace
because the equipment the soldiers use are violent when they react
to violent situation," he told a press conference in Kaduna on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Controversy over the planned introduction of Sharia has
resurfaced in recent times over the propriety of the adoption, by
the state House of Assembly, of a report on the implementation of
the Sharia law.
</P>
<P>
Christians in Kaduna are opposed to the introduction of the
Islamic code, while the Muslims favor it.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso of Nigeria' s northern
Kano State announced that his state would introduce the
controversial Islamic law Sharia next week, which is almost
certain to have nationwide repercussions.
</P>
<P>
Kano and Kaduna are two most popular and influential states in
the northern part of the West African nation. Unlike other
northern states dominated by Muslim population, both of the two
states have a large Christian population.
</P>
<P>
Two northern states, Zamfara and Sokoto, have already
introduced Sharia into their criminal code earlier in the year,
despite the opposition from the Christian dominated southern
states and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
Sharia, mainly implemented in Islamic countries, is a code of
living for Muslims. Apart from its religious contents, the code is
known for its regulations that women must cover themselves, and
different sexes must be segregated.

<HEADLINE> Annan Announces Israeli Withdrawal From Lebanon  (Updated with background information) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday announced the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in full
compliance with the relevant Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
Annan told a press conference here that "I am delighted to
tell you that the United Nations force in Lebanon has today
reported to me that Israel has withdrawn from the country in full
compliance with Security Council resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
Annan started the press conference, previously scheduled for
10:45 EST and held some two hours later, after he conveyed this
information to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Lebanon have waited more than 22 years for this
moment," he said. "We must all admire the fortitude with which
they have borne this long ordeal."
</P>
<P>
"This is a happy day for Lebanon, but also for Israel," he
said. "It is a day of hope for the Middle East as a whole, and it
is a day of pride for the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"It shows that U.N. resolutions, when fully implemented by all
parties working together, can be the building blocks of peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is now closer to peace than it has been in decades,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan's announcement clears the way for the 4,500-member U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to be strengthened and deployed
in the border area. It also helped restore the Lebanese Government
's authority over the evacuated territory.
</P>
<P>
"The main task will now be to help the Lebanese Government and
armed forces assume their responsibility along the border and
throughout the area from which Israel has withdrawn," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced its pullout on May 24. U.N. map experts and
others have since been checking that all Israeli troops and
officials have withdrawn behind the international border
demarcated in 1923.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special representative for the Middle East, Terje
Roed Larsen, told the same press conference that the Lebanese
Government had told the United Nations it "would respect the
decision of the United Nations as concerns the Israeli withdrawal.
"
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of southern
Lebanon as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern Israel
from 1985 until its withdrawal on May 24 this year.
</P>
<P>
Annan left immediately after his press conference for the
Middle East to meet the leaders in the region and to see what the
United Nations can do to consolidate and build on today's
achievement.
</P>
<P>
The trip, along with Friday's announcement, was delayed a day
after Israeli soldiers fired shots near a United Nations team
visiting one of the last remaining unchecked border sites. Israeli
authorities Thursday expressed regret over the incident.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Regulators Approve Massive Phone Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal regulators
approved Friday the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE Corp., a deal
that transforms Bell Atlantic into the nation's largest local
phone company and wireless provider.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the deal
after accepting a plan by the companies to partially spin off GTE'
s long-distance assets in areas where Bell Atlantic by law cannot
yet offer that service. The Justice Department cleared the deal in
the fall, so FCC approval is the final hurdle.
</P>
<P>
The approval allows the companies to complete a deal announced
almost two years ago and launch a combined business under the new
name Verizon Communications.
</P>
<P>
The GTE marriage marks yet another step in Bell Atlantic's
evolution into a telecommunications powerhouse. In 1997, the
company merged with Nynex, one of the other seven Bell companies
created from the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
The new Verizon will now become the largest local phone company,
controlling 63 million of the phone lines into people's homes with
a presence in more than 30 states.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Bell Atlantic formed a wireless partnership with
Vodafone AirTouch PLC, a venture that greatly increased the
company's national footprint for cellular phone and paging
services.
</P>
<P>
By adding GTE's assets, Bell Atlantic will solidify its lead in
the U.S. wireless market with 25 million customers and a wireless
footprint covering more than 90 percent of country. That puts it
ahead of its next largest wireless competitor, AT&AMP;T, by 14 million
customers.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Executive Director Carol
Bellany of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Friday
refuted reports that the Ethiopian government did not respond
quickly to famine crises created as result of the latest drought
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is fair to say that the government was the first
intervenor,for the most part, in responding to the crises",
Bellany said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Bellany is here on a five-nation Horn of Africa tour, during
which she will assess the difficult conditions facing millions of
people in the region.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, she visited the drought affected southeast of
Ethiopia where more than one million people were reportedly facing
loss of livelihood, hunger and disease.
</P>
<P>
She expressed hope that donors would step forward in supporting
the work UN agencies and non-government organizations have been
carrying out in drought affected areas of Ethiopia since February.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United Nations issued a 378-millions U.S.
dollars appeal for drought relief efforts in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
According Bellany, donors have been reluctant to provide relief
assistance to the drought affected people in Ethiopia because of
the ongoing border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Bellany welcomed the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, to be
signed this weekend between Ethiopia and Eritrea, aimed at
bringing an end to the two-year-old war.
</P>
<P>
She expressed hope that the agreement would lead to a lasting
peace,allowing both countries to focus on the immediate
humanitarian as well as development issues.

WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- United States Chamber of

medicine to Cuba as part of a wider effort to curtail America's
use of unilateral sanctions in foreign policy.

"First, unilateral sanctions don't work," Donohue said. "They
make martyrs out of the target, and they make America look bad. It

Noting the chamber supported congressional efforts to end the

He noted that France considers it necessary to work
simultaneously on the EU's internal reform as well as its
enlargement. He stressed that successful enlargement was of key
importance.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that at the end of this year the EU should reach a
scenario of the further development of the enlargement process.

this year so as to become able to admit the best-prepared
countries as of January 1, 2003.

<P>
The Czech Republic, together with Poland, Hungary, Slovenia,
Estonia and Cyprus, are members of fast-track candidates for EU

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Lift Nuclear Sanctions on Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pakistani Foreign
Minister Abdul Sattar on Friday called on the United States to
lift sanctions imposed after Pakistan followed India to conduct
nuclear tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Washington, Sattar said the
sanctions were unfair to Pakistan and urged the U.S. to "review
the plethora of sanctions that are on the statute."
</P>
<P>
"We feel strongly that some of these sanctions have been
Pakistan-specific, these have singled out our country and that
this is not consonant with friendly relations," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the U.S. government and the Congress
"will review these sanctions and allow perhaps a more general,
even-handed and balanced approach to this subject."
</P>
<P>
Washington imposed a wide range of sanctions against India and
Pakistan after the 1998 tests, restricting the provision of
credits, military sales, economic assistance and loans to the
government.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Sattar held talks with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and other senior U.S. officials.

<HEADLINE> Anson Chan: "One Country Two Systems" Happy Arrangement for Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Weeks before the third
anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, Anson Chan, a top
official of Hong Kong, said here that Beijing's "one country, two
systems" policy was suitable for the former British colony.
</P>
<P>
Chan, visiting Chief Secretary of Hong Kong Special
Administration Region (HKSAP), said the island remained a "free
and liberal society" in recent three years.
</P>
<P>
"Stripped of its diplomatic protocol and political polemics,it
means, in effect, that Hong Kong remains exactly as it has always
been," Chan commented on Beijing's policy for Hong Kong at the
opening ceremony of "Hong Kong Architectural Exhibition" in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition held at the headquarters of German Industry and
Trade Council (DIHT) presented some 500 distinguished German
guests with the skyline of Hong Kong, the new buildings in
downtown, and its new international airport.
</P>
<P>
Chan, who arrived in Germany on Thursday, was invited to give
a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's "one country, two systems" policy is a "happy
arrangement" for Hong Kong' she said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has its own currency, the HK dollar linked to the US
dollar, and with its physical land and sea boundary separated from
Chinese mainland, the Hong Kong administration keeps its full
control over its own police, customs, and immigrants, she said.
</P>
<P>
The free market, the rule of law, and the human rights
enshrined by Hong Kong's Basic Law remain the cornerstone of Hong
Kong's remarkable success, stressed Chan.
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks short of three years on, I can safely say that Hong
Kong has seen the future, and it works. One Country, Two Systems
has been transformed from a political concept into a practical
reality," she said, "Beijing leadership's 'Hands-off' policy on
Hong Kong is a happy arrangement that suits all parties."
</P>
<P>
Chan, after meeting with German President Johannes Rau Friday
morning, invited German Interior Minister Otto Schily to the
opening ceremony of Hong Kong Food Festival, another large-scaled
promotion of Hong Kong SAP in Germany.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking Hong Kong officials and leading businessmen in
Chan's delegation said Hong Kong economy was rebounding after the
nightmare of Asian financial crisis, and its future lied in its
link to Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong enjoyed a real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth
rate of 14.3 percent in the first quarter of this year, said
Vincent Cheng, Chief Executive of Hang Seng Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We also stand to benefit from the immense opportunities
arising from China's imminent entry into the World Trade
Organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that Hong Kong's role as a middleman between
China and the rest of the world will be further reinforced upon
China's WTO entry," said Cheng.

MANAGUA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan Agriculture, Livestock

Alert because of the epidemic of Aviarian Influenza in Honduras
and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The MAG-FOR also banned imports of poultry, poultry products
and byproducts from Guatemala, to prevent local species from being
contagied with the virus.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's National Association of Poultry and Poultry Feeding

of contamination with any virus, because of the strict control.
</P>
<P>
The virus killed more than half a million chicken in the last
two weeks in Honduras, which also closed its border to Guatemalan
poultry products, and the losses amounted to 450,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Inter-American Organization of Animal Health (

</P>
<P>
Another of the agreements is the implementation of a regime of

through a rapid procedure, different from other touristic bands,
and with permanence of up to 72 hours in the other's territory.
</P>
<P>
The ministers arrived at another agreement that seeks the
