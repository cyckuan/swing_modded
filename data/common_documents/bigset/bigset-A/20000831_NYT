ARCHER SPREADING WORD ABOUT GRAND PRIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever the spectator turnout for the inaugural Grand Prix of
Texas at Texas Motor Speedway this weekend, Bobby Archer is
confident it will either meet or exceed the fan-count compiled at
Lowe's Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 20 people at Charlotte. Maybe 25,'' said Archer,
referring to a similar American Le Mans Series-headlined program
staged in April at TMS's sister superspeedway in Concord, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlotte sucked,'' said Archer, succinctly sizing up his
weekend in the heart of NASCARland. ``I mean, we were up at this
race in podunk Ste. Croix (Quebec) earlier this month, and it was
15,000 people. It was SRO. Everybody was complaining about racing
up there, and I said, `Hey, remember Charlotte.' This is going to
be a very good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Bobby Archer's opinion, as reigning Speedvision World
Challenge GT champion: This weekend is a huge opportunity to
properly reintroduce sports car racing to the Fort Worth-Dallas
market ... if enough potential customers know about it.
</P>
<P>
   TMS and its various venues already have exposed motorsports fans
to stock cars, Indy cars, pickup trucks, flat-track motorcycles,
Sprint Cars, Late Models ... and Legends Cars. Archer believes the
wide array of recognizable machinery at the track in far north Fort
Worth will draw from the area's sports car-driving enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Bobby Archer's opinion, and I'd like to think I have a
pretty good clue,'' said Archer, whose business, German Motor
Works, caters to various sports car-oriented clientele. Wednesday,
the shop on North Henderson Street also played host to the
inaugural Bobby Archer Motorsports Open House. It was Archer's
attempt to get the word out, and by midafternoon, Archer said
approximately 200 fans had braved the afternoon heat to check out
the displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just mystified there isn't more promotion for this event,
because these people are in a different group,'' said Archer,
referring to both the sanctioning body and the racetrack staff.
``It's been my contention all along that even the IRL doesn't
attract these people. They like to do things as a group. I know of
guys who are selling tickets for the race out of their homes. I
don't see that in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I'm going to maintain that this is a brand new market _
unblemished, untapped _ and they need to pursue it. I just haven't
seen it (promoted) at the grass roots level. And you couldn't hit a
more direct bull's-eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Five separate series will compete on the track's new combined
oval/road-course. The ALMS Prototype, Grand Touring Sport and Grand
Touring cars are the acknowledged attractions for Saturday night's
2-hour, 45-minute main event.
</P>
<P>
   From Archer's position, that leaves the BFGoodrich Trans-Am
Series, World Challenge, Women's Global GT Series and Star Mazda
Series to argue over who's best of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm racing in the SCCA World Challenge, sponsored by
Speedvision,'' said Archer, a transplanted Minnesotan living in
Keller. ``And SCCA is not promoting it because they feel
Speedvision should be. And Speedvision is saying, `We're paying our
money, SCCA should be promoting.' There's a standoff. Meanwhile,
they've got one of the fastest growing series ... with over 100
cars entered for the two (World Challenge) classes here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as though everybody is trying to keep it under
wraps. And from my standpoint, it almost makes it impossible to
sell a sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer's No. 32 ViperSpeed Dodge Viper, and the team he
relocated from Detroit over the winter, will begin the weekend
trailing Peter Cunningham and his BMW M3 by 11 points (117-106)
halfway through the World Challenge schedule. Archer has secured a
one-race sponsorship deal for TMS from Jack Farr, his friend and
founder of the Motorsports Ranch in Cresson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar has been raised in this series,'' said Archer, whose
car is owned by Ben and Sandy Madey of Ingleside, Ill., only
because Archer has been unable to raise enough money to purchase
the team outright. ``Trying to get sponsors to do it properly has
been tough. I really thought we could have attracted a (seasonlong)
local sponsor at some level. We got the Motorsports Ranch, but it's
just for this race, which makes it hard to show a return on
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make this come across as a negative, because
by my own admission, this series is not Formula One. But this is a
series that gets a lot of recognition and air time. It deserves
some acknowledgement. There's probably going to be more people in
the stands that will know me than will know the winner of the ALMS
race.''
</P>
<P>
   With the word starting to get out, that number hopefully will
meet or exceed 20 fans. Maybe 25. Easy.
MOTORPLEX ATTEMPTING TO ADD MULDOWNEY
</P>
<P>
   Three-time NHRA Top Fuel champion Shirley Muldowney is scheduled
to make a one-race return to the series during the 46th annual U.S.
Nationals this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The six-day event at Indianapolis Raceway Park is the longest,
oldest and most prestigious stop on the National Hot Rod
Association Winston Drag Racing Series Tour. But officials of the
Texas Motorplex in Ennis will touch down at IRP on Thursday with
the idea of convincing Muldowney to add the O'Reilly Fall Nationals
in October to her 2000 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Muldowney, 60, last competed in an NHRA-sanctioned race in 1997
at the Motorplex. She qualified 19th, three spots away from the
16-car ladder, with a top quarter-mile elapsed time of 4.882
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Muldowney is scheduled to drive the Goosehead.com Dragster,
tuned by husband Rahn Tobler, when professional qualifying begins
Friday at IRP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to the marketing and promotions people at
Goosehead.com and our understanding is that she'll be here in the
fall,'' said Elon Werner, Motorplex general manager. ``Shirley
loves racing here. It's a perfect track for her, because her
husband can generate more horsepower with less money than anyone
out there. Coming to a track like the Motorplex, which is
all-concrete and can hold all that horsepower, it's a perfect
match.''
</P>
<P>
   Muldowney's appearance behind the wheel of the Action-backed Top
Fueler in 1997 was her lone NHRA drive of that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had only four qualifying sessions in the car, and nearly
made it,'' Werner said. ``Getting some time in Indy ... I'll be
shocked if she doesn't qualify there. And I think they'll build on
that coming into Ennis.''
</P>
<P>
   As announced on Tuesday, the Oct. 19-22 event at the Motorplex
is scheduled to play host to the anticipated debut of George and
Hank Steinbrenner's Yankee Racing Top Fuel team run by Darrell
Gwynn and driven by Mike Dunn. The addition of Muldowney would make
the weekend a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a good relationship with Shirley going back to
1997,'' Werner said, ``and I'll definitely touch base with her at
Indy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first woman licensed to drive a Top Fuel car, Muldowney
claimed her first championship in 1977 and added titles in 1980 and
1982. Muldowney scored her last NHRA top-10 points finish, 10th, in
1990, but has remained active with numerous match-race appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Muldowney also has competed in the rival International Hot Rod
Association circuit in recent seasons, clocking a top speed of 319
mph and elapsed time of 4.741 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Among her 18 career national event victories _ most by a woman
driver in NHRA history _ was the 1982 U.S. Nationals final over
Connie Kalitta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking forward to racing at Indy,'' said
Muldowney, a resident of Armada, Mich. ``There's no other place
like the NHRA U.S. Nationals, and I'm proud to have been the only
woman to have ever won a professional title there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rahn and I would like nothing better than to have an impact on
this year's points race. I think we can do that with a good showing
at Indy.''
</P>
<P>
   PIT STOPS MENARD STICKS WITH RAY
</P>
<P>
   Team-owner John Menard says Texan Greg Ray will return as his
Indy Racing Northern Light Series driver in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Menard squelched two rumors at Kentucky Speedway last weekend
during The Belterra Resort Indy 300: that he was moving to another
series, and that Ray _ the 1999 Indy Racing League champion _ was
jumping to NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, we're going to have an (Indy Racing League) team,''
said Menard, a charter member of Tony George's all-oval open-wheel
series. ``Greg now is in the second year of a five-year contract.
We'll keep on going with a one-car team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Greg would be a success in any series he'd run, but as
it stands now, he's given every indication of fulfilling the
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Ray's future with Menard heightened after team
manager and confidant Thomas Knapp unexpectedly left the team in
August, shortly after Ray scored his only victory of the season at
Atlanta Motor Speedway. Ray is 11th in points with only the
season-ending Excite 500 at Texas Motor Speedway on Oct. 15
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Davis has replaced Knapp as team manager on Menard's No. 1
Conseco Dallara/Oldsmobile. TRUCK RACE GETS LONGER
</P>
<P>
   Looking to provide a better show and more ticket value, NASCAR
and Texas Motor Speedway officials have agreed to lengthen the
Craftsman Truck Series race on Oct. 13 by 100 kilometers to 400K.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Reilly 300K has been redubbed the O'Reilly 400K, which
figures out to an increase of 42 laps/62 miles (to 167 laps/248
miles) around the 1.5-mile quadoval. The fall race now is the same
distance of the June night event won by current points-leader Greg
Biffle.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying for the O'Reilly 400K is scheduled Oct. 12 at 5:30
p.m., with the race the next day at 7 p.m. ATLANTA RETURNS TO IRL
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Motor Speedway will return to the Indy Racing Northern
Light Series in 2001 with a new date.
</P>
<P>
   The open-wheel series is scheduled to compete on the 1.5-mile
AMS trioval for the fourth time on Saturday night, April 28. The
series most recently competed at AMS under the lights on July 15.
In its new slot, the Atlanta race becomes the lead-in event to the
Indianapolis 500 on May 27.
</P>
<P>
   After competing with only nine events in 2000, IRL teams face a
13-race schedule in 2001. Included are stops at Texas Motor
Speedway on June 9, the first race after the Indy 500, and the
season-ender on Sept. 30. LAST LAPS
</P>
<P>
   _ CART's Team Kool Green has signed Paul Tracy to a contract
extension through the 2005 FedEx Championship Series season. In
addition, teammate Dario Franchitti, who tested with Jaguar's
Formula One team this summer, has decided to return to Barry
Green's lineup for the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rookie Jamie McMurray has scored two poles and three top-10
finishes in four starts for TKO Motorsports owner Mike Farris of
Fort Worth in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. nn

USC'S PALMER HEARS NEW FEEDBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the first time in his college career, Carson
Palmer is walking around the USC campus answering a tough question
instead of receiving an obligatory compliment.
</P>
<P>
   The usual ``good job'' has been replaced by ``What happened?''
as everyone analyzes his performance against Penn State on Sunday,
when he completed 10 of 20 passes for 87 yards with an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wonders what the deal was,'' Palmer said. ``It's
different. It's the first time I've felt that. I just tell them the
same thing I tell you guys. I didn't have a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is still his unflappable self, relaxed and positive as he
prepares for USC's Sept. 9 game against Colorado. But he isn't
about to concede that fans should expect less of him as he regains
his sharpness following a year off with a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still want people to expect a lot from me,'' Palmer said.
``I know I've got that game out of my system and I'll be ready to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he watched films of the Penn State game, Palmer hasn't
discovered any magical answers for his subpar opening effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt I wasn't in a rhythm with my footwork and I was a
little rusty,'' he said. ``The only way I'll get out of the rust
stage is more and more practice. Hopefully, it was a first-game
thing. I wish we did have another game this week. I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said Palmer's play might have been
attributed to playing against a defense other than the Trojans,
which is going out of its way to avoid hitting him hard in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot different,'' Hackett said. ``But he has to get
playing. We're going to find out a lot about the guy. He's going to
grow and get better.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuire to play: Freshman offensive lineman Joe McGuire was used
in goal-line formations against Penn State, which would seem a
minor role to use up his redshirt year. However, Hackett said he
fully intends to play McGuire this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect him to play,'' Hackett said. ``If we redshirt him, it
would be a medical issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Which might not seem so far-fetched. McGuire missed Wednesday's
practice with a back injury suffered during an all-star game this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Plays of the game: Wide receiver Marcell Allmond made two of the
biggest plays of the game, but neither involved catching passes. He
recovered Mike McGillivray's blocked punt in the end zone, which
allowed Penn State to score a safety instead of a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball just came to me, I didn't know what to do,'' Allmond
said. ``I thought about running with it, but then I knew it would
be better to take a safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Allmond also recovered Sultan McCullough's fumble at the USC
23-yard line in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just there at the right time. I saw the ball pop out and
went for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Number change: Snapper Joe Boscovich of Westlake High has
changed from jersey No. 91 to 57. It means USC no longer has two
Westlake players wearing 91. Defensive tackle Bobby DeMars also
wears the number.

TEXAS A&AMP;M COUNTING ON ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT
</HEADLINE>
 12-REPORT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Listen closely to coaches and players
and you get a sense that the puzzle pieces are finally fitting into
place for a Texas A&AMP;M offense in transition.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Farris, we're told, is The Man. He'll get first shot at
ending the Aggies' three-quarterback carousel in the season opener
at Notre Dame on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Robert Ferguson, from all indications, is The
Truth. The junior-college transfer, in the estimation of
overmatched defensive backs, is the game-breaker A&AMP;M has lacked
since Albert Connell took his pass-catching act to the NFL after
the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   But this offense is going nowhere without The Attitude
Adjustment. That's where fullback Ja'Mar Toombs enters the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The 275-pound fullback provided one of the few sparks in a
dismal ground game last season, leading the Aggies in rushing with
583 yards. It marked the lowest season total by A&AMP;M's top
ground-gainer since 1983, when Roger Vick netted 425 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs' reward for setting the pace has been an increased role
as a blocker for unproven tailbacks Richard Whitaker and Joe Weber.
This might raise eyebrows among those who watched Toombs' matador
blocking skills result in the beating former A&AMP;M quarterback Randy
McCown took in last year's 24-0 loss to Penn State in the Alamo
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then. This is now. Toombs, after some
heart-to-heart talks with coaches during the off-season about
personal responsibility, sounds committed to his new role. The
junior expressed gratitude that, after two arrests since the
conclusion of his freshman season (one for marijuana possession,
one for driving while intoxicated), he still has a spot on the A&AMP;M
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into a college career clearly at a crossroads, Toombs
finally shows signs of being a leader on an offense in dire need of
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the old guys now,'' Toombs said. ``It's time for me
to take hold of the reins and do all the things the coaches
expected of me. To do the things they recruited me to do. Most guys
in college don't develop until their junior year. Now that I'm a
junior, it's time for me to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   After missing spring workouts because of a hamstring injury,
Toombs' recent actions have matched his determined words. Coach
R.C. Slocum said he has never seen Toombs work harder, or practice
with more intensity, than during fall drills.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining that focus will be crucial because Toombs, as a
blocker, will be integral in creating holes for A&AMP;M tailbacks and
providing Farris enough time to find receivers. If Toombs flops in
his new role, the A&AMP;M offense flops along with him. If Toombs'
selfless attitude proves genuine and rubs off on teammates, it will
raise the performance level of those around him.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum acknowledged that the stakes are high, adding that he is
betting on Toombs' turnaround to withstand the test of time. Toombs
said he does not plan to disappoint. The ``Big Rumble'' vows not to
grumble about a lack of carries. Instead, he is planning on
pounding linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've listened to a lot of criticism, most of it deserved,''
Toombs said. ``Every day, I keep thinking to myself, `I've got to
become a better blocker.' I'm not the best at it yet. But I know
what I'm supposed to be doing now. I'm working at it. I know my
role and my role has changed a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   From all indications, so has his attitude.
</P>
<P>
   That could be A&AMP;M's most significant change of the 2000 season.
LITTLE-KNOWN RECEIVER A KEY TO TEXAS OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the most glaring question marks on the Texas
depth chart involve the wide-receiver positions, where five
freshmen could earn playing time this season. Four of the five
spent last season playing high school football but arrived with
glittering resumes: B.J. Johnson, Roy Williams, Sloan Thomas and
Tony Jeffery.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Wednesday night's final scrimmage, Johnson and
Williams had made the biggest impression among the newcomers. But
all have had their moments while working against the first-team
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Artie Ellis, a redshirt freshman who has two things
the others do not: a year of experience in the Texas system and a
projected spot in the starting lineup. Teammates identify him as
the forgotten commodity in a receiver corps that could be better
than last season despite the departures of Kwame Cavil (100
catches, 1,188 yards) and Ryan Nunez (56 catches, 600 yards), the
Big 12's busiest pass-catchers in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a big year from Artie,'' free safety Greg Brown said.
``He's been so overlooked, people don't take him into
consideration. But he's a big guy with good hands who can give you
a lot of moves. I think he'll be a big factor in what our offense
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Major Applewhite said Ellis (6-foot-4, 205 pounds)
has the ideal body type to play the position and understands some
techniques that the newcomers have yet to grasp. He also bowled
over free safety Phillip Geiggar to complete a 20-yard,
catch-and-run during one scrimmage session, drawing one of the
loudest cheers of the night from Texas fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artie really positions himself well to the ball. He catches
the ball well and runs good routes,'' Applewhite said. ``The
biggest thing I've seen in Artie, from spring until two-a-days, is
that he's become a whole lot more consistent. That's what you need
out there is a consistent guy with Artie's body type who can
perform.'' IMMEDIATE IMPACT
</P>
<P>
   Three of 10 junior-college players who signed in February have
moved into the starting lineup at Kansas: defensive tackle Ervin
Holloman, defensive end De'Nard Whitfield and wide receiver Roger
Ross. Defensive ends John Culp and Demond Benford also have cracked
the two-deep list heading into the season opener at SMU on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For the Jayhawks, the influx of defensive linemen has been
crucial. The team had no returning starters from 1999. Coach Terry
Allen said Holloman has especially been impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``His motor has been running full speed. I'm delighted with the
way he's stepped up,'' Allen said. ``We have some proven players
among the new guys up front. I think we'll be much better there.''
</P>
<P>
   The influx is strong enough, Allen said, that the Jayhawks plan
to use more 4-3 alignments, rather than their base 3-4, to get
additional linemen on the field. TEXAS TIES
</P>
<P>
   Opening the season against Texas A&AMP;M offers special incentive to
a pair of Notre Dame offensive linemen from the Lone Star State.
Jordan Black, the starter at left tackle, is from Rowlett. Mike
Gandy, the first-team right guard, is from Garland.
</P>
<P>
   Black, who played at Dallas Christian, said he is ``good
friends'' with A&AMP;M quarterback Vance Smith, a Fort Worth Christian
graduate. He has received ample input in recent weeks from other
buddies with A&AMP;M connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was home over the summer, a lot of people told me, `I
can't wait to see Texas A&AMP;M whip up on you guys,' '' Black said.
``My response? I said, `Well, we'll see about that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gandy said he is excited about the noon matchup Saturday in
South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from Texas, it's good to play against teams you've
followed,'' Gandy said. ``Against A&AMP;M, it will be like any other
game. If we play bad, we'll lose. If we play good, we'll have a
chance to win.'' SIZING UP THE HYPE
</P>
<P>
   Is bigger really better when it comes to correlating the size of
a team's media guide with its on-field performance? Or, can a
school remain thin and still win?
</P>
<P>
   These questions are asked in response to Texas' unveiling of a
536-page guide for the 2000 season, by far the biggest in the Big
12. As a means of comparison, Kansas State has won 11 games in
three consecutive seasons while hyped by guides less than half that
size.
</P>
<P>
   Below is a look at how former Southwest Conference teams have
fattened records and media guides (or failed to do so) since
joining the Big 12. Under each season is listed the size, in pages,
of the school's annual media guide with its corresponding record:
School 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 Texas 412 (8-5) 444 (4-7) 446 (9-3)
492 (9-5) 536 (TBD) Texas A&AMP;M 292 (6-6) 292 (9-4) 300 (11-3) 336
(8-4) 348 (TBD) Baylor 304 (4-7) 168 (2-9) 208 (2-9) 204 (1-10) 240
(TBD) Texas Tech 144 (7-5) 184 (6-5) 196 (7-5) 200 (6-5) 272 (TBD)
BURCH'S PICKS
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Burch picks (against the line) this week's Big 12 games:
</P>
<P>
   Baylor at North Texas (plus 51/2). Pick: Baylor. Greg Cicero
reintroduces the passing game, and the win column, to Baylor fans.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M (plus 21/2) at Notre Dame. Pick: Notre Dame. Aggies
struggle to win in Lubbock, much less in the intimidating presence
of Touchdown Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas at SMU (plus 41/2). Pick: Kansas. Jayhawks finally have
an act worth taking on the road.
</P>
<P>
   UTEP (plus 26) at Oklahoma. Pick: Oklahoma. Sooners air out,
then blow out, the outmanned Miners.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado vs. Colorado State (plus 41/2). Pick: Colorado. The
Buffs can't lose to their in-state rivals in consecutive seasons
... can they?
</P>
<P>
   Ohio (plus 131/2) at Iowa State. Pick: Iowa State. A soft
schedule has the Cyclones primed for another 3-0 burst from the
gate.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech at Kansas State (271/2). Pick: Kansas State. A
taste of Manhattan should cure the Wildcats' struggling offense.
</P>
<P>
   Western Illinois at Missouri (no line). Pick: Missouri. Tigers
capitalize on their only iron-clad opportunity to win this season.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State (plus 50) at Nebraska. Pick: Nebraska.
Cornhuskers justify their top-ranked status with a thunderous romp
to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   Utah State (plus 21) at Texas Tech. Pick: Tech. High-flying
offense struggled in its debut but the Tech defense still looks
salty.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's record: 1-1. Season record: 1-1. nn

U.S. VOLLEYBALL WOMEN GAINING ON COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A few months ago, getting to the medal round - let
alone leaving Sydney with a medal - was considered a difficult
proposition for the United States women's volleyball team.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans' chances of at least getting out of pool play
seem much better after what has transpired on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Team USA's pool includes lightly regarded Kenya and Australia,
ranked 27th and 29th, respectively, in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. also made big strides at the recently concluded FIVB
Grand Prix in Asia by beating several higher-ranked teams,
including a five-game upset of China, the world's fourth-ranked
team.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-28, 25-20, 22-25, 25-18, 15-12 win snapped a 10-game
losing streak to the Chinese dating back to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great feeling to beat China,'' Robyn Ah Mow said. ``We
have had some great matches with them, but we have never pulled out
a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. also defeated fifth-ranked South Korea in the
preliminary rounds. But a loss to the Koreans in a rematch later in
the tournament exposed a continuing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have won if we had played consistently, but we were
unable to execute when it mattered,'' U.S. outside hitter Tara
Cross-Battle said after the Americans were swept by Korea. ``This
problem needs to be fixed before the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are coming off a disappointing 1996 Olympics, when
they were a heavy medal favorite. Instead, the veteran U.S. team
finished a disappointing seventh. Afterward, the entire team
retired or played professionally overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas women's coach Mick Haley was hired to rebuild the
program. Haley has since been hired by USC as its women's coach,
beginning after the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   With most of its players just a year or two out of college, the
U.S. has struggled most of the past four years. But the Americans
got a boost when veterans Danielle Scott, who played in `96) and
Cross-Battle, a `92 and `96 Olympian, returned.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, an All-American basketball and volleyball player at Long
Beach State, considered a chance to play in the WNBA but opted for
the national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things that Danielle does for us,'' Haley
said. ``First of all, she gives us confidence. She really takes a
lot of pressure off the other players. Second, she's experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on board are promising young players such as Ah Mow,
Heather Brown and Logan Tom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think right now we're making great strides from when I
joined the team until now. We know we can play well. If we can get
better results in terms of wins, that will help us in the future
and give us more confidence,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the way the (rally) scoring system is, it's up for
grabs for anyone. The team who makes less errors and has the heart
is going to be the victor.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Australia and Kenya are in the way of the Americans being
one of the top four in their pool and reaching the medal round.
</P>
<P>
   Getting past a potential quarterfinal matchup with a Russia or
Cuba is a longshot for a team lacking Olympic seasoning.

BIGGER, STRONGER BAYLOR TEAM AIMS TO ERASE BAD MEMORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Baylor football coach Kevin Steele, the most dismal sound in
a 1-10 inaugural season last year was a phrase that crept into his
headset with alarming regularity:
</P>
<P>
   ``They got us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sound Steele frequently heard ``before'' the snap when
the Baylor offense lined up to run a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant we were running a dead play,'' he said. ``A situation
where the opponent was in the perfect defense to stop it, and we
had no ability to check off and run a different play. We knew it
wasn't going to work before the ball was snapped, but there was
nothing we could do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding this woeful scenario is one of the chief goals in the
team's preparation for Steele's second season, which begins
Thursday night when the Bears visit North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year is a new year ... that's the great thing about
athletics,'' Steele said, tossing out a quick reminder about how
the St. Louis Rams went from 4-12 to 13-3 a year ago. Anything can
happen, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, almost everything that could have happened to the
Bears did happen _ from the infamous fumble return on the final
play that cost them the Nevada-Las Vegas game to being outscored,
347-61, in Big 12 play. But Steele's mood is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different team,'' he said. ``Bigger, stronger,
faster, working harder and with a different attitude. I know that
people outside the program look at it and say, `Wow, they were
1-10, how can they get this thing right this year?' But they don't
see the changes from within.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were in a situation so destitute that it would
have been daunting for Tom Osborne, or Joe Paterno, or anyone else.
If `Bear' Bryant could have returned from the grave, he would have
looked around and shaken his head. But we started after the season
in January with an intense physical conditioning program, and we
have a lot of very young kids _ especially in the offensive line _
who are a year older and wiser and a lot bigger and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, for the first time in 11 years, the Baylor coaching
staff returns intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Steele said, this means no more dead plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we got into it last year,'' he said, ``we extremely
simplified the offense. It was not our original plan to do that,
but the situation here dictated it. We had a lot of people trying
to learn a new system and, in the offensive line for instance, they
were almost all underclassmen. We decided out of necessity not to
give them too much to try and learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when we encountered that situation in games where the
normal headset conversation is `what's he going to?,' we had
nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Bears not only have somewhere to go, there is an
exciting new quarterback _ Greg Cicero _ ready to take them there.
</P>
<P>
   A second-team junior college All-American from Palomar (Calif.)
College, Cicero was once running neck-and-neck with Major
Applewhite for the starting job at Texas before he injured a knee.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero, who played at Servite High School in Anaheim, Calif.,
transferred to Palomar College and last season threw for 2,880
yards and 33 touchdowns. He signed with Baylor last December and
won the quarterback job in spring drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no savior,'' he said, ``but I'm glad to be back in the Big
12, and I think I can help this team.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Steele, who noted that along with his physical skills,
Cicero is accustomed to directing the far more diversified attack
Baylor will use this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a coach on the field,'' Steele said. ``He sees
things and instantly changes the play and comes up with something
that will work. Most important, perhaps, he's a leader who inspires
confidence in those around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be much improved. I know that at some point, we have
to start winning ... not so that someone can keep their job but
because people can only go so long working in a down environment.
They need the energy of success to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have that energy. I don't know when, but it'll
happen.'' nn

<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ President Clinton made a one-day visit
Wednesday to this secure oasis of Colombia to lend backing to the
nation's counternarcotics program.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the $1.3 billion in military aid that
Washington recently agreed to is limited to the drug fight, not
directed toward ending the government's decades-long battle with
rebel groups. ``This is not Vietnam,'' Clinton said, ``nor is it
Yankee imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   He was reacting to critics at home and in Colombia who fear the
consequences of an increasing fight to stop the drug traffickers of
Colombia, who supply 90 percent of the cocaine and most of the
heroin that enters the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Republican and Democratic lawmakers, Clinton said
the United States was helping Colombia with its $7.5 billion
five-year program to destroy much of its drug crop, root out
traffickers and rebuild its judiciary and other government
operations. Part of those funds are coming from Europe and
international agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said continuing support would depend on the Bogota
government's breaking ties with paramilitary groups and adhering to
strict human rights standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before Clinton arrived, rebels bombed three banks,
blockaded a road east of Bogota and engaged in skirmishes with
govern- ment troops, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters also were active. In Bo- gota, a riot policeman was
killed at a university, and a protest outside the U.S. Embassy also
turned vio- lent. In Cartegena, the police said they had arrested
three men who had bomb materials in a house six blocks from one of
Clinton's stops.
 &UR;  &LR; The president urged the country's neighbors to stand by Colombia
in its struggle against the drug trade, even if they suffered from
an overflow of refugees, coca growers and guerrillas. Some of those
neighbors are worried about the American attack helicopters and
military advisers headed here. Already rebel activity has increased
since Congress voted the aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really say Colombia can't attack this in an aggressive
way because there will be some negative consequences on our
border,'' Clinton said, ``the logical conclusion is that all the
cancer of narco-trafficking and lawless violence in this entire
vast continent should rest on the shoulders and burden the children
of this one nation. And that's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the first president to visit Colombia in 10 years,
toured one of the main ports and, with President Andres Pastrana
acting as a translator, held emotional meetings with a dozen wives
and mothers of slain soldiers and drug agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please help us,'' Diana Viveros, a widow, pleaded to the
president, sobbing and clutching his hand. Clinton looked her in
the eyes and said: ``I came to help. We have to make sure your
husband did not die in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears streamed down the face of Yina Torres, a pregnant woman
whose husband, a soldier, was struck down in the drug war.
``Remember, my mother carried me as a widow,'' Clinton said to
console her, words that caused her to sob deeply. The president
wiped the tears from her face and gave her a hug.
</P>
<P>
   It was the president who became choked up when Carmen Elisa
Nunez handed him a medal that her husband had won for his heroics
before he was killed. The army captain had escaped from rebels of
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia last year but was
tortured and later killed by them when caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will put this up in the White House,'' the president said,
holding the medal close to him.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings were arranged by Pastrana, who in his two years in
office has cooperated closely with the United States, and were
intended to show the depth of the government's struggle against
drug lords and rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, addressing the concerns of human rights groups, vowed
to continue to press for improvements in the government's
performance. He asked for time, though, to revamp his army and
police force. ``We are asking the rest of the world to understand
the complexities we have in this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Clinton's side for much of the day was J. Dennis Hastert, the
House speaker, and other lawmakers who voted to back Pastrana's
``Plan Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We share a great burden,'' Hastert told the Colombian
president, noting that thousands of people in the United States and
thousands more in Colombia died every year as a result of drug
abuse and violence.
</P>
<P>
   At the port of Cartagena, the entourage of U.S. officials viewed
a high-speed boat used by narcotics agents to intercept smugglers
at sea and a submarinelike vehicle used by traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling at the water's edge, Clinton stopped to pet a
drug-sniffing dog and inspect a variety of hidden compartments used
to smuggle drugs. ``Very clever,'' he remarked as a captain with
the Colombian navy showed him a boat battery that doubled as a
cocaine hideaway.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also visited a Casa de Justicia, one of the
U.S.-financed centers aimed at rebuilding the tattered criminal
justice system across Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   There was extraordinary security in place for Clinton's visit,
the first by an American president since President George Bush
visited. Cartegena is a tourist haven and one of Colombia's cities,
unlike the capital, Bogota, and various areas where drug cartels
rule. Similarly, Clinton spent part of last week in Nigeria in the
new capital, Abuja, avoiding the tumult of Lagos, the country's
largest city.
</P>
<P>
   In Bogota on Wednesday, union and student groups protested the
president's visit, on the ground that the nation's war would just
go on longer with the new aid. A police spokesman said of that 20
people had died since early Tuesday, 11 of them civilians, three
guerrillas and six police officers.  &QL; 
A riot policeman was killed in the capital when hooded students
threw a home-made explosive during running battles outside the
National University.

<P>
   The NCAA placed the program on probation in December.
</P>
<P>
   The head coach's status beyond this season remains a hot topic
for discussion, and the program will open the season unranked in
The Associated Press Top 25 for the first time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the quarterback can't throw, either.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame's Arnaz Battle heard it all this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they say a lot of things about this team,'' Battle says.
``I really don't listen to it too much because I know what I can
do. The coaches have confidence in me. The players have confidence
in me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really doubted my abilities. I've been playing
football too long to doubt myself like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle makes his first career start Saturday when the Fighting
Irish play Texas A&AMP;M at Notre Dame Stadium. How the junior from
Shreveport, La., reacts to replacing Jarious Jackson could well
determine Notre Dame's season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our schedule, there is no honeymoon period for the
quarterback,'' said coach Bob Davie, whose Irish play A&AMP;M,
Nebraska, Purdue, Michigan State and Stanford in their first five
games. ``He's thrown into the fire right off the bat, but Arnaz had
the opportunity to learn from Jarious and watch Jarious _ and
that's invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of playing that position is what you do when something
bad happens. Is he going to be able to jump in there and get the
offense back on track? It's still hard to say how good he will be,
but from a talent standpoint, he's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   No one questions Battle's athletic talent or his ability to beat
a defense senseless with his speed. Battle's 74-yard touchdown run
against Kansas in the 1999 season-opener stood as the Irish's
longest play from scrimmage last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, can a quarterback who attempted only 15 passes in seven
games as a reserve a year ago operate efficiently in the passing
game?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to come down to how good can Arnaz throw the
football,'' Davie said. ``Not that he can't go out there right now
and throw the football, but when it's third-and-10, are they up
there bluffing blitz or are they blitzing? How well is he going to
throw the football then?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think back to Jarious two years ago out here against
Michigan. The first half was frightening. I didn't know if we would
ever complete a pass, but the second half got a little bit better.
Then, we got a little bit better and a little bit better. So, how
quick is he going to settle in being comfortable throwing the
football? But I like him. He brings a lot of explosiveness to that
position, and I think he's going to be exciting to watch. I really
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame returns seven starters on offense, so Davie doesn't
envision Battle being forced to carry the weight of the offense as
did Jackson, who last year established Irish single-season records
for completions (184), attempts (316) and passing yards (2,753).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ``being the Notre Dame quarterback, all eyes are on you,''
Battle said.
</P>
<P>
   Irish offensive coordinator Kevin Rogers senses his
inexperienced signal caller could ``shock some people'' this
season, but ``Arnaz also has to learn that he is `the man,'''
Rogers said. ``Jarious understood and relished that role and, as a
result, was a tremendous leader. We have to develop Arnaz as a
leader. He can be a dynamic player, but he needs to be a confident
player.'' nn

MAN, 91, TEARFUL OVER CHILD'S DEATH
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His eyes brimming with tears, a 91-year-old
motorist who accidently backed into a bank said Wednesday that he
is profoundly sorry he killed a 1-year-old boy and injured three
others.
</P>
<P>
   Val Conrad of suburban Sylmar was backing out of a handicapped
parking space Tuesday when he hit the gas pedal instead of the
brake, rocketing his station wagon 60 feet inside the Bank of
America branch on Glenoaks Boulevard, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it,'' Conrad told
KNBC-TV (Channel 4). ``The car just took off like somebody was
pushing it. I feel so sorry for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Wednesday that they probably won't seek charges
against Conrad, who just six days earlier had renewed his driver's
license after taking a road test. He has had no crashes or
traffic-related convictions on his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have evidence of a crime, how are you going to
prosecute someone?'' asked Capt. Greg Meyer of the Los Angeles
Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. ``We've found no
objective symptoms of him driving under the influence and no
indication he was driving outside of his driver's license
restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The car hit and killed Nathaniel Escudero of Sylmar, who was on
a couch inside the bank waiting for his grandmother and 8-year-old
brother, neither of whom was injured. Three other people suffered
minor injuries, and Conrad was taken to the hospital as well.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of the child's family said his parents are too
grief-stricken to consult with the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family doesn't know anything. They are dealing with the
grief and loss,'' said Kimberly Schuler Hall, a family friend and
counselor with the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to bury a son and would like it to remain private.
For now, they plan to get through this on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, Conrad's license was still valid, but police
said they have asked the Department of Motor Vehicles to re-examine
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do consider it very urgent that the driver have his
driver's license re-examined by DMV officials,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad had just renewed his license a week ago, and the
Department of Motor Vehicles required him to return to the DMV on
Dec. 5, his birthday, of this year to renew his license, a DMV
technician said. On Aug. 24, his exam included a driving test.
</P>
<P>
   His license was restricted to driving only from sunrise to
sunset, with no freeway driving, the DMV said. He was also required
to wear corrective lenses.
</P>
<P>
   After age 70, a California driver must go in person to a DMV
office and take both a written and vision test, said Evan Nossoff,
a DMV spokesman. Though the law allows for a driving test, the DMV
does not require it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not funded for that,'' Nossoff said.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is an exception: If the elderly person measures
below the DMV's 20/40 vision requirement, that person must get an
eye exam and can be ordered to take a driving test, Nossoff said.
And a doctor, DMV employee, law enforcement officer or family
member can request that the driver be reviewed by the DMV's drivers
safety unit.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the oldest licensed driver in California is a man who
is 105 years old, with no tickets or convictions on his record,
Nossoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, a man and woman, are both 104. And three other
drivers are 103 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are 310,559 licensed drivers 80 to 84, 122,034
who are 85 to 90, and 27,220 who are 90 and older, according to DMV
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   By 2015, DMV projects there could be 6 million licensed drivers
over 65, including 1.6 million over 80.
</P>
<P>
   Comparatively, teen-agers 16 to 19 account for 872,472 of the
licensed drivers in the state. The largest category is age 35 to 39
with 2.6 million licensed drivers.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1995 DMV study of teen and senior drivers, those
age 85 and older are 2.2 times as likely to be at fault in a fatal
collision as the average driver and about 10 times more likely
based on miles driven.
</P>
<P>
   However, those 16 to 19 are 2.8 times more likely to be at fault
in such a collision, according to the same study.
</P>
<P>
   Police, including the detective investigating the case, said
more thorough testing is needed for aging drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to do more than answer 10 questions and read a chart
20 feet away or so,'' said Detective Tom Whetzel of the Valley
Traffic Division. ``They should take them out on the road and see
how they drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, on the day of the crash, the Legislature had
taken up a bill that would toughen rules for licensing certain
California drivers: The Brandi Joy Mitock Safe Drivers Act _ SB
335.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, named after a 15-year-old resident of suburban
Woodland Hills was killed in Santa Monica by a 96-year-old
hit-and-run driver who had been suffering strokes for four years,
would require DMV to give road, written and vision tests to drivers
reported as unsafe by law enforcement, doctors or family members.
</P>
<P>
   The bill seeks to strengthen current law that makes a DMV review
of an unsafe driver purely discretionary, said Rocky Rushing, chief
of staff for the bill's author, state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to prevent tragedies like the one that happened
in Sylmar,'' Rushing said.

FIRST IMPRESSION SHAKY FOR KARL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia displayed
one more of his attributes Wednesday night: a remarkably keen eye.
</P>
<P>
   Asked before Wednesday's game about his pitcher from the
previous night, left-hander Scott Karl, Scioscia replied, ``We saw
some positive things.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? In his first start for the Angels after coming to
Anaheim in a deal last week with Colorado, Karl lasted all of 2
innings, yielded nine hits and left trailing by four.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's someone who can be a high pitch-count guy,'' Scioscia
said of Karl, who was around for just 50 pitches in his Angels
debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability to change speeds better than he did
(Tuesday night).''
</P>
<P>
   Karl, who admitted afterward he was on the jittery side as well
as a little rusty, will make his next start Monday night in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   More rehab for Belcher: Right-hander Tim Belcher will not be
activated Friday, the day clubs expand their rosters, but will
pitch that night in his second rehab assignment with Single-A Lake
Elsinore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'll see,'' Scioscia said. ``He'll throw 100 or so
pitches, then we'll have to decide if he's better off going back
into the rotation or will be used out of the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, 38, had elbow surgery in December, came back to make
four starts, then strained the elbow again July 2 and has been on
the disabled list since.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Belcher finally is activated he'll quickly be
deactivated; he still must serve a three-game suspension for
arguing a balk call during a 2-1 loss at Seattle on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   No cigar - yet: After extensive research the Angels' public
relations department has discovered that Darin Erstad's 109-point
leap in average - from .253 last year to .362 entering Wednesday's
game - would be the third-greatest increase in baseball were the
season to end. Thus far, it's the largest in 82 years.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 is George Burns, who jumped from .226 in 1917 to .352 in
1918, an increase of 126 points. George Davis' 110-point leap -
from .241 in 1982 to .355 in 1983 - was the second greatest.
</P>
<P>
   What the P.R. staff couldn't pin down was Burns' choice of
cigar.
</P>
<P>
   More pitching help: The Angels claimed right-hander Ben Weber
off waivers from San Francisco and assigned him to Triple-A
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Weber, 30, was 0-1 in nine relief appearances with the Giants
and was 4-8 with seven saves in 38 appearances, including three
starts, for Triple-A Fresno of the Pacific Coast League.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential
candidate and former defense secretary, delivered a harsh
assessment Wednesday of the condition of the armed forces under
President Clinton, accusing him of ``running down'' a military that
has succeeded in recent conflicts only because of the military
buildup of past Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said the American military was stretched over too many
foreign theaters and hampered by low morale, low pay, inadequate
training and unreliable weapons and equipment. He accused Clinton,
and by association Vice President Al Gore, of neglecting the
national defense to the point where military planners were no
longer certain that the United States could meet its stated goals
of being prepared to fight two medium-sized conflicts at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decisions made today shape the forces of tomorrow,'' he told
an audience of several hundred veterans and political supporters in
a hotel ballroom here. ``That is why we were able to win the Gulf
War _ because we were commanding a military that had been rebuilt
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that is why the current administration has been able to
conduct its vast deployments, from Baghdad to Belgrade. The ships
and planes were ready. The pilots and crewmen were prepared. The
missiles, the ammunition, the equipment and the men and women to
use them were all there. That is the military they inherited. The
question today is what future presidents will inherit.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense analysts acknowledged several of Cheney's arguments, but
cautioned that he exaggerated some of the criticisms and ignored
positive trends in the military under the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot valid points in the speech _ things aren't
quite as good as they were under Cheney,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a
defense policy specialist at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``But he greatly overstates the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's appearance, which was scheduled only in recent days,
seemed to signal a shift in tactics in the Bush campaign. Cheney's
aides had said he would spend the week talking about education. But
after more than a week in which the Bush campaign found itself
defending its policies on tax and health care, Cheney returned to
more familiar Republican ground with an appeal on national
security.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Cheney also seemed to be trying to play the role
that Republicans had hoped he would take in the campaign _ lending
his age, experience and authority as a former defense secretary to
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee.
Indeed, Cheney not only framed his remarks as the words of the
defense secretary who helped defeat Iraq, but portrayed himself as
a man who had returned to public life in large part because of his
desire to repair the damage he said had been done to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney offered few concrete proposals in his speech Wednesday.
But in the past the Bush campaign has called for a $20 billion
increase in the military budget for research and development from
2002 through 2006, for directing the Defense Department to spend a
fifth of its procurement budget on new technologies and for
increasing the recently enacted pay raise for members of the armed
services by $1 billion more a year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded Wednesday night to Cheney's criticisms. ``We have
the strongest military in the world by far, and we reversed the
decline that began in the Bush-Quayle years,'' Gore told reporters.
``And I have advocated additional steps to continue the rebuilding
and strengthen- ing to make sure it's always the best and always
more than adequate.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has said that the vice president advocates a
10-year, $127 billion in- crease in spending on military salaries,
training and modernization, and that amount may in- crease when
Gore adjusts his budget propos- als to reflect a growing surplus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Cheney also sought to counter the Democratic
response to the criticism directed by Bush at President Clinton's
military policies. Since those attacks began in recent weeks, Gore
and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, accused
Bush and Cheney of denigrating the American military, which they
said sent a bad signal to allies and potential adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``To point out that our military has been overextended, taken
for granted, and neglected _ that is no criticism of the
military,'' Cheney said Wednesday. ``That is a criticism of a
president and a vice president, and the record they have built
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said that Gore had expressed concerns that criticism
about the military would send the wrong message to potential
adversaries, and he used it to make another dig at the Clinton
administration. ``If our potential adversaries have received any
`wrong messages' recently,'' he said, ``it was not from the
newspapers, but from the nuclear lab at Los Alamos. And what lesson
do they draw from the fact that this administration has failed to
safeguard our nation's most vital national secrets?''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney attributed the Clinton administration's recent military
successes, like the NATO bombing that led to the withdrawal of of
Serb forces from Kosovo and the air strikes on Iraq, to the
military build-up under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
And he said that the Republicans in Congress deserved the credit
for recent increases in the defense budget.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While many of the examples Cheney cited echoed his past remarks
_ that fewer units are ready for combat, recruitment is down, aging
equipment poses a danger and low pay is damaging morale _ he cast
his criticisms in a much more partisan light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the record of eight years of stewardship over the
American armed forces by President Clinton and Vice President
Gore,'' he said. ``Eight years of neglect and misplaced priorities.
Eight years of multiplying missions and unclear goals. Eight years
during which the enemies of freedom have not been idle. Eight years
is a long time _ and eight years is long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military today is overused and under-resourced,'' he said.
``All this has brought on serious problems of readiness,
recruiting, retention and morale.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon, the Brookings Institution analyst, criticized Cheney
for not proposing a specific alternative for overseas commitments
or enlarging the military. ``As much as Cheney says we've
overdeployed and overcut, there's been no proposal by the campaign
to reverse either of those policies,'' O'Hanlon said. ``The idea
they'll review U.S. commitments and find any big cutbacks is
illusory.''
</P>
<P>
   A former national security budget specialist under Clinton,
Gordon Adams, said many of the problems Cheney cited, including
substandard military housing, was prevalent during the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's selectively culled barnicles of the readiness issue, but
many are out of context,'' said Adams, who now directs the security
policy studies program at George Washington University. ``This is
not neglect, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams also said the former defense secretary was not giving the
military enough credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When called upon, this force has performed spectacularly
well,'' Adams said. ``He fails to note the question of readiness
for what? To the rest of the world, the U.S. military isn't just
the toughest kid on the block, it's the toughest by far.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Gore campaign echoed the criticism. ``By
twisting facts about our military for partisan gain, Governor Bush
has demonstrated that he is not ready to be America's
commander-in-chief,'' said the spokesman, Douglas Hattaway. ``Our
military is the strongest, most capable, most ready fighting force
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have countered Cheney's assertion that morale
is declining, citing improvements in the number of troops
re-enlisting, which they attribute to two years of increases in pay
and benefits. They have also pointed to improvements this year in
recruiting, although reserve recruiting has declined and there has
been a shortage in commissioned officers, with a drastic increase
in the number of captains leaving the Army.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cheney offered few concrete proposals to bolster the nation's
military in his speech although he did say that a Bush-Cheney
administration would spend more money researching new technologies
and deploying missile defenses, that it would raise pay for the
troops and improve their housing and schools.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the importance of what aides billed as a major
policy speech, Cheney's aides encouraged reporters to interview
another Gulf War colleague of Cheney's _ Colin Powell, the retired
general who led the joint chiefs of staff. ``I share his view,''
Powell said in a telephone interview. ``We still have a great
force, and I don't think anybody would say we don't. But we owe
them everything they need to get the jobs done.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., released a statement in support
of the speech. ``Congress deserves a share of the blame for this
problem for annually treating the defense budget as just another
pork barrel,'' he said. ``But the lion's share of our failure
belongs rightfully to the man honored to serve as
commander-in-chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Cheney's most pointed dig at the opposition came when he
quoted an ``observer of the military'' in his speech. ``One
observer of the military,'' he said. ``had this to say last year:
`Our military faces readiness problems,' he cautioned, `including
falling recruitment, and retention in critical skill areas; aging
equipment that costs more to keep operating at acceptable levels of
reliability; a need for more support services for a force with a
high percentage of married personnel; and frequent deployments.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a fair summary of the problem,'' Cheney said, ``and it
came from Senator Joseph Lieberman.''

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fishermen risk going overboard and have little job
security. Cowboys don't get paid much and get hurt a lot.
Lumberjacks face high risks and bone-wearying work.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the worst jobs America has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   But financial planners, Web site managers and computer systems
analysts they have the best jobs of all, according to the new
``Jobs Rated Almanac,'' which lists the best _ and lousiest _ jobs
for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Buckets of cash, time to spend it and being your own boss have
propelled financial planner from No. 17 last year to America's top
gig, author Les Krantz said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are thinking about retirement and they need
professional advice,'' said the 57-year-old Krantz, in his fifth
year of rating jobs. ``The stock market is booming, and we see the
need for good financial planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ortiz, a 33-year-old financial planner from Glendale whose
wife is pregnant with their first child, was elated at the
promising rank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome, good to hear that,'' said Ortiz of American Express
Financial Services in Glendale. ``I do enjoy what I do; you're
helping people all the time, it's the most rewarding part of my
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I always wanted to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mining data from the U.S. Department of Labor, trade
organizations and telephone interviews, Krantz ranks 250 jobs
according to six criteria: income; stress; work environment; job
outlook; job security; and physical demands.
</P>
<P>
   The top ranked jobs, like last year, were in math or
computer-related fields. Web site managers, top dogs last year,
slipped to No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a glut of people in computer jobs,'' Krantz said in
explaining the drop. ``A few years ago, computer jobs were not in
abundance, but today, even a dope can do it. You just have to know
how to type.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the almanac's rankings seem predictable. Got a yen to
be president of the United States? Better figure the highest stress
(No. 250) and worst working environment (No. 250), according to
Krantz, a Wisconsin author and journalist. Of course, the $400,000
salary and benefits provide a balance in the best paying category.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs with the most tedium were also least stressful: medical
records technician, janitor and musical instrument repairer to name
a few. ``Clarinets don't give you much guff when you're fixing
them,'' Krantz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Krantz almanac advised would-be teachers (No. 119) and cops
(No. 200) that such callings offered low pay, high stress and
less-than-desirable working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Krantz's advice for career cubs or job changers: Above all, find
out what a person does at the job all day. It's not what you see on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see Perry Mason and Johnny Cochran and think, Boy, what
a great way to make a living. In actual fact, that's not what
lawyers do every day _ being a lawyer is very tedious, (often)
filing forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the job-crud five, ranked at the bottom because of
long hours and poor working conditions: fisherman, oil field
roustabout, lumberjack, cowboy and ironworker, according to Krantz.
</P>
<P>
   Fisherman, besides being one of the most dangerous, is one of
the worst jobs. ``You're in the boat all day getting seasick with a
lot of smelly fish; it's not fun. And a lot of waters are getting
fished out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a cowboy when I grew up _ I still want to be
one,'' Krantz said. ``But even cowboys get the blues. You're
stepping in cow s--- all day, it's raining, you're out there
punching cows.''
</P>
<P>
   While not many people would opt for a job in the worst-ranked
working environment, that of the president of the United States,
those toiling in the fifth-worst-ranked working environment, taxi
drivers, said they didn't have many complaints about their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Valley Cab driver Steve Froehlich, 51, who works the 4 p.m. to 3
a.m. shift, said based on his experience, he totally disagrees with
the ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to love what I'm doing,'' he said. ``It gives me
freedom to do what I want. I have no boss ... basically we are on
our own out there.'' Froehlich did acknowledge, however, that there
are inherent dangers on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was robbed a number of years ago driving a cab in New
York,'' he said. ``I didn't drive again for a while, but I went
back to it.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to earning an income, waiters and waitresses
ranked the lowest, followed by dishwashers, bartenders, dressmakers
and cashiers.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Tovar, a 26-year-old waiter at the TGI Friday's in
suburban Woodland Hills, said he didn't think that waiting tables
should have been ranked as the lowest-income job with an average
wage of $14,058 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe most people make a little more than that, especially
at this TGI Friday's,'' Tovar said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the low ranking could be attributed to the uncertainty
attached with the varying tips.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``You might go through a week when you're not making a lot of
money,'' he said. ``One week you can make $600 to $700 and the next
only $300,'' he said, adding that about 90percent of his income is
from tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on the restaurant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The job of president of the United States also ranked as the
most stressful, followed by firefighters, senior corporate
executives, race car drivers and surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County fire Capt. Mark Savage, who works out of
Station 73 in Newhall, said he was not surprised by the ranking
firefighters received.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stress is something we don't think about,'' Savage said.
``We accept that it may shorten our life expectancy with the
exposure to the stress and the hazards we encounter ... but we
wouldn't trade it for anything because we enjoy what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lists such as Krantz's generate excitement and cause people to
think, career planners say. But they sometimes fail to guide
prospects to meaningful careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't talk about what people's skills are,'' Adele
Scheele, director of the Career Center at California State
University, Northridge, said of the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most meaningful type of career is what uses your best
talents and consumes your interest,'' Scheele said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet people still work terrible jobs, Krantz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we complain, I think people love and take pride in
their jobs,'' Krantz said. ``The American worker takes the most
pride in even the worst job. I would say working is alive and
well.''

 BURNING MAN ORGANIZERS WANT TO PUT BREAKS ON `SPECTATORS'  &HT;     By JAMES SULLIVAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At Burning Man, the annual art carnival in the
Black Rock Desert of Nevada, strange behaviors are not just
tolerated, they're encouraged. Voyeurism, however, is not one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the festival's organizers have made some subtle
changes to discourage the ``spectators,'' last-minute visitors who
show up simply to gawk and party. Their numbers have been
increasing in recent years, to the chagrin of the artists, event
planners and self-proclaimed freaks who claim Burning Man as their
own.
</P>
<P>
   For many in the San Francisco Bay Area, Burning Man, the
fantastical celebration now in its 15th year, has made the Labor
Day weekend's traditional last gasp of summer more like a howl. The
event runs through Monday, and the annual ceremonial bonfire of the
50-foot man takes place Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, walkup tickets were available during the entire run
of the festival. This year, for the first time since Burning Man
moved to the desert 11 years ago, there is a cutoff: midnight
Thursday. No tickets will be sold during the last four days of the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at the festival, once an improvisational gathering of
a few dozen friends on the beach in San Francisco, has been rising
sharply in recent years, from 15,000 in 1998 to 24,000 last year.
This year 28,000 are expected.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, Burning Man founder Larry Harvey and his team decided
it was time to tap the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Variously described as New Age, a space-age Woodstock and a
bacchanal, Burning Man attracts artists, performers and
exhibitionists who relish the opportunity to create a temporary
community from scratch each year. People set up cafes, radio
stations and galleries; real money is useless, but bartering with
candy or toys is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Prices this year are up considerably, to $200 for advance
tickets and up to $250 for those bought on-site before the cutoff.
Officially, the higher prices are attributed to higher fees imposed
by the federal Bureau of Land Management, which regulates Burning
Man's use of the dried-mud playa at Black Rock, 100 miles northeast
of Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to abolish last-minute walkup tickets ``was to
discourage last-minute decision making,'' said Marian Goodell,
Burning Man's ``mistress of communication.'' ``We implemented the
policy to try and reduce the `looky-loo' factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Also this year, the festival entrance has been moved about nine
miles farther from Gerlach, the tiny town of 250, which represents
the closest thing to civilization at the barren festival scene.
</P>
<P>
   Goodell said that the event still has room to grow, provided it
happens through ``slow growth.'' There are resource issues to
consider _ ``the number of Porta Potties there are within several
hundred miles of the site,'' for instance. ``There are
infrastructural limits, but we haven't hit them yet. We're sort of
in a yellow zone.''
</P>
<P>
   For devotees, the policy changes are minor impediments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd travel further,'' said East Bay musician Ben Leinbach, 33,
who was a first-timer last year and left last night for his second
Burning Man experience. The effort involved in making your own
personal Burning Man a success, he said, is ``taxing, but I
definitely think it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leinbach said he was well aware before he attended the event
last year that creative participation _ a costume, an art
installation, a fortune-telling tent _ was considered mandatory at
Burning Man. He and his friend, guitarist Chris Shot, made a mobile
percussion rack, and they strolled around, serenading camp sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a few posses of _ what do we call them? _ `yahoos,' ''
he said. ``There were a couple groups of rowdy, drunk people who
didn't seem to be offering anything.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, planning for Burning Man is a year-round proposition,
but August is especially hectic. In recent weeks, campers have been
raiding Bay Area suppliers for their Burning Man equipment _
coolers, tent stakes, solar showers, face paint and endless gallons
of water. Those who want to make the trip in recreational vehicles
rent them months in advance. The value of a solid, no-frills
bicycle out on the vast playa has made it nearly impossible to find
a used bike in the Bay Area in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much everything gets sold,'' said Tony DeLeon, a
mechanic at Pedal Revolution in the Mission District of San
Francisco, which salvages old bike parts. People going to the
desert, he said, ``don't care what it is _ clunkers, 3-speeds _ as
long as it rolls and has air in the tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning a contribution _ your installation or your rave tent _
often takes months, too. Dan Das Mann, a San Francisco artist who
founded Headless Point Studios on Hunters Point, taught 36 people
how to weld this spring so they could work on his project.
</P>
<P>
   They built three 20-foot-tall masks made from copper, grass and
driftwood designed to suggest what the stick-figure man's face
might look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What is the man's face to us? Is it love? Hate? Is it
you or me?' '' said Das Mann, who is trained as a landscape
architect. ``I wanted it to be a completely collaborative
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as everyone understands that spirit of cooperation,
Burning Man's Goodell said, the more the merrier. As a temporary
community created entirely by its inhabitants, Burning Man is an
experiment in utopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally we would like to affect as many people as possible,''
said Goodell. ``Through a slow-growth process, this event could
probably be 40,000 or 50,000 people.''

 CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE VOTE TO TAX SALES OVER THE INTERNET  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL and KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Wading into one of the most controversial policy
debates of the new economy, the California Legislature voted
Wednesday to force many Internet retailers to charge sales tax in
California.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when government leaders from Washington to Wyoming are
eyeing substantial tax revenues from the rapidly expanding
e-commerce business, the Assembly's 42-to-31 approval of a measure
by Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, thrusts California to the
forefront of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was approved by the Senate 21 to 14 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the effect of the law is to make Internet sales conform to
laws governing catalog operations, it also takes the critical step
of defining Internet sales for taxing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis had said he is opposed to Internet taxes, but
even if he vetoes Migden's bill, it will be viewed as a bellwether
on the overall issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the cutting edge of this,'' said Lenny Goldberg, the
lobbyist for the California Tax Reform Association. ``It will have
have national implications. A lot of other states should be looking
at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Migden's bill goes to the heart of the highly charged debate
about taxing the billions of dollars of online sales of books,
clothes, stereos and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Internet companies must charge sales tax
just because they have a brick-and-mortar store in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Critics maintain that the bill is a hidden tax increase and will
drive business out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill doesn't solve the problem, it exacerbates it,'' said
Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-Rancho Cucamonga. ``What this bill will
do is grow the economy of all the other states in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Migden said the bill simply clarifies existing law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fair and square measure _ not an expansion,'' she
said. ``According to current law, there are gross violators, and we
are going to require them to collect.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ross, owner of Cody's Books, a bookstore in Berkeley that
has some online sales, said that current California law gives
companies like Barnesandnoble.com an unfair advantage over his
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never expected to get this far,'' he said. ``We thought it
was going to be a good consciousness-raising device about this tax
loophole. ``Surprisingly, California is taking a path-breaking
role. California is like a company town that has been dominated by
technology for many years now.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal government and dozens of states are
considering taxing the Internet, officials in Migden's office said
no other state has tried specifically to enforce sales tax
collection by dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, some e-tailers like Barnesandnoble.com and
Borders.com do not charge California sales tax because their
Internet subsidiaries are based outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   But other online retailers _ such as Macys.com and
EddieBauer.com _ do charge state sales tax because they do not use
separate, out-of-state subsidiaries to operate their online
doppelgangers.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy stems from a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that
requires merchants to collect sales tax only in states where they
have a physical presence or ``nexus.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble have said that their
stores do not constitute nexuses for their Web subsidiaries because
their Internet operations are separate.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Davis signs Migden's bill, it does not apply directly to
companies like Amazon.com, which exist only as Web sites. However,
its long-term affects are unclear, as the bill opens the doors to
all kinds of Internet taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents have said it is the thin edge of a wedge aimed at
wholesale taxation of the Internet. The Internet is largely a
tax-free zone because of the 1992 decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The bill) doesn't really apply to Amazon, which is the giant
gorilla on the Internet,'' said Ross. ``But we couldn't create the
perfect law.''
</P>
<P>
   Other foes say the bill is simply misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill tries to shoehorn e-commerce business into an old
tax system that doesn't make any sense,'' said Chris Schultz,
spokesman for the American Electronics Association, a high-tech
trade group in Silicon Valley that opposes the bill. ``A better
approach would be to simplify the tax code.''
</P>
<P>
   But proponents say such a law will level the playing field, and
possibly provide a boon to schools, transportation agencies and
others that rely on taxes to support improvements and new
construction.
</P>
<P>
   According to a General Accounting Office report released last
month, California will forfeit between $23 million and $533 million
in Internet sales tax revenues this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is closing a loophole,'' said Hut Landon, executive
director of the Corte Madera's Northern California Independent
Booksellers' Association, a group of about 300 booksellers that has
lobbied for the bill's passage. ``This is score one for the little
guys.''

LONG AWAITED SWITCH TO A MINORITY-MAJORITY STATE WILL AFFECT ALL 
 ASPECTS OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ, LORI OLSZEWSKI and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Long anticipated, California's transformation
into a minority-majority state may have arrived with little
fanfare, but make no mistake about it _ the shift in the
demographic landscape is expected to ripple through most every
aspect of life.
</P>
<P>
   Experts, responding to census data showing the rise to dominance
of minority groups over non-Latino white Californians, anticipate
that the shift will change the state's political makeup, its
economic balance, its educational institutions _ even people's
perceptions of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no place in the state that is not touched by
immigration and these racial and ethnic changes,'' said Mark
Baldassare, senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of
California in San Francisco and author of a book on the state's
demographic changes, ``California in the New Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be inventing a new kind of society, and we don't
really have any urban states to use as a role model. California of
the future may look a lot like Los Angeles today.''
</P>
<P>
   Whites _ a census category that can include Latinos _ still make
up the majority, with 79 percent of the population. But for the
first time since 1860, California's minorities have, as a group,
taken the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Released this week, the new census figures _ annual estimates
based on births, deaths and net migration for 1990-1999 _ show that
the percentage of non-Latino whites in the state dropped from 57.1
percent in 1990 to 49.9 percent in 1999. At the same time, the
state's Latino population rose from 26 percent to 31.6 percent, and
the Asian and Pacific Islander population increased from below 10
percent to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other California minorities increased, but not as much as Asians
and Latinos. American Indian and Alaska Native populations grew by
9.4 percent, and the African American population increased by 5.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers for Latinos and Asians are startling, the
transformation has happened gradually during the past decade.
Whites already have been a minority in the state's public school
classrooms for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   And more minorities are on the way, said Baldassare, with even
more dramatic changes ahead. By mid-century, he said, the state's
Latino population alone will outnumber whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigration will continue to be the dominant growth engine for
California,'' said William Frey of the University of Michigan's
Population Research Center. ``California is going to be an
immigrant state.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a fact already reflected by recent voting and registration
trends.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study released by the Field Institute last May,
the entire 1.1 million increase in registered voters over the past
10 years can be attributed to minorities, most of them Latino. The
number of non-Latino white voters actually fell by about 100,000,
while Latinos added about that same number of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has huge implications politically,'' said Mark DiCamillo,
director of the Field Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Latinos have served as lieutenant governor,
speaker of the Assembly and head of the state Democratic party.
Candidates for statewide office regularly run Spanish-language ads,
and the two candidates for governor in 1998 had a live debate on
Spanish-language television.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of the state's Latino voters have registered since
1994, when voters passed Proposition 187, aimed at illegal
immigrants. The measure enraged California Latinos and sparked
successful efforts to naturalize more resident aliens and register
them to vote.
</P>
<P>
   California and the nation had a look at that growing power last
March, when the state's Latinos voted overwhelmingly for Democrat
Al Gore in the state's blanket primary. According to exit polls by
the Voter News Service, Latino voters accounted for almost all of
Gore's 6 percent margin over Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the state
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The growing political clout of the state's Latinos hasn't
escaped the notice of other minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asians are looking at the Latinos' move to political power as
a model, but there's a long way to go,'' said David Lee of the
Chinese-American Voter Education Committee in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of Asian voters has increased by about 300,000
over the past decade, ``that's still nowhere near the population
growth,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are beginning to make their influence felt regionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``In places like San Francisco, for example, Asians have
achieved political mass'' and are getting the political power that
goes along with that, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   While minorities have made significant population and political
gains, they are not making comensurate economic and educational
advances. Particularly vulnerable, experts say, are poor,
non-English-speaking Latinos and their children, whose numbers are
increasing at the fastest rate.
</P>
<P>
   Without major policy changes that reflect the demographic shift,
the state is on a path to disaster, experts say. We could find
ourselves with an under-educated, low-paid minority workforce
responsible for supporting the bulge of aging, white Baby Boomers
who soon will be retiring in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made these disinvestments and Latinos get the short
end of the stick, and that hurts everybody,'' said David
Hayes-Bautista, director of the Center for the Study of Latino
Health and Culture at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   But shaping a young, affluent work force from a largely poor
minority pool starts with educating them, said Audrey Wagman,
principal of Oak Grove Middle School in Concord. Schools, she said,
must begin as early as possible addressing the educational needs of
a diverse population.
</P>
<P>
   At Oak Grove, 25 languages are spoken, and the make-up of
student body is evenly split between minorities and whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers need to be able to teach the children who walk into
their classroom,'' Wagman added. ``This is the world we live in. We
need to know how to get these kids up to speed in terms of English
language development.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the needs and challenges facing California increase as
more immigrants move into the state, it should not be assumed that
a minority-majority will be some sort of burden, said Seema Nayyar,
editor of American Demographics in New York cautioned that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you are in one economic group in one decade
doesn't mean you will be in the next decade,'' she said. ``As the
minority becomes the majority, they will also become the majority
in economics, in schools and in colleges as well as in the
workplace and they will begin to have more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, the first Latino to hold statewide
office in more than 120 years, concurred. The needs and desires of
the growing ranks of minorities, he said, will be no different than
most others in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that hard working people are in a
situation where they can take care of their kids and have something
when they get old,'' he said. ``There may be more Sanchezes, but
the issues will basically be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues might be, but the sights, smells, and flavors will
reflect many different cultures. In fact, the landscape is already
being transformed all across the state, in traditional white-flight
suburbs, as well as urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   In strip malls in Irvine, a traditional white enclave in Orange
County, Asian grocery stores and restaurants are popping up where
chain stores used to be, Baldassare said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be seen in the fact that Mexican food is no longer
considered ethnic because of Taco Bell, in the fact that a good
majority of teenagers listen to rap and Latin music,'' Nayyar said.
``It will seep through the culture.''

MISSOURI GAMING COMMISSION VOTES TO REVOKE CASINO LICENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri Gaming
Commission moved Wednesday to strip Station Casinos Inc. of its
licenses to operate in Missouri after its executives boycotted a
public hearing into the activities of a St. Louis lawyer who once
represented Station.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Station executives challenged the commission's
investigative authority and refused to honor subpoenas to testify
at the Kansas City hearing on the activities of attorney Michael
Lazaroff. They made good on that threat Wednesday, prompting a
unanimous commission vote to revoke the company's licenses to
operate in the state.
</P>
<P>
   A Station attorney said the company would appeal the hastily
prepared order. That will trigger a public hearing later this year
and probable lawsuits that could take years to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Station operates Kansas City's biggest and most lucrative casino
and another complex in St. Charles, Mo. Combined, the company's
Missouri casinos generate $288.4 million a year in gambling
revenues alone and employ 3,500 people. The casinos would continue
to operate while legal matters are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed revocation of its Missouri licenses could trigger a
similar inquiry in Nevada, where Station operates five casinos.
</P>
<P>
   One of the possible scenarios could see the commission allowing
Station to sell its Missouri riverboats, pay a fine and voluntarily
surrender its licenses, similar to the commission's decision in the
aftermath of a scandal that forced Hilton Hotels Corp. to sell its
Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Station already has proposed a $475 million sale of its
Missouri operations to a group of five company executives. Two of
those executives were subpoenaed to appear.
</P>
<P>
   One, William W. Warner, Station's vice president for finance,
refused to appear, prompting commission staff members to say they
would begin steps to bar Warner from receiving a Missouri license.
The other, Station's Midwest counsel Troy A. Stremming, is expected
to testify when the hearing resumes today.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hearing examined the $500,000 in bonuses Station
paid Lazaroff over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Lazaroff pleaded guilty in federal court in
St. Louis to multiple felonies, including misappropriation of more
than $800,000 in law-firm funds. That included $500,000 from
Station that rightly belonged to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to cooperate in the commission probe while awaiting
sentencing in exchange for leniency consideration in his expected
prison sentence of 27 to 33 months.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Kansas City also is examining Lazaroff's
affairs. FBI agents monitored Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials were aware of at least $100,000 of
Station's payments since 1996 and questioned Lazaroff about the
money at the time. But only recently have questions been raised
about whether that money was used to improperly influence any
public officials to approve Station's St. Charles and Kansas City
casinos in 1994 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaroff testified that was ``absolutely not'' true. He said he
kept the money and spent it all on himself and his family. Federal
prosecutors who examined Lazaroff's bank records earlier this year
made no allegations of bribery of any public official.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's testimony focused tightly on Lazaroff's relationship
with Robert L. Wolfson, the Gaming Commission's chairman from its
inception in 1993 until February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Following several hours of testimony by Lazaroff, Wolfson
acknowledged improper contacts with Lazaroff over the years.
Wolfson said he used Lazaroff to obtain tickets to Las Vegas shows
for clients and family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad judgment,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaroff characterized their relationship as an illicit and
``tacit understanding'' that each would provide the other with
useful information. ``I think we used each other,'' Lazaroff said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson responded that he was ``appalled by distortions'' in
Lazaroff's testimony. Wolfson said he typically tried to discourage
Lazaroff from initiating private conversations about casino
regulatory matters; such conversations are barred by the
commission's ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazaroff produced documents he faxed to Wolfson that he said
painted a picture of a quid pro quo and a continuing flow of
information between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1996 example, Lazaroff said Wolfson detailed his concerns
about Station's plans for financing construction of its $300
million Kansas City casino. Lazaroff reported those concerns to
Station, which then shaped its financing plans to satisfy Wolfson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no such recollection,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson repeatedly testified under oath that ``I have no
independent recollection'' of any sensitive information he
allegedly disclosed to the casino lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Under commission rules, all improper contacts must be reported
by the commissioner involved and also by the regulated casino, if
it is aware of the contact.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolfson told the commission he never reported any of his
contacts with Lazaroff. Office and residential phone records made
public by the commission document more than 200 calls between the
two men over six years.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaroff said there were many more than that from other phones.
During particularly controversial periods his contact with Wolfson
was ``daily,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State law has no disciplinary sanctions against commissioners or
former commissioners. But failure by Station to report improper
contacts could bring further disciplinary actions _ including a
separate license revocation order.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaroff testified that Station executives were sometimes in the
room or in his car when he spoke by telephone with Wolfson, and
that Station executives frequently asked him to clear company
issues with Wolfson before they were made public.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Warner, the other Station executives who received
subpoenas to testify at Wednesday's hearing were: Frank J. Fertitta
III, chairman and chief executive; Glenn C. Christenson, executive
vice president and chief financial officer; Scott Nielson,
executive vice president and general counsel; Richard Haskins,
associate general counsel; John Pasqualotto, vice president of
regulatory compliance; and Marnie Hinrichs, executive secretary to
Nielson.
</P>
<P>
   At midday press conferences next door to the commission hearing
room at the Westin Crown Center hotel, Station lawyer Charles
German deflected Lazaroff's testimony, calling him a convicted
felon and a liar who is trying to shorten his prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   German acknowledged, however, that Station executives were aware
of Lazaroff's contacts with Wolfson, but depended on them to follow
the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``People hire lawyers like Mike Lazaroff and his law firm, which
is very well regarded in this state, to keep them out of trouble,
not to get them into trouble,'' German said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaroff refused all interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   Station's troubles had little impact on Wall Street Wednesday,
where its publicly traded stock closed at $14.81, down 6 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaroff was one of the principal forces who lobbied for
Missouri riverboat gambling in the early 1990s, and he represented
many Missouri casino firms over the years.
</P>
<P>
   His first client was the President Casino on the Admiral in St.
Louis, whose owners in the late 1980s pressed for riverboat
gambling in Iowa, where Lazaroff first made his reputation as a
gaming-industry lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   President executives who testified Wednesday said Lazaroff never
suggested to them he had any extraordinary relationship with
Wolfson, and they said they never pressed him to seek such
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson was appointed by Gov. Mel Carnahan and shaped the
development of casino gambling in Missouri until resigning the post
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson established Feld Chevrolet in 1947 and is a co-founder
and former officer of the St. Louis Blues National Hockey League
franchise. He also has established several banks, including Parkway
Bank and Progress Bank, which are now part of the Mercantile Bank
group.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaroff and Wolfson testified that they first became close
while serving as board members at a St. Louis country club. ( 30 )

 EBAY TURNING 5 YEARS OLD AS TOP AUCTION SITE  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's not much of a stretch to say that EBay
changed Michael Krasow's life.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of Pacific Loan &AMP; Jewelry Co., a pawn shop on Sixth
Street in San Francisco, gave his business a jump start by selling
items to EBay users throughout the world instead of over the
counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold a Palm Pilot this week to a fellow in Germany,'' Krasow
said. ``I sold a guitar to a lady in Connecticut. I don't put a lot
of stuff out front in my store anymore. Now I just keep it in the
back and sell it online.''
</P>
<P>
   His experience mirrors that of millions of people who have
helped San Jose's EBay evolve from an electronic clearinghouse for
Pez dispensers and Beanie Babies to an economic juggernaut, with
the value of annual merchandise sales topping $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   EBay turns 5 years old Monday _ an eternity in Internet time but
a remarkably short period for a single company to both create and
thoroughly dominate an entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   That growth has not been without pitfalls. EBay has seen more
than its share of oddities and hoaxes _ items for sale have
included body parts, babies and even a teenager's virginity _ and
not all sellers have upheld the highest standards of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the FBI reported that online auctions far and away
account for the highest number of complaints relating to fraud on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet EBay continues to grow, with its roughly 16 million
registered users listing more than 5 million items for sale. Each
day, users add an additional 600,000 items to the site. A thousand
bids are entered every second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a global trading platform accessed by millions
each year,'' said Meg Whitman, the company's chief executive.
``Anything you're interested in is there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Whitman's case, her interests, when not overseeing the
planet's largest swap meet, stray toward fly fishing. It goes
without saying that she picks up much of her gear at
you-know-where.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately I've been looking for a collapsible fly rod of a
certain length,'' Whitman said. ``I couldn't find it retail. But I
found it online.''
</P>
<P>
   EBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar on Labor Day in 1995 after
his then-girlfriend, a collector of Pez dispensers, had commented
one day about how it would be nifty if she and like-minded Pez
enthusiasts could hook up via the Net to share their passion.
</P>
<P>
   The bell that went off in Omidyar's head still resonates today.
An early Internet geek, he acted on his girlfriend's suggestion by
creating a sort of virtual flea market where Pez-heads could buy
and sell dispensers to round out their collections.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history. EBay _ as in ``electronic
bay,'' a tip of the hat to the company's Bay Area home _ quickly
expanded its scope to embrace all manner of collectibles. The bull
market for Beanie Babies that emerged around the same time helped
fuel the site's growth.
</P>
<P>
   Today, users really can find almost anything on the site.
Sellers are charged a small fee per listing and then pay EBay a
variable commission, ranging from about 1 percent to 5 percent,
depending on the final sale price.
</P>
<P>
   By functioning in a classic middleman mode, EBay has pulled off
that rarest of tricks _ it is an Internet company that actually
makes money. Last month, the company reported a 159 percent
increase in quarterly earnings to $13.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay has evolved so much over the past five years, you could
argue they've entered the level of AOL or Yahoo,'' said Michael
Cibula, an analyst at Robertson Stephens in San Francisco. ``They
dominate in the U.S., and according to our estimates, they dominate
in almost every international market they're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Those markets will grow by year's end when a French version of
the site debuts, joining EBay outposts in Australia, Britain,
Canada, Germany and Japan. An Italian site is expected next year.
</P>
<P>
   Cibula said EBay has achieved an almost unstoppable ``critical
mass'' among users of online auctions. As the biggest service, he
said, EBay attracts a greater number of would-be buyers and
sellers, which in turn only reinforces its position as the biggest
online auction house.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Cibula noted that technical glitches last
year, which caused prolonged outages and forced EBay to overhaul
its operation, ultimately served to make the company stronger. The
same applies to its handling of high-profile hoaxes and fraud
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone through growing pains,'' Cibula said. ``That's a
huge advantage over competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that EBay is completely out of the woods. Along with being
the biggest kid in the playground, EBay continues to attract more
than its fair share of charlatans and pranksters.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the company halted bidding on an auction in which six
people were offering to sell their votes in November's presidential
election. The bidding went as high as $10,100.
</P>
<P>
   Past items for sale _ legitimate and otherwise _ included
kidneys and other organs, Ku Klux Klan memorabilia and a raft that
the seller claimed Elian Gonzalez rode on from Cuba to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding on a mysterious painting attributed to artist Richard
Diebenkorn soared from 25 cents to $135,805 in May before the
auction was halted. The work has since been discredited by art
experts.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no surprise, then, that the FBI's new Internet Fraud
Complaint Center has found that almost half of all complaints from
Net users concern online auctions. Nondelivery of goods ordered
online was a distant second.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as EBay's reach grows, its user base has become
increasingly sophisticated. Whereas the typical EBay user several
years ago might have been someone cleaning out the basement or
attic, nowadays the site is overshadowed by entrepreneurs who in
essence use EBay as a virtual storefront.
</P>
<P>
   EBay calls them ``power sellers'' _ wholesalers, inventory
liquidators and wannabe e-commerce moguls who now account for the
majority of items listed on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auctions are not just a garage sale for consumers,'' said
Munjal Shah, CEO of Andale Inc., a Mountain View firm specializing
in technology for online auctions. ``They are a new sales channel
for small and medium businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   After closely examining EBay's listings, Shah said he discovered
that a mere 10 percent of the site's sellers account for 80 percent
of its sales. And because they generate so much in listing fees and
commissions, these power sellers have become one of EBay's primary
revenue generators.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Birnbaum is a good case in point. His New Jersey
company, WearAmerica.com, purchases excess designer goods from
retailers at below-wholesale prices and then resells them at a tidy
mark-up. He hopes to see about $2 million in sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half that amount, however, will come from hawking items
on EBay, where Birnbaum estimates he makes up to $100,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can acquire customers at a very low cost,'' he said.
``That's definitely the key. Nobody else can drive traffic like
EBay.''
</P>
<P>
   As an investment, EBay has richly rewarded those who got in
early. Omidyar, the founder, is now worth more than $4 billion
(and, unlike many other techno-riche, has vowed to give away the
bulk of his fortune).
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, which slipped 6 cents yesterday to close at
$61.06, now trades at more than 1,000 times earnings _ a staggering
multiple.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't for the faint-hearted,'' observed Jeetil Patel, an
analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown in San Francisco. ``But over
the long haul, EBay is probably a very sound investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors circulated earlier this year that EBay may be an
acquisition target for Santa Clara's Yahoo, which has struggled to
carve out a piece of the online-auction pie. ``That's still within
the realm of possibility,'' Patel said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, EBay has set its sights on further expansion,
building on acquisitions like auction house Butterfield &AMP;
Butterfield and fixed-price online marketplace Half.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could scroll forward five years, you'd see us in many
more geographies and with many more categories,'' CEO Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect the company to significantly alter the way it
does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to stay focused on the person-to-person and
small-business-to-person marketplace,'' Whitman said. ``That's what
we do best and that's what we'll keep doing.''

 SONY CAMCORDER SEES ALL, DOES ALL  &HT;     By BECKY WARING 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you have been coveting a digital camcorder
but have hesitated to spend the big bucks (typically starting at
about $1,500) for a high-quality model, here's a reason to take the
plunge: Sony's DCR-TRV720.
</P>
<P>
   The TRV720 is the hottest addition to Sony's top-selling Digital
8 line. This $1,199 powerhouse boasts features usually seen in
$2,500 cameras, and is quite simply the best digital video camera
under $1,200 available.
</P>
<P>
   DV camcorders offer several big advantages over traditional
analog models (which use VHSC, 8mm or Hi-8 tape), such as higher
image quality and the ability to transfer footage directly to a
computer for editing (via an IEEE 1394 cable, also known as
FireWire or i.LINK). Digital also means that you can copy tapes
with practically no image degradation; with analog, you get cloudy,
noisy tapes after just a couple generations.
</P>
<P>
   While most consumer DV camcorders use MiniDV tape, the Digital 8
line uses regular Hi-8 tape, recorded digitally. If you already
have a Hi-8 camcorder, you can play back your old tapes with a
Digital 8 model, and re-record them digitally, a great feature.
Hi-8 tapes are about 30 percent cheaper than MiniDV, and easier to
find. Hi-8 tape mechanisms are also less costly than MiniDV, which
means Digital 8 cameras are less expensive too, starting at about
$799.
</P>
<P>
   So what's so great about the TRV720? In terms of size, it's a
handheld model, about 2.5 pounds. Perfectly portable, although not
palm size. A palm-size model would not be able to accommodate the
features this camera has, starting with a phenomenal 25X optical/
450X digital zoom lens, a big 4-inch LCD screen and an optional
13-hour battery.
</P>
<P>
   That zoom lens captures distant action, such as sports events
and concerts, as well as vacation shots of scenery and landmarks.
The TRV720 can shoot still images, too, and with such a long
optical zoom, it can beat many digital still cameras at their own
game. While still pictures from the camcorder are only 640x480,
most digital still cameras are limited to about 10X optical zoom,
so even at megapixel resolutions (1280x1024), they can't match a
close-up from the TRV720.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony also comes with a Memory Stick slot for storing stills.
I would prefer to see a more ubiquitous Compact Flash or SmartMedia
slot, but luckily a serial cable is provided for downloading, so
you don't have to buy yet another adapter to get the images into
the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's PictureGear software for the PC is bundled for
transferring images. There is no Mac version. Mac users can work
around the situation by copying Memory Stick images to tape, but
this is a hassle.
</P>
<P>
   The big LCD screen swivels, so it can be used to frame shots
above the head and below the waist easily, great for crowds and
kids. However, the TRV720 also boasts a flip-up color viewfinder
(most low-cost video cameras have monochrome viewfinders), so you
can have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, amateur videographers will benefit greatly from
SteadyShot image stabilization, which eliminates handheld camera
shake. If you're going to shoot for a long time, a tripod is still
best, but the camera is light and easy to hold. Another cool
feature is the Super NightShot mode, which brightens images about
16X, and can even take footage in pitch-dark conditions by using
infrared light.
</P>
<P>
   Controls are placed well, with three operating modes: camera,
memory and VTR. The camera mode is for shooting video, memory is
for shooting stills onto the Memory Stick card and VTR is for
playback. A strap wrapped around the back of the hand lets you hold
the camera securely and shoot one-handed with the start/stop
button. VTR control buttons (Fast Forward/Rewind/Pause etc.) are
along the top of the camera, again for single-handed operation.
There's also a remote control that works in all three modes.
</P>
<P>
   Camera enthusiasts will also like features such as the ability
to adjust focus and exposure manually, add a light or microphone to
the front accessory shoe and add a time code to recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The TRV720 also includes in-camera special effects and titling
(such as movie credits), although they are elementary and
cumbersome compared with computer video editing packages. By all
means take advantage of the i.LINK port to transfer your footage to
a computer. Most current Mac models have built-in FireWire ports,
as do many consumer-level machines from Sony, Dell and Compaq. You
can also add an IEEE 1394 card to most PCs with PCI slots for less
than $100.
</P>
<P>
   With the TRV720, you can even convert old analog tapes into
digital by using the analog input port. This is a great way to edit
scenes from old home movies along with new ones on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have gotten a video into the computer, you can use
software like Pinnacle's StudioDV, MGI's VideoWave or Apple's
iMovie to edit it, then send it back out to videotape. Or you can
save it in compressed formats for CD or Web playback.
</P>
<P>
   While its amazing zoom lens will be the key attraction for many,
the TRV720 is an all-around great value. It can take excellent
pictures in virtually any environment, and links up to your
computer for editing and sharing video with others.

 AUGUST DOLDRUMS FOR GAP  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The back-to-school season came in with a pained
whimper at Gap Inc., as same-store sales at all four of the
company's divisions declined during August, the retailer reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Companywide, same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least
a year, plummeted 14 percent against August 1999, about twice the
shortfall expected by analysts. Leading the plunge was the
low-price Old Navy chain, which saw same-store sales tumble a
stunning 24 to 26 percent. (Gap provides ranges, rather than
specific numbers, for sales of its individual chains.)
</P>
<P>
   With the help of store openings, total sales rose 6 percent to
$1.09 billion compared with last August. The number of new stores
grew 22 percent to 3,348 worldwide during that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the nature of these results and the uncertainties in the
retail environment and in consumer spending on apparel, we continue
to see risk and challenge in both the third and fourth quarters,''
Gap Chief Financial Officer Heidi Kunz said in a recorded message.
</P>
<P>
   Gap has suffered sales and earnings disappointments all year.
</P>
<P>
   At press time, shares of the onetime Wall Street darling had
skidded 16 percent to $22.50 in after-hours trading, near the
stock's 52-week low. The San Francisco company's sales announcement
was made after the end of the regular trading day.
</P>
<P>
   At the flagship Gap brand, which includes Gap adult, child and
baby stores, same-store sales declined 4 to 6 percent for the
month.
</P>
<P>
   The shortfall was blamed largely on an experiment in which the
Gap adult chain's high-profile television advertising was replaced
with in-store promotions, including a new discount card.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shop Card program fell below our expectations and did not
provide a strong enough voice in the marketplace'' to boost sales
above last year's levels, Kunz said.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to step up television advertising leading into
the holiday shopping season, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Same-store sales at Banana Republic declined 1 to 3 percent
while the company's international division, comprising mostly Gap
stores in Europe and Japan, fell 7 to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Old Navy continued to suffer from warehouse distribution snafus
that began in July. Fixing that problem is the company's top
priority and it expects to have the issue resolved by the end of
September, Kunz said.
</P>
<P>
   In every division, a highly promotional retail climate ``forced
us to take deeper markdowns that we would have liked to attract
customers and clear through inventory,'' Kunz said.
</P>
<P>
   She echoed complaints of other retailers that the beginning of
the back-to-school season, a crucial period for the Gap and Old
Navy chains, has been anemic.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of the typical ``sales build'' through the month of
August was largely responsible for lower-than-expected results, she
said. Already-declining foot traffic at Old Navy actually worsened
as the month progressed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite weak sales, inventories companywide are currently at
expected levels. Also, consumers seem to like Old Navy's new
``techno chino'' merchandise and a ``cleaner'' fashion focus at Gap
stores, Kunz said.

TWO MEN HOLD WOMAN HOSTAGE IN HER CAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY BERRIOS and ANNE LAMOY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 53-year-old Kansas
woman was snatched from her home early Wednesday, touching off a
three-county police chase and a desperate standoff with police that
dragged on into a second day.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early Thursday, police were still attempting to negotiate the
release of the hostage, See Vongphrachanh. She reportedly was
showing signs of heat-related illness brought on by more than 20
hours inside the sport-utility vehicle holding her and her two
armed captors.
</P>
<P>
   The SUV, disabled in Gladstone, Mo., after a chase that wound
through downtown Kansas City, was surrounded by a phalanx of police
and FBI agents as negotiations played out in hours of 100-degree
heat and then into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Police estimated that 70 to 100 officers were involved, and the
area was blocked off to the public for several blocks in each
direction. Residents from at least two homes were evacuated, others
were asked to stay inside at about a dozen homes, and 21 children
stayed home from school.
</P>
<P>
   The episode began about 3 a.m. Wednesday, when a man dialed 911
and said two intruders were in his house, holding his family
against their will. Inside the split-level house in the 5400 block
of Locust Avenue in Kansas City, Kan., were a woman and her three
grown sons.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, Kan., police said they had no reason to suspect
that Wednesday's break-in was linked to a series of recent
incidents in which intruders have impersonated police officers or
sheriff's deputies. At least eight times since May, intruders
posing as police officers or sheriff's deputies have robbed and
intimidated people in Johnson and Wyandotte counties, most recently
on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's break-in, police said, two white males took the
woman with them when they broke through the garage door of the home
in her Isuzu Rodeo at about 3:30 a.m.. The Rodeo hurtled backward
through the garage door, stopped briefly on a small hill in front
of the house, then slipped between a car and the mailbox before
speeding east on Locust.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City police officers picked up the chase when the vehicle
entered Kansas City on Southwest Boulevard just after 4 a.m.,
department spokesman Steve Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The men fired at police during the chase. Police did not fire
back, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle weaved through downtown and north on Interstate 35.
It ended up on Vivion Road and eventually got stuck in the back
yard of a house in the 5200 block of Old Pike Road in Gladstone.
Tactical teams from Gladstone and Kansas City surrounded the car.
</P>
<P>
   Then the waiting and negotiating began.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, tactical officers outfitted in black with
masks, helmets and bulletproof vests, with guns slung over their
shoulders, worked the area as temperatures reached 102 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   At first, negotiators communicated with the abductors using a
bullhorn and yelling. According to police, the abductors had
spray-painted the windows black and placed sheets or blankets
across its windows.
</P>
<P>
   The abductors demanded water, cigarettes and alcohol, police
said. Between 11 and 11:30 a.m., police said, they received water
in exchange for a weapon. Police said there was at least one more
gun in the car. The abductors also received cigarettes, and between
5:35 and 5:45 p.m., police delivered more water and a direct-line
phone to the vehicle by a mechanical robot.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle's air conditioning was being turned on and off
throughout the stifling heat of the day. The FBI had a doctor on
the scene from about 10:30 a.m. to monitor police and the vehicle's
occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Officers from the Gladstone and Kansas City police departments
worked the scene, along with the FBI. Spokesman Jeff Lanza said the
FBI had jurisdiction because of potential federal kidnapping
charges involving taking a person across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who live on Old Pike Road and on adjacent streets had
front-row seats as the drama unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas Payne and his wife, Ora-D. Payne, were rousted out of bed
about 3:30 a.m. in their home at 301 N.W. 52nd Terrace. They were
waiting at the command post when police asked for a key to the
Paynes' house.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas Payne went to the house with police, and saw about 75
policemen in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the house was surrounded, and they were all behind my
trees,'' Payne said. ``I was over my shock by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne took the police to a second-story bathroom, which looked
out on the SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Police told him the bathroom would be a good spot for a sniper.
</P>
<P>
   Payne left with the police having taken over his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thoughts are with the lady in the car and what she's going
through,'' Payne said. ``It must be devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Corrigan, who said he wakes up at 4 a.m. every morning
to watch ``Cops'' and ``Real TV,'' opted for the real-life show
playing out in his front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hear the sirens blaring, and we saw the police
chasing him down Old Pike Road and into a driveway,'' Corrigan
said. ``Police told him to stop, but he turned around, and sparks
were flying everywhere because his tires were all flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan said his home looks down the street on the home where
the Rodeo finally stopped, stuck on the retaining wall of a garden.
</P>
<P>
   Several neighbors said they heard police yelling for the
abductors to leave the vehicle and get on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept saying to stop the vehicle because the engine kept
revving,'' resident Diane Hartley said. ``I was very concerned when
I saw the cops going at the car with their guns drawn. I have two
3-year-olds, and my only thought was to get them out of their
bedrooms and into the back of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hubbell said she and her family were asleep when her
doorbell rang at 4:45 a.m. at their house in the 5100 block of
North Washington Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was, `Who...is ringing my doorbell at this
hour, what is going on?' &UR; '' Hubbell said.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be an officer dressed in solid black, who told
Hubbell and her husband, Todd, that there was a hostage situation
and that the area was being evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   At that hour, there weren't too many places open for the
Hubbells, their 13-year-old son, her brother and a cousin, who all
had been in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Home Depot and sat down for a while, and we've been
at the command post ever since,'' Susan Hubbell said. ``I'm ready
to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   However, police told the Hubbells they would be wise to find a
place to stay Wednesday, indicating the situation was nowhere near
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Three schools in the North Kansas City School District also were
affected.
</P>
<P>
   District spokeswoman Jo Burton said police prohibited the
district's buses from picking up students who live in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Burns, who lives on Old Pike Road, said he hoped
everything would be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it makes me feel better to think that everything
ended, rather than started, here in my neighborhood,'' he said. (

 REVIEW: COMPAQ'S NET APPLIANCE NOT QUITE ALL IT COULD BE  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Internet appliances'' are in danger of
becoming the Godot of the high-tech world.
</P>
<P>
   For years the industry has been promising such products _
stripped-down devices designed to make getting online as easy as
making toast. Market researchers studying the potential for such
products have egged the manufacturers on by conjuring up visions of
unit sales in the millions and revenues of billions.
</P>
<P>
   As the pundits see it, the half or so of U.S. households that
have so far resisted the siren song of the personal computer _ plus
countless customers in the rest of the world _ would take the
plunge once offered something smaller, cheaper and less
intimidating than full-blown PCs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, there has been little reality to support the
hype. Microsoft's WebTV, a set-top box that puts the Net on the
tube, has sold slowly _ slightly more than a million units during
nearly four years on the market. The I-opener, a stand-alone
terminal introduced last fall by a Texas startup called Netpliance,
took off only when hackers figured out how to convert it into a
Linux computer, and now it's off the market while the company tries
to figure out how to price the product low enough to sell but high
enough to keep it afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, with a few even less significant exceptions, all the
announced appliances _ including a trio that Gateway is building
for America Online _ are still somewhere over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Except one: Compaq's iPAQ Home Internet Appliance 1A-1, which is
supposed to reach most major electronics chains this week. This
could be the product that finally brings the appliance concept into
the mainstream, but my testing during the last few weeks suggests a
little more tweaking is required before it really takes off.
</P>
<P>
   The product's list price is $599, but you're eligible for a $400
rebate if you sign up for three years of Internet access from MSN,
the Microsoft Network, at $21.95 per month. Because the appliance
is useless without MSN _ it's the first in a class of products
called MSN Companions, which are based on software Microsoft
developed specifically for use with its service _ you would be a
fool to buy one without taking advantage of the rebate.
</P>
<P>
   (An aside on terminology: neither ``iPAQ'' nor ``MSN Companion''
refers exclusively to this particular product. A number of hardware
companies are expected to offer MSN Companions of their own design
in the future, and Compaq now applies the iPAQ brand to a whole
line of products, ranging from pagers and MP3 players to desktop
PCs. For this review, though, iPAQ means the Compaq MSN Companion.)
</P>
<P>
   Hardware Basics
</P>
<P>
   The iPAQ hardware consists of two cables (one that you plug into
an AC outlet, the other into a phone jack), a keyboard and a main
unit that includes a 10.1-inch display (measured diagonally) and,
stretching out in a slightly bulbous base behind the screen, the
system's electronics.
</P>
<P>
   In back there's a jack for external speakers (not included) and
an Ethernet port, which currently isn't functional but will someday
allow the device to be connected to high-speed cable and DSL
modems. There are also four USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports, where
you can add a mouse and printer. (Neither is included, and for now
only one printer, the $99 Epson Stylus Color 740, works with the
iPAQ.)
</P>
<P>
   The compact keyboard communicates with the base unit wirelessly,
via infrared light, which works well as long as you keep the
keyboard pointed directly at the main unit and don't let anything
get in the way. The keyboard has a number of handy special keys
that take you directly to common Internet activities _ e-mail,
MSN's search page, the service's online shopping area, a special
Compaq support page, etc.
</P>
<P>
   At the front of the keyboard, below the space bar, is a floating
black button, the size of a quarter, that serves as the default
cursor-control device in the absence of a mouse. It works a little
like a miniature joystick: Press one edge of the button and the
onscreen pointer moves in the corresponding direction.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly there are people who will be comfortable with this
device, but my strong hunch is that they're few and far between; I
continued to find it a painfully slow and awkward way to work, even
after several weeks of daily use. Until Compaq replaces it, or at
least adds a mouse as standard equipment, I bet it's going to be a
real deterrent to the success of the product, especially among the
seniors, novices and computerphobes the company says are its target
market.
</P>
<P>
   The laptop-style screen could also be a problem for some of
these users. It's bright and crisp enough when you look at it
straight on, but it's based on a low-end display technology called
passive-matrix, which means you often see shadows and streaks on
the screen and the viewing angle is narrow _ if you look at it from
an angle, it's unreadably dark.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, the display has a fixed resolution of 800 by 600
pixels. It's easy to understand why Compaq chose that resolution _
it's the standard Web designers usually assume these days. But when
you pack that many pixels into a 10-inch screen, each pixel has to
be smaller, which in turn means everything on screen gets smaller,
and type in small point sizes can get difficult to read. Many
potential buyers would, I suspect, welcome an option to switch to a
resolution of 640 by 480 pixels, which would make text bigger and
much more legible.
</P>
<P>
   Making Toast
</P>
<P>
   The iPAQ tries to make Internet access easy in the same way
toasters make toasting easy: by not doing much else. All it's
capable of is Web browsing, e-mail and instant messaging. Since the
device has no hard drive, floppy drive or CD-ROM, there's no way
you can install or run additional software or even load browser
plug-ins. (There's room for cookies, though: they're stored in a
flash-memory buffer; if you collect so many that the buffer gets
full, the oldest cookie is automatically thrown away.)
</P>
<P>
   The developers did their best to make setting up the device and
connecting to the Internet as simple as possible. When you purchase
the iPAQ appliance, the dealer is supposed to enter your name and
address into a Microsoft database, so the system will know who you
are and have an e-mail account all set up for you the first time
you connect. All you have to do to get started _ in theory _ is
take the hardware out of the box, plug in the AC and phone cords,
hit the Connect button on the keyboard, and work through a few
simple setup screens.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it didn't work that way for me. The prototype
Microsoft sent me for evaluation arrived configured for the 415
area code, but during setup it gave me the opportunity to switch
the numbers, and since I live in the 510 area, I opted to do so,
picking a ``Berkley'' number (as Microsoft's list spells Berkeley,
Calif.) as my primary dial-in point and an Oakland, Calif., number
for backup.
</P>
<P>
   But when I then hit the Connect button, it proceeded to dial a
superfluous 510 in front of the seven-digit number, which of course
made it impossible to complete the local call. Eventually, after a
Microsoft support engineer had talked me through numerous attempts
to reconfigure the system, we got past that problem, and I managed
to get connected. But I continued to encounter a variety of
technical problems, including blank screens, half-drawn pages and
weird error messages.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, my friendly and helpful support engineer gave up and
sent me a second prototype. That one didn't work at all _ over and
over again, it dialed the right number, seemed to connect and then
disconnected. This time the engineer blamed unspecified ``server
problems,'' but they apparently turned out to be intractable; after
several days, he finally had me switch to a different dial-in
number.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, the iPAQ worked like a charm. I could connect every
time I tried. The Web looked and acted pretty much the way it does
from a PC or Mac, except that the device's browser has its
simplified toolbar and address field at the bottom instead of the
top of the screen. My MSN mail account, which uses Microsoft's
HotMail system, also worked reliably; you can even open and read
attached files, provided they were created in Microsoft Office or
saved in a few other common formats.
</P>
<P>
   But I did run up some important limitations with the browser. It
supports Flash, an animated graphics format that's common on the
Web, but not Shockwave, another common animation format. When I
went to the Shockwave Web site, the device froze. Likewise, it
handles audio and video in Microsoft's Windows Media format, but
not the Real Networks or Apple QuickTime formats. And you can't
read .pdf documents, the Adobe Acrobat format many sites use for
manuals and other documents where graphics and formatting are
important.
</P>
<P>
   I even had trouble with a Web site that runs entirely on
Microsoft software _ the Web site through which Chronicle employees
can check their e-mail from off-site. I could log in and see my
in-box, and even read messages, but when I tried to reply, all I
got was a blank screen. Microsoft said it's investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's one very important issue that's inherent in the
hardware: The iPAQ doesn't give you any way to store documents. Old
mail is saved, for a while, on the HotMail server, but that's
accessible only when you're online. As for keeping information from
the Web, the best you can do is choose an option that's supposed to
let you mail a Web page and send it to yourself, but all it really
does is mail the URL, not the page's content.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bottom Line
</P>
<P>
   At its list price the iPAQ isn't a whole lot cheaper than a
full-fledged computer _ you can now get an Apple iMac for only
$799, or a low-end PC and monitor for less, maybe even less than
$599. If you're willing to sign up for three years of MSN, you can
get the same $400 rebate offered to iPAQ buyers.
</P>
<P>
   If you go that route, you'll get a much more versatile machine,
with floppy and hard drives for your data, plenty of room for
additional software when and if you want it, and ports where you
can add a wide variety of peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that would bring you up against the complexity that
Internet appliances are designed to avoid. But you don't have to
take advantage of all the flexibility a PC or Mac provides _ if you
wish, you could use it only for the same things an appliance does:
the Web, e-mail and instant messaging.
</P>
<P>
   If you're disciplined enough to stick to just those
applications, and you resist adding plug-ins, screensavers,
shareware utilities, additional programs or new hardware, odds are
your system will be just as easy to use as the current iPAQ _ maybe
even easier, because you'll have a better mouse, a bigger, more
adjustable screen, and plenty of room to store important
information where you can easily get at it. And you'll have the
option of changing Internet service providers or getting high-speed
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Even assuming most users won't encounter the numerous setup
glitches I did, I just don't see a compelling advantage to the iPAQ
in its current form, even for the customers Compaq and Microsoft
are targeting. They'd be better off pitching it as a second (or
third) terminal to households that are already Net-savvy and simply
want a way for more family members to get online simultaneously.
But MSN's policies make that unlikely: Even if you're willing to
use MSN as the Internet provider for your PC or Mac, you have to
open a separate account, and pay an extra $21.95 per month, for the
iPAQ.
</P>
<P>
   I still believe Internet appliances have lots of potential, but
they're not there yet.

 WINEMAKER SEBASTIANI SELLING MOST OF ITS BRANDS  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sebastiani Vineyards of Sonoma, Calif.,
announced the sale Wednesday of the bulk of its business _ six
popular midprice wine labels and production facilities in San
Joaquin County, Calif. _ in a move to focus on high-price premium
brands bearing the Sebastiani name.
</P>
<P>
   The Wine Group, a San Francisco vendor best known for its
bag-in-the-box Franzia wine, was the buyer. No purchase price was
announced, but industry sources estimate that the Wine Group paid
more than $300 million for the brands and facilities that account
for about 7.8 million cases of Sebastiani's 8 million cases it
produces annually.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastiani sold its Turner Road Vintners division, which
includes Vendange, Talus, Farallon, Heritage, La Terre and
Nathanson Creek brands. It also sold two wineries and a
distribution center near Woodbridge, Calif., and its Humphrey &AMP;
Brown International wine marketing group.

   The winery deal is the third this week as a wave of
consolidations resculpts the wine country landscape.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Australia's Foster's Brewing Group agreed to buy
Beringer for $1.5 billion and Canada's Vincor agreed to buy R.H.
Phillips for $92 million.
</P>
<P>
   Vendange and Talus have been among California's fastest-growing
wine brands during the past decade. But Sebastiani Chairman Don
Sebastiani said the continuing wine industry consolidation made it
necessary for his privately owned winery to concentrate on just one
of its two businesses _ either the low-volume, high-price
ultra-premium niche or the high-volume, lower-margin $7 and $8
wines that require substantial ``marketing muscle'' to stay
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastiani, which has been making wine in Sonoma since 1904,
chose to sell its high-volume operations, which employ about
two-thirds of its 380 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Wine Group was a logical buyer. Once part of the Coca-Cola
Co., the Wine Group began as a limited partnership in 1981 to buy
Franzia Bros., Mogen David and Tribuno brands. It also produces the
popular Corbett Canyon line of midprice varietal wines.

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: EXPECT TO PAY $1,500 FOR A DECENT LAPTOP COMPUTER  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: What should be my top priorities when shopping for a notebook
computer? And what will I have to pay for a decent one?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Notebook PCs (also called laptops) can be had for less than
$1,000, but to get one that provides a satisfying computing
experience, you're probably looking at $1,500 minimum. The two
things that make the biggest difference between a good notebook and
a mediocre one are the technology used in the display, and the
weight of the computer. Notebooks costing less than $1,500
generally have dual-scan displays, while more expensive machines
have TFT active displays. The active display is clear and bright
regardless of the viewing angle. With a dual-scan display, you have
to look directly at the screen or else it fades.
</P>
<P>
   Weight is really important if you intend to haul your notebook
around _ and again, the more expensive the machine, the lighter
it's going to be. The trouble is that really light notebooks _ less
than 5 pounds _ usually cost more than $2,000. For $1,500, you'll
probably have to settle for 7 pounds including the battery (which
is the heaviest component).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Floppiless Tranfers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: After purchasing a new PC, I'm trying to find a way to transfer
data files from my old computer to the new one without having to
use floppy disks. That would take a long time, plus, some of my
files are too large to put on a floppy. Someone mentioned a cable
that you can hook up to both machines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Someone is absolutely right. The Direct Cable Connection feature
in Windows 98 lets you link two PCs together using either a
parallel cable, which attaches to the printer ports of both PCs, or
a serial cable that connects to the serial ports. Direct Cable
Connection should be located in the Start/Programs/Accessories
/Communications menu. (If it's not there, you can install it using
Windows Setup in the Add/Remove Programs option of the Windows
Control Panel.)
</P>
<P>
   When you start Direct Cable Connection, you'll see a Wizard that
will walk you through the process of getting your old and new PCs
to talk to each other and setting them up to share files. Keep in
mind, however, that while you can easily copy data files like Word
documents from one PC to the other, copying an actual program is a
tricky business and probably won't work. For that, you need to
install the program on the new PC.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Great 3-D Sans AGP
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I need to upgrade my computer with a 3-D video accelerator card,
but my motherboard doesn't have an AGP slot. I've been told that
all the hottest new cards are made for AGP. Am I out of luck, and
what are my options?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: AGP (accelerated graphics port) provides the fastest possible
graphics, but don't despair. If you have an open PCI slot
(peripheral component interconnect), you can still get great
explosions and other special effects. Just make sure to get a PCI
version of whatever card you decide on (my son just got a PCI
Voodoo 3 3000, and the 3-D is terrific).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Home Networking
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'd like to set up a home network so that our daughter's PC can
share the high-speed DSL line that's connected to my computer. Is
this something I can do myself, or is it hopelessly technical?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Actually it's a piece of cake. Companies like Intel, S3
(Diamond) and 3Com offer easy-to-install network cards (and in some
cases even easier-to-install USB devices) that let you connect two
or more PCs via the telephone jacks in your house. They also
provide the software, although you won't even need it if you have
Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows NT 4 or Windows 2000 _ which
come with something called Internet Connection Sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Once your network is up and running, the PCs will be able to
share files, printers, and, of course, the Internet. And the best
part is that both you and your daughter can be online at the same
time, with no measurable loss of speed for either of you. Pretty
cool stuff.

 FOUNDERS DREAM OF HIGH DEMAND ON MARIJUANA NET SITE  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Call it a cross between Webvan and a cannabis
buyers club.
</P>
<P>
   Two budding entrepreneurs behind a firm descriptively named
IToke say they will launch a Web-based marijuana delivery service
in Amsterdam on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The e-commerce company promises to deliver orders within 30
minutes, using fast, friendly ``iTokkerista'' couriers astride a
fleet of green and white bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   The IToke Web site describes a service allowing customers to
place their orders by phone, fax or WAP-enabled wireless phones.
They pay for the pot with prepaid ``iToken'' smart cards that can
be refilled with cash online.
</P>
<P>
   Founders Tim Freccia and Mike Tucker, two Seattle natives, also
say they have plans to open a chain of ``toke style'' clubs in
London, New York and Tokyo that will ``celebrate a pastime that is
as American as Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business isn't different than any other business and had
its share of obstacles to overcome,'' Tucker said in a news
release. ``At the end of the day, who do you want to buy from? Some
guy in an alley in Barcelona, or from a company that not only
delivers premium products, but also shows an interest in the
community and its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``IToke is a vertical corporation,'' Freccia said. ``Think
Seattle. Think Starbucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Freccia and Tucker could not be reached for comment Wednesday to
determine whether the site is serious or just blowing smoke. The
online portal Yahoo listed the site,  &LR; www.itoke.co.uk, &LR;  under
``humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen St. Pierre of the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws said IToke could run a legitimate business in
Amsterdam, where the laws and social mores regarding marijuana use
are less strict than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like all they need are the growers and the bike
riders,'' said St. Pierre, executive director of the NORML
Foundation, the nonprofit education and research arm of the
Washington, D.C., lobbying group that is trying to make marijuana
legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this service was available in an unfettered way in the
District of Columbia, they'd be zillionaires,'' St. Pierre said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, though, Freccia and Tucker would be
considered major drug dealers and thrown in jail, St. Pierre said.
Pro- and anti-marijuana forces are battling over the question of
whether pot should be distributed for medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an emergency order
barring the Oakland (Calif.) Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative from
distributing marijuana to seriously ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Netherlands, marijuana can be sold legally in small
amounts from licensed coffee shops, although it remains to be seen
whether a fleet of ganja couriers runs afoul of those laws, St.
Pierre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people who use marijuana (medicinally) are so physically
incapacitated that if they could call someone to have it delivered
to them, this would be a godsend,'' St. Pierre said.

 FORD FACES RECALL OVER FAULTY IGNITION DEVICE  &HT;     By HENRY K. LEE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
OAKLAND, Calif. _ Lambasting Ford Motor Co. for deceiving
consumers, an Alameda County judge is poised to order an
unprecedented recall of up to 2 million Ford cars because of an
ignition device that allegedly causes stalling.
<P>
   The preliminary decision Tuesday by Superior Court Judge Michael
Ballachey was hailed Wednesday by attorneys who filed a
class-action lawsuit on behalf of 3 million current and former
owners of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars of model years 1983 to
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't be better,'' said Jeff Fazio, an attorney for the
plaintiffs. ``This recall would be the first by a judge in United
States history _ it's a complete vindication of five years of very
hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed decision deals another blow to the Dearborn, Mich.,
automaker, which is embroiled in the recall of 6.5 million
Firestone tires used on its Explorer sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Krusel, a Ford spokeswoman, denied the allegations, saying
no plaintiffs in the suit have been injured or killed because the
ignition module was mounted on the distributor, which heats up
quickly, rather than on a cooler part of the engine.
</P>
<P>
   Krusel said Ford plans to ask the judge to reverse his decision
at a hearing on Sept. 28. If Ballachey finalizes his decision, the
automaker intends to appeal, she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Alameda County trial, Ballachey said Ford officials
and witnesses provided evasive answers and used euphemisms in
attempting to explain why cars suddenly stalled, when in fact they
knew about problems associated with a part known as the ``thick
film ignition'' module.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford's strategy, clearly established by the credible evidence,
was: `If you don't ask the right question, we don't have to answer
with what common sense tells us you want to know,' '' Ballachey
wrote in his 10-page tentative decision.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the proposed recall, the judge said he plans to order
Ford to pay full restitution to plaintiffs who paid to have their
modules replaced.
</P>
<P>
   But Krusel said the judge's ruling ``absolutely conflicts with
all of the real-world data and engineering analysis that was
presented in the case. The modules we're talking about lasted over
100,000 miles and performed as well as any alternative design
available at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling stems from a two-part trial before Ballachey, who was
called out of retirement to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   The trial drew national attention not only because the
plaintiffs sought $3 billion in damages, but also because they
accused Ford of violating a state consumer law _ rather than a
product-liability statute _ by allegedly misleading the public, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and environmental
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase ended in a mistrial in November, when jurors
reported that they were deadlocked on whether Ford concealed
alleged problems with the module.
</P>
<P>
   In his written tentative ruling, Ballachey accused Ford
officials of selectively releasing information it was required to
release to the national highway safety agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford presented a blizzard of unpersuasive statistical evidence
in an attempt to disprove the obvious: That TFI modules failed in
enormous numbers from the outset, that they continued to fail in
unacceptable numbers for many years before being replaced by
successor technology, and that they presented a serious safety risk
to its consumers,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballachey also attacked the auto manufacturer's use of phrases
such as ``stop, won't start,'' ``quits on road'' as euphemisms that
were ``immersed in rhetoric claiming a multiplicity of causes for
stalling.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nelson, a plaintiffs' attorney, said, ``They played word
games.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs said at trial that the module often failed at 257
degrees Fahrenheit &LR; , resulting in stalled engines. Ford decided to
save $4 per vehicle by mounting the device on the distributor
instead of on a cooler place on the engine, attorneys for the
plaintiffs said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said it did not have an estimate for the cost of any
recall.
</P>
<P>
   Krusel also sought to dispel concerns about public confidence in
Ford because of the tire recall and the recent trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always doing everything we can to assure the public that
Ford Motor Co. is doing the right thing,'' Krusel said. ``There
should be no decline in trust. We are committed to ensuring safe
products for our customers.''

TREASURER'S ``IN GOD WE TRUST'' POSTING DRAWS ACLU SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN PETTERSON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   TOPEKA, Kan. _ The framed motto ``In God
We Trust'' that greets taxpayers in the public offices of Shawnee
County Treasurer Rita Cline drew a constitutional challenge
Wednesday from the American Civil Liberties Union.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I've never run across a public official that has been so
blatant in their use of their official capacity to promote their
personal religious beliefs,'' said Dick Kurtenbach, executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and
Western Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtenbach's organization filed a lawsuit against Cline in U.S.
District Court in Topeka, and he personally served notice on the
treasurer in her office in the Shawnee County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   He paid little attention to the ``In God We Trust'' poster that
hangs just inside the office's waiting area.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU asked the federal court to prohibit Cline, the county
treasurer for the last 12 years, from hanging the posters in her
offices, from making disparaging statements about the religious
beliefs of one of the plaintiffs and from using county funds to
promote her religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lawsuit, Cline said at this point she has no
intention of removing the poster and an identical one in her
satellite office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a law-abiding citizen,'' she said. ``I'm pleased they
asked for a jury trial. The polls are in my favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Cline will be represented at no charge by Joel L. Oster of
Olathe, regional counsel for Liberty Counsel of Orlando, Fla. Oster
described Liberty Counsel as a ``religious liberties law firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Oster said Cline had done nothing wrong and said, ``It's a good
time to educate people on the true nature of the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The motto has appeared on U.S. currency since 1864. In 1956,
Congress adopted ``In God We Trust'' as the nation's motto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious freedom of every one of us, including Ms. Cline,
is tied to the enforcement of the wall of separation between church
and state,'' Kurtenbach said. ``When that wall is high and strong,
religious freedom is secure in this country. Ms. Cline would
dismantle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtenbach said a federal court ruled in the late 1950s that the
motto did not violate the constitutional prohibition against
establishment of a national religion because its use on currency
was so widespread that it had no significant religious meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to us to prove her motivation was religious in
nature,'' Kurtenbach said. ``I think in Rita Cline's mind, if I
could get in there a second, it's not `In God We Trust,' it's `In
My God We Trust.'''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also said Cline had used county supplies to mail
copies of a religious tract titled Why Should Anyone Believe the
Bible?
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Mary Lou Schmidt and Darlene
Stearns, both of Topeka. Stearns is a member of the board of
directors of the ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt had complained to Cline about the motto. She later told
the treasurer she was offended by the religious message of the
posters and asked that they be removed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Cline used her office letterhead to
write Schmidt an ``evangelical letter'' that ``questioned her
religious integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Stearns, the lawsuit said, ``objects to the campaign of
evangelism, proselytization and distribution of religious
propaganda being conducted by defendant Cline in her capacity as
Shawnee County treasurer and the expenditure of any Shawnee County
funds for any of these religious activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by the ACLU's legal director, Lisa
Nathanson.
</P>
<P>
   Another controversy over displaying the nation's motto surfaced
this summer in Colorado when the Colorado State Board of Education
voted 5-1 to urge schools to post the motto in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on whether to post the motto was left up to local
school boards. ( 30 )

 &UR; HATCH'S MEMOIR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' champ  &UR; Richard Hatch &LR;  is about to close a $500,000
deal with St. Martin's Press to write his memoir, reports
Inside.com. The book is not only a memoir of the 39-year-old
corporate trainer's life but also a summary of his professional
advice, for those who might want to emulate him.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's 76-page proposal was with his agent,  &UR; Eric Simonoff &LR;  at
Janklow &AMP; Nesbit, before he was announced as winner of the show.
St. Martin's prevailed over Simon &AMP; Schuster and Pocket Books, both
of which are owned by Viacom, the parent company of the show's
broadcast network, CBS.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-WORKERS (Tianjin, China) _ The Meite Packaging factory
here is nearly deserted now, its managers and machines all hastily
transferred over the last two days to an isolated development zone.
Although the closure had long been planned, the precipitous
departure was necessitated by an extraordinary event: Last week,
desperate Chinese workers fearing layoffs kept six foreign managers
from Meite's U.S. parent company hostage in the factory for 40
hours. The workers' frustrations that sparked this unusual incident
are extremely commonplace, leading to hundreds of worker protests
in the last 3 years. By Elisabeth Rosenthal. 1,500 words.

<P>
   SOMALIA-POLITICS (Mogadishu, Somalia) _ Somalia finally has a
government, and its first president in nearly a decade arrived here
escorted by at least 120 pickup trucks carrying more than 1,000
militiamen armed with rifles, rocket launchers, even
double-barreled antiaircraft guns. And just to be on the safe side,
the president wore a bullet-proof vest. By Ian Fisher. (The story
has moved in ``i'' news file.) 1,300 words.

<P>
   SCI-ROBOTS-REPRODUCE (Undated) _ For the first time, computer
scientists have created a robot that designs and builds other
robots, almost entirely without human help or expertise. In the
short run, this advance could lead to a new industry of inexpensive
robots customized for specific tasks. In the long run _ decades at
least _ robots may one day be truly regarded as ``artificial life''
_ able to reproduce and evolve, building improved versions of
themselves. By Kenneth Chang.

<P>
   &UR; CAMPAIGN _ (Moved in ``p'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-VEEPS (Undated) _ Joseph Lieberman and Dick Cheney are
waging starkly different campaigns as they strike out on their own
for the first time since each party's national convention. Cheney
has largely kept a low profile, staging small events, sticking to a
safe speech script, generally staying clear of reporters from
national news organizations. Lieberman has been a more active
campaigner, drawing far larger crowds and attracting _ indeed
courting _ more media coverage. By David Barstow. 1,700 words.

<P>
   NY-PRIMARY (New York) _ It is a primary race that has spawned a
soap opera-like drama. The bitterness of a feud between two
Democrats in the 11th Congressional District in Brooklyn has not
only torn apart a longstanding relationship but has delivered some
of that anguish to the doorstep of other politicians and voters in
the borough. But it is also a race that has brought to the surface
simmering _ and often unspoken _ unease between black New Yorkers
whose roots are in the United States and those with Caribbean
heritage. By Jonathan P. Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CNN-FUTURE (Undated) _ In 1997, CNN's executives were looking
for something to make it the news outlet of record all of the time.
So they hired Richard N. Kaplan, an ABC News producer, in the hope
that as the president of their U.S. operation, he would bring to
CNN what the broadcast networks already had: highly produced news
programming so compelling that millions of people would tune in
regularly whether there is big news or not. The dual announcements
Wednesday that Kaplan was resigning and that CNN's entire executive
structure was being revamped, were accompanied by admissions that
the strategy did not work. By Jim Rutenberg.

   FORD (Washington) _ Federal regulators trying to determine how

the company provide detailed information of any tire problems in 16
countries outside the United States. By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   BANKS-TAKEOVERS (New York) _ Now that the acquisition of
Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette promises to put Credit Suisse First
Boston in the ``bulge bracket'' of Wall Street firms, how do
also-rans like Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Chase Manhattan
respond? Do Lehman Brothers, Prudential Securities and even Bear
Stearns now become more attractive takeover targets? By Patrick
McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIACAMP-AD-COLUMN (New York) _ The concept of summer camp
normally conjures up images of kayaks and campfires. But at a new
two-week day camp, children instead find story boards, video
cameras and even the ingredients food stylists use to prepare prop
ice cream cones. The camp, called Club Media, is designed to teach
children how to be more aware of the persuasion techniques used in
marketing. By Allison Fass.
</P>
<P>
   INCOME-ECONSCENE (Undated) _ Make no mistake about how good the
last five years have been to Americans. But what is too often
ignored is that this remarkable economic performance has not yet
compensated for the persistent erosion of the income of male
workers since the early 1970s. And this goes a long way toward
explaining why Al Gore's message at the Democratic convention to
help working families seems to have caught on. By Jeff Madrick.
</P>
<P>
   KIDNAP-TAX (Undated) _ A legal memo from the Internal Revenue
Service says that if a child is kidnapped, taxpayers who claimed
that child as a deduction can take a deduction only for the year of
the kidnapping and not for subsequent years even if they maintain a
room for the child or otherwise spend money on the child. This is
apparently because the law makes the kidnappers eligible to deduct
the cost of caring for the child. By David Cay Johnston.

   GOOD-JUNK (Undated) _ The pin on Mimi Mannix's hat said it all.
``Junk 'til you drop'' it read, which is why Ms. Mannix was outside
the Strudel Haus in Covington, Ky., on a Thursday afternoon
painting a giant pig. Like a multitude of less colorful people, Ms.
Mannix, an Indiana collectibles dealer had come to this musty
little town across the Ohio River from Cincinnati to shop. ``I'm
selling, I'm buying, I'm doing my pig,'' Ms. Mannix said, dipping
into a vat of pink enamel. ``I'm having fun.'' Here at the
northernmost tip of an annual event known as the 450-Mile Route 127
Corridor Sale, it was no wonder why. A banner spanning Main Street
hailed, ``Welcome to the start of the world's largest yard sale.''
On the reverse it said, ``Welcome to the end of the world's largest
yard sale.'' Covington was the final destination if you started
your journey at the other end, 450 miles away in Gadsden, Ala. Like
everything about this multistate flea market, it was all in how you
looked at it. By Frank DeCaro.

love with composting. Bird walkers. (``Baby! Baby! Baby!'' a
Chinese woman cried one morning. Her bird had flown off its
string.) And then there's tai chi, the ancient Chinese exercise
that evolved from the martial arts centuries ago, practiced here
from 7 to 9 every morning, 365 days a year. By Anne Raver.

synonymous with comedy, with the shtick and shpritz of Sid Caesar,
Jerry Lewis and Mel Brooks. But the glorious mountains here and the
flavorful summertime crowds they drew have also proved to be a
fertile ground for more thoughtful dramas, fiction and films about
love, betrayal, even struggles with faith. This Jewish world of the
Catskills seems to be accumulating something of a genre worthy of
serious literary and cinematic study. By Joseph Berger.

WORKERS IN PARADISE FEEL PINCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   You know the local job market is
painfully tight when you get a heartfelt yelp for help from
paradise.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Paradise'' may be stretching it, but all those ``best places
to work'' lists over the years have lionized Southwest Airlines for
its employee benefits, work atmosphere and job satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of companies and business professors have visited its
Dallas headquarters to divine its hiring, retention and customer
satisfaction secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Now at Kansas City International Airport (MCI in airline code),
the workplace blossom has wilted along with the energy and morale
of Southwest ground crews.
</P>
<P>
   Read excerpts from a letter that short-staffed, overtime-weary
MCI customer service and ramp agents wrote to headquarters this
summer:
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, we are extremely exhausted by our jobs. The
amount of hours that we are putting in individually is unrealistic
and inhumane. ... Customers are suffering through long lines, and
being given a level of customer service that is far below our
standards...
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love our jobs; otherwise we wouldn't be here. Many
outsiders would view our situation and say we should find another
job, but that is the last thing in the world we want to do. This
Company holds a very special place in all of our hearts. We are
just at the end of our rope.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Barrett, Southwest executive vice president, answered
the plea with a seven-page, single-spaced letter and ``game plan''
on staffing strategies for MCI and two other staff-stressed
stations (Baltimore and San Jose, Calif.).
</P>
<P>
   First, she commiserated with workers' pain. But, she wrote,
``Unfortunately, there are no `miracle cures' to the cumulative
effect of three years of virtually no unemployment in the MCI
area.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall economy, competitive salary offers from high-tech
companies and the location of the airport make it difficult to
attract employees to MCI, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest is trying to add 20 percent more ground workers at MCI
by holding job fairs, advertising in movie theaters, operating a
toll-free hot line for job applicants, operating a 1-800-SWA-JOBS
(1-800-792-5627) hot line, using the Monster.com resume database,
giving $500 referral bonuses to employees who suggest new hires,
recruiting at colleges and high schools, and paying some moving
expenses that the airline otherwise wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it has scheduled more job fairs and interviews between now
and November, hired a commercial staffing company to help find job
candidates, arranged for ``loaners'' from other airports,
temporarily relaxed its high school diploma requirement, and
streamlined interview and hiring processes for the short-staffed
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Other remedies are in mind, Barrett said, ``all the while
realizing that some of them will fail and that some will be more
effective//successful than others. The bottom-line objective is to
have each Station across our system fully staffed ASAP and to have
our short-staffed Stations (with MCI as our first priority) fully
staffed.''
</P>
<P>
   The tight job market has put Southwest's famed reputation at
stake _ and its staff, top officers and customers know it. ( 30 )

FIRE IN NEW JERSEY RAZES APARTMENT COMPLEX NEAR HUDSON
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDY NEWMAN and ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A spectacular and suspicious fire Wednesday night consumed a
sprawling apartment complex under construction near the Hudson
River in Edgewater, N.J., destroyed an occupied apartment building
and eight homes across the street, and sent columns of flame 200
feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   There were no serious injuries, but dozens of people lost their
homes, said the Edgewater Fire Chief, Sam DeNorchia Several
firefighters were treated for heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight, fire officials said they had contained
the blaze but could not put it out, partly because it was being fed
by a ruptured gas line in the apartment complex. Public Service
Electric and Gas was unable to get to the valves to shut off the
line, said the Edgewater fire chief, Sam DeNorchia. Another gas
line, on Undercliff Avenue, where the occupied dwellings burned,
also ruptured, the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   From the Palisades, the cliffs that overlook Edgewater, the
scene of the blaze, resembled a lake of fire. Homeowners on top of
the Palisades in the town of Cliffside Park doused their lawns to
keep the fire from spreading to them, and firefighters stood near
the cliff's edge and shot water 150 feet down onto the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the top of the cliff, the heat was so intense that
firefighters had to hose down the firefighters working closest to
the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began around 8:15 p.m. at Avalon River Mews, a 400-unit
complex consisting of an H-shaped, seven-story structure and seven
other buildings under construction on the inland side of River
Road. Within minutes, it was as if a curtain of flame had been
drawn across the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   On Undercliff Avenue, just west of the complex, residents
described a huge fireball shooting up the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's windows went red,'' said Debbie Bonhan, a
resident. ``The whole sky was illuminated, the power went out.
People were running around because they didn't know where the fire
was.'' Hundreds of homes surrounding the fire lost power.
</P>
<P>
   DeNorchia said that the first of the more than 150 firefighters
who eventually arrived on the scene did not know where to begin.
``When you pulled up, it was, `I got a fire here, I got a fire here
and I've got another fire here,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials were especially concerned because Avalon River
Mews, built on the site of an old Alcoa aluminum plant, is only
about a hundred yards from a tank farm _ a field of giant tanks
filled with gasoline. Only an empty warehouse stands between the
condominium complex and the tanks. Officials said they were taking
steps to protect the tank farm from the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began in the southeast corner of the H-shaped structure
and spread at a furious speed. One witness, Jeff Louisot, 24, said
that in no more than 10 minutes the entire structure was aflame.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the blaze was not immediately determined, but
DeNorchia said, ``Anything that burns that quickly has got to be
suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fire consumed Avalon River Mews, it jumped across
Undercliff Avenue, which runs parallel to River Road west of the
complex, and began chewing its way through the houses and a 25-unit
apartment building there.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:15 p.m., Edgewater's mayor, Bryan Christiansen, stood on
Undercliff Avenue watching firefighters from more than 20 towns
struggle to save more houses.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a three-story house nearby collapsed. ``There goes
that one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many cars along Undercliff Avenue exploded from the heat of the
fire, Chief DeNorchia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The radiant heat it generated was tremendous,'' he said. ``It
was the worst fire I've encountered outside a building in 20
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Across River Road, Edgewater's main thoroughfare, a shopping
center parking lot filled with people who came to watch the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds of smoke and ash filled the air, lighted from beneath by
the orange flame. Periodically, chunks of Avalon River Mews broke
off or collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was also watched by thousands of Manhattan residents _
Avalon River Mews is across the Hudson River from about 125th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Bourdain, who watched from the windows of his apartment
on Riverside Drive, said, ``It looks like an oil field fire, with
periodic explosions of pressurized flame that extend higher than
the Palisades.''
</P>
<P>
   Avalon River Mews is part of the transformation of the Hudson
riverfront from factories and rail yards into some of the most
desirable residential real estate in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning construction, the developer and Alcoa had to
spend millions to clean up PCBs and other contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the 408-unit complex began last September, said
Gary Steinfield, the vice president for development of the
complex's owner, Avalon Bay Communities, which is based in Iselin
N.J. The first apartment were going to be occupied in December, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As he watched the $70 million project go up in flames,
Steinfield tried to be philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' he said, the most important thing is
life and safety.''

INDONESIA WAITS TO SEE IF SUHARTO WILL ATTEND HIS OWN TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS 3rd graf, adds 4th graf with proceedings adjourned By MARK
LANDLER  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The corruption trial of Indonesia's fallen
leader, Suharto, got under way on Thursday morning in the converted
auditorium of a government ministry that was crowded with
spectators and ringed by police, but missing one man: the accused.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before Suharto was scheduled to appear before the court
to answer charges that he siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars
for his own use through charitable organizations under his control,
lawyers for the 79-year-old former president said he was too ill to
attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's chief lawyer, Juan-Felix Tampubolon, told the judge
that his client had been examined by a team of 23 doctors at his
residence in central Jakarta early this morning. The doctors
concluded that Suharto was ``very ill'' and could not attend the
hearing, Tampubolon said. The an- nouncement drew a chorus of boos
inside and outside the courtroom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Lalu Mariyun, adjoured the proceeding and ordered
Su-H harto's doctors to attend another hearing in two weeks to
explain their findings. He also said he would con- sider the
prosecution's request for an independent panel of doctors to re-
examine Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Guessing whether Suharto would show up had become a sort of
parlor game here in recent days, as demonstrators have marched,
prosecutors have made tough statements and newspapers have mused
about his state of mind. Few people were surprised that he pleaded
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the tumultuous changes that followed Suharto's ouster
in May 1998, people here are skeptical that their stunted legal
system can take on a strongman who ruled this country for 32 years,
amassing a vast fortune made Indonesia synonymous with corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in Jakarta turned tense in the hours before Suharto was
scheduled to appear. Late Wednesday, a small bomb exploded in an
empty bus parked near the building where the trial is set to take
place. There were no injuries, but the bus was destroyed.
Authorities had moved the trial from the South Jakarta District
Court to the Department of Agriculture for security reasons, and to
accommodate a large crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes go beyond Suharto's future. Legal experts and
political analysts said that unless the government successfully
prosecutes the former president, Indonesia will never cleanse
itself of a legacy of corruption that ranges from financial
scandals to military massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make an example of Suharto,'' said Umar Juoro, a
former adviser to Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie. ``Bring him
into the court, charge him, convict him, and then pardon him if
necessary. But we must demonstrate that everybody is the same
before the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Suharto was dealt its first setback under
former President Habibie, when his government dropped its
investigation of him last October, saying it could not turn up
enough evidence. That decision drew howls of protest from people,
and it contributed to Habibie's ignominious withdrawal from the
presidential election held later that month.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's successor, President Abdurrahman Wahid, swiftly
reopened the case. And his prosecutors have steadily tightened the
noose around Suharto _ placing him under city arrest in April,
house arrest in May, and formally charging him with corruption this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has promised to pardon Suharto _ but only after he is
judged. The president has also suggested that Suharto could strike
a deal by returning money stolen from the state. One of Wahid's
senior advisers, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, began negotiations with
members of the Suharto family. But he said on Thursday that those
talks had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto and his family are accused of building a
multibillion-dollar fortune by siphoning state money and steering
contracts to family-owned firms. But Gen. Marsuki Darusman,
Indonesia's attorney general, has focused on a narrower set of
allegations involving seven tax-free foundations under Suharto's
control.
</P>
<P>
   He is accused of funneling at least $150 million through the
foundations into personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's trial is so important because it comes at a time when
the struggle for Indonesia's future has shifted from the streets
into the courtroom. His case is one of nearly a dozen
investigations and prosecutions of people who were officials,
cronies, or tycoons in the Suharto era.

BANDAGES AND BRACES AND A CURE FROM CONE
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The New York Yankees lead the American League East in
victories and perhaps all of baseball in medical implements. David
Justice's uniform is stretched by the extra wrapping he wears to
protect a strained groin muscle. A brace houses the right knee of
Glenallen Hill. Tino Martinez played Wednesday night's game with
his left foot enveloped by gauze.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of their lineup are slowed by nagging injuries and
others are just slow, but in their deliberate way, the Yankees
dumped the Seattle Mariners Wednesday night, 5-4, to finish their
six-game road trip with four victories. David Cone improved his
record to 4-11; Dwight Gooden relieved and pitched out of a pivotal
seventh-inning jam.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch's sore elbow is preventing him from playing now
and may prevent him from playing second base the rest of the
season, depriving the Yankees of one of their few speedy everyday
players. Derek Jeter, who will replace Knoblauch as the leadoff
hitter on most days, is fast, and once Bernie Williams gets a
couple of strides, he moves well; Paul O'Neill is capable of taking
an extra base, when healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill played Wednesday night's game with a hip pointer,
his right side flushed crimson because of a cortisone shot.
Justice's injury has bothered him since he joined the Yankees, and
when he is hurting, he strides with his feet splayed uncomfortably.
Hill and Jose Canseco are cautious rounding bases, gaining speed
when moving in a straight line. Martinez's injury is not considered
serious, but he is not speedy when fully healthy; nor is Jorge
Posada or Luis Sojo or Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are a slow team, and that won't change before the
postseason, the tradeoff for fielding a lineup stocked with big
bangers. But the Yankees are compensating for that by reverting to
the patient style they thrived with in 1998 and 1999, drawing walks
and flooding the base paths with runners and creating a steady
stream of runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led Seattle and Aaron Sele, 1-0, in the fourth
inning, having stranded runners in scoring position in the second
and third innings. Williams singled through the middle leading off
the fourth, and Justice walked on five pitches. Before the Yankees
traded for Justice on June 29, they had collected 245 walks in 74
games, an average of 3.3 walks a game. Since then, they have 273
walks in 55 games, an average of five a game. Martinez chopped a
grounder toward first, where Raul Ibanez was playing in place of
John Olerud, who was with his wife as she gave birth to their
second child. The ball took a kangaroo hop over Ibanez's glove,
Martinez had a double and each runner advanced two bases, Williams
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Sele hit Hill in the hand with a fastball, loading the bases.
The right-handed-hitting Sojo, falling toward third base as he
reached for an outside pitch, slapped it to the right side _ just
inside first base, the ball rolling toward the corner. Justice and
Martinez scored, Hill steadily made his way toward third and Sojo
had a double. Yankees 4, Seattle 0.
</P>
<P>
   The lead must have pleased Cone, although he would probably have
preferred the Yankees' at-bats to move a little more quickly, to
help him keep loose. Cone likes to pitch in hot weather, and
Wednesday night, Seattle was cool and clear and he wore long
sleeves, stretching his arm after warm-up pitches and his first
offerings of each inning. His first fastballs in each inning
invariably reached about 87 mph, and as his arm loosened, he threw
harder, some fastballs clocking in at 91 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Cone lasted just three innings in his previous start, against
Oakland last Friday, and came away second-guessing much of what he
did. Kevin Appier, the pitcher who faced Cone that day, digs huge
holes in the mound when he pitches, and Cone had trouble landing
properly. Rather than summon a member of the grounds crew to fill
the holes _ or fill them in himself _ Cone simply shifted to the
opposite side of the rubber for the third inning, and he was
knocked out after allowing five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Cone also lamented that he didn't use his fastball more
aggressively, and Wednesday night, he changed that. He threw a
fastball on the first or second pitch to every Seattle hitter the
first time through the lineup, and finished off the Mariners when
he got ahead in the count. Cone struck out six in 5 2/3 innings,
allowing five hits and a run and walking four.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle scored a run in the fifth, reducing the Yankees' lead to
4-1. With his pitch count mounting, Cone was relieved after
allowing a two-out single in the sixth. The left-hander Randy
Choate, who is building a case to be part of the postseason roster,
retired the only batter he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden took over in the top of the seventh, and after allowing a
walk and a single to start the inning, he got Alex Rodriguez to pop
out. Edgar Martinez, who beat the Yankees on Tuesday with a
late-inning three-run homer, came to the plate as the potential
tying run. He chopped a double-play grounder to Jeter _ and Jeter
fumbled it, and fumbled it again while trying to pick it up.
Everybody was safe. But Gooden struck out Al Martin and retired
Mike Cameron on a fly to deep right-center, where Justice caught
the ball for the last out of the inning, faked as if he were going
to flip the ball to jeering fans and then kept it for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The next game the Yankees play will be in September, at Yankee
Stadium, their magic number for clinching the AL East at 28. The
Yankees are expected to add a little more speed for their bench _
Ryan Thompson will most likely be in uniform Friday, to be followed
by Alfonso Soriano and perhaps Knoblauch.

RACE TAKES LESSER ROLE IN PICKING ALABAMA STARTING QB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In Alabama, Rosa Parks refused to sit in the back
of the bus. George Wallace practiced his politics of division and
Shoal Creek Country Club played host to the PGA Championship before
it played host to an African-American member. It is not hard to
find issues there that can be simply defined in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback debate at the University of Alabama - where
unheralded Andrew Zow, a junior who is black, has held off hometown
hero Tyler Watts, a sophomore who is white
</P>
<P>
   merely seems to be the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Except that it is neither black nor white. It's a story with
varying shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   When Watts, a four-year starting quarterback at Birmingham's
Pelham High, decided to attend Alabama three years ago, he was
hailed as the messiah of a struggling program.
</P>
<P>
   Watts was, by most accounts, the most hyped quarterback to ever
come out of a state that has produced a Heisman Trophy winner in
Pat Sullivan and former NFL quarterbacks Kenny Stabler and Richard
Todd.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that Watts hasn't been able to beat out Zow,
a little-known recruit from Florida whose only other scholarship
offer to play quarterback came from Central Florida, the school
most known for producing Minnesota Vikings starter Daunte
Culpepper.
</P>
<P>
   Zow, who won the job for the second consecutive season, will
start for No. 3-ranked Alabama on Saturday at the Rose Bowl against
UCLA, though Watts is also expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   In football-mad Alabama, it's a story that's never far off the
radar of fans or the front pages of the six newspapers that
regularly cover the Crimson Tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting situation,'' said Clyde Bolton, a
columnist for the Birmingham News who has covered Alabama football
since 1961, 10 years before its first African-American player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have this kid who came out of nowhere who wins the job
from probably the most highly publicized recruit in the history of
the state. That's a dramatic situation, the kind of story that
captures people's imagination. People still read Cinderella after
hundreds of years. I think it would be just as interesting if both
were white or both were black.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolton says this is the mainstream view, also. Alabama fans
don't care if their quarterback is white, black, blue or green as
long as the team wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anybody say one guy ought to play because he's
black or white,'' Bolton said. ``You do hear the code words
sometimes on the talk shows and I can't speak for every guy who's
got time to pick up the phone and call (a talk show) before he goes
to cook hamburgers on the night shift, but I don't think generally
that it's an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an issue, however, with some factions within the team
last season.
</P>
<P>
   It was no secret that former star tailback Shaun Alexander, who
is black, privately lobbied for Zow. However, later in the season,
most players agreed that Watts who led the team to victories over
LSU and Auburn while Zow was hobbled by an ankle injury deserved to
start.
</P>
<P>
   Managing such a predicament will be particularly dicey this
season. Zow and Watts are the only two quarterbacks on scholarship
and Alabama can't afford to have either one leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``At such a school as Alabama, if you don't play 'em, they don't
stay very long,'' said Alabama quarterbacks coach Charlie Stubbs,
who came from UNLV in 1998 to open up the offense. ``It's not just
quarterback, but other positions. We want them both to be leaders
of this team on offense, but the toughest thing for me is to keep
'em happy. I can't rotate 'em in like receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wasn't supposed to be like this.
</P>
<P>
   Zow, who quarterbacked Lake Butler (Fla.) Union County High to
back-to-back state titles, originally committed to Auburn, which
recruited him to play linebacker or defensive back, as most schools
did. When Alabama said it would give him a shot to play
quarterback, he jumped at it.
</P>
<P>
   When Watts signed, Zow wondered if he'd get the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt I did,'' Zow said. ``I wondered and kind of worried
at first. But as I evaluated myself, I felt like if I got a fair
shot I could show I could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Zow, as a redshirt freshman, took over from ineffective senior
John David Phillips because the Tide weren't going to sacrifice
Watts. At the time, Watts was a freshman behind a young line in
what appeared - at 2-2 - was going to be a disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   But Zow performed spectacularly, leading Alabama to five wins -
including a victory over rival Auburn in its final seven
regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations were so high that Tyler would take it over,''
Stubbs said. ``Andrew was recruited as an athlete, but all of a
sudden he comes in and grasps the offense pretty well and kind of
took off.''
</P>
<P>
   While Watts looked better at the end of the season and through
the spring, Zow had an outstanding fall camp and was awarded the
job early last week. Watts, who declined an interview request,
acknowledged that Zow deserved the job but vowed to continue
competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (Watts) is there,'' Zow said. ``I don't worry about
political things. Hopefully that won't have any impact on it. I
know some people might not like it that I'm black and the
quarterback, but that's their opinion. I just have to keep playing
like I'm capable of and I don't have anything to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Amilcar Shabazz, an American Studies professor at Alabama
and the chair of the African-American studies program, says he is
pleased that both players have been dismissive of race baiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to salute them for the maturity they've both
demonstrated,'' Shabazz said. ``They actually poo-poo any racial
edge or tension. That's not to say that they're Pollyannish. ... I
just see it as a promising sign that they're not feeding whatever
(division) may exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Zow says he laughed last year when a TV commentator remarked
that Zow was the better athlete and Watts was the better passer. In
fact, they do not fit the black/white quarterback stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we're completely opposite,'' Zow said. ``But
Tyler's able to use his legs to get himself out of trouble, while I
try to sit back and wait on things and let my arm help me out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still misconceptions, but I think it's changing.
Hopefully, people in the college world will see a black quarterback
in high school who has some ability and give him a chance at what
he's been doing instead of just moving him to another position. I
think we're moving beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for much of the rest of the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're finally getting to a point, in the 21st century,
where the idea of Alabama as the worst place on earth for race
relations is finally becoming passe,'' Shabazz said. ``The most
gruesome racially-motivated murder of the late 1990s wasn't in
Mississippi, it was in Jasper, Texas. The beatings of blacks by
police are in Philly, New York and L.A., not Alabama or
Mississippi. Those of us in Alabama definitely have our problems,
but they're problems that have resonance all over the U.S.''

VALDES COULD GO TO BULLPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ While Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said
he wouldn't go to a four-man rotation in the season's final few
weeks even if it meant making a playoff push, the starting rotation
issue is far from settled.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are getting production from Kevin Brown, Chan Ho
Park and Darren Dreifort, but quality outings and wins beyond that
have been few.
</P>
<P>
   That stated, right-hander Ismael Valdes' time in the starting
rotation could be running out, and club officials have talked about
making a change if Valdes doesn't pitch well Friday against
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes has been awful since joining the club in late July in a
trade the Dodgers made the same day Arizona acquired Curt Schilling
from Philadelphia. In 18 games, Valdes is 2-6 with a 5.94 ERA this
season, including going 0-2 with a 7.33 ERA in seven games with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers pitching coach Clause Osteen is hopeful Valdes can turn
around his dismal season with a strong month. Osteen said Valdes'
20-minute bullpen session Tuesday was his best since being
reacquired.
</P>
<P>
   But Osteen added that one of the reasons Valdes hasn't pitched
well is because he's still feeling the effects of a shoulder injury
that landed him on the disabled list to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think it's going to take him a little bit of time to
get his strength back, and I think it will come as his timing and
rhythm get better,'' Osteen said. ``His timing has not been good.
(Tuesday) night was probably the closest he's come to doing it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers can still turn to right-hander Matt Herges, who made
four starts after lefty Carlos Perez was yanked from the rotation
in early August. Herges went 0-3 with a 5.25 ERA as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Park: The moment catcher Chad Kreuter arrived at spring
training, he began asking about right-hander Chan Ho Park, and what
made a pitcher of his talent have a 5.23 ERA in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Trusting his ability to throw any pitch at any time in the count
was something Park lacked, but working exclusively with Kreuter for
the past three months has changed that approach. And it's made Park
one of the top young pitchers in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Park had the most dominating performance of his
career when he struck out 14 and allowed one hit in eight innings
Tuesday against Milwaukee. Park (14-8) leads the Dodgers in wins
and is 5-2 with a 2.48 ERA since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the spring, it was a must to have Chan Ho,'' Johnson said.
`He's pitched like a No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was strictly a thrower last year, and overthrew a lot. This
year, he's been pitching. This year, with the help of Kreuter, he's
a complete pitcher. When he's in that groove and makes good
pitches, he gets good hitters out.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Dodgers utility outfielder F.P. Santangelo said
team doctors told him his season is all but over. Santangelo, who
tore a ligament in his left thumb Aug. 22, is expected to be in a
cast for another two weeks. However, Santangelo said he's hopeful
he can return for the last week of the season. ... Dodgers center
fielder Devon White played for the first time since straining his
left quadricep Friday. White pinch hit in the ninth and grounded
out, though he had trouble running because the leg is not 100
percent. ... Left fielder Bruce Aven's strained left oblique muscle
continues to give him trouble, and he was unavailable for the third
straight day.

BALL IS BACK IN U.S. COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT MAGOLOFF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Personal differences crept into play during the
1996 Atlanta Games. Holly McPeak and Nancy Reno crumbled - as did
the medal hopes of the American favorites in beach volleyball -
from their rift. And it happened in the public eye and on U.S.
sand.
</P>
<P>
   McPeak and Reno, considered the gold-medal favorites in `96,
instead finished fifth in the sport's Olympic debut.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, McPeak has undertaken the challenge of
redeeming herself - as well as U.S. women's beach volleyball. And
she does so with partner Misty May, who's only in her first full
year on the beach circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Joining McPeak and May in the quest to restore pride to the
American beach volleyball movement is the No. 1 team of Jenny
Johnson Jordan and Annett Davis, both residents of Tarzana and UCLA
All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Davis will not only try to correct the U.S. team's
failure in 1996, they have the added pressure of possibly becoming
the first African-Americans to medal in the sport's short history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it a little bit,'' said Jordan, who played
alongside Davis for three years at UCLA. ``That's not really our
motivation behind us playing - it would be an added bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the idea wasn't as motivational as some might think
because beach volleyball is so new to the Olympics. She looks at
the 24-team competition as a means to further her team's dramatic
three-year rise in international beach volleyball and reestablish
the U.S. as a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to win,'' Davis said. ``If we can bring back a medal,
that would be great for our country, but there's no pressure on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the pressure build at Bondi Beach, the Olympic beach
volleyball site, Jordan and Davis might be the two most qualified
to handle it based on their connections to big-time sports.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's father, Rafer Johnson, won Olympic gold in the
decathlon in 1960 and the silver in 1956. He is often in the stands
at his daughter's BVA Tour stops. Davis' father, Cleveland Buckner,
played for the NBA's New York Knicks. His 33 points in a game
against the Philadelphia Warriors on March 2, 1962, was somewhat
overshadowed by the record 100 points poured in by Wilt
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do well it's just an added bonus,'' Jordan said. ``It's
something that (my father and I) have in common, the Olympic
experience, that we can share together. Not many fathers and
daughters have that in common, so that will be special.''
</P>
<P>
   McPeak is determined to make 2000 the year she figured 1996
would be. Heavily favored to finish among the top three in `96,
McPeak's and Reno's inability to work toward a common goal cost
them and took some luster from the sport in the U.S. McPeak is
convinced the compatibility between her and May will be evident in
their performance.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the team was approaching its peak on the U.S. and
international tours, McPeak and May must now battle through a torn
muscle in May's abdomen, which will keep the former Long Beach
State star out until the Olympics. McPeak has been playing U.S.
events with different partners since the injury.
</P>
<P>
   May has been taking advantage of her partner's relationship to
Leonard Armato, the agent for Shaquille O'Neal. McPeak's fiancee
arranged to have May visit with the specialist who treated O'Neal
when he suffered a similar injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be the chance for (McPeak) to make up for
(1996),'' said Gene Selznick, McPeak's coach. ``If Misty's healthy,
we'll just dominate and get a gold medal.''

HICKS' FIRST GAME WILL LOOK FAMILIAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It may happen only once or twice, but the
possibility still exists.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge running back Matt Hicks could take a
handoff Saturday and find his brother, Air Force defensive lineman
Jonathan Hicks, waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be one-on-one,'' Matt said. ``I'm not going to hit
him. I'm going to avoid his contact. He won't catch me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors play the Falcons in Saturday's season opener at
Falcon Stadium. Initially, the Hicks brothers were going to be on
the same sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Matt signed with Air Force after a stellar senior season at
North Hollywood High last year but left after two weeks of basic
training. Since Hicks wasn't at Air Force long, he contends there
are no hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing big,'' Matt said. ``It's nothing like, 'Oh, I
want to kill them.' You're just an athlete playing a team. You want
to go out and win. But if I do something good, my brother is going
to be hearing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt said he's been hearing about how Air Force is going to win
all week. Jonathan should be right. Air Force, a Division I-A team,
is a big favorite to beat CSUN, although there is no line on the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the individual competitiveness between the two is
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been competitive between me and my brother,'' Matt
said. ``Everything is a competition - from playing video games to
playing basketball to dress to who has the cuter girl. And can you
note that I have the cuter girl?''
</P>
<P>
   Matt, however, likely won't win Saturday's playing-time
competition. Jonathan is a backup nose guard and is expected to see
plenty of time. Matt just began practicing with the Matadors on
Tuesday. He had to wait until he was admitted to CSUN and all
paperwork was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Though Matt will have only three practices and one walk-through
under his belt, he'll play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's learning the offense and learning the protection,'' CSUN
coach Jeff Kearin said. ``That's the hardest part. Physically, he
looks like he has the abilities we saw in high school. He'll be
ready to see some action in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another scare: Punter Ethan Beck suffered a compound dislocation
of the pinkie on his left hand. Beck, who also plays receiver,
injured the finger while catching a pass. Beck got six stitches and
had his hand wrapped. He'll take snaps today but he's expected to
be OK for Saturday.

VORBE'S LATE GOAL LIFTS GALAXY

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The San Jose Earthquakes couldn't rattle
anything or anyone Wednesday night. Especially not starting
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, who could have taken a nap in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   But the Los Angeles Galaxy has found ways to miss a sure thing
this season and it nearly did it again.
</P>
<P>
   The Earthquakes, whose only previous shot came in the 74th
minute, evened the match 1-1 on a penalty kick by Dario Brose in
the 88th minute after Galaxy defender Danny Califf pulled down
Wojtek Krakowiak in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   However, substitute Sebastian Vorbe came to the rescue, scoring
in the 93rd minute - three minutes into injury time - to help the
Galaxy escape with a much-needed 2-1 victory in front of 11,974 at
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Galaxy (14-8-8, 50 points) into a share of
the Western Division lead with Kansas City (14-7-8, 50 points),
which was idle on Wednesday. The Wizards have three games remaining
while the Galaxy has two.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, K.C. will look in the paper today and see that
we're even,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid. ``I think anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not only a good night for Vorbe, but also Seth George.
Both strikers are fighting for the starting spot that will be left
by Sasha Victorine during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous four starts and 11 appearances, George logged
252 minutes, but had more offsides (seven) than shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Starting his fifth game in typical George fashion, the former
UCLA striker was whistled offside three times in the first half and
had missed two easy shots before breaking through in the 40th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Elliott sent a pass right of San Jose's goal for
Victorine. Victorine headed the ball down to George streaking in
the penalty area. George wasted no time, sending a one-touch shot
to the left corner for a 1-0 lead and his first goal and points of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Cienfuegos (El Salvador), Cobi Jones (U.S.) and Luis
Hernandez (Mexico) all missed Wednesday's match because of World
Cup qualifiers Sunday. Ezra Hendrickson (St. Vincent &AMP; the
Grenadines) also has a qualifier Sunday, but his federation allowed
him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   With the playoffs looming, the Galaxy is keeping close tabs on
El Salvador and St. Vincent &AMP; the Grenadines, which are both at the
bottom of CONCACAF Group D.
</P>
<P>
   Neither country can afford another loss if it hopes to advance
to the next round. On the flip side, Schmid would have Cienfuegos
and Hendrickson the remainder of the season if they do lose,
prompting a reporter to ask Schmid if he would light any candles
this weekend hoping for that outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of St. Vincent, I don't think I have to light any
candles for that to happen,'' joked Schmid. ``I don't want to
disappoint Ezra, but, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Schmid would love for those countries to lose, he
won't root against his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tremendous respect for Mauricio and I know it means a
lot for him to have his country qualify,'' said Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if Mexico wins on Sunday against Panama, it all but
assures Mexico a berth in the next round of qualifying. If that
happens, Schmid said Hernandez may not be called for Mexico's last
two qualifiers, one of which is during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had informal conversations with Mexico,'' said Schmid.
``They said if they win this game they won't call Luis for the next
game. We just hope that's the case.''

ANGELS POUNDED BY BLUE JAYS

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels failed to add to their
American League-leading number of home victories Wednesday night,
absorbing an 11-2 thrashing by the Toronto Blue Jays and David
Wells, and now they head back out on the road where life so far in
2000 has been far from blissful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to get to where we want to be,'' said manager Mike
Scioscia, who clearly wants to get to the top, ``then, obviously,
we've got to win on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously.
</P>
<P>
   Of their remaining 29 games, 20 are on the road and only nine -
nine - at Edison Field, where 19,653 fans showed up Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels begin a seven-game trip Friday night in Chicago, then
move on to Detroit, remarkably, for the only time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be a good club, you have to play well on
the road,'' said Scioscia, well aware the Angels, who are 41-31 at
home, are just 27-34 on the road. That's by far the poorest road
record of any of the AL wild-card contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season we've hit some stretches on the road when we
haven't played well, we've had some tough spells, and we've hit
some hot clubs on the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now all they've got coming up is the winningest team in the
league, the White Sox, and then the hottest, the Tigers, who have
rebounded from a 9-23 start to climb into wild-card contention.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Angels are through with the Blue Jays, who won
seven of the 12 meetings with Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays unloaded on three Angels pitchers for 19 hits,
four of them home runs. A dozen hits came off of rookie starter
Matt Wise (3-2), including three of the homers, and he was gone
after only 4 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just pounded the ball,'' Scioscia said. ``Every mistake
(Wise) made, they were on.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Wells breezed to his career-best - and
major-league-leading - 19th win.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, pitching in his 300th game as a Blue Jay, left after five
innings because of what was described as tightness in his left
shoulder. He also left with an 8-0 lead. Wells threw only 61
pitches, little more than a workout, and gave up just three hits,
all singles.
</P>
<P>
   While the Angels may have their troubles on the road, not so for
the 6-foot-4, 235-pound Wells. He's 11-1 this season away from the
SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   For the second successive night, the Angels spotted the Blue
Jays a 4-0 lead. But unlike Tuesday night, when they stormed back
to win 9-5, this one only got worse. Toronto added single runs in
the second and third innings, then two in the sixth and one in the
seventh against reliever Derrick Turnbow, plus two more in the
ninth off of Mark Petkovsek.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good-hitting team, and I made mistakes,'' Wise said,
``... the change I hung to Fullmer (in the first inning).'' It
wasn't until the eighth that the Angels finally retired the Blue
Jays 1-2-3 in an inning.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Brad Fullmer slugged two home runs, his 27th
and 28th, and drove in four runs; third baseman Tony Batista hit
his 37th home run to reach 100 runs batted in, and catcher Darrin
Fletcher hit his 17th home run.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Blue Jays a major-league-leading 221 homers for
the season, which tied the Toronto franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Carlos Delgado drove in four runs, giving him 124
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays' Dave Martinez had two of the Blue Jays' 19 hits,
a single and a double, to extend his hitting streak to 20 games, a
career high and the longest current streak in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were shut out until the seventh, when Mo Vaughn
opened the inning with his 33rd home run off of reliever John
Frascatore. It was good for his 100th RBI. Vaughn is just the
second Angels player with back-to-back 100 RBI seasons (Wally
Joyner did it in 1986-87).
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant homered in the ninth, the Angels' 123rd homer at Edison
Field, breaking the franchise record for most homers at home. The
previous mark of 122 was established in the Angels' first season,
1961, when they played in cozy Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels ended August at 11-15, their first losing month all
season.
</P>
<P>
   But, all was not bad. In the past month they still managed to
gain a game on first-place Seattle in the AL West.

TOUGH ONE TO SWALLOW FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE -- Eight marvelous innings and 106 pitches by Darren
Dreifort was wasted as the result of five pitches by Terry Adams
and an errant throw by young shortstop Alex Cora.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the predominant topic in the Los Angeles Dodgers'
clubhouse - after Milwaukee's Richie Sexson singled in the winning
run with none out in the ninth inning to give the Brewers a 3-2
victory Wednesday at County Stadium - was a controversial call back
in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers leading 1-0 with runners on second and third
and two out, Adrian Beltre hit a sharp single a few steps to the
left of Brewers shortstop Mark Loretta. Mark Grudzielanek scored
and a throw home allowed Beltre to move to second while Shawn Green
stopped at third.
</P>
<P>
   However, second base umpire Jeff Kellogg ruled the ball glanced
off Green's heel and called him out, which ended the inning. The
run didn't count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely brutal call,'' Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros
said. ``That's not an interpretive call. It's not like, `Well,
maybe it was a ball, maybe it was a strike.' It either hit him or
it didn't hit him. To make a call like that, you would think you
would have to see it. My understanding is he heard it, and the
shortstop, who has the play right there, didn't get up and argue.
Just a brutal call. There's no reason to make that call. None.
Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said the ball was a few feet behind him and initially was
confused as to why he was called out. Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
argued and Kellogg asked home plate umpire Eric Cooper for help.
Cooper didn't overturn the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kellogg) said he didn't see it, but he thought he heard it,''
Johnson said. ``The only thing I don't like about that call is you
have to see it and it's got to change direction. You can't hear
something and assume that it nicked him. Greenie said it didn't
come close.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential for a big inning existed, especially since
Milwaukee starter Jamey Wright walked the first three batters.
However, to what extent the Dodgers suffered is debatable.
</P>
<P>
   Though it clearly altered the game, the Dodgers had other
chances to get to Wright, who survived eight innings. Wright wasn't
as dominating as Dreifort but struck out a career high 11 and -
even though he's without a decision in his last three starts - he
got the Brewers to the ninth inning tied 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's first two runs came via homers. Geoff Jenkins tied
it 1-1 with a two-out shot in the first inning and Tyler Houston
made it 2-1 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The winning run was the result of a mistake. Jenkins led off
against reliever Adams (6-7) with a bloop single to left field.
Cora, who almost came up with the catch, grabbed the ball on one
hop, spun and threw wildly to second thinking Jenkins was heading
there. However, Jenkins didn't move up a base until Cora's throw
sailed well over Grudzielanek's head.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson then hit the second pitch he saw from Adams into center
field to knock in Jenkins and hand the Dodgers their second loss in
10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a stupid play, that's it,'' Cora said. ``I tried to
make the catch and sometimes, defensively, I try to be too
aggressive. I thought he was going to try to go to second and I
threw it away. Cost us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Green had a chance to make the first-inning call a little less
relevant, but with the bases loaded and two outs in the fifth
inning, he tapped weakly in front of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers did tie it 2-2 on Jim Leyritz's RBI double in the
sixth, but another opportunity was lost in the seventh when Karros
grounded into a double play with two runners on and one out. Wright
got his third double play in the eighth when Leyritz grounded to
third to start it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had (Wright) on the ropes. Who knows what we would have
ended up getting in that (first) inning,'' said Dreifort, who
allowed four hits. ``You end up losing by one run in the bottom of
the ninth and you definitely look back on it and it makes a
difference.''

   (PHOENIX) - Julie Vega could see it coming. She'd seen it coming
from the moment in early March, 1998, when someone called her from
Arizona Boys Ranch near Oracle to say her son, Nicholaus Contrarez,
was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that scared me all along was that these people who
killed my boy were going to get away with it,'' she told me
Wednesday. ``You try not to believe it. And the prosecutors, they
tell you that it's never going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, it happens.
</P>
<P>
   Pinal County prosecutors dropped criminal charges against nurse
Linda Babb, the last of five former Boys Ranch employees originally
accused of wrongdoing in the 16-year-old's death.
</P>
<P>
   Contreraz died of an infection in the lining of the lungs that
was complicated by asthma and other ailments. That's the medical
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that actually killed Nicky Contreraz was cruelty, and
arrogance, and something close to hatred.
</P>
<P>
   He was a troubled kid in a place meant to help troubled kids,
and he wound up dead. Instead of recognizing that he was sick, the
staff at Boys Ranch treated him like a slacker, forcing him in the
last minutes of his life, as he gasped for air and begged for
mercy, to do push-ups over a bucket of his own excrement-soiled
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy revealed more than 2  &QC;  quarts of pus in the lung
lining and a collapsed lung.
</P>
<P>
   Babb was the nurse at the school. She had been charged with
manslaughter and child abuse. In the beginning, five employees at
the school were charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the cases against four defendants faded like bad
memories, and the charges against them eventually were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a problem with conflicting testimony from an expert
witness, Babb was let off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I would have asked,'' Julie Vega told me, ``is that a jury
get to decide what happened that day. These are not people who just
made mistakes. My son is dead. To me, there was a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in the eyes of the law, however. Not any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Contreraz family has settled a lawsuit against Boys
Ranch for what is estimated to be over &QL;
</P>
<P>
   $1million.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time we did that, there were five people being
prosecuted,'' Vega said. ``I never would have agreed to settle
anything if I thought there would be no criminal trial for this.
Never.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor in the case, Sylvia Lafferty, told me that a
reversal in the testimony of Dr. Robert Kearl, an expert she
expected to pin the blame on Babb, caused her to drop the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he (Kearl) decided that the medical situation wasn't what
he thought{hellip}then there was no criminal liability,'' the
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Lafferty is actually the second prosecutor to work the case. She
was sent in, many believe, to clean up an initially botched job.
That's certainly what Julie Vega and her family believes.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they wanted a trial. It's why they deserved their day
in court. They know a jury would have seen through the conflicting
testimony and lawyers' tricks.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if there was no crime then Nicky Contreraz could be
said to have died of natural causes, a notion that reeks almost
most as much as the bucket of filth over which he breathed his last
breaths.

DAUBACH, MERLONI TOOK THEIR LUMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ With his injured left arm dangling
awkwardly at his side, Brian Daubach abruptly rushed out of the Red
Sox clubhouse Wednesday for an unscheduled trip to Boston that will
determine if the team's second-leading home run hitter will play
again this season.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a woozy Lou Merloni sat in front of his locker, trying
to sift through the wreckage of his short memory to piece together
the events the night before that also knocked him out of the Sox
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   And all around there was the lingering tension from Tuesday
night's Bean Brawl by the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all things, they embarrassed themselves,'' Sox catcher
Jason Varitek said of a Tampa Bay team that had eight members
ejected, five of them in connection with their game-long war
against Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly angry, right fielder Trot Nixon said, ``I'm not even
going to waste my breath talking about that team over there.''
</P>
<P>
   And reliever Derek Lowe, noting that the Red Sox finish the
regular season with three games against Tampa Bay, said that could
be the time when Boston exacts its payback for the Daubach fiasco.
He said the Sox cannot risk losing a key pitcher to a possible
suspension in their race for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   But the team might not mind losing a pitcher who is called up
from the minors in September and does not factor into postseason
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have come out on top last night in hitting guys,''
Lowe said, ``but there's September, when you have September
call-ups, and then you can do the same thing. It might be a totally
different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams continued to defend their actions as the
commissioner's office began an investigation. Major League
officials received videotapes of the game and spoke with Red Sox
general manager Dan Duquette and his Devil Rays counterpart, Chuck
LaMar.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams, who was ejected in the first inning, is
expected to be suspended not only for charging the mound but for
briefly returning to the field when both benches emptied again in
the seventh inning. He was quickly ushered back to the Tampa Bay
clubhouse by teammates.
</P>
<P>
   LaMar said he expects the league to act swiftly in suspending
Williams. But he argued that Williams charged Pedro Martinez in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no retaliation an opposing team can have against a
pitcher,'' LaMar said, citing the designated hitter rule. ``So
you're going to have hitters trying to protect themselves, and in
Gerald Williams's case, whether we condone it or not, he went out
there because he thought he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   LaMar also insisted that Tampa Bay was justified in sending out
three pitchers to try to hit Daubach with pitches. Two succeeded
and a third came dangerously close. All three were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tampa Bay Devil Rays feel strongly that Brian Daubach did
not conduct himself in a professional manner when the fight broke
out,'' LaMar sid. ``Our actions throughout the rest of the night
indicate that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rays believe Daubach threw ``cheap shots'' in the pile of
players on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no place in baseball for what he did,'' said Devil
Rays closer Roberto Hernandez, who gave Daubach a two-handed shove
in the back following the pileup.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Martinez insisted his pitch to Williams was about
establishing control of the inside of the plate, LaMar said, ``We
spent the rest of the game trying to establish the inside part of
the plate against Brian Daubach.''
</P>
<P>
   His regret? ``In our pursuit of trying to establish the inside
part of the plate, we could have done a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they should have hit him more often.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach was headed back to Boston for more tests on his arm.
Before he left, he said preliminary X-rays determined the arm was
not fractured. The Sox listed the injury as a hyperextended left
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I know,'' Daubach said, declining further comment
until he returns to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach's loss comes at crucial time for the Sox, as they brace
for the September stretch drive. He was the team's hottest hitter
on the seven-game road trip that ended Wednesday and one of the
only power threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play with what we've got,'' Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams said. ``We've got to keep going. No excuses, no sour
grapes, no nothing. We go play.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daubach's teammates were still hot over the ongoing effort
by the Rays to hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about cheap shots,'' Merloni said. ``I didn't see
any cheap shots. When you have a guy charging Pedro Martinez, you
do everything you can to prevent anything from happening to him.
Daubach just came in to try to get him out of there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, a very important part of our team could be
out for a while for something that never should have happened in
the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek, who was near Merloni at the bottom of the pile, agreed
that Daubach acted appropriately. The corroboration is important
because Merloni may have been fuzzy at the time. Daubach had just
dived onto Merloni, causing his head and neck injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Merloni spent Tuesday night in Bayfront Medical Center after
suffering a mild concussion. He said he continued to suffer
headaches and a stiff neck Wednesday but hoped to be able to play
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When Merloni beat out an infield hit with two outs in the second
inning Tuesday night, he said he ``felt weird and just kind of shut
down. I don't remember how we got the third out.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a game anyone else who was there will not soon
forget.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tampa Bay coach Jose Cardenal, who was ejected, ``It was a
wild and crazy night.''

PEDRO'S REPUTATION HAS PRECEDED HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes two Pedro hit-by-pitch text tables.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has gone on too long unpunished. His identity is known to
everyone in both leagues, this righthanded Red Sox pitcher from a
Latin country who is hitting batters at an alarming rate. Two years
ago, he hit more batters in a season than any pitcher in the '90s.
Nineteen batters felt his wrath in 1998. This season, he's leading
the major leagues again.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Robinson, how much longer are you going to let Rolando
Arrojo get away with such reckless behavior? That's right, our
newest Cuban import leads the majors with 16 hit batsmen, 12 while
he was with the Colorado Rockies, four since joining the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you thought we were talking about the little Dominicano?
</P>
<P>
   That's how reputation intrudes on reality. When have you ever
heard Arrojo described as a headhunter? But Pedro Martinez, who
thought he'd left that all behind him in Montreal, when manager
Felipe Alou and pitching coach Joe Kerrigan went to the league
president to plead his case for him, is now back to being Public
Enemy No. 1 among opposing hitters.
</P>
<P>
   True, Martinez has hit 14 batters this season, most in the
American League. But in the previous four seasons, he hasn't come
close to leading the league: 3 in 1996, 9 in '97, 8 in '98, and 9
in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Gentleman Jim Lonborg hit 19 men in the Impossible Dream year of
1967. Compared with Lonborg, Martinez has been a prince.
</P>
<P>
   But all it has taken is a few pitches for Martinez to be saddled
with his previous reputation, and this time it may be tougher to
shake. I am in no way an apologist for Martinez. He is not afraid
to go up and in on a hitter, especially one with whom he has an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   He buzzed Einar Diaz after the Indians' backup catcher hit two
doubles off him on that May day when he later hit Robbie Alomar as
payback for Charles Nagy hitting Jose Offerman, leading to
Martinez's five-game suspension. He drilled Matt Lawton of the
Twins last year for stepping out of the box one too many times. And
yes, he went upstairs on Gerald Williams of the Devil Rays Tuesday
night, delivering a message to the first batter of the game that he
was not letting the expansion team have its way with him again,
like it did two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And if a batter doesn't know how to spin away, like Diaz of the
Tribe, or should happen to be plunked, like Williams, Martinez
isn't the type to offer apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had a right to be upset. The fastball from Martinez
could have broken his hand. But even one of the Devil Rays' own,
catcher John Flaherty, admitted he was embarrassed at the clumsy
way in which the Devil Rays tried to even the score, with a parade
of pitchers taking aim (and generally missing) Brian Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach remained a target Wednesday, the Devil Rays making a
show of how they had sent a tape to the commissioner's office,
which they claim proves Daubach had performed dirty deeds while in
the scrum created when Williams charged the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Globe assistant sports editor Joe Sullivan, who confesses to
having once covered the Yankees, pondered what the Devil Rays hoped
to accomplish. ``What are they going to show,'' he asked, ``that
Daubach was fighting during a fight?''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach may have paid a high price for his part in the brawl. He
flew back to Boston to have an MRI taken of his sore left elbow.
But what of the future cost to Martinez, because of his reputation
for extracting retribution.
</P>
<P>
   That reputation has gotten so large, when his brother Ramon hit
Oakland's Olmedo Saenz with a pitch the day after Saenz had taken
Pedro deep, Saenz blamed Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   Review the batters Martinez has hit with pitches this season,
and it becomes obvious there was no malice aforethought. Miguel
Tejada of the A's hit a big homer off Martinez last season, but
when Pedro hit him in April, Tejada absolved the pitcher, saying
his good buddy from the Dominican would never intentionally hit
him.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton of the Rangers was plunked with two outs and a
runner already on first. Chuck Knoblauch and Jorge Posada of the
Yankees both had two strikes on them when they were hit with
pitches in the ninth in Yankee Stadium, when Martinez was trying to
hold onto the 2-0 lead Trot Nixon had given him in the top of the
inning against Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   On June 14 in Fenway Park, Martinez hit Bernie Williams of the
Yankees with a 2-0 count, runners on first and third in the first
inning. Paul Konerko of the White Sox, one out and nobody on in the
second inning. Hitting Shannon Stewart of the Blue Jays in his
first at-bat after he'd led off with a homer wasn't as innocent,
but when all is said and done, only three players plunked by
Martinez would have any chance of making an accusation stick.
</P>
<P>
   Does that sound like a headhunter to you?
</P>
<P>
   And yet, partly because of his reputation, Martinez did not dare
retaliate against Tampa. He didn't want to be thrown out of a game
the Sox needed to win, but neither could he risk a suspension that
could be expected to be worse, because he'd be a multiple offender.
</P>
<P>
   And with a month left in the season, we are reminded of the
words of Tigers manager Phil Garner, who in the wake of Martinez's
suspension in May suggested he might be tempted to order his
pitcher to hit a Red Sox batter early, daring Martinez to
retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we got down to the pennant I tell you what, I'd have to
think about it,'' Garner said at the time. ``I'd have to think
about sending a guy out there and saying, `Hit the first guy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers began the night just five games out of the wild-card
lead. Include the Tigers, and there are nine teams still in
postseason contention.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a long, hot September for Pedro and the Sox.

GEORGE W. BUSH: RARELY SMOOTH, NEVER SPEECHLESS 

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether George W. Bush will make a good president I cannot say,
but he certainly knows how to give a speech.
</P>
<P>
   Not a comprehensible speech, necessarily, but one that is often
rich in insights, nuance and subtle shades of meaning that reveal
themselves to only a select few listeners, specifically those who
have been drinking heavily.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Bush has problems with the English language is like
saying tourists from Michigan have problems with their turn
signals; it just doesn't adequately describe the scope of the
problem. (I have no idea if George W. uses his turn signals
properly, nor do I have any idea how many tourists from Michigan
describe our nuclear arsenal as ``tacular'' weapons. I apologize to
both sides if there was any misunderstanding.)
</P>
<P>
   After a few slow weeks of relatively gaffe-free speaking, the
Republican presidential candidate went to Des Moines last Monday
and in a mere 16 minutes showed the world that he is still the
undisputed king of mangled language.
</P>
<P>
   Bush warmed up the crowd by saying, ``When we carry Iowa in
November, it'll mean the end of four years of Clinton-Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush must be the only person in America for whom the
Clinton-Gore administration seemed to last only four years. For
everyone else, it lasted at least 20.
</P>
<P>
   What the 2,300 Republicans who paid $100 each for the state
party fund-raiser thought of another Bush remark is hard to say,
but it's likely they were terrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a free-trader,'' Bush said. ``I will work to end terrors _
tariffs and barriers _ everywhere, across the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A Reuters account of the event said that the crowd was generally
enthusiastic and cheered Bush frequently, even if they couldn't
make heads or tails of what he was saying. Bush's comment on
security policy, however, left everyone in the crowd momentarily
stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot let terrorists and rogue nations hold this nation
hostile or hold our allies hostile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Bush was saying that America and its allies are quite
capable of being hostile without the help of terrorists and rogue
nations. Or something.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, has been putting his own personal spin on the
mother tongue (ouch!) since the first days of his campaign. The
Web, as you might expect, offers a cornucopia of Bushisms, the best
collection being Jacob Weisberg's of Slate magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The scary part is that if you read enough of these things, they
actually start to make sense. Bush's take on the federal budget is
a good example:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly a budget. It's got a lot of numbers in it.''
</P>
<P>
   What else could it possibly be? A grocery list?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of groceries, Bush was possibly thinking of ways to
liven up the dinner hour when he said to the Greater Nashua, N.H.,
Chamber of Commerce, ``I know how hard it is for you to put food on
your family.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. is from Texas and it's possible his mind was out
riding the open range when this came out of his mouth last February
in Florence, S.C.:
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator has got to understand if he's going to have _ he
can't have it both ways. He can't take the high horse and then
claim the low road.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's professors at Yale might be the ones to speak to this
next quote, also uttered before the poor, suffering people of
Florence:
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they is and maybe they ain't, Mr. Bush, but you certainly
seem to have plenty of confidence in your own intellectual
abilities, as evidenced by your remark in U.S. News &AMP; World Report:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody who doesn't think I'm smart enough to handle
the job is underestimating.''
</P>

   Talk about grumpy old men.
</P>
<P>
   China's President Jiang Zemin answers some tough questions from
Mike Wallace in a rare two-segment interview on CBS' ''60 Minutes''
Sunday at 7, which comes two days before Jiang's scheduled visit to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   We'll expect human rights to be high on the agenda, as well as
the complex issues of trade between the two countries and possibly
even a mention of Tibet. Wallace may be getting up there in years,
but he's still one of the best face-to-face interviewers, and he's
certainly not shy.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the only two-guys-sitting-around-talking show of note
this weekend. Although it may be at the other end of the spectrum
from ''60 Minutes'' in terms of global importance, a lot of folks
will be tuning in curiously to this weekend's debut of the
syndicated ``Ebert &AMP; Roeper &AMP; the Movies'' (various days and times,
check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   Since the death of his longtime partner Gene Siskel, Ebert has
been working with various guest hosts, but he says he's found his
most comfortable match in his fellow Chicago Sun-Times columnist
Richard Roeper. There's been some minor grumbling online because
Roeper is a metro columnist, not a film critic, but we seem to
recall from our days in Chicago that he's a pop-culture sponge and,
well, we're all for columnists getting lucrative TV gigs.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    COSTA RICA'S ECOLOGY AN ATTRACTION FOR TOURISM

<TEXT>
<P>
   HERMOSA BEACH, Costa Rica _ From 120 feet up in a tree in the
Costa Rican rainforest, the view of the broad, blue Pacific is
breath taking.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear howler monkeys up here, jabbering as they dance
among the branches. You might even spot a bright-winged quetzal
bird, a cute sloth or a slow-moving iguana creeping along the
forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   That's if you keep still.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Chiclets Canopy Tour, keeping still is the last thing
you do.
</P>
<P>
   You're too busy gasping for breath as you plunge off the tiny
wooden platforms lashed in the high treetops. One step and whoosh,
you're zipping down a steel cable, plummeting through the branches,
securely suspended from a harness and pulley, screaming your head
off at the rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' gushed one gringo tourist, sweating from the tropical
heat and the excitement as she zipped from one high platform to
another. ``They don't have anything like this in Orlando! The
lawyers would never let them.''
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica was a pioneer in the field of eco-tourism in the
1980s, turning its lush landscape of rumbling volcanoes, high cloud
forests, rushing mountain streams, vibrant rainforests and gorgeous
deserted beaches into a nature-lover's vacation paradise.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the Central American hideaway has put action
into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can raft through raging whitewater streams, mountain
bike through dense forests, kayak along unspoiled rocky beaches,
windsurf on a stunning lake in the shadow of a smoking volcano,
explore the azure Caribbean in scuba gear, horseback ride through
the rainforest or surf some of the world's best waves.
</P>
<P>
   For more tranquil souls, there are butterfly farms, orchid
farms, teak reserves, bird- and nature-watching tours, and hikes
along the rim of a volcano. There are also canopy tours high in the
rainforest treetops that let you walk on swinging bridges or ride
in suspended tramcars instead of launching into the great void
clipped to a steel cable with a harness.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think you have to be a high-adventure junkie or an
eco-freak to enjoy a trip to Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   There's also plenty of traditional vacation fare, including
deserted beaches perfect for meandering, sparkling new golf
courses, five-star hotels, day-sailing trips to nowhere, and
casinos and discos offering plenty of night-time action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much to do here,'' said Dave Klostermann, 40, a
California transplant who now runs a horseback-riding outfit in the
Pacific coast surf town of Jaco Beach. ``You can ride horses on a
gorgeous beach, kayak, white-water raft, mountain-bike, surf or
take a canopy tour. But it's also a great place to just hang out
and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   The message appears to be getting out. Costa Rica is now Central
America's top tourism destination, luring more than 1 million
visitors in 1999 who spent nearly US$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They are drawn by the tiny country's natural beauty, the long
list of activities and Costa Rica's reputation as a peaceful,
relatively prosperous oasis in the midst of a region marred by
poverty, civil war and unstable governments.
</P>
<P>
   While its neighbors spent decades embroiled in wars and
dictatorships, Costa Rica abolished its army in 1949, investing the
money in developing the country's infrastructure and social
services.
</P>
<P>
   Visionary leaders also jumped on the conservation bandwagon
early, and have set aside nearly 25 percent of Costa Rica's
territory as nature preserves or national parks. There are more
than 75 such parks in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The country offers a staggering array of flora and fauna: more
than 9,000 species of plants, including 1,200 varieties of orchids
and 800 different types of ferns. As for animals, there are more
than 850 species of birds, while 10 percent of the world's
butterflies call Costa Rica home. There are more than 5,000
different species of grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   And it's all so close together. Wedged between Nicaragua and
Panama, with the Caribbean to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the
west, Costa Rica is only 200 miles long. You can drive almost
anywhere in the country within a day _ although be warned: the
roads are notoriously rough and can be dangerous after dark as
livestock and wild animals like to bed down on the warm pavement.
</P>
<P>
   But driving around Costa Rica is fun. Rent a car in the Central
Highlands at the capital, San Jose, and within a half-hour, you can
be hugging curves on a high mountain road, zipping past coffee
bushes planted on unbelievably steep terraces.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later and you can be standing on the rim of the Poas
Volcano, or dodging drops at the La Paz waterfall. Half an hour
more and you can be touring a butterfly farm, then hiking in the
rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   The country is actually made up of several distinct ``climate
zones,'' and the weather can vary from hot and dry to summer
monsoon to surprisingly brisk. The rainy season runs from May to
December, and the high tourist season, which is dry, lasts from
January until May.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most popular destinations are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Arenal Volcano, about five hours northwest of San Jose. This
5,000-foot peak is one of the country's most active, and regularly
throws off showers of sparks and smoke. Hiking to the rim is not
recommended, although you can hike along the slopes and see plenty
of dramatic action.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You can also windsurf on Lake Arenal in the volcano's shadow,
enjoying some of the most predictable high-wind conditions in the
world. Rental equipment is available at several resorts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Also in this area is the Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological
Preserve, which has earned a reputation as one of the most
outstanding tropical reserves in the Americas. Take a guided tour
and you may glimpse any of the hundreds of species of animals
living here, from pumas to exotic moths to 30 species of
hummingbirds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About three hours southwest of San Jose, beach-lovers flock to
Manuel Antonio National Park, a small but gorgeous park bordering
the blue Pacific. Visitors can sun on magnificent white sand
beaches, or hike through the park's rainforest, where they are
almost guaranteed to see monkeys, sloths, scarlet macaws and other
exotic wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful with your beach picnic, as the monkeys are notorious
thieves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For whitewater rafting, enthusiasts have their choice of
multi-day trips that include camping by the river or one-day
excursions that range from the relatively tranquil Rio Corobici to
wild, high-adrenaline rapids on the Rio Reventazon. More than a
half-dozen companies offer guided trips, with most departing from
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For those interested in a more relaxing time, several
companies offer daylong sailing cruises on both the Caribbean and
the Pacific. Most stop on nearby islands, and some offer gourmet
picnic lunches so that visitors can delight their palates as well
as soak up sun and sand.
</P>
<P>
   While Costa Rica has been in the news lately for a few
high-profile crimes against tourists, most veteran travelers will
recognize that it is still much safer than other Latin American
countries. Petty theft is a problem, but robberies and more serious
crimes are still rare. Visitors who take reasonable precautions
should have few problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Costa Rica really is a utopia,'' said David Reid, 56, owner of
Calypso Tours, who moved to Costa Rica 30 years ago and helped
pioneer the country's tourism offerings with his daylong cruise and
gourmet lunch adventure. ``It's such a beautiful place. There are
more people now than before, but there's still so much to do and
see.''

</P>
<P>
   ---------------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO GO: The rainy season runs from May until December. The
dry season, which lasts from January to May, is the most popular
time to visit. However, prices are higher during the dry season and
it doesn't rain all the time during the wet season, so you might
consider a summer visit. Climate ranges from cool in the central
highlands year-round to steamy along the coasts during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Many major U.S. carriers, including American,
Delta and Continental, have daily flights to San Jose, Costa Rica's
capital, from cities including Houston, Atlanta and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND: All international flights arrive in the capital,
and unless you are staying at an all-inclusive resort that offers
transportation, you'll likely need a rental car. Traffic is bad in
San Jose, but outside the capital, it thins out and driving can be
a gorgeous adventure, with curvy mountain roads and stunning views.
Watch for potholes and road repair crews, as well as livestock and
rural residents, who use the highway as a sidewalk. You will need a
4-wheel-drive vehicle during the rainy season if you plan to visit
a volcano or rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY: In San Jose, you can find everything from US$15
barebones rooms to a luxurious new five-star Marriott built in the
midst of an old coffee plantation, where rooms start at US$150 a
night. Outside the capital, there are lots of hotels with varying
price ranges in the most popular tourist destinations, including
Puerto Viejo and Limon on the Caribbean and Tamarindo, Jaco Beach
and Quepos on the Pacific side.
</P>
<P>
   SECURITY: Crime against tourists has unfortunately been
increasing in Costa Rica but the country is still relatively safe
compared to other Latin destinations. Petty theft is very common so
don't leave items unattended, even in a locked car. Take the same
common-sense precautions as in other strange places: don't walk
alone at night; don't carry and flash lots of cash; be wary of
over-friendly strangers.
</P>
<P>
   LANGUAGE: The native Costa Ricans, called ``Ticos,'' speak
Spanish, but most tourism-related businesses have English-speakers.
Even in the remote countryside, Ticos are accustomed to dealing
with tourists and you'll probably get by fine even if you don't
even know how to order a ``cerveza,'' (beer) in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ACTIVITIES: The list is nearly endless. There's whitewater
rafting, mountain-biking, hiking, bird-watching,
butterfly-watching, rainforest canopy tours, cloud forest tours,
volcanoes you can hike or drive up, windsurfing, surfing, scuba
diving, beach-combing, golf, tennis, sailing and sport-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing to do is decide which activities you want to try
and build a vacation around them. You could start in San Jose, do a
day-trip to whitewater raft, then rent a car and drive to the
Pacific coast for some beachtime and a tour of a rainforest. Then
move on to the Arenal Volcano and the Monteverde Cloud Forest
Preserve.

   DATONG, China _ The way Zhang Weilin sees it, as the Chinese
palate becomes more demanding and sophisticated, it's only a matter
of time before the dog meat industry takes off. With his 90 Saint
Bernards, he's counting on being at the forefront of the
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When China opens the dog meat market and dog breeding
industry, it will gradually become like raising cows and sheep,''
said the middle-aged Zhang. ``As people spend more and their
dietary habits change, industrialization of dog breeding will not
take as long as domestication of cows and sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows there's still a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to start a new industry,'' he said. ``Breeding
dogs (for meat) has never been done on a large scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang oversees what he says is China's largest Saint Bernard
breeding center and the only one that is state-run. The famed
mountain rescue dog is mated with local dogs to produce mixed-breed
dogs that can then be sold for meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage of the local dogs is they have a lot of lean
meat,'' said Zhang. ``The advantage of Saint Bernards is they're
big and grow fast and don't get sick.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Zhang's farm is only breeding dogs, not slaughtering
them. But he has plans to build what he says will be China's first
large-scale dog meat factory.
</P>
<P>
   After launching two years ago, the breeding center has become
one of the most profitable ventures of the state-owned Datong
Mining Bureau, the largest employer in this gritty city of 2
million about 160 miles west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   When the coal industry went into a slump a few years ago and
started running out of money to pay workers, the government ordered
certain sectors to find outside revenue streams. Zhang, and a few
other Datong Mining Bureau officials spent more than six months
exploring possibilities before settling on dog meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through market analysis and research, we discovered there was
a huge demand for dog meat,'' said Cui Liguo, a former coal
industry planner now in charge of managing the Saint Bernard
breeding center. ``There are a lot of consumers of dog meat and not
many breeders of dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to use Saint Bernards was also arrived at after
much scientific research, Cui and Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To develop this industry you need a good breed. The local
breeds are not good enough,'' said Zhang. ``Chinese scientists have
done a lot of comparative research. The Saint Bernard was their
first choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being large - male Saint Bernards can grow to
more than 200 pounds - they are also very fertile, adapt well to
various weather conditions and are easy to care for.
</P>
<P>
   At Zhang's farm, a pair of puppies _ one male, one female _
sells for $1,800 and has to be ordered months in advance. An adult
Saint Bernard, which is cross-bred with other dogs to produce meat
for consumption, goes for $3,600 to $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers include farmers and small businessmen who come from all
over China hoping to make some money on the side by breeding dogs.
They are drawn by ads boasting of a high rate of return: three
times as profitable as poultry and four times as profitable as
raising pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang said the breeding center earned back its initial
investment of $324,000 after just one year.
</P>
<P>
   They stress that Saint Bernards are not for eating. Gao
Yuanping, head of the mining bureau's forestry division, said he
knows dog lovers would howl in protest if it were thought Saint
Bernards were being killed.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights groups in Switzerland have tried to stop the sale
of Saint Bernards to Asian countries. But Cui said Swiss dogs are
too expensive anyway; most of their Saint Bernards come from Russia
and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   For American animal rights groups, however, the breed of the dog
is a secondary issue. ``Like pigs, cows and chickens, all dogs are
intelligent animals that deserve respect and not exploitation at
the hands of money-makers,'' said Cem Akin, a spokesman for the
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).
</P>
<P>
   He said PETA is currently focused on a similar situation in
Korea, site of soccer's World Cup in 2002. The group alleges that
it is a common practice in Korea to consume dog meat after first
beating, torturing and strangling the dog to increase its
adrenaline level. It is believed that this will make a man
consuming the meat more virile, Akin said.
</P>
<P>
   Gao knows Americans don't eat dog meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Americans, it's very strange,'' he said. ``Dog is man's
best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, he said he welcomes investors from the
United States or anywhere else to help them expand their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to like dogs,'' he said enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Dog meat is thought to be nutritious and good to eat in the
winter because it heats up the body. Gao said every part of a dog
can be eaten except for the lungs. ``Heart of a wolf, lung of a
dog,'' is a Chinese insult meaning cruel and savage. Some
restaurants offer a full banquet of up to 100 different dishes made
from one dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog skin tastes very good,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas American palates rarely venture beyond the staples,
Asians are far more adventurous diners, enjoying chicken feet, pig
brains and countless other dishes that would make Americans
squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Beijing and many other cities in China, dog meat is
not commonly eaten and is available only at a few restaurants. It
is more popular in the northeast, which has a large ethnic Korean
population, and Guangdong province in the south. More and more
urban Chinese with disposable income are also keeping dogs as pets.
</P>
<P>
   Cui, the general manager of the dog farm and once an avid
consumer of dog meat, said he has stopped eating dogs after working
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel affection for them,'' said Cui, who had never raised
dogs before his current job. ``Dogs have intelligence. They're not
like livestock. This is one of the reasons dog breeding has never
developed over these thousands of years. Dogs are smarter than
other animals and they have feelings. They can understand people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zhang, who has a German shepherd as a pet, sees no conflict
between raising dogs and eating them.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the dogs are not often let out to play on the large
grassy yard, Zhang, Cui and Gao all seem to enjoy them. Gao asks
workers to let two out so they can demonstrate to a visiting
reporter how dog breeding occurs.
</P>
<P>
   But after 10 minutes of commanding and nudging and physically
lifting of one dog on top of the other, the dog coupling was not to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just mated yesterday,'' Gao offered as an excuse for the
stud's poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Ends optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   To Zhang, cross-breeding Western and Chinese dogs is simply part
of the trend towards globalization. Just as foreign wheat has been
introduced on Chinese farms and foreign people are living all over
the country, he says, mixing foreign and Chinese dogs is a natural
result of opening up China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is getting smaller,'' he said with great
seriousness. ``Dogs can also get globally connected.''

   DATONG, China _ The way Zhang Weilin sees it, as the Chinese
palate becomes more demanding and sophisticated, it's only a matter
of time before the dog meat industry takes off. With his 90 Saint
Bernards, he's counting on being at the forefront of the
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When China opens the dog meat market and dog breeding
industry, it will gradually become like raising cows and sheep,''
said the middle-aged Zhang. ``As people spend more and their
dietary habits change, industrialization of dog breeding will not
take as long as domestication of cows and sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows there's still a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to start a new industry,'' he said. ``Breeding

<P>
   HERMOSA BEACH, Costa Rica _ From 120 feet up in a tree in the
Costa Rican rainforest, the view of the broad, blue Pacific is
breath taking.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear howler monkeys up here, jabbering as they dance
among the branches. You might even spot a bright-winged quetzal
bird, a cute sloth or a slow-moving iguana creeping along the
forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   That's if you keep still.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Chiclets Canopy Tour, keeping still is the last thing
you do.
</P>
<P>
   You're too busy gasping for breath as you plunge off the tiny
wooden platforms lashed in the high treetops. One step and whoosh,
you're zipping down a steel cable, plummeting through the branches,
securely suspended from a harness and pulley, screaming your head
off at the rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' gushed one gringo tourist, sweating from the tropical
heat and the excitement as she zipped from one high platform to
another. ``They don't have anything like this in Orlando! The
lawyers would never let them.''
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica was a pioneer in the field of eco-tourism in the
1980s, turning its lush landscape of rumbling volcanoes, high cloud
forests, rushing mountain streams, vibrant rainforests and gorgeous
deserted beaches into a nature-lover's vacation paradise.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the Central American hideaway has put action
into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can raft through raging whitewater streams, mountain
bike through dense forests, kayak along unspoiled rocky beaches,
windsurf on a stunning lake in the shadow of a smoking volcano,
explore the azure Caribbean in scuba gear, horseback ride through
the rainforest or surf some of the world's best waves.
</P>
<P>
   For more tranquil souls, there are butterfly farms, orchid
farms, teak reserves, bird- and nature-watching tours, and hikes
along the rim of a volcano. There are also canopy tours high in the
rainforest treetops that let you walk on swinging bridges or ride
in suspended tramcars instead of launching into the great void
clipped to a steel cable with a harness.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think you have to be a high-adventure junkie or an
eco-freak to enjoy a trip to Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   There's also plenty of traditional vacation fare, including
deserted beaches perfect for meandering, sparkling new golf
courses, five-star hotels, day-sailing trips to nowhere, and
casinos and discos offering plenty of night-time action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much to do here,'' said Dave Klostermann, 40, a
California transplant who now runs a horseback-riding outfit in the
Pacific coast surf town of Jaco Beach. ``You can ride horses on a
gorgeous beach, kayak, white-water raft, mountain-bike, surf or
take a canopy tour. But it's also a great place to just hang out
and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   The message appears to be getting out. Costa Rica is now Central
America's top tourism destination, luring more than 1 million
visitors in 1999 who spent nearly US$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They are drawn by the tiny country's natural beauty, the long
list of activities and Costa Rica's reputation as a peaceful,
relatively prosperous oasis in the midst of a region marred by
poverty, civil war and unstable governments.
</P>
<P>
   While its neighbors spent decades embroiled in wars and
dictatorships, Costa Rica abolished its army in 1949, investing the
money in developing the country's infrastructure and social
services.
</P>
<P>
   Visionary leaders also jumped on the conservation bandwagon
early, and have set aside nearly 25 percent of Costa Rica's
territory as nature preserves or national parks. There are more
than 75 such parks in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The country offers a staggering array of flora and fauna: more
than 9,000 species of plants, including 1,200 varieties of orchids
and 800 different types of ferns. As for animals, there are more
than 850 species of birds, while 10 percent of the world's
butterflies call Costa Rica home. There are more than 5,000
different species of grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   And it's all so close together. Wedged between Nicaragua and
Panama, with the Caribbean to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the
west, Costa Rica is only 200 miles long. You can drive almost
anywhere in the country within a day _ although be warned: the
roads are notoriously rough and can be dangerous after dark as
livestock and wild animals like to bed down on the warm pavement.
</P>
<P>
   But driving around Costa Rica is fun. Rent a car in the Central
Highlands at the capital, San Jose, and within a half-hour, you can
be hugging curves on a high mountain road, zipping past coffee
bushes planted on unbelievably steep terraces.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later and you can be standing on the rim of the Poas
Volcano, or dodging drops at the La Paz waterfall. Half an hour
more and you can be touring a butterfly farm, then hiking in the
rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   The country is actually made up of several distinct ``climate
zones,'' and the weather can vary from hot and dry to summer
monsoon to surprisingly brisk. The rainy season runs from May to
December, and the high tourist season, which is dry, lasts from
January until May.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most popular destinations are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Arenal Volcano, about five hours northwest of San Jose. This
5,000-foot peak is one of the country's most active, and regularly
throws off showers of sparks and smoke. Hiking to the rim is not
recommended, although you can hike along the slopes and see plenty
of dramatic action.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You can also windsurf on Lake Arenal in the volcano's shadow,
enjoying some of the most predictable high-wind conditions in the
world. Rental equipment is available at several resorts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Also in this area is the Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological
Preserve, which has earned a reputation as one of the most
outstanding tropical reserves in the Americas. Take a guided tour
and you may glimpse any of the hundreds of species of animals
living here, from pumas to exotic moths to 30 species of
hummingbirds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About three hours southwest of San Jose, beach-lovers flock to
Manuel Antonio National Park, a small but gorgeous park bordering
the blue Pacific. Visitors can sun on magnificent white sand
beaches, or hike through the park's rainforest, where they are
almost guaranteed to see monkeys, sloths, scarlet macaws and other
exotic wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful with your beach picnic, as the monkeys are notorious
thieves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For whitewater rafting, enthusiasts have their choice of
multi-day trips that include camping by the river or one-day
excursions that range from the relatively tranquil Rio Corobici to
wild, high-adrenaline rapids on the Rio Reventazon. More than a
half-dozen companies offer guided trips, with most departing from
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For those interested in a more relaxing time, several
companies offer daylong sailing cruises on both the Caribbean and
the Pacific. Most stop on nearby islands, and some offer gourmet
picnic lunches so that visitors can delight their palates as well
as soak up sun and sand.
</P>
<P>
   While Costa Rica has been in the news lately for a few
high-profile crimes against tourists, most veteran travelers will
recognize that it is still much safer than other Latin American
countries. Petty theft is a problem, but robberies and more serious
crimes are still rare. Visitors who take reasonable precautions
should have few problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Costa Rica really is a utopia,'' said David Reid, 56, owner of
Calypso Tours, who moved to Costa Rica 30 years ago and helped
pioneer the country's tourism offerings with his daylong cruise and
gourmet lunch adventure. ``It's such a beautiful place. There are
more people now than before, but there's still so much to do and
see.''

<P>
   ---------------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO GO: The rainy season runs from May until December. The
dry season, which lasts from January to May, is the most popular
time to visit. However, prices are higher during the dry season and
it doesn't rain all the time during the wet season, so you might
consider a summer visit. Climate ranges from cool in the central
highlands year-round to steamy along the coasts during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Many major U.S. carriers, including American,
Delta and Continental, have daily flights to San Jose, Costa Rica's
capital, from cities including Houston, Atlanta and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND: All international flights arrive in the capital,
and unless you are staying at an all-inclusive resort that offers
transportation, you'll likely need a rental car. Traffic is bad in
San Jose, but outside the capital, it thins out and driving can be
a gorgeous adventure, with curvy mountain roads and stunning views.
Watch for potholes and road repair crews, as well as livestock and
rural residents, who use the highway as a sidewalk. You will need a
4-wheel-drive vehicle during the rainy season if you plan to visit
a volcano or rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY: In San Jose, you can find everything from US$15
barebones rooms to a luxurious new five-star Marriott built in the
midst of an old coffee plantation, where rooms start at US$150 a
night. Outside the capital, there are lots of hotels with varying
price ranges in the most popular tourist destinations, including
Puerto Viejo and Limon on the Caribbean and Tamarindo, Jaco Beach
and Quepos on the Pacific side.
</P>
<P>
   SECURITY: Crime against tourists has unfortunately been
increasing in Costa Rica but the country is still relatively safe
compared to other Latin destinations. Petty theft is very common so
don't leave items unattended, even in a locked car. Take the same
common-sense precautions as in other strange places: don't walk
alone at night; don't carry and flash lots of cash; be wary of
over-friendly strangers.

   LANGUAGE: The native Costa Ricans, called ``Ticos,'' speak
Spanish, but most tourism-related businesses have English-speakers.
Even in the remote countryside, Ticos are accustomed to dealing
with tourists and you'll probably get by fine even if you don't
even know how to order a ``cerveza,'' (beer) in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ACTIVITIES: The list is nearly endless. There's whitewater
rafting, mountain-biking, hiking, bird-watching,
butterfly-watching, rainforest canopy tours, cloud forest tours,
volcanoes you can hike or drive up, windsurfing, surfing, scuba
diving, beach-combing, golf, tennis, sailing and sport-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing to do is decide which activities you want to try
and build a vacation around them. You could start in San Jose, do a
day-trip to whitewater raft, then rent a car and drive to the
Pacific coast for some beachtime and a tour of a rainforest. Then
move on to the Arenal Volcano and the Monteverde Cloud Forest
Preserve.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The men who wrote the Constitution faced a choice: Either
establish a church, as some of the colonies had done, or provide
for religious toleration. They chose the way of nonestablishment.
This seemed a good choice, and it worked well throughout most of
the 19th century and well into the 20th.
</P>
<P>
   True, a mild kind of civil religion was accepted. Enlightenment
politicians in America, some of whom were believers, thought
religion useful for the support of the Republic. Early documents of
the new country emphasized strong religious commitment: for
example, the Declaration of Independence and Washington's Inaugural
Address.
</P>
<P>
   But the God of early American politics was somewhat impersonal
and detached, described in rather general terms as ``the Creator,''
``the Invisible,'' ``the Almighty Being.''
</P>
<P>
   With time, relationships between God and American politicians
became more personal, as manifest in the exchange of endorsements _
the politician usually endorsing the Divine and his works and
claiming a responsive endorsement of the politician by the
divinity. Lincoln's second inaugural address, by one count, had 14
references to God and four quotations from the scriptures. (Sen.
Joe Lieberman has been criticized for a speech in Nashville, after
he was named Al Gore's running mate, in which he mentioned God 13
times. But he still falls short of the Lincoln standard.)
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 100 years later, President Lyndon Johnson,
speaking about the civil rights law of 1965, declared, ``It is
rather our duty to do his Divine Will. But I cannot help believing
that he truly understands and that he really favors the undertaking
that we begin here tonight.'' Johnson, like Lincoln, kept the line
between church and state reasonably clear, if not the line between
religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The significant blending of the latter two took place in Dwight
Eisenhower's campaigns and administrations. The first campaign was
presented under the banner of a crusade, although its cross was a
little vague. One of the crusaders, a member of Congress, charged
that the previous administration had tried to ``make a settlement
with the devil, communism, instead of spurning him as Christ did
when tempted.'' The inaugural parade of 1953 even featured what was
called ``God's float,'' a late entry. And the pledge of allegiance
to the flag was changed during the administration to include the
words, ``under God.'' Finally, the postmaster general issued a
stamp bearing the motto, ``In God We Trust,'' and the same slogan
was prescribed for U.S. money, scarcely a vote of confidence in the
secretary of the treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The John Kennedy campaign and administration had a different
religious thrust. They were more detached and impersonal. Whereas
Ike had included, as part of the inaugural program, a prayer he
himself had composed, the Kennedy inaugural was sustained by the
prayers of the Catholic Archbishop (later Cardinal) Richard
Cushing; Archbishop Iakovos of the Greek Orthodox Church; John
Barclay, a Protestant minister; and Rabbi Nelson Glueck. Whereas,
as William Miller wrote in his book ``Piety along the Potomac,''
Eisenhower had a vague religion strongly held to, Kennedy had a
strong religion vaguely held to.
</P>
<P>
   The fusion of religion and politics, or of morality and
politics, proceeded under President Richard Nixon. He did not go
quite as far as to say that the morality of the prince is the
morality of the people, but he did say that the president was the
moral leader and spokesman of the people.
</P>
<P>
   President Gerald Ford, when he pardoned Nixon, was more
restrained. He said that he was acting as God's humble servant.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, presidents and presidential candidates have
claimed more direct and personal relationships. Many claim to have
been ``reborn,'' including Jimmy Carter, John Anderson and, in
milder form, Ronald Reagan. Carter was most outspoken, reporting
that he prayed many times a day. Pat Robertson, as a candidate for
president, said that he spoke directly to God but that he did not
use those communications in his campaign. Anderson hinted that God
was his ultimate campaign manager. (He later enlisted the public
relations expert David Garth as a supplement.)
</P>
<P>
   And in 2000 all manner of candidates have been calling God down
for campaign help.
</P>
<P>
   When Vice President Al Gore called Lieberman to select him as
his running mate, we are told the two men shared a prayer. And at
the Democratic ticket's debut in Nashville, God was mentioned
often.
</P>
<P>
   During the primary campaign, Gov. George W. Bush was asked his
favorite philosopher, thinker or historic figure. He named Jesus.
(To his credit, Sen. John McCain picked Theodore Roosevelt.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps God does not object to political appropriation. But, in
some sense, such tactics mock God. They also muddle politics.
</P>
<P>
   And scripture warns that God is not to be mocked. Leave God in
his heaven (or the human heart, when he is present there). Let the
public square be filled with citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The president is NOT the moral leader of his people, no matter
how often he prays or mentions God's name. He was never intended to
be THE moral leader, and it is unhealthy when candidates for
president present themselves or are regarded in this way,
especially when they think they have a pipeline to God.
</P>
<P>
   The president is the premier political leader _ one hopes with
some sense of morality. But moral leadership, in a pluralistic
society, is the work of many. It is not invested in one person, or
even one system of belief. Moreover, morality, compassion, decency
and good manners are not the province merely of religious (or
``deeply religious'') people. There may be more than a few secular
humanists out there who are good neighbors and better citizens.
</P>
<P>
   There may even still be a few Christians, Jews, Buddhists or
Moslems who wish to purify their souls, and work out their
redemptions, in private. Religious belief, privately held, may well
be good for democracy, as John Adams felt. Its politicization is
not.
</P>
<P>
   Religifying politics tempts politicians to messianic delusion.
And politicizing religion cheapens and corrupts the spirit. If we
return to the wisdom of the founders on this point, excessive
public expressions of religious piety will be regarded with
suspicion. Our motto should be: ``By their DEEDS shall we know
them.''
</P>

author, most recently, of ``An American Bestiary.'' Keith C. Burris
is editorial page editor of the Journal Inquirer in Manchester,
Conn.)

CHOOSING SPAM OVER CENSORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've pretty much made my peace with spam _ those annoying
unwanted e-mails from folks trying to sell you something. The stuff
just doesn't bother me as much as it used to, even though I get
more of it than ever.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned to chuckle at messages that offer me the chance to
retire rich at age 35 _ eight years too late, guys. FedEx me a time
machine and try again. Meanwhile, I'll just delete this crapola
with the flick of a finger . . . there! That wasn't too bad. And
maybe the next batch will be even sillier.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody's as even-tempered as I am, though. One
Californian's outrage over spam has launched him on a crusade
that's now being waged in a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good chance you've never heard of Mail Abuse
Prevention System LLC (MAPS) of Redwood City, Calif., even if
you're affected by its actions. MAPS was founded in 1997 by Paul
Vixie, a man who hates unsolicited e-mail. He set up a list of
Internet addresses that originated the offending messages. Then he
automatically blocked all mail from these sources.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's Internet service providers liked the idea, and
asked to use Vixie's system, which he called the Realtime Blackhole
List (RBL). This led to the foundation of MAPS, a nonprofit
organization that has sworn eternal enmity to spam in all its
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Today, MAPS estimates that about 20,000 Internet users and
service providers rely on the Blackhole List to block spam. This
includes some of the biggest outfits in the business, such as
Microsoft Corp.'s free e-mail service Hotmail. And yet, MAPS is
still run by a handful of people, who decide for themselves what
counts as spam. If you offend their sensibilities, you go on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   And what does it take to offend them? A handful of complaints.
Three will do.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many people griped to MAPS about getting e-mail from
Harris Interactive Inc., known for its Harris Poll public opinion
surveys. Harris polls over the Internet, sending questions to
people randomly selected from a list of 6.6 million e-mail
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   A number of sites provide their membership lists to Harris.
Users are warned about this during the signup process, and can
choose to opt out of the Harris list. But it'd be easy not to
notice the warning. Next thing you know, you're getting unexpected
questions about how you plan to vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   That must have happened to the unlucky trio who complained to
MAPS, which responded by blackholing Harris. Now millions of e-mail
recipients, including those who really do want to be polled, no
longer can receive the questionnaires. That's because these people
use service providers that subscribe to the RBL, which deletes mail
from Harris.
</P>
<P>
   My ISP doesn't subscribe to the list; I know because I get
Harris Poll e-mails. I've never responded to them, but I don't mind
getting them. And I'm not sure I want some guy in California
denying them to me, or to millions of others who don't even realize
their mail's being blocked.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Harris has filed a federal lawsuit against MAPS
and a number of Internet providers who use it. ``They have too much
power, and they apply it arbitrarily,'' says Harris spokesman Dan
Hucko. ``They're basically acting as censors, and that's just
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The MAPS people say there's no First Amendment right to send
unwanted e-mail. MAPS and the ISPs own their e-mail servers, and
can choose which messages to accept or reject. ``Being on the RBL
just means I think you're friendly or neutral to spam, and I don't
choose to exchange packets with you,'' says the list's manager,
Kelly Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   To get back into Thompson's good graces, Harris must send a
confirmation e-mail to every new person it signs up, and must send
such mail to the 6.6 million members it already has. These are good
ideas, and Hucko says that Harris is considering them.
</P>
<P>
   It may have no choice. The judge recently refused to issue a
restraining order against MAPS, and there's much merit to the
organization's case. Surely ISPs are entitled to reject some kinds
of incoming mail. On the other hand, should the final say reside in
the hands of a few self-appointed Web cops?
</P>
<P>
   Though I've grown used to spam, I wouldn't miss it if it went
away. That could happen under a proposed federal law that recently
passed the US House by an almost-unanimous vote. Rather than ban
spam, the law would make it easy for consumers to sue the spammers.
A few fat financial judgments against these clowns would be more
effective than MAPS's vigilante tactics, and not nearly as creepy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Linux is not pretty _ at least not in its
natural state. But lately the upstart operating system has been
getting a facelift, and Nat Friedman likes the look of it.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman and his colleagues at Helix Code Inc. are performing
the surgery. Their Helix Gnome software masks the drab, complex
text interface of Linux behind rich and colorful images that let
users control Linux by clicking a mouse, just as they do with
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-million people have already downloaded Helix Gnome
from the company Web site since it was released on the Internet in
March. Among the small but influential clique that runs Linux
software on their personal computers, Helix Gnome is on its way to
being the gold standard.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not bringing in any gold. Like Linux itself, Helix
Gnome is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software itself is a commodity,'' Friedman says. ``We hope
to make no money off the software.''
</P>
<P>
   As with other Linux firms, Helix Gnome expects to get users
hooked on a variety of add-on services to bring in some bucks.
Quite a lot of bucks, says Will Roseman, cochairman of Linux Global
Partners, a New York venture capital firm that has invested $2.2
million in Helix Code. Roseman predicts quarterly earnings in the
$30 million range by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new about any of this technology,'' says
Friedman with refreshing candor. After all, Gnome's been around for
a couple of years, the brainchild of a team of programmers led by
Mexican software designer Miguel de Icaza. Nor is Gnome the only
effort to create a user-friendly interface for Linux. Its
best-known rival is the KDE Project, launched by programmer
Matthias Ettrich in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   De Icaza began Gnome in 1997, largely because the KDE Project
originally contained some ``closed'' code that belonged to a
commercial software company. This code has since been removed, but
the change came too late for de Icaza.
</P>
<P>
   A disciple of the Free Software Foundation in Cambridge, de
Icaza rejected on principle the idea of giving any commercial firm
control over the contents of a Linux system. All the code, he
believed, should be ``open,'' freely available in its raw form for
anyone to modify. This was the guiding principle of the Free
Software Foundation's GNU project to create open software programs.
(GNU stood for GNU's Not Unix). De Icaza made his new interface
part of the GNU project, and named it the GNU Network Object Model
Environment, or Gnome.
</P>
<P>
   De Icaza's devotion to open software doesn't mean he's opposed
to making money. He even interviewed for a job at Microsoft Corp.,
when MIT computer science student Friedman was working there as a
summer intern. De Icaza didn't get the Microsoft job, but he and
Friedman hit it off, and decided to found a company to improve upon
and commercialize Gnome.
</P>
<P>
   Helix Code was incorporated in October, and began by staffing up
with top Linux coders. ``We knew everyone in the Gnome community,''
Friedman says. ``So recruiting and hiring for us was just a game .
. . we hired the best developers from a community of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   The team set to work, adding a number of sophisticated new
applications to the basic Gnome interface. One of them, Evolution,
may raise a few eyebrows at Microsoft headquarters. It's a dead
ringer for Microsoft's popular Outlook personal information manager
_ only it's free.
</P>
<P>
   Another top priority at Helix Code is built-in software that
will connect a user to the company's Internet servers. That way, a
user can automatically download bug fixes, code updates, new
features, and more.
</P>
<P>
   A whole lot more, if Friedman gets his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The updater for us is sort of the seed for the beginning of
service offerings,'' he says. Once you get people regularly logging
in to a Helix Code server for upgrades, you get regular
opportunities to sell them stuff.
</P>
<P>
   How about an add-on that lets you order airline tickets from
inside your Evolution program, with arrival and departure times
automatically loaded into your schedule?
</P>
<P>
   Or you could dump your new digital photos onto your hard drive,
click a button, and have the pictures relayed to a photo processing
firm that would print them on glossy paper and mail them to
Grandma.
</P>
<P>
   You could also have the server send you a message the next time
Courtney Love is playing in town. The concert date would
automatically appear in your schedule. Friedman figures people
might pay $5 a month for such a service.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible revenue stream could flow from customized
versions of Helix Gnome, tailored to the needs of specific
businesses. And of course, there's the model of Linux firms like
Red Hat, which make their money by providing service and support
for users.
</P>
<P>
   All these profit options depend on getting Helix Gnome on as
many Linux desktops as possible. The company got good news on that
front at last week's LinuxWorld trade show in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the nation's top computer makers, including Compaq
Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM Corp., and Sun
Microsystems Inc., have joined with Helix Code in a new consortium
to support continuing development of Gnome. The deal doesn't mean
these companies have specifically endorsed Helix Gnome, but it
furthers the goal of making Gnome the standard user interface for
Linux computers.
</P>
<P>
   And not just Linux. Sun Microsystems plans to use Gnome on its
Unix-based computers, the most popular Unix machines in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's dirt cheap and relatively easy to switch from standard
Gnome to Helix Gnome. So expanding the universe of Gnome users is a
boost for Helix Code's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Helix Gnome is a hit with the Linux cognoscenti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every conference I go to, people are using it,'' boasts
Friedman. ``So there's a kind of immortality there.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, immortality is more fun when there's money in it.

 Computing Q&AMP;A: E-Books Aren't Quite Ready to Make a Move 
 &HT;     By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I've been hearing a lot about e-books. Exactly what are they,
anyway? Do I need special hardware or software to read them, and
what makes them different from any other document I can view on my
PC?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It's a good thing I don't charge by the question or you would be
in trouble. E-books _ or electronic books _ are actual books, like
novels, textbooks and classics, that have been digitized and
formatted in a way that makes them appear on a computer screen
exactly as they do in print. You can read e-books on a PC, but the
goal is to put them on portable devices like specially designed
handheld readers or personal digital assistants, so you can read
them while you are on a bus, train or plane.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, e-books are in their infancy. The primary software
formats for them are the Microsoft Reader and the Glassbook Reader.
Both are free downloads _ from www.microsoft.com/reader and
www.glassbook.com _ that you can load onto your PC or notebook
computer. The Microsoft reader also comes loaded on new Pocket PC
handheld computers from companies including Hewlett-Packard and
Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   A few e-book devices also are available, including the $600
SoftBook Reader from SoftBook Press and the $269 Rocket eBook from
NuvoMedia.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more titles are available for the Microsoft Reader than
for other formats. But it probably won't be long before most
e-books are released in all available formats. Right now, expect to
pay about the same price for an e-book that you would for a
discounted regular book.
</P>
<P>
   For a lot more information on e-books, go to
www.barnesandnoble.com or to www.ipublish.com.

   &QL; 
Cleaning Up Temp Files
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I have collected about 48 megabytes of temporary files on my
hard drive. Is it safe to delete them?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: In general, the answer is yes. Any file ending in ``.tmp'' is a
temporary file that your computer can live without very nicely.
Many programs create temporary files while you work.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, temporary files are automatically deleted
when you close a program or reboot your PC, but because it isn't a
perfect world, you will always have some temp files hanging around.
The first place to look for temporary files is in the TEMP folder
inside the Windows folder. You can also use the Find function in
the Windows Start menu to search for ``.tmp,'' which will reveal
the location of all your temp files.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, don't confuse temporary system files with
``temporary Internet files'' that Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web
browser stores on your disk. Those are useful, because they make it
possible to load Web pages faster. Netscape also uses such files,
but refers to them as ``cache'' files.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Loading MSN Messenger
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: Do you need an Internet account with MSN to use its Messenger
service? If you do not have to be a subscriber, how do you go about
getting MSN Messenger?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Internet message services like MSN Messenger and America
Online's Instant Messenger are free to anyone, not just people who
get their Internet access via MSN and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, all you have to do is sign up online at
www.msn.com or www.aol.com, and download a small software program
if it isn't already on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   You should bear in mind that MSN Messenger users can't
communicate with AOL Instant Messenger users. The two companies
hate each other too much to cooperate. So you may have to use both
services to keep in touch with all your friends.
</P>
<P>
   NICE WORDS FOR ATHOME: During the past couple of years, I have
taken a shot or two at AtHome, mostly because of the slow service I
have received when my Internet cable went down. Recently, however,
I had a really good experience. After rebuilding a PC, I called
AtHome for some help configuring the service with a new internal
network card. I got a tech support fellow on the phone right away,

   TIP OF THE WEEK: If you find yourself printing a lot of stuff _
draft versions of documents, notes or information from the
Internet, for example _ don't waste your money on expensive typing
paper. Instead, buy a box of copy machine or multi-use paper. For
less than $20, you should be able to get 10 reams _ that's 5,000
sheets.

ECONOMIC SCENE: COMPETITION IN ONLINE MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is supposed to be a consumer paradise, with
cutthroat pricing creating bountiful bargains for surfing shoppers.
And so far the Internet has been a great place to shop. A survey by
two MIT professors, Erik Brynjolfsson and Michael Smith, found that
prices on the Internet are 9 to 16 percent lower than in retail
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But there is reason to believe that the bargains will not last.
For the last few years, Internet retailers have engaged in
``penetration pricing,'' setting low prices to make a big splash in
new markets. But recently, Internet retailers appear to be nudging
up prices, so as to reduce the burn rate and improve the bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   While online retail selling matures, online wholesale markets
are heating up as businesses rush to set up online exchanges to cut
supply costs and, incidentally, to create a more competitive
environment for their suppliers. Proponents of online exchanges and
auctions claim cost savings of 10 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What does economics have to say about these rosy scenarios? Will
online markets really result in lower prices in the long run? The
answer is somewhat ambiguous: there are good reasons why prices
should go down, but there are also some good reasons why they might
go up.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet lowers the cost of the search. It is a lot easier
to click on a hyperlink than it is to drive to the store, or for
that matter, to make a phone call or send a fax. This means buyers
can shop around for a low price. High-priced sellers have either to
meet the competition or go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   But there are more subtle effects. It is true that buyers find
it easier to discover what the sellers are charging, but each
seller also finds it easier to discover what other sellers are
charging. It there are lots of competing sellers, this will
probably tend to push down prices even more rapidly. But if there
are only a few sellers, low-cost information about what they are
charging could, perversely, lead to higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because when price information is widely available, it
becomes easier for suppliers to coordinate their pricing, with each
seller agreeing, implicitly or explicitly, to charge a high price
so as to avoid ``ruinous competition.''
</P>
<P>
   A classic example is the infamous Joint Executive Committee set
up by the major American railroads in the 1880s. The committee,
actually a cartel, predated the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and
was, at the time, perfectly legal. Newspapers of the day reported
on meetings and statements from the committee, just as newspapers
today report on meetings of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   The primary role of the committee was to collect information and
publish weekly accounts of shipments by the individual railroads.
The committee also collected data on prices charged, but this was
notoriously unreliable since committee members tended to cheat on
the cartel prices by making secret agreements with shippers to
shave prices in exchange for traffic.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to recognize that price cutting by the railroads
had to be secret _ public cuts were counterproductive because they
just precipitated price wars. But imagine what would happen if the
railroad cartel had used a public Internet exchange. Each railroad
could then see the prices charged by the others and attempts to
shave prices could be quickly countered, making the cartel less
vulnerable to price wars.
</P>
<P>
   Sound far-fetched? Look at the way airline prices are posted
online today: each airline announces its prices, along with the
associated terms and conditions, allowing competitors to scrutinize
one another's offerings. In the late 1980s, the airlines used
online reservation systems to signal price changes to one another.
One airline would post a price increase at 2 a.m. on Monday. If the
competition followed, the change would stick. If the competition
did not respond, the airline would roll its price back by 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Justice Department sued several large airlines,
requiring them to cease such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Online merchants are clearly monitoring one another's prices
today. Go to http://www.dealtime.com and type in the name of a
well-known book. Odds are the the best prices are within a few
cents of one another. This is not just chance.
</P>
<P>
   The usual story of competition has an implicit timing assumption
that buyers move faster than sellers. If a seller cuts its price,
it is rewarded by a flood of buyers before the other sellers can
respond. But if the sellers move faster than the buyers, they can
match one another's price cuts immediately, damping the rewards of
price cutting. Similarly, if a seller raises a price and all other
sellers quickly match it, the seller will not lose customers. When
sellers move faster than buyers, prices tend to drift upward.
</P>
<P>
   If there are lots of competitors, this effect is swamped by the
usual dynamics of competition. The problem is that the cost
structure of online retailing suggests that there are likely to be
only a few big companies in the long run, making implicit collusion
more likely. When Toys ``R'' Us and Amazon.com announced a joint
venture a few weeks ago, Toby Lenk, chief executive of eToys said:
``This is great news for us. Last year we had half a dozen
competitors. Now our two remaining competitors are merging into
one.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are only a few online retail vendors, the real
competition they face will not be from one another, but will be
from offline substitutes _ traditional retailers. As long as this
market remains fragmented, full-fledged retail collusion is
unlikely. Prices will not be as low as they were in the heady days
of penetration pricing, but they will have to be attractive enough
to compete with alternative retail channels.
</P>
<P>
   What about the online business-to-business exchanges? If an
exchange operates in a wholesale market where there are few buyers
and many sellers, the extra flow of price information is likely to
work for the benefit of the buyers, pushing down prices. But in
exchanges in which there are few sellers and many buyers, the
availability of timely price information may well have the opposite
effect, pushing up prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is now trying to set standards of
behavior for online exchanges. The objective is to make sure that
such exchanges foster competition rather than dampen it.

 &HT;    GENDER IMBALANCE HURTS THE TECH INDUSTRY, FEMALE EXECS SAY
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. _ Despite the astonishing growth of high-paying
jobs in the tech world, the number of young women entering
computer-related careers is small _ and shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   While women now account for slightly more than half of U.S.
Internet users, they are barely visible in the ranks of computer
scientists, engineers and programmers.
</P>
<P>
   But does it matter to the economy, or to society, if women sit
out the tech revolution? Would anything be different if women held
half of the tech jobs available?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes'' was the emphatic answer from a pair of the tech word's
leading female executives, who last week joined a sea of white guys
at the Aspen Summit, an annual conference on the digital revolution
sponsored by the Progress &AMP; Freedom Foundation, a non-profit
research group.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that if women played a larger role in the
technology-driven sector of the economy, it would be much
healthier, with more stable companies, fewer labor shortages, lower
costs and higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``My political side says women are no different (from men), but
they are,'' said Esther Dyson, chair of the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers, a new international agency charged
with setting policy for the Internet's infrastructure. ``Whether
it's nature or nurture, they have different concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   And because of their different perspectives, women would help
stabilize an industry that has become too chaotic, Dyson said. For
example, she said, one of the top concerns of many young male
techies is to become a chief executive officer as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at how this industry works right now, there are
too many companies where some guy just decided he wanted to be CEO,
so he went out and did something that was redundant,'' she said,
referring to the wild proliferation of dot-com businesses in the
late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of those me-too companies are collapsing, dragging
down the tech stock market and vaporizing capital. ``It's great to
see the outpouring of entrepreneurship, but at the same time, there
is this arrogance that says 'I'm going to do it,' as opposed to
saying, ``Gee, someone is already doing it _ let me help them do it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   A more female-influenced industry also might be better at
understanding consumers' needs, said Julie Shimer, a vice president
for 3Com Corp. and general manager of its consumer business. ``The
engineering pressure right now is very technology-gee-whiz focused,
but there's not much on 'Why would I want to do this? How would I
use it responsibly?','' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If half of all engineers were female, ``I think technology would
be easier to understand, and it would be targeted more at women and
children,'' Shimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson said ``friendlier'' products also could reduce business
costs because companies ``might spend less money on tech support,''
she said, referring to the legions of workers who answer customers'
questions about puzzling products and services.
</P>
<P>
   But female perspectives are lacking because, outside of the
National Football League, few enterprises are as male-dominated as
the tech world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commerce Department estimates that while women
represent 51 percent of the population, they make up only 26
percent of the computer scientists and 9 percent of the engineers
working today.
</P>
<P>
   But even those ranks soon will thin as the pipeline of female
tech majors dries up. Only about 25 percent of computer science
bachelor's degrees will go to young women this year, down from 37
percent at the peak in 1984, according to the American Association
of University Women (AAUW). And at the high school level, girls
represent only 17 percent of the computer science ``advanced
placement'' test takers.
</P>
<P>
   While women's participation in computer science has been
decreasing, many girls are flocking to other fields that require
intensive study of math and science. For example, women now make up
about 40 percent of students pursuing medical degrees and master's
degrees in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, women are swarming over U.S. campuses, where they now
outnumber males 56 percent to 44 percent, according to the U.S.
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   So why are they shunning the tech world?
</P>
<P>
   An AAUW study found that girls regard computer-related jobs as
``boring'' and ``lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson said that perception is fostered by the entertainment
media, which tend to use ``geeky guys'' to portray lonely computer
workers. ``Girls get a wrong message,'' Dyson said. ``Programmers
often work together and trade ideas. It's some of the more
interesting work because they are solving problems. You're not
doing the same thing again and again. It's very creative.''
</P>
<P>
   The AAUW study found that girls also say teachers make computers
seem boring by focusing on the technical properties of hardware,
rather than on innovative uses of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the AAUW study showed girls are turned off by idea of
working extremely long hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the computer industry, ``some people do work a lot,'' Dyson
said. ``But I think that, frankly if you had more women in it,
you'd have more people to hire and nobody would need to work quite
so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if more young women were entering tech fields, the
industry would be better able to restrain its runaway labor costs.
A survey of nearly 5,000 college students last spring found that of
those planning to graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer
science or engineering, 51 percent expect a starting salary offer
of between $51,000 and $70,000 a year, according to CollegeHire, an
Austin, Texas-based high-tech recruiting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing solely on paying higher salaries, tech
executives would do well to concentrate on making the workplace
friendlier to people who want to maintain a home life, Dyson said.
Such changes would also help the industry attract more young men,
who also have started avoiding computer-related fields.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of U.S. undergraduates earning computer and
information science degrees declined from a high of 41,889 in 1986
to just 24,768 in 1997. The Information Technology Association of
America says technology-driven companies have about 800,000 jobs
now open or projected to be open through the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   For a quick fix to the labor shortage, the industry has been
hammering Congress to nearly double the current cap of 115,000 on
the visas that allow high-skilled foreigners to work here for up to
six years.
</P>
<P>
   But long-term, a better solution would be to make the computer
lab feel less like a stay-up-all-night fraternity house. Providing
more humane working hours, child-care help and vacation time would
attract far more people, both male and female, to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're hot and you're growing, you don't need to do that,''
Dyson said of the tech industry of the 1990s. ``But when you lose
your sex appeal, you need to start treating people right.''

JUKE JOINTS JUMP WITH HIGH-TECH TUNES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You're at your favorite bar. You amble up to the
new Internet-connected jukebox and punch up your favorite tune. In
moments, the jukebox downloads the song, plays it and asks if you
want to buy the CD.
</P>
<P>
   Then you notice the jukebox displaying the live video feed of an
attractive patron sitting in a bar 3,000 miles away. In seconds,
you've e-mailed a hopeful message: ``Can I buy you a song and a
drink?''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this is not your father's jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the bubble-tubed, Art Deco mechanical machines that
have survived for a century as an American music icon are about to
be transformed by the Internet music revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Little-known startups such as Ecast Inc. of San Francisco as
well as long-established jukeboxmaker Wurlitzer are rolling out
online, computer-powered digital jukeboxes that they hope will
supplant an estimated 250,000 machines that spin vinyl 45 rpm
records or plastic CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the new ``downloadable'' jukeboxes promise a
virtually limitless selection of songs _ nearly enough to make a
Napster junkie happy _ but analysts say it is a concept that could
also make e-commerce transactions like buying a CD palatable for
the millions of people who don't use computers at home or work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is kind of a `duh' idea,'' said Edward Bevilacqua,
chief executive of Fun e-Business Inc., a San Diego County company
that designed the technology inside a new computerized jukebox that
Wurlitzer Jukebox Co. of Chicago plans to roll out later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jukebox is a multigenerational product that people feel
good about,'' Bevilacqua said.
</P>
<P>
   A deal that Ecast announced earlier this week is the biggest
signal to date that digital music is beginning to transform the
$2-billion-a-year jukebox industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe International Inc., the world's biggest manufacturer of
jukeboxes, said it will build new downloadable jukeboxes using
Ecast's Internet technology, called the Siren Entertainment System.
</P>
<P>
   The Rowe-Ecast jukeboxes will be able to tap into a library of
thousands of songs from major and independent record labels. Each
box can store up to 400 discs on a local hard drive. For payment,
the boxes will also accept credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Because Rowe International of Grand Rapids, Mich., claims about
70 percent of the North American jukebox market, its alliance with
Ecast will get the attention of traditional jukebox operators who
historically have been skeptical about switching to new technology,
said Marcus Webb, editor of the industry publication RePlay
Magazine, based in Tarzana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leading jukebox factory has made this very close alliance
with a firm making downloading-music technology,'' said Webb, who
has followed the jukebox industry for 15 years. ``That is going to
send a really big signal to the operators who buy these
jukeboxes.''
</P>
<P>
   One company, TouchTunes Music Corp. of Montreal, has already
leased about 2,000 of its Genesis digital jukeboxes around the
country. The TouchTunes jukebox can store 750 downloaded songs.
</P>
<P>
   According to jukebox historians, the first commercial
``coin-operated phonograph'' made its premiere on Nov. 23, 1889, in
San Francisco's Palais Royal restaurant on Sutter Street. Inventor
Louis Glass affixed a coin slot to an Edison gramophone, which
played sound for two minutes on a nickel.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 20th century, jukeboxes became cabinets that played
songs from a small collection of vinyl records stored inside. For
example, the first Wurlitzer jukebox, the Debutante, which
premiered in 1933, had 10 songs. The company now has a model that
holds 120 CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Wurlitzer plans to roll out a model that looks
like an old-fashioned rainbow-colored jukebox on the outside but
replaces the mechanical CD or record changer on the inside with an
off-the-shelf computer.
</P>
<P>
   The jukebox can store 10,000 songs in digital form on a hard
drive and, through a high-speed DSL connection, access and download
music from a virtual library of 200,000 songs, using Liquid Audio
Inc.'s digital audio format.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, mechanical jukeboxes have to be manually
updated to add the latest top hits. That means jukebox distributors
typically have to go to each unit and replace the 100 CDs with new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem you have with CD jukeboxes is that only
one to three songs out of 12 (on a CD) are being played by the
jukebox patron,'' said Joe Pankus, chief executive officer of
Wurlitzer USA.
</P>
<P>
   However, with Internet-connected jukeboxes, ``you have all the
hits,'' Pankus said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Ecast chief executive and founder Mouli Cohen said his system
also has the ability to link to a site that sells CDs. And the
system is designed to deliver other forms of entertainment, like
video games, film and cartoons. Cohen also envisions a time when
the jukeboxes could be used to buy and print concert or sports
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   And imagine a day, Cohen said, when a jukebox network includes
screens that show people in other taverns around the country. ``If
you're in a bar in San Francisco and see someone in New York,'' he
said, ``I can buy him or her a drink or a song from the location
where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   While that scenario is still too futuristic, the Ecast jukeboxes
are becoming a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Ecast has demonstration models set up in about 50 U.S.
locations, such as Kennedy's Irish Pub Curry House on Columbus
Avenue in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The company earlier this year signed a deal with England's
Leisure Link Group Ltd., the world's biggest electronic amusement
game operator, to deploy Ecast technology in about 20,000
Leisure-made jukeboxes in the United Kingdom during the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the downloadable jukeboxes will catch on
quickly. According to a report by Dataquest analyst Van Baker, the
Ecast business model ``is so compelling at all levels of the supply
chain that it is bound to have a profound impact on the traditional
jukebox industry. ... This is clearly a potential change-or-die
scenario for the operators.''
</P>
<P>
   That could bring sweet music to an industry that has been slowly
shrinking due to competition from the new forms of digital
entertainment, from video games to the home computer.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that jukeboxes remain a staple in bars but
practically disappeared since the late 1980s from restaurants, said
Jim Hayes, chairman of the jukebox committee for the Amusement &AMP;
Music Operators Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to find them in other places besides bars, like ice
cream parlors and pizza places,'' Hayes said. Downloadable
jukeboxes ``gives our industry a chance to gain back some market
share in some of the venues we used to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Rufus Connell, an analyst with Frost &AMP; Sullivan, a San Jose
company that tracks Web-connected kiosks, said music will only be
the first step toward introducing non-Web-savvy consumers to
Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, retailers may be able to use the jukebox
to sell products to restaurant customers who are playing music and
waiting for their food to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of providing music through an Internet jukebox is a
neat idea,'' Connell said. ``This is a great way to provide revenue
streams.''
</P>
<P>
   But Webb, the editor at RePlay, said persuading the thousands of
bar and restaurant owners to install downloadable jukeboxes could
be a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same group that waited until 10 years after CDs were
introduced _ and five years after CDs had replaced vinyl albums as
the dominant music media _ to start replacing the old vinyl-playing
jukeboxes with ones that played CDs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a new, but still-unreleased jukebox industry survey by
the University of New Orleans shows 19.6 percent of the commercial
jukeboxes still in use play vinyl 45 rpm records.
</P>
<P>
   And although 41 percent say downloadable jukeboxes will
eventually replace the old technology, 43 percent say the new
machines will have no effect, according to the survey commissioned
by the amusement operators association.
</P>
<P>
   ``American operators are coming to the reluctant conclusion that
the technology that they were 10 years behind the rest of the
country in embracing _ CDs _ may eventually have to be replaced by
downloading music,'' Webb said. ``But they're not eager to do it.''

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: You would do a great service to your readers by

peoples' heads, we did a much better job. Bet you thought there
really was a guy named Steve Jobs, didn't you? Ha! Pure fiction. I
mean, really, starting an industry in a garage? Get real!
</P>
<P>
   The claptrap you sent me is so full of holes it looks like my
laundry. You didn't really need me to tell you this is completely
bogus, did you? You did? Now I'm really depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Look, just because something is in writing and sounds
quasi-possible doesn't mean you should automatically accept it as
gospel. Hmmm. That's sort of how this column is supposed to work.
Let's try a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   When you get spam like this, please, please, please don't
forward it until you research it. The first thing I did was go to
Yahoo! and search for ``Bill 602P.'' The first hit I got was to the
Urban Legends Archive (www.urbanlegends.com). Does that give you a
clue about your e-mail tax?
</P>
<P>
   The site does a good job of picking the hoax apart, point by
point, but it's nothing you couldn't have found out for yourself.
The biggest giveaway is the name of the bill, 602P. Sure, most of
us slept through high-school civics, but it's pretty common
knowledge that House resolutions begin with ``H.R.'' A more
experienced hoax-meister would have called it H.R. 4602.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is no Tony Schnell in Congress, as a quick trip to
www.house.gov would have shown. Third, there are other people,
addresses and firms mentioned in the full letter that don't exist
either.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that didn't stop Congress from reacting to the
nonexistent bill. Last May, Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., actually
drafted legislation to block any such plan. And Rep. Michael G.
Oxley, R-Ohio, vice chairman of the Commerce Committee's
Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection,
has posted a strongly worded denial on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that denial raises other questions. Is Oxley part
of the hoax? You probably didn't know this, but his ``state'' is
just another urban myth, one of the nation's longest-running
practical jokes. In 1803, fun-loving President Thomas Jefferson
casually mentioned to a few gullible reporters that a 17th state
carved from American Indian territory would be added to the Union.
</P>
<P>
   The nonexistent ``state'' was christened Ohio. It was even given
electoral votes. To this day, anyone who professes to be from
somewhere in Ohio or to have seen the mythical Cincinnati Reds and
Cleveland Browns is in on the joke.
</P>
<P>
   It's true! You read it here! Tell everyone you know!
</P>
<P>
   (What if ``Dr. Emilio Bombay'' is a hoax, too? Wouldn't those
things he said that were untrue be true then? Now we're all
confused. If you can clear this up, write to
drbombay(at)star-telegram.com (snail-mail: Fort Worth

HARCOURT HIGHER EDUCATION LAUNCHES CYBERSPACE U. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERRY ACKERMAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are no ivy-covered walls, no bell towers, no high-tech
science labs. Indeed, there are no classrooms, and the full-time
academic staff numbers only nine.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there is the computer, which is king.
</P>
<P>
   This is Massachusetts' newest degree-granting college, named
Harcourt Higher Education. It's a for-profit subsidiary of Harcourt
General Inc. of Newton, a publishing conglomerate that had $2.1
billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harcourt Higher Education maintains offices in Boston,
for most purposes it exists only in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Its students will lead ``virtual'' lives _ applying for
admission, attending classes, going to the library, taking tests,
and engaging in classroom debate _ entirely online.
</P>
<P>
   When they graduate, that will happen online, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uniqueness of what we offer is that everything is
online,'' said Robert V. Antonucci, who quit as state education
commissioner in 1998 to oversee development of Harcourt Higher
Education as the Northeast's first for-profit Internet-based
provider of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education voted to
license the result of this work, a move that authorizes the online
school to grant associate's and bachelor's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Classes begin in November, with students enrolling in groups
that will take course ``modules'' that last six or 12 weeks,
keeping in touch with professors and each other by e-mail and
through chat-room discussions. The first catalog will carry about
30 courses; by June, there will be about 120.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 US colleges currently offer online, for-credit
studies. About 50 offer programs leading to degrees, including a
master's degree in business at Suffolk University in Boston, a
master's in electrical engineering at Stanford University, and
advanced education degrees at Lesley College in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Northeastern University, offer courses leading
to certification in specific skills, including technical writing,
electric commerce, or Web management.
</P>
<P>
   In the for-profit realm, however, Harcourt Higher Education's
program is only the fourth in the nation, said Michael Teitelbaum
of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in New York, which awards grants
to accredited schools to build online courses.
</P>
<P>
   The others are the University of Phoenix, which combines online
and classroom work and has branches in several cities; Nova
Southeastern University, in Florida, and Jones International
University, in Colorado. All are private.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum expects more. ``There is definitely a movement in
that direction,'' he said. Traditional colleges' online programs
also are expanding rapidly, with state university systems in
Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, and Michigan leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the potential for revenue, several blue-ribbon private
schools have created for-profit affiliates to manage and market
their online courses, including Columbia University, New York
University, and Temple University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition at Harcourt Higher Education will be $900 for each
three-credit-hour course. Antonucci said he expects about 1,000
students to enroll during the school's first year, and projects
revenue of about $18 million, including fees from licensing the use
of Harcourt teaching materials to other schools.
</P>
<P>
   He said licensing discussions are at various stages with
Northeastern University, the School of the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts, Endicott College (where Antonucci is a trustee), and
Fitchburg State College (Antonucci's alma mater).
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, Antonucci said, the school expects to have about 20,000
students taking an average of 2.5 courses each, a class load that
would yield about $45 million in tuition revenue. The school
expects to break even by 2003, other officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While these projections represent barely a blip on the parent
company's ledgers, analysts say this online presence could
influence Harcourt General's efforts, announced in June, to sell
some or all of its assets. Other publishing companies are seen as
the most likely bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if a buyer isn't interested in online, they might just
choose to shut this operation down,'' said Marta Nichols of
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt General shares, which jumped more than 30 percent
following the June announcement, closed Thursday in New York Stock
Exchange trading at $59.63, down 56 cents.
</P>
<P>
   This week's Board of Higher Education vote gives Harcourt Higher
Education authority to award both two-year associate's degrees and
four-year bachelor's degrees. School officials say they expect most
students to be adults, studying while working or raising families.
Many will have some college credits, which Harcourt will apply
toward its degree programs.
</P>
<P>
   Other colleges can elect to reject Harcourt credits, though,
until the school is accredited by the New England Association of
Schools and College _ which can't happen until at least one student
is awarded a degree.
</P>
<P>
   And evaluating a one-of-a-kind institution where everything is
electronic will be challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may think we have the appropriate criteria, but in two or
three years, or even in six months, things can change,'' Charles
Cook, who will oversee this process for the assocation, said.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of personal contact between students and faculty is the
biggest criticism leveled against Internet-based education. But
Teitelbaum said online teaching got a boost at a Sloan-sponsored
conference last year, where directors of college-based programs
reported almost no difference in test scores between their students
and those who took identical courses in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt, as an online-only institution, won't be able to make
such comparisons in the business, health studies, and information
technology programs about to be launched.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher Weir, who heads Harcourt's business education
program, said the fledgling school has taken pains to ensure its
courses match those at universities. Faculty from schools such as
McGill University, Carnegie Mellon University, and New York
University were hired to write course outlines and lecture
material, with other educators reviewing their work.
</P>
<P>
   Weir, a former advertising executive and administrator at
Emerson College, is one of four deans hired to oversee a total of
four full-time instructors for the school's start-up. The bulk of
their work will be managing up to 30 part-time adjunct instructors
who will be teaching the majority of courses.
</P>
<P>
   Adjunct faculty will post lecture texts; designate textbook
readings from textbooks or files that can be downloaded from a
Harcourt General database center in Florida; grade tests and other
papers; provide individual advice and criticism via e-mail; and
coordinate online class discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Because most homes don't have high-speed, broadband Internet
access, Harcourt and other online programs avoid using audio and
video. But e-mail and chat rooms take on extra importance to
stimulate participation. ``What we want to avoid, at all costs, is
a disconnect, a sense of loneliness,'' Weir said.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum, at the Sloan Foundation, said online educators
generally have found students to be more communicative via e-mail
than they might be in a classroom. ``Students who are shy and would
never think of raising their hands in a classroom have no fear
about sending their professor an e-mail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even by Internet-age standards, the development of Harcourt
Higher Education has been fast. Antonucci said he was hired in
January 1998 to run Harcourt General's ICS Learning Systems unit,
which sells correspondence courses.
</P>
<P>
   ICS at the time was changing its name to Harcourt Learning
Systems and beginning to distribute its courses on CD-ROM discs
from another Harcourt General unit, Archipelago Productions, of
Monterey, Calif. But it was clear that college online course
offerings threated that plan. Antonucci moved the Harcourt Learning
Systems headquarters office to Cambridge from Scranton, Pa., and
began overseeing development of an online program.
</P>
<P>
   One mandate was to use existing Harcourt General resources
wherever possible. The results include location of the school's
digital library at Harcourt's server computers in Florida;
assigning ICS staff in Scranton to screen applications; using
Archipelago software; and adoption of Harcourt-published texts for
about half the courses being offered this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Full-time faculty were chosen in part for their experience in
``distance learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald D. Babcock, a former associate chancellor at the
University of Masschusetts in Boston, was one of the first, hired
as provost and vice president for academic affairs. Babcock had
administered UMass-Boston's off-campus courses for health care
workers, delivered via videoconferencing.
</P>
<P>
   Almost alone among the current Harcourt faculty, Babcock, who
previously taught literature courses, keeps an office cluttered
with books, from works of Aeschylus, the ancient Greek writer, to a
text titled, ``Navigating the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock believes online teaching's popularity will explode once
broadband connections are widespread so instructors and students
can communicate via video. But he also advocates in-person
meetings. ``I don't believe Web-based education will ever replace
face-to-face communication, nor should it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, hoping to build some sense of identity and
school spirit, Harcourt Higher Education is considering selling
sweat shirts, coffee mugs, and the like _ bearing a school seal
that includes an image of a computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately for an exclusively online institution, the seal
now exists only as a digital file on its computers.

CHINA ARRESTS INTERNET CAFE OWNER FOR POSTING POLITICAL ARTICLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The owner of an Internet cafe in southern China has
been arrested and charged with subversion for posting articles
critical of the Communist Party, the latest sign of the
government's campaign to tame the explosion of electronic
information.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang Shihua, a high school teacher who operated the cafe in the
city of Nanchong in Sichuan province, is the third person in recent
months known to face serious charges for political statements on
the Internet. His arrest on Aug. 16, five days after he began
posting the articles under a pseudonym, was reported this week by
the Free China Movement in Washington, based on accounts by Chinese
television and Reporters Without Borders, a media watchdog group in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders have embraced the Internet as a key to
development but also fear it, and special ``Web police'' units have
been formed to search for illegal activities like fraud and
pornography as well as outlawed political debate.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Huang Qi, who ran a Web site from Sichuan that
published statements on the student democracy movement that was
crushed in 1989 and other rights issues, was charged with
subversion in June.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, Qi Yanchen, of Hebei Province, has been charged
with the same crime for posting anti-government messages, according
to rights groups. None of the three arrested men has been tried,
but convictions in such cases are nearly certain and can bring long
prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the authorities shut down New Culture Forum,
a Web site in Shandong Province that sponsored debate on the need
for democracy.

TIME IS SHORT FOR ADS AT TOP OF WEB PAGES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By SUSAN STELLIN  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to give media planners more information about
advertising patterns online, a study to be released on Monday found
that a majority of online advertisements had short life spans,
running three weeks or less.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in keeping with the short attention spans of most
Internet users, 23.7 percent of all online advertisements run one
week, while 16 percent run two weeks, and 11.9 percent run three
weeks, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, most advertisers reach a very small audience, the
study said, with a huge majority getting less than a 0.01 percent
share among all online advertisements running at a particular time.
</P>
<P>
   The study, done by AdRelevance, a unit of the Internet measuring
service Media Metrix, analyzed standard ad banners on the top 500
Web sites, as determined by Media Metrix, between July 1999 and
June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Buchwalter, vice president for media research for
AdRelevance and an author of the study, said the findings indicated
that advertisers were using online ads more for short-term direct
marketing than to create brand awareness. ``As time goes by,'' he
said, ``the average duration of campaigns will start increasing as
people understand more about the brand impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey did find differences in the length of online
campaigns run by various industries. While the auto industry
scheduled online ads to run the longest, an average 7.8 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the average online ad campaign in the
second quarter of 2000 registered 7,265,000 impressions, a measure
of the number of times an ad is viewed. But more than half of all
advertisers ran campaigns that registered fewer than 44,000
impressions in the second quarter, equivalent to about 0.0003
percent of all ads displayed in that period on a site like Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Buchwalter said that over all, the study's findings reflected
the fact that advertisers were still learning what works best in a
relatively new medium. ``With all the growth that is happening in
the online ad industry,'' he said, ``It's still in its infancy.''

A MAYOR'S PLUG; REDEEMABLE STAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 750 local governments now use the Web site operated by
NetClerk to put the construction-permit process online. But so far,
only the mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, has become part of
NetClerk's advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NetClerk put a picture of Brown and the city's seal
on www.netclerk.com, the company's Web site, along with a letter
the mayor had written praising the company for, among other things,
helping reduce lines at city hall.
</P>
<P>
   So far, NetClerk's PermitCentral service has been used to issue
more than 1,000 building permits in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we enjoy interacting with each and every person who
comes to city hall, waiting in line may not be the best use of a
contractor's time,'' the mayor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter may have been less than a spontaneous testimonial.
Jon Fisher, founder of NetClerk, said the company began discussing
a ``public relations partnership'' with the San Francisco's mayor's
office about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a letterhead partnership play out?
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of San Francisco is well known for its forward
thinking, technological savvy,'' the mayor wrote. ``NetClerk offers
a perfect example of how technology can improve a current system to
the satisfaction of all parties involved.''
</P>
<P>
   For Brown, of course, the satisfaction comes from bolstering his
image as a technology supporter and promoter of the Bay Area's
high-technology economy.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, NetClerk, based in South San Francisco, is part
of that economy.

   Redeemable Stamps Online
</P>
<P>
   The Carlson Cos. could be called the grandfather of customer
loyalty programs, dating to 1938, when the company first started
giving out Gold Bond Trading Stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Now Curtis C. Nelson, grandson of the founder and Carlson's
chief operating officer, wants to take it back to its roots _ this
time, online.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, Minneapolis-based owner of the TGIF restaurant chain,
Radisson Hotels, Thomas Cook Travel and a long list of other
businesses, is beginning to offer redeemable Gold Points to
customers on a new site, 24k.com.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the site will be the online hub of the
company's rewards program, both as a shopping portal and an online
redemption catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Much like S&AMP;H Green Stamps, Gold Bond Trading Stamps were doled
out by the thousands the last half century, typically as a way for
supermarkets, gas stations and shops to differentiate themselves in
competitive markets.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers redeemed their stamps for a range of consumer items
like toasters and hair dryers _ that is, until they began shopping
at discount warehouses and the practice fell by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   The online customer loyalty business is already fairly crowded,
what with S&AMP;H and others already doling out electronic trading
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   But today's online loyalty programs are an entirely different
beast from their predecessors. Among other things, they take
advantage of Internet data collection that allows merchants to
pitch specific products to customers based on their past shopping
behavior. And these days, customers can redeem their stamps for
much more than toasters.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson says that Carlson has a leg up on other redemption
programs because of the variety of brands it owns. And where it
does not have its own brand, he says, the company will join forces
with other companies to fill the void. Already, 24k.com either owns
or has a partnership with 1,500 sites that offer Gold Points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective,'' Nelson said, ``is to touch the customer 365
days a year, across all facets of their life.''

E-COMMERCE: COMPANIES LEARNING HOW TO PERSONALIZE SERVICE ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By SUSAN STELLIN  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask a handful of Internet executives to define the term
``personalization,'' and invariably the conversation turns to the
analogy of a shopkeeper who knows not only his customers' names,
but how much they can afford to spend and what size shirt they
wear.
</P>
<P>
   This old-fashioned ideal of personalized service _ albeit,
updated with new economy motives _ is the next hurdle for Internet
companies trying to achieve profitability in an increasingly
competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   What this means in practice is that rather than displaying the
same set of pages to every visitor, a Web site would present
different information to each customer based on the person's data
profile. A person who has shown online interest in classical music
might be presented with a special price on Bach compact discs,
whereas someone who has bought a Britney Spears CD might be offered
a discount on N'Sync.
</P>
<P>
   This type of personalized experience, alternatively described as
``one to one marketing'' or ``targeted merchandising,'' has long
been touted as one of the key benefits of the Web. But so far, very
few Internet companies have been able to take advantage of this
potential, mainly because the technologies for delivering it are
still in the early stages of development.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the industry is gradually catching up to the hype
surrounding personalization, as a growing number of companies have
installed tools enabling them to present customized Web pages _ if
not to a single individual, then at least to groups that have been
identified as having a similar profile. This trend is going to
raise the ante for companies doing business online, both in terms
of investors' and customers' expectations. It is also going to
raise new privacy issues concerning what type of information is
collected about consumers and how that data is used.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some degree of personalization has existed for years
online, most notably through sites like Yahoo or Excite, which
allow members to create a page that displays information based on
preferences they have entered, like stock symbols or categories of
news. That type of service is now referred to as ``customization,''
whereas the techniques known as ``personalization'' are based on
information companies have more discreetly gathered about
consumers, like their purchase history or the Web pages they have
viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Cormac Foster, an analyst at the research firm Jupiter
Communications, said the difference involves explicit versus
implicit data. ``Customization is giving users what they've told
you they want,'' he said, ``and personalization is anticipating
what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, one of the leaders in the personalization
arena is Amazon.com, which began its efforts in 1997 with a ``book
matcher'' feature. To use that feature, customers had to fill out a
form indicating their interests, and the system would match them
with books tailored to their entries. The problem with that
feature, according to Josh Petersen, Amazon's director of
personalization, was that it required too much work on the user's
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't have had to walk into a store of old and fill out
a questionnaire,'' Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Amazon focused its efforts on building a system
based on implicit data, like a customer's past purchases, which now
feeds into the site's ``New for You'' and ``Recommendations''
features. Using technology primarily developed by Amazon, these
services recommend products to customers based on algorithms that
take into account factors like the ratings a customer has assigned
various products on the site and the purchasing patterns of
customers with similar profiles.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the impact of errant data, Amazon allows users to
exclude certain purchases from their profile; that way, a Pokemon
game purchased for a niece will not skew a pattern of buying
mystery novels and Woody Allen videos. The system also makes some
automatic assumptions, like excluding gift-wrapped items.
</P>
<P>
   John Samuel, vice president of interactive marketing for AMR's
American Airlines, would be the first to agree that current
implementations of personalization technologies are still in their
infancy. American overhauled its AA.com Web site in 1998, with a
new version that allows the site to present pages that have been
tailored for each individual.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel said the company had a head start in its personalization
efforts because of its AAdvantage frequent-flier program, which has
gathered information about 40 million members. American uses that
information, as well as data collected from customers who fill out
a profile online, to tailor the offers that customers see when they
visit the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, that translates to knowing someone is in college
versus knowing someone is retired or often flies business class,''
Samuel said. ``The communication to those customers should be very
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel said that American has been careful to err on the side of
being explicit about collecting data, which is why the company asks
customers to fill out a profile, even if that information is easy
to deduce from an individual's travel history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be hard for us to infer a customer's home
airport,'' he said. ``But we still ask on the Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for American Airlines and other companies
experimenting with this level of personalization will be
negotiating a delicate balance between providing consumers with
services and offers they want, and appearing to know too much and
risk scaring those customers away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a lot, and our customers know we know a lot,'' Samuels
said. The question is, ``What permission do we have from the
customer to use that knowledge?''

NEW ECONOMY: SKY-HIGH GERMAN TELECOM AUCTION RANKLES SOME BIDDERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ It was a free-market contest of the purest
sort, an airwave auction of the kind pioneered in the United States
and taken to dizzying new heights in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ever since the bidding ended on Aug. 17 in Germany's auction
of wireless licenses for so-called third-generation mobile
networks, even devoted market enthusiasts have started to wonder if
this is really the most rational way to go.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks and 173 rounds of bidding, six companies had bid
a total $46 billion for the rights to one license apiece. And that
total did not include an additional $4 billion or so that each
company would have to spend to build the new networks and drum up
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been reeling, dumping the stocks of all the
winners: Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, British
Telecommunications, France Telecom, Telefonica of Spain and Sonera
of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's, the credit-rating agency, warned that it
would probably lower most of the companies' credit ratings and
might even drop some to the triple-B level, not much better than
junk-bond status. Bond investors are bracing for a flood of
gigantic telephone bond offerings, but the uncertainties were high
enough that British Telecommunications postponed an offering last
week until its rating was clarified.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, wireless opportunities are immense. Europe is well
ahead of the United States in rolling out digital wireless
telephones, and the new licenses will be used to offer high-speed
data communications that are eventually expected to galvanize
mobile electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned, the new third-generation mobile networks will
enable people to surf the Internet from a sidewalk, download video
clips onto their hand-held phones or simply locate a nearby
restaurant and book a table.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knows what consumers will really want or how much
they will be ready to pay. And because the new systems will
increase competition in ordinary mobile phone service, analysts
predict that prices and profitability in voice service will decline
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists argue that risks are simply part of the game. If
companies overbid, they may have to fold tent and sell their
licenses to someone else at a loss. The world will go on.
</P>
<P>
   But the German auctions also uncovered deep fissures in the
European telecommunications landscape that make the entire playing
field uneven.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Germany and the Netherlands have all held auctions, won
by a variety of European players. But Spain and Finland, using a
so-called beauty contest approach, simply awarded licenses to
companies deemed most worthy. The licenses, granted primarily to
domestic applicants, came at a fraction of the price they might
have fetched at auction. France will hold a beauty contest, too,
but will charge a flat fee of about $4 billion a license.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives complain that companies from countries with very
low license costs can save billions at home and then plow the money
into auctions elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a level playing field in Europe,'' said Hans
Ehnert, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom. ``We had to compete in
the bidding against companies like Telefonica from Spain, but we
were excluded from the Spanish market.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of auctions argue that they are the most effective way
to put licenses in the hands of those most likely to use them
profitably. Compared with beauty contests, auctions give the
participants no opportunity to exploit political connections or
bedazzle government bureaucrats with lofty promises that can later
be broken.
</P>
<P>
   Both the British and German auctions were open. But one of the
surprise winners in the German auction _ a bidder that Deutsche
Telekom and Vodafone both tried and failed to eliminate _ was a
group controlled by Telefonica of Spain and Sonera of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish and Finnish companies had received new wireless
licenses at negligible costs from their own governments.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom bid for a license earlier this year in Spain,
where the license fees were relative peanuts: about $130 million
and 0.15 percent of future revenues. Deutsche Telekom teamed up in
the beauty contest with Jazztel, a fast-growing Spanish competitor
to Telefonica, but the team lost to three Spanish operators and a
fourth group led by Vivendi of France.
</P>
<P>
   As for Finland, Pirjo Kekalainen-Torvinen, Sonera's senior vice
president for international business development, said her company
had not unfairly benefited by getting a Finnish license almost
free. ``We paid as much for our license in Germany as anybody
else,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Finland had strong policy reasons for awarding
wireless licenses as cheaply as possible. Finland, home to Nokia,
the world's biggest wireless phone producer, Nokia, considers
wireless technology its biggest national industry. By giving out
next-generation wireless licenses as quickly and cheaply as
possible, government officials hope to promote and indirectly
subsidize innovative new technology and services.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry executives blame Deutsche Telekom itself for the
high prices of the German licenses. Gerhard Schmid, chief executive
of Mobilcom, which was awarded a license in the auction, angrily
complained that the six final bidders could have ended up with the
same licenses and saved billions of dollars if they had simply
stopped bidding four days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid blamed Deutsche Telekom for a misguided attempt to outbid
the Spanish-Finnish group for an extra license, a move that would
have reduced the number of rivals from six to five.
</P>
<P>
   But Telefonica and Sonera refused to give up, and Deutsche
Telekom executives capitulated after the total bidding had climbed
from 30 billion euros ($27.1 billion) to 50.5 billion euros. The
result was higher license prices and more licensees than most
investors had been expecting.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, investors pummeled shares of Sonera and Telefonica
even more than they did those of Deutsche Telekom. Yet when Italy
begins auctions later this year, Deutsche Telekom plans to stay
out, saying it has no interest in Italy. But Telefonica and Sonera,
exuberant after their German adventure, plan to team up again.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a report to President Clinton last year, a group of leading
computer scientists warned that the nation faced a troubling
``software gap.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, made up of corporate executives and university
researchers, said that programmers simply could not keep pace with
exploding demand for high-quality software _ the computer code
needed for everything from Internet commerce to nuclear weapons
design.
</P>
<P>
   To bridge the gap, the group said, the nation must not only
train more skilled programmers but also explore fresh, even
radical, approaches to developing and maintaining software.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report, the group, known as the President's Information
Technology Advisory Committee, will recommend that the federal
government back ``open source software as an alternate path for
software development,'' according to a draft copy of the report,
which will be sent to the White House and published in a matter of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open source software'' seems a radical approach indeed. The
term stands for both an iconoclastic philosophy and a software
development model: software is distributed free and its ``source
code,'' or underlying instructions, are published openly so that
other programmers can study, share and modify the author's work.
</P>
<P>
   The open-source model represents a sharp break with the
practices of the commercial software business, which considers
source code a company's private property _ usually guarded
jealously and shared only rarely, under strict licensing terms.
</P>
<P>
   But open source, once viewed as an ideological movement at the
fringes of computing, is moving into the mainstream _ largely
because the spread of the Internet and personal computers makes it
easy for programmers to collaborate in far-flung, voluntary teams.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source software has already made real inroads with a pair
of showcase success stories: the Linux operating system for
computers used alone or in networks, and the Apache software system
for so-called server computers used for Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Linux and Apache have attracted the support of established
companies like IBM and Hewlett-Packard, and startups like Red Hat
and VA Linux. Both open-source programs have done best in the
market for Web server software. Apache is used on 63 percent of Web
servers, according to Netcraft, a research firm, while Linux is the
operating system on 36 percent of Web servers.
</P>
<P>
   The movement's fans say that open-source development, if widely
adopted, has the potential to help fill the software gap by more
efficiently delivering high-quality software. And open source, they
add, is forcing the software industry to rethink its traditional
development practices and its business strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The point, they say, is not to destroy the profit motive that
has helped make software a $175 billion-a-year business worldwide.
The goal instead is to bring software development into the Internet
era by sharing knowledge widely, allowing programmers to build on
one another's work and accelerate the pace of software debugging
and improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in the open-source economy would make money mainly by
tailoring programs for customers, and with service and support.
Software, open-source advocates say, would increasingly become a
service business _ compared with the the traditional model of
shipping proprietary code, shrink-wrapped, as if it were a
manufactured good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am increasingly coming to the conclusion that the Internet
and open-source initiatives are the free marketplace way of dealing
with the extremely complex software issues we are facing,'' said
Irving Wladawsky-Berger, an I.B.M. executive and a member of the
presidential advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft is taking open source seriously, if warily.
``This issue of open source cuts to the core of the software
business,'' observed Jim Gray, a Microsoft researcher who is also a
member of the presidential advisory group. ``It is a real
challenge, masked by a great deal of hype.''
</P>
<P>
   The new report by the technology advisory panel is another sign
that open source is an emerging force. The group's recommendations
focus mainly on developing software in a rarefied niche of
computing _ the federally financed supercomputing centers devoted
to over-the-horizon research in fields like modeling the atmosphere
and simulating nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the report also notes that open-source development could
have ``a profound economic and social'' impact, and it clearly
regards the supercomputing centers as technology incubators for the
marketplace. (It was a team from the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, after
all, that helped spawn the Web revolution by creating the Mosaic
browser, Netscape's precursor, in 1993, and that built the server
software that became the foundation of the Apache project.)
</P>
<P>
   ``High-end computing should be a good test bed if you want to
find out if open source can produce high-quality, complex
software,'' said Larry Smarr, co-chairman of the open-source panel
of the presidential advisory committee, who was head of the
Illinois supercomputing center in the Mosaic days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For all the momentum of the open-source model, uncertainties
abound. Making the transition from a movement to the mainstream,
industry analysts say, will mean overcoming some daunting cultural,
business and legal obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of open-source development go back to the 1970s and
the academic traditions of freely publishing research, subjecting
work to peer review and sharing one another's discoveries. The
early idealists, led by Richard M. Stallman, a revered programmer,
believed deeply that all software should be free and that
commercial software was all but immoral.
</P>
<P>
   But the leading figures in the open-source movement today,
however, have a more pragmatic bent. They believe in open-source
development mainly, they say, because it produces better software
and service _ not because it is morally superior to the traditional
commercial model. They are all for capitalism, and they welcome
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If open source is to succeed, it has to have a business
justification,'' said Brian Behlendorf, one of the creators of
Apache, and the founder and chief technology officer of Collab.Net,
a San Francisco start-up company that helps companies design and
run projects using open-source techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are in the open-source community because they
think it is the right thing to do,'' he added. ``But charity only
goes so far. You've got to make it sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 5 million software programmers worldwide,
Behlendorf figures that fewer than 50,000 participate in
open-source projects. ``The goal is to bring what works from open
source into this other 99 percent of the programming community,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collab.Net, founded last year, has about two dozen clients,
including Sun Microsystems, Oracle and Hewlett-Packard. Some of its
customers are experimenting with distributing source code freely.
But others are proceeding more cautiously, perhaps sharing some of
their proprietary code with business partners and customers as a
way to improve the quality and speed of its software development
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' said Bill Portelli, president of Collab.Net, ``this
is not about software being free. It's about the open-source
practices and principles _ a methodology for fast, effective
collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   To make money, Collab.Net charges fees for consulting, education
and coordinating software projects. Indeed, the business model for
open-source development is based on the premise that software is a
service and that the companies seeking to profit from it are
service suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial software business, open-source advocates say, is
locked in an industrial-era ``factory model'' of shipping programs
out the door as ``finished goods.'' Instead, such advocates say,
software should be seen as more like a living organism that is best
fed and cared for in the open-source environment. Even Microsoft,
they note, has said recently that its software effort will evolve
into a service business.
</P>
<P>
   So far open-source development has been more of an Internet-age
breakthrough in engineering management than a progenitor of new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The two marketplace triumphs of open source, after all, are
derivative rather than truly innovative. Linux is a version of the
Unix operating system, and the Apache Web server was derived from
software developed at the Illinois supercomputing center.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, some experts say the promise of open source is
being overstated. William N. Joy, a founder and chief scientist of
Sun Microsystems, created and distributed an open-source version of
Unix two decades ago at the University of California at Berkeley.
The Internet, he now says, has changed the context of things,
making collaboration easier. But real innovation, he says, remains
the work of a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, great software comes from great programmers, not
from a large number of people slaving away,'' Joy said. ``Open
source can be useful. It can speed things up. But it's not new, and
it's not holy water.''
</P>
<P>
   Open-source enthusiasts reply that Joy is correct when it comes
to the conceptual insight needed to forge a new direction in
software. Truly creative insights, they concede, will remain the
bailiwick of the ``lone craftsman'' programmer. But they hurry to
add that breakthrough innovation, while important, is only a small
part of the software economy. More than 75 percent of the time and
cost of a software project is typically consumed by what the
open-source approach is meant to do best: debugging, maintaining
and tweaking the code.
</P>
<P>
   Such work may seem mundane, but it represents a huge
problem-solving challenge that determines the speed of development
as well as the reliability of software.
</P>
<P>
   So when Linus Torvalds released an experimental version of Unix
onto the Internet as a student at the University of Helsinki in
1991, it may not have been breakthrough software. As the Web took
off, though, he soon found himself the steward of a developing
operating system project, dubbed Linux, spurred by the voluntary
contributions of programmers around the world. In the book ``The
Cathedral and the Bazaar,'' Eric S. Raymond, an open-source
evangelist, observed that Torvalds was ``the first person who
learned how to play by the new rules that pervasive Internet access
made possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rules can be disorienting. Netscape Communications
learned some hard lessons after it opened the source code on its
Internet browsing software in early 1998. By then, Netscape,
following Microsoft's lead, had been forced to give its browser
away. But browser market share was still important to Netscape
because its software server sales and service contracts depended on
the popularity of its technology.
</P>
<P>
   By making its browser an open-source project, Netscape hoped to
enlist the widespread support among open-source programmers eager
to help the company in its battle against Microsoft. The
open-source project was called mozilla.org _ a playful combination
of Mosaic, the original browser, and Godzilla. But the effort drew
only limited support.
</P>
<P>
   Developers typically join open-source projects for the challenge
of solving interesting software problems and the resulting
recognition of their peers. That works best when a software program
is designed as many pieces, or modules, so ``there is a lot of
frontier to homestead,'' in open-source parlance.
</P>
<P>
   But Netscape's browser was a big batch of programming code that
was not designed in modules. ``That made it hard for even strong
hackers to come in, stake a claim and do interesting work,'' said
Brendan Eich, a leading programmer and one of the six founders of
mozilla.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Corporate attitudes slowed things down as well. At first, for
example, the Netscape programmers were reluctant to post their
comments in the online area accessible to outsiders, preferring to
post them instead on in-house lists for Netscape engineers. ``There
was a whole mindset that had to change,'' Eich observed.
</P>
<P>
   The mozilla open-source project was weakened further by staff
defections after Netscape agreed to be acquired by America Online
in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the project was also overhauled in the fall of 1998 in ways
that laid the groundwork for a turnaround. The mozilla leaders
adopted a modular code base called Gecko _ named after a small,
fast lizard _ for rendering Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, more outside developers joined the open-source
browser effort. Eich, the lone founding member of mozilla still
with Netscape, rattles off the names of several outside programmers
who have made significant contributions. Bugs are fixed quickly.
``More eyes looking at the code really helps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, America Online released a preview version of
its next-generation browser, Netscape 6.0, long delayed but praised
in the trade press for its streamlined design and novel features.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Microsoft seems to be entrenched as the leader in
browsers for personal computers. Still, the Netscape browser is at
least a counterweight to Microsoft on the desktop. Beyond that, the
mozilla open-source browser is designed for post-PC computing _ to
run easily on everything from cell phones to hand-held Internet
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've rounded the corner at mozilla,'' Eich said.
</P>
<P>
   The mozilla effort is also being watched as a model for
licensing _ a crucial issue for open source. There are many kinds
of open-source licenses, but they all require contributors who
modify an open-source program to make those improvements available
to all members of the project. The most restrictive licenses
require any code that touches an open-source program to be made
available freely. ``To some companies, that is a terrifying
thought,'' said Lawrence Rosen, executive director of the Open
Source Initiative, an education and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The mozilla license is an effort to let open source and
proprietary software coexist peacefully. Its license applies to
each of the software files _ building blocks of code _ in the
open-source browser. If someone modifies one of those files, the
improvement must be given back to the project as open-source code.
But if a company mingles some of its own proprietary software files
with the browser, those separate files can remain its private
property.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of accommodation, industry analysts say, is a step
toward making open source acceptable to corporate America. ``Open
source can't go mainstream unless it finds ways to work with
companies that have very different business models and believe that
intellectual property can be owned,'' said James F. Moore,
president of Geopartners Research, a consulting firm. ``That's a
big challenge.''

 &HT;    Long-distance calls via Web come free, if not so easily
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine being so excited about something that you
called yourself to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   I made my mouse tracks across the on-screen dialpad, clicking
along the digits of my phone number. I heard the distant sound of
ringing through my computer's speakers, followed by my recorded
voice. I was alone in my home, and I told my voice mail, ``It
works, it really works.''
</P>
<P>
   My first Internet telephone call was to my own answering
machine. I was amazed and excited when it worked. I suppose that's
why I even left myself a message.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance phone service was my major vice and a steady
expense ever since I had the money to pay for it. Internet
telephone offers a chance to save money.
</P>
<P>
   I was a reluctant convert to Internet telephone calls. My
neighbor Susan asked me what I knew about the technology, and I was
ashamed to say I had no first-hand experience. I gave her some
articles about it, and she picked a provider.
</P>
<P>
   She invited me to her house to help walk her through the first
call. The process did not go smoothly, but that short exposure made
me curious.
</P>
<P>
   I could understand Susan's motivation to find free or cheap
phone calls. Her daughter met a foreign student who returned to
Germany. Their phone exchanges could get expensive, and Susan
wanted to find a way to reduce the costs.
</P>
<P>
   After fiddling with Susan's setup for a while, I came home and
got to work on my own computer. I downloaded PC-to-Phone software
from Deltathree's Web site (www.deltathree.com).
</P>
<P>
   It took work, but I managed to set it up. Once I was ready to
make a call, I dug out the microphone that came packaged with our
computer.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial call to myself, I was eager to test the
technology on real conversation. Call No. 2 was to my friend Marci.
She was friendly, as always. Then she said, ``I'm sorry, but who is
this?''
</P>
<P>
   Next I called my parents. My mother asked if I was in the car,
and she struggled through a short phone call with me before asking
me to call on a ``real'' phone later.
</P>
<P>
   The microphone is not great for this purpose. My call recipients
also had the distraction of hearing their own voices loud and clear
from my computer speakers while they talked. To optimize your
chances for quality sound, you need a headset that plugs into your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics stores carry them, and some of the Internet phone
providers sell them from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the exciting news is, even with the bad microphone, the
calls worked. And the price was right; the call was free. Plus,
this technology allowed me to make phone calls while I was online.
</P>
<P>
   I only have one telephone line at home, which I use for my
computer and telephone. When I surf the Web, the phone line is tied
up and calls are sent to my BellSouth voice mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Using PC-to-Phone, I can use the Internet and make phone calls
through my computer at the same time. I can also check my voice
mail messages by dialing in to the voice mail center. It simply
requires opening another browser window.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Deltathree, there are several companies offering
free calls from personal computers to traditional phones.
Dialpad.com (www.dialpad.com) and PhoneFree.com (www.phonefree.com)
offer free, unlimited calls within the United States. Other
companies like Net2Phone (www.net2phone.com) and MediaRing.com
(www.mediaring.com) offer discounted calls within the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The technology still has imperfections. There are echoes and
voice delays. Some calls are reminiscent of cheap mobile phones or
international calls of 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those cases where you get something for nothing
and sacrifice a little quality.
</P>
<P>
   One way to improve quality is to buy a headset.
</P>
<P>
   Net2Phone makes a headset that plugs into the back of a
computer. It sells at many local retailers for about $45. Or you
may find headphones that you can order via one of the Internet
phone providers. Deltathree and Dialpad.com offer a selection on
their sites ranging in price from $10 to $75.
</P>
<P>
   To make the calls, you need a computer, an Internet connection,
a sound card, a microphone and speakers.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 &HT;    Reader input adds some clarity to discussion about digital
photos
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The recent column on digital photography provoked some
response, both from the unanointed, like me, and the experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am also an old photographer ready to go digital. But right
now, the more I read, the more confused I become. A number of my
friends have chosen the Sony Mavica line, which uses a floppy disc.
This is appealing to me because it seems so easy. Now Sony is
adding Memory Stick storage. Do you have any suggestions, based on
your own research? Thanks for any info you might have.''
</P>
<P>
   Using 3.5 floppies for image storage provides enormous freedom _
you don't have to carry a laptop or some other expensive storage
device if you intend to make a lot of pictures on a trip. As far as
I can see, the only sure disadvantage is that the Mavica is a lot
larger than most digital cameras. There is also the question of
whether it takes longer to record the image on a floppy than on a
Memory Stick, but I haven't found the answer to that.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Will Christopher passes along some excellent information
for all of us seeking to get into digital images:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I just this year made that plunge, perhaps my experience
might be of interest to you. Check out this Web site:
www.imaging-resource.com. It will give you all the information you
need and quite a bit more on any digital camera on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher extols the virtues of the Agfa Ephoto 1680, which
provides 1.9 megapixels, 3X optical zoom and 2X digital zoom. He
paid $429 for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site he mentions appears to be just what all of us
beginners need.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Eisele has a related question:
</P>
<P>
   ``Approximately a year ago a piece of software came out which
allows an individual to take data from a VCR or video camera and
make still photos through their computer. Any ideas? It was
advertised on several radio shows about a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   This requires hardware, not just software. The pioneer in this
field is the Snappy Video Snapshot, a little box to be connected
between your VCR/camera and your computer. A similar and perhaps
more sophisticated function is now being included in some video
display cards.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Langan, a reader in Colorado, wonders about the
durability of prints made on an inkjet printer. While the maker of
the Pictorico line of paper I reviewed recently states that its
Photo Gallery High-Gloss White paper is archival, I suspect the
greatest durability lies in the images themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless over the next 50 years or so there will be advances in
storage formats, and JPG and GIF files will become obsolete. But it
is hard to imagine that there won't be provisions for migrating
images from those formats to new ones.

 &HT;    Worry not about a bot
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I've started paying more attention to applications that place
bots on my computer. You should make readers aware that many
programs place bots on their system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dan Mares, Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: So, what's a bot and what does it do? Bot is short for
robot. It's a software tool that sifts through computer data. It
has been programmed to search and recover information.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Developers send bots on missions with specific
instructions. Web search engines dispatch bots to snag relevant URL
information from other servers. Shopping bots are big. They scan
the Web for prices for online products. Bots can be newshounds,
too, retrieving the latest in news, finance, sports and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: They help maintain intricate Web sites. They monitor site
links to make sure they're still alive when Web pages are removed
or relocated.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There is some concern about how they are used. They're
constantly retrieving info and have been called ``spiders'' or
``Web worms.'' This can give the impression that they multiply.
That's not really the case. They use standard Web protocols.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Bots can place demands on a network. There are newer
protocols being designed every day to standardize and limit those
demands. Developers are asked to strike a balance when designing
and deploying a bot.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: So, bots can be good, bots can be bad? In general, bots
are babes.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Readers:
</P>
<P>
   Here's a fun Web site to bookmark. Cruise to www.surprise.com.
Thank you, Dave Garr, for sending it in.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It's a gift site that doesn't try to sell you anything.
It's big on pointing you to ideas for fun gifts anywhere on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Click on ``Who's it for'' to pick a present for
grandparents, the baby sitter or your child's coach.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The ``What Occasion?'' options cover retirement,
housewarmings, graduations, birthdays. Another ``must click'' is
``What are they like?''
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Do they love to throw parties? Perhaps a maid service or
a bubble machine. A gadgeteer? No problem. There are PDAs, a
folding shovel and a wristwatch camera. The list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Buying for someone with a wacky sense of humor? There's
custom toilet paper or a glow-in-the-dark basketball. For pet pals,
there's a puppy pager.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Ideas are submitted by folks who surf the site.
Surprise.com will pay $100 for ideas that are among the 1,000 most
popular ideas for a three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Get downright organized about your gift-giving. Set up an
account. Schedule e-mail reminders for anniversaries, weddings,
etc., and keep track of gift ideas you've saved while browsing.
</P>
<P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Graphics a big hook in `Ecco'
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been well over a year since I first saw screen
shots of a promising Dreamcast game titled ``Ecco the Dolphin.'' It
was one of the best-looking games I had ever seen, and now it's
finally here and I couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game loads, prepare to witness some of the best
graphics on the system to date. For the first half-hour I totally
ignored the game play and just explored the vast undersea world in
awe.
</P>
<P>
   The game artists' research spanned several months, and it shows.
From the smooth contour of a dolphin to the subtle cloud of sand
from a shifting stingray, every element is captured realistically.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful imagery is complemented with a soothing ambient
soundtrack. Some hard-core gamers may be a little skeptical, but
it's actually a refreshing break from the gritty, techno-throbbing
action games.
</P>
<P>
   The sensory experience is nearly perfect, but how does it play?
</P>
<P>
   Again, I was impressed. Ecco, the dolphin, has many abilities,
and although they may take a few minutes to get used to, you'll be
chasing fish and gliding gracefully along the ocean floor in no
time.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ecco's most important abilities is his sonar projection.
The skill allows Ecco to speak to other creatures, wrangle fish and
map out his environment.
</P>
<P>
   The only factor that comes close to polluting this pristine game
is the vagueness of the tasks for each stage.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are info-crystals and sea creatures that guide
Ecco, you'll often be uncertain as to what to do or where to go. I
usually don't refer to hint guides, but I found that I didn't have
much choice if I wanted to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a few unclear missions, ``Ecco the Dolphin'' is a dream.
This is yet another great title that makes me happy I have a
Dreamcast.

 &HT;    Bundles of fun
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   For kids not content with mere ogling and cooing over their
latest bubblegum card acquisition or setting up a fantasy
competition via linked game machines, Bandai's Gundam Wing toys
offer hands-on, tangible toys for imaginary-world play. Better
still, Bandai bundles two activities into one package as the toys
are also available as Gundam Wing plastic model kits ($5 to $25;
www.bandai.com). When the glue-less snap-together figurines are
finished _ complete with weapons, decals and accessories _ they
become effective and interactive posturing models with some 40
points of articulation. A slightly sophisticated motor-skills
challenge and a long-term toy craze all in one. Pretty neat.
</P>
<P>
   THE GENTLE LULL OF A JACKHAMMER?
</P>
<P>
   There's one thing mechanical wind-up mobiles have over lazy-age
motorized, doll-dangling, eye-catching baby distracters: They're
not motorized! That is to say, while Fisher Price's Sparkling
Symphony Mobile with Remote Control ($25; www.fisher-price.com) is
indeed ultra modern, colorful and pleasing to behold visually, the
diminutive powerhouse rotating its dangling moon and stars is
notably audible. To compensate, the symphony of nursery rhyme
electronica is fixed at a fairly loud volume, which is all well and
good if you're grooming a future rock star or jackhammer operator,
but it's not at all peaceful late in the night when a soft,
soothing lullaby is all that's required. A wonderful daytime
distraction, to be sure, but clicking on the remote from up to 20
feet away and setting the moaning wheels and enthusiastic digital
orchestra in motion somewhat defeats the purpose of stealth tactics
in the nursery.

 &HT;    Accessory-deprived? Writeable CD drive a handy tool
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am often a great disappointment to those who meet
me.
</P>
<P>
   Most people assume that _ here at Technology Ranch in exotic
Smyrna, Ga., _ I have all the latest in computer equipment. They
envision banks of blinking lights, PCs with processors so fast that
special cooling units are needed to prevent meltdown, and shelves
stocked with every new accessory that comes along.
</P>
<P>
   But today I am sitting in a bedroom that serves as my home
office, bare feet propped on a desk where my father once sat
presiding over a failing boat-manufacturing company. I am typing
away on a 350-megahertz computer that any self-respecting
13-year-old would sneer at.
</P>
<P>
   I love gadgets and computers. It's just that I am promiscuous
with my love and my money and have flings with fly rods, golf clubs
and cameras as well as computers. My modest income gets spread too
thin to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   So when the public relations woman called to ask me to test the
new MP3 audio gadget that her company was promoting, she explained
that I would need to use my writeable CD drive as part of the test.
I had to tell her I hadn't gotten around to buying one. You could
hear the disdain of my high-tech poverty in her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Then, being highly trained in the art of human relations and in
advanced table manners, she said she would lend the drive to me so
I could test her product. When the drive arrived, it sat _ unopened
_ for a week while I went about my more usual tasks of cleaning up
after the cat and trying to find my lost wallet.
</P>
<P>
   I still haven't tested her product. But I did install the CD
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a few days of messing with it, I am already looking
closely at my No. 2 fly rod, thinking I may pawn that sucker and
buy my own writeable CD drive. I am finding uses for the drive that
didn't strike me until I used it.
</P>
<P>
   It passed the Husted Test for Practicality. It has multiple
uses, and all of them have actually solved one problem or another
for me.
</P>
<P>
   I've used it to make audio CDs of some of my favorite vinyl
albums. Now I can drive along in my car accompanied by Peggy Lee.
Those who have heard me sing _ even trendy people who listen to
more popular music _ appreciate hearing her instead of me.
</P>
<P>
   My hard disk was clogged with electronic photographs. There's
the (I swear this is true and can provide witnesses if necessary)
photo my electrical engineer uncle sent of his new license tag,
countless family photographs I scanned in, photos of various
friends, and pictures that I no longer remember taking but hesitate
to throw away. I've copied most of them to a CD and tucked them
away so _ years from now when this hard disk meets up with the law
of entropy _ I'll have them.
</P>
<P>
   Then I did something that surprised even me. For years I have
been urging readers to make a backup copy of the personal data on
their hard disks. But _ since I did not have a tape drive, or even
a Zip drive _ the notion of inserting countless dozens of floppy
disks to save my tax data, e-mails and writing documents was
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   I felt guilty about not doing it, but a guy can get used to
guilt. Now I have a true backup copy of my data. (I didn't bother
making copies of programs since it's almost always necessary to
install them from scratch in a new installation.)
</P>
<P>
   What I'm saying is: Go out and get a writeable CD drive if you
don't have one.
</P>
<P>
   I know many of you are nervous about tasks that involve opening
up the innards of your PC. But it's truly easy _ a 30-minute job at
most. I won't take you through the steps since it's far smarter to
follow the step-by-step instructions that come with the drive. But
I can tell you that installation simply involves sliding the drive
into your computer and fastening it with two screws.
</P>
<P>
   Then you plug in two cables. Once you load in the software that
comes with the CD drive, you're set. Those of you who still get the
quivers about things like this needn't be ashamed if you decide to
take your machine in to a computer shop for the installation.
</P>
<P>
   Since this CD drive must soon go back to the manufacturer, I'll
be postponing the purchase of a new sand wedge for my golf bag and
buying a writeable CD drive of my own.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, I may even get around to testing the MP3
gadget that started this whole thing.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 &HT;    A weekend trip through the labyrinthine world of Internet sports
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Memo to: The office.
</P>
<P>
   Re: That assignment you gave me to watch sports on the Internet
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The latest: I'm trapped in cyberhell. It sounds like something
out of Twilight Zone, but it's true. There is a cartoon of a
ballplayer named Ron Jocker on my screen. His lips are moving, and
the audio track is saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the Mets. The biggest thing I don't like about New York
are the foreigners. How the hell did they get in this country,
anyway? I don't have the attention span to go out there and
concentrate much longer than 10 minutes. I am not a racist. I was
not raised that way. Baseball is just a game, and no matter what
happens my parents still love me.''
</P>
<P>
   And I can't get rid of it. Jocker keeps railing on, even though
the computer appears to have shut down. I'm stuck with a cartoon
maniac looming on my screen and coming out the speakers. This is a
computer greeting-card company's idea of a joke.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I know it wasn't part of the assignment. But following the
Braves pitch by pitch on the Internet wasn't that exciting. So I
decided to answer the e-mail that carried the subject line: Get
back at Atlanta's Bad Boy Pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that Ron Jocker.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least something dramatic happened during my Internet
surf.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of two days and a long Saturday night, I
felt like I had been trapped in a time warp, back in the days when
news came over a ticker tape, line by line.
</P>
<P>
   Following baseball pitch by pitch, college football play by
play, Tiger Woods hole by hole. It lacked all of the emotion and
color one gets from TV, or by being there. The experiment revealed
this surprising revelation: the best thing to watch on the Internet
is a NASCAR race.
</P>
<P>
   On NASCAR.com, you get the race summary lap by lap, a graphic of
little cars supposedly running in true proximity among the top
four, a graphic of the track layout and a radar image showing how
far rain showers in the Midwest are from Bristol Motor Speedway. A
scoring and timing page gives each car's last-lap speed.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't get are the pit stops and the wrecks. On the Web,
a ``Race Alert'' dialogue box is as intense as it gets: ``Lap 395.
An incident involving Robert Pressley has brought out the 11th
caution in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   If you love statistics, following the pro golf tour is slightly
interesting. PGATour.com posts round-by-round, hole-by-hole scores
of tournaments, followed by a summary of key categories _ driving
accuracy, driving distance, putts per round, sand saves, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the numbers can leave one cold.
</P>
<P>
   I had expected to spend the weekend locked in my computer room
with Cynthia Cooper, Tiger Woods, Venus Williams, Ruben Mavarez,
Hristo Stoichkov and Albert the Great.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them showed up.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to follow Williams in the Pilot Pen finals against
Monica Seles got sidetracked by this revelation: www.WTA.com does
not connect to the Women's Tennis Association but rather to
Anything.com, a company that advises Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some insider's info: type carefully. My typo _ Teenis.com _
brought me to My Teeny Tiny David Cassidy Appreciation Site. After
correcting my error, I was able to navigate to Tennis.com. Without
a match available, I felt obliged to work through the nine Anna
Kournikova Web pages and catch up on her development. The photos
testify that she surely has perfected the art of bending over to
tie her shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Had planned to follow Stoichkov and the Chicago Fire in the MSL
soccer match against Tampa Bay. No such luck. But www.mlssoccer did
offer one of the more interesting sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the latest news on drugs, players in trouble, manager
movement, injuries, scandals and a whole lot of other offbeat
features to keep you amused,'' it promised, but I was too timid to
click on Kickmyballs.com.
</P>
<P>
   My fascination with WNBA.com kept me from tuning into Albert the
Great's near-win in the Travers Stakes. I caught the Houston
Comets-New York Liberty championship game in progress. On the
cybercast, guest analyst Kym Hampton, retired Liberty center, was
available for Q&AMP;A.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive opportunity cluttered things up:
</P>
<P>
   MODERATOR: At 2:33 p.m. With 1:36 remaining in the half the
score is now 24-23 Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Megan from the Web: ``What do you recommend that New York works
on for the second half?
</P>
<P>
   Kym Hampton: ``Making more shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the game in Portuguese was as informative. ``Your
own photos from Houston with WNBA.cam'' offered still views from
either basket.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over at www.ABCSports.com, Mavarez was pitching
Venezuela to the Little World Series title. Clicked on Myteam.com
to hear the gamecast. Instead, got an insult: ``You have an
outdated version of RealPlayer,'' the dialog box shouted.
``Download RealPlayer8 now, $29.99.''
</P>
<P>
   I always follow instructions. As the computer began the
46-minute downloading procedure, I escaped upstairs to watch the
Venezuelans win the game on TV. Returned to find the computer had
crashed with only 77 percent of the download complete. Scrapped the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Went to Fastball.com. To catch up on the Yankees-A's, already in
the top of the fourth, I clicked on the update and received 12
pages of play by play.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to watch the Kansas State-Iowa football opener. With
no audio available to me from the FANSonly.com site, I settled for
the play by play on www.K-Statesports.com. 2-8 K22 Allen 28 rush
middle (Davison). Just like reporters get in the press box, except
chronologically backwards, with the most recent play listed first.
</P>
<P>
   Another dialogue box popped onto the screen. ``Get out of debt.
Click here.'' How'd those people know I was online?
</P>
<P>
   Followed the game until K-State took a 17-0 lead (Beasley 4 pass
left to Morgan; touchdown (at) 0:19) just before halftime. The site
was packed with stats after the game, including drive charts, play
by play, notes and quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Clicked on over to Atlantabraves.com to see if they had rallied
against the Cardinals. They hadn't. Neither had my audio function.
Clicked on MLB radio, which allows access to every broadcast, and a
voice from inside the computer said, ``Sorry, but we did not
understand the URL you requested. Please check the URL and try
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a long day had become night. Dialed up NASCAR.com to
watch Rusty Wallace run away at Bristol. Neither Seminoles.com nor
BYUCougars.com offered play by play. Clicked on the audio broadcast
at the BYU site and got a message that said: ``Error No. 11. This
document is not a RealAudio document.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when I fell into the Ron Jockerzone.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: The Internet is interesting for cold numbers and
requires patience and a more agreeable computer than mine. I'll
take a TV and remote control, thanks.

PORTALS: A TEST POSTPONED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROSS KERBER   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lawsuit against Yahoo Inc. that had been seen as a key test of
online anonymity was withdrawn before any formal arguments could be
made in court.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was brought in May by an Ohio man who said he was fired
after being identified as the author who posted on a Yahoo message
board criticism of his superiors at AnswerThink Consulting Group in
Miami. The man's lawyer argued Yahoo should have done more to
protect his identity, or at least notify him that AnswerThink was
seeking the information. The American Civil Liberties Union had
supported the suit, contending Internet companies give users the
false impression their online musings will be protected.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments will have to wait for another case, however,
following the withdrawal of the suit by the plaintiff, according to
his attorney, Megan Gray of the Baker &AMP; Hostetler law firm in Los
Angeles. Gray declined to discuss the reasons for the action. A
Yahoo attorney said there was no settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the suit, Yahoo's policy had been that it would
disclose information about its users in response to civil
subpoenas. After the suit was filed, Yahoo said it had changed its
rules. Now, it will notify users when their identities are sought
by a third party, and give them 15 days to take legal action.
</P>
<P>
   One of the suit's original supporters, David Sobel, an attorney
with the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington,
called Yahoo's new rules an improvement but said he hopes federal
laws will eventually clarify just how much anonymity users should
expect when using pseudonyms online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers me the most is that it's entirely
voluntary, and still probably subject to their discretion, and
there's nothing that obligates them to do more'' to protect a
user's identity, Sobel said. &QL; 
Searching unplugged
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista Co. has introduced what it calls the world's largest
index of Web pages customized for use by mobile phones and palmtop
devices, a listing of 2.7 million pages in all. AltaVista, a
majority-owned unit of CMGI Inc. of Andover, is best known as a
portal site for PC users. But full Web pages usually contain too
much data, up to 1,000 words, to be useful for most wireless
devices that link to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware makers hope to overcome the limitation with a standard
known as WAP, or Wireless Application Protocol, which creates Web
pages with fewer characters _ perhaps just 80 words _ that are
easier to download and display on wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   By listing sites that are WAP-enabled, AltaVista hope its index,
found at wap.raging.com, will become a standard of its own.
Currently a majority of the sites it lists are in Europe, where
mobile-phone usage is more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Google Inc., an AltaVista competitor, uses a technology that
translates sites written in traditional Web codes into another
mobile-friendly language. Earlier this month, Google announced a
deal with wireless-services provider Nextel Communications Inc. &QL; 
Hyperlinks unbound
</P>
<P>
   A New York company's software turns any typed text into a
hyperlink to other information on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The company is Zapper Technologies Inc. and its program, Zapper,
works with most PC applications. The software develops links to
financial, sports, reference, and shopping sites, and pastes to
them any word or phrase a user highlights with a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   If a user receives an e-mail mentioning the book ``In a
Sunburned Country'' by Bill Bryson, for instance, he could
highlight the title and be linked to Amazon.com, where the book is
for sale, or to a review at CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Zapper says it is in talks with several Internet portals,
including AltaVista, Excite, and AskJeeves. Zapper says it won't
limit searches to sites with which it has business agreements,
however.

<P>
   BURLINGAME, Calif. _ Guy Kawasaki is being wicked.
</P>
<P>
   As moderator to a panel of start-up chief executives, he asks a
question he knows will make them squirm.
</P>
<P>
   ``So are venture capitalists good for anything?'' Kawasaki lobs
with deliberate amiability, arching an eyebrow for effect.
</P>
<P>
   A few CEOs nervously chuckle as they ransack their brains for a
diplomatic answer. Kawasaki glows, knowing entrepreneurs privately
loathe venture capitalists _ call them ``vulture capitalists''
behind their backs _ but dare not say so in public for fear of
losing their funding.
</P>
<P>
   Being a troublemaker is all in a day's work for Kawasaki, best
known in Silicon Valley as Apple Computer Corp.'s one-time chief
evangelist (yes, that was the title), the man who turned down the
chance to interview for the CEO position at Yahoo, and now the CEO
of Garage.com, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He is also known here as a ceaseless self-promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Guy does best is promoting Guy,'' said Andy Hertzfeld,
one of the original engineers at Apple and now head of Eazel, a
Linux software company.
</P>
<P>
   This is something Kawasaki happily and bluntly acknowledges in
his one-page biography: ``Guy wasn't the first or the last
Macintosh evangelist, but he took the most credit.''
</P>
<P>
   It's in this realm of in-your-face ``Aikido marketing'' that
Kawasaki has excelled. What makes him bearable in polite company is
his biting humor, which he directs at himself just as often as he
aims it at others.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking to the guy who turned down the opportunity to
interview for the CEO position of Yahoo,'' said Kawasaki in a
recent interview. ``There were 10 search engines at the time,
including one from (Digital Equipment Corp.) called AltaVista. I
couldn't see how Yahoo would make it. So you see how easy it is to
be a bozo.''
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki also turned down the job because he had a second son on
the way, and the commute to work would have been too taxing on his
young family.
</P>
<P>
   Family is something he refers to often. He points out that his
grandfather, an immigrant from Japan, was a taxi driver in Hawaii,
where Kawasaki was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly weren't wealthy industrialists,'' he said. ``And we
didn't make motorcycles, either.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Kawasakis did well. His father, Duke Kawasaki, was a
Democratic state senator for Honolulu. Guy attended college at
Stanford University and majored in psychology. After a week in law
school, he quit because he ``couldn't take it.'' His calling became
clearer while he was attending business school at the University of
California at Los Angeles. He joined a jewelry company as a diamond
counter and left as vice president of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   His next job was at a software company, which was sold to a
larger company in Atlanta. Not wanting to relocate, Kawasaki cast
about for another job in California. He landed at Apple. It was
1983, and Apple was an irreverent upstart battling a formidable
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki left Apple in 1987, hacked around on various projects,
and eventually returned to Apple in 1995 as chief evangelist. He
left again in 1998 to become CEO of Garage.com, a company that
funds start-ups, matches investors with entrepreneurs, and stages
``boot camps'' throughout the country for would-be entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   At 46, Kawasaki still has an edge. He rises at 4:45 a.m. three
mornings a week to play basketball. His sarcasm continues to be
unsparing. And he is an unrelenting smart aleck. It's almost as if
he can't help himself.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, ``Rules for Revolutionaries: The Capitalist
Manifesto,'' he writes about naysayers, ``The higher you go in a
company, the less oxygen there is, so supporting intelligent life
becomes difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the book, he encourages start-ups to slum it.
``A lousy building and lousy furniture are necessary because
suffering is good for revolutionaries,'' he writes. ``It builds
cohesiveness; it creates a sense of urgency; and it focuses the
team on what's most important: shipping'' new products.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his thoughts on Apple, Kawasaki responds that as a
consumer he would like to see Apple make an ultra-lightweight
laptop to compete with Sony Corp.'s VAIO line of computers. ``I'd
like a laptop I can carry to five meetings a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a strategist, Kawasaki said, ``The bigger challenge for Apple
is that they have to make a computer that kills the Macintosh.
Right now, they're milking the Macintosh. But what they need to do
is jump to the next curve.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kawasaki is a man on today's curve, and he knows it. That's
why he relishes his current position as sifter of ideas for the
next generation of computing.
</P>
<P>
   As CEO of Garage.com, he sees hundreds of business plans float
across his desk each week. Today, the buzz is around companies
built on solid science, as opposed to marketing, he said. Companies
that focus on building the Internet's infrastructure or wireless
technology are hot. Internet retailers are not.
</P>
<P>
   The weirdest proposal he's seen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone actually submitted a business plan for buying a small,
Middle Eastern country and turning it into an amusement park,''
Kawasaki said. ``We turned him down.''

   E-COMMERCE AMAZON.COM TO OPEN FRENCH WEB SITE
</P>
<P>
   The online retailer Amazon.com will open a French-language Web
site, selling books, music and videos. The new site, Amazon.fr, is
the company's third venture outside the United States, after online
stores for Britain and Germany. A spokeswoman said the company
hoped to serve French speakers outside of France as well.
Amazon.com, based in Seattle, will operate the French site from
offices in Guyancourt and a distribution center in Orleans.
Separately, Amazon.com announced that it had expanded its marketing
alliance with America Online. No terms were disclosed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC SITE MAKING A SHIFT
</P>
<P>
   GetMusic, the online site owned by two big music labels,
Bertelsmann and Seagram's Universal Music group, is getting out of
selling music. GetMusic plans to announce Wednesday that it is
entering five European countries, but the music sales will be
handled by Bertelsmann's BOL unit. GetMusic is also looking for a
company to take over the music store it now runs on its original
site in the United States, perhaps CDNow, the ailing company that
Bertelsmann agreed to buy last month, said Andrew Nibley,
GetMusic's chief executive. Nibley asserted that GetMusic, with 1.2
million users, had strong prospects as a media company, earning
money from advertising. For now, it is the No. 1 site for Internet
users under the age of 12, thanks largely to its close ties to
Britney Spears and N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   BRONFMAN MAY TESTIFY AGAINST MP3.COM
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Seagram Co., Edgar J. Bronfman, Jr., is
expected to testify Wednesday in a federal trial being held to
determine the scope of the damages that MP3.com will pay Seagram's
Universal Music Group for violating its copyrights with its
Internet music service. MP3.com's chief executive, Michael
Robertson, concluded testifying before a skeptical Judge Jed Rakoff
on Tuesday, saying he had not set out to willfully violate
Universal's copyrights when he created an online database of
thousands of albums.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET BET IS BUYING 360HIPHOP
</P>
<P>
   BET.com, a Web site created in February as adjunct to the Black
Entertainment Television cable network, has reached a tentative
agreement to buy a key competitor, 360HIPHOP.com. That Web site,
started in June by Russell Simmons, the founder of Def Jam Records,
is geared to music trends and information. Under the agreement, the
two companies will combine business operations, but maintain
separate Web sites. BET.com is ranked among the most popular
African-American-oriented sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   NEW VERTICALONE BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   VerticalOne, a unit of the S1 Corp., is expected to announce
Wednesday that it will provide account-aggregation services to
Yahoo and to Wells Fargo bank, allowing them to provide a single
place on the Internet where their customers can keep all of their
financial data, like the balances in their bank and brokerage
accounts, frequent-flier programs and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   HARDWARE GATEWAY TRIES TAX PROMOTION
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to take the no-tax edge away from pure direct-sales
rivals like Dell, Gateway will temporarily absorb the sales tax for
consumers who buy desktop and notebook PCs at most of its 290
Country Store locations. The promotion, which began Tuesday and
ends Thursday, was started after Gateway executives saw sales spike
when states like Pennsylvania and South Carolina offered sales-tax
blackout periods to their residents. ``The response to that program
was huge, so we decided to extend it to additional states,'' said
Brad Williams, a company spokesman.

 &HT;    Words to the wise if you're new to Texas
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ A friend of mine who moved here a decade or
so from California gave me something undoubtedly off the Internet,
entitled ``If You Are New To Texas.'' As a transplanted Texan,
albeit one who's been here for more than 30 years, I can identify
with the feeling that one has entered a strange if fascinating land
with a culture quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of advice if you have recently crossed the
Red or Sabine rivers. And you natives ought to identify with some
of these, also. After all, someday you might be sent somewhere
different, where people don't bury hamburgers in a mound of lettuce
and tomato and actually drink iced coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Pray that doesn't happen. Most of these came from my friend's
photocopy. A few I modified to fit our neck of the woods, but none
are original with me, so blame someone else if you're offended.
</P>
<P>
   Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed later
how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Just because you can drive on snow doesn't mean we can. Stay
home the two days out of each decade that it snows.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to hearing, ``Y'all ain't from around hear, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   If you hear a good ol' boy say, ``Hey, y'all watch this,'' get
out of the way. It's likely the last words he'll ever say.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to hearing in the dog days of summer these two phrases:
``It's not the heat; it's the humidity,'' and ``You think it's hot
now, wait 'til August.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisket is not ``cooked'' in an oven.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell us how you did it ``up there.'' Nobody cares.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Mountain oysters are not oysters. Don't ask. Don't eat
them.
</P>
<P>
   The value of a parking space isn't determined by how close it is
to the door, but by the availability of shade.
</P>
<P>
   Tea has ice in it. Always. Coffee never does.
</P>
<P>
   You can put ranch dressing on anything and make it taste better.
</P>
<P>
   Coldbeer is one word.
</P>
<P>
   Never say anything bad about Tom Landry or Stevie Ray Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Learn to say ``Yes, sir'' or ``No, m'am'' to anyone older than
you. If you're smart, you'll say it to everybody except teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The state from which Ted Kennedy hails is pronounced
``Massatoosets'' down here.
</P>
<P>
   If it comes in a can and isn't coldbeer, it's called ``Coke''
even if it's a Sprite. And Dr Pepper is the preferred soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Best peel that ``Gore 2000'' bumper sticker off your car. He
isn't going to win Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Men should never wear a Speedo to the swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Even rich folks have water bugs in their house. Killing them is
great sport but won't cut down on the population significantly.
</P>
<P>
   It's pronounced ``faraints.'' You can spend a fortune trying to
poison them, or you can just mow the mounds over and get on with
life.
</P>
<P>
   It's considered common courtesy to pull over on the shoulder on
a two-lane road to let someone pass you, even if you're going 10

   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ Think times are good now?
You haven't lived until you've lived in the 1950s. A friend sent me
this bit of e-mail fluff that may or may not be authentic, but it
is interesting to compare just how far we've come in half a
century. (Ernest Murray is managing editor of The Lufkin Daily
News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ It is not often that you have a chance to
witness a historic event. Mine came on a spring day in 1952 at
Lafargue High School, located near the banks of the Red River in
Avoyelles Parish, La. It was during an eighth-grade science class I
was teaching. I was lecturing on the characteristics of poisonous
snakes when Elton Lee Lofton, a redhead from lower Vick, raised his
hand. ``Do you believe in stinging snakes?'' he asked.''No, Elton,
I don't,'' I said. ``Grandpa said you wouldn't,'' Elton said.

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ A friend of mine who moved
here a decade or so from California gave me something undoubtedly
off the Internet, entitled ``If You Are New To Texas.'' As a
transplanted Texan, albeit one who's been here for more than 30
years, I can identify with the feeling that one has entered a
strange if fascinating land with a culture quite different. Here is
a sampling of advice if you have recently crossed the Red or Sabine
rivers.(Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Some Texas Republicans have
been contemplating their slots in a George W. Bush presidential
administration. Others are looking ahead to the political musical
chairs that will start when the Texas governor moves into the White
House. Several members of the Texas Senate are jockeying, with
varying degrees of subtlety, to become lieutenant governor when
Rick Perry moves up to replace Bush. But as Democrat Al Gore's
bounce in the polls was a little stronger than the Bush folks would
have hoped and Bush has struggled to fill in the details of his
trillion-dollar tax cut idea, ponder this:

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ HOUSTON, Texas _ It is said that Texas air
pollution got built into an issue in 1999 because Texas'
jogger-in-chief was running for president. Actually in this city it
took some other runners to make it so. Last October, the Deer Park
High School girls cross country team went for its daily four-miler.
The whole squad shortly was bent over coughing and wheezing,
throats raw. Coach Mike Walker instantly knew something was wrong.
He was right. They had been flexing their lungs in what Los Angeles
would have classified a Stage 1 Smog Alert, which to the Houston
man on the street was a day without discernible alarm. (John Young

 &HT;    Living la vida '50s
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Think times are good now? You haven't lived
until you've lived in the 1950s. A friend sent me this bit of
e-mail fluff that may or may not be authentic, but it is
interesting to compare just how far we've come in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   These are a few things they were saying in '50s:
</P>
<P>
   _ I'll tell you one thing, if things keep going the way they
are, it's going to be impossible to buy a weeks groceries for $20.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have you seen the new cars coming out next year? It won't be
long when $3,000 will only buy a used one.
</P>
<P>
   _ If cigarettes keep going up in price, I'm going to quit. A
quarter a pack is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   _ Did you hear the post office is thinking about charging a dime
just to mail a letter?
</P>
<P>
   _ The government is wanting to get its hands on everything.
Pretty soon it's going to be impossible to run a family business or
farm.
</P>
<P>
   _ If they raise the minimum wage to $1, nobody will be able to
hire outside help at the store.
</P>
<P>
   _ When I first started driving, who would have thought gas would
someday cost 50 cents a gallon. Guess we'd be better off leaving
the car in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kids today are impossible. Those duck tail hair cuts make it
impossible to stay groomed. Next thing you know, boys will be
wearing their hair as long as the girls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also, their music drives me wild. This ``Rock Around The
Clock'' thing is nothing but racket.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pretty soon you won't be able to buy a good 10-cent cigar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Did you see where some baseball player just signed a contract
for $75,000 a year just to play ball? It wouldn't surprise me if
someday they'll be making more than the president.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you suppose television will ever reach our part of the
country?
</P>
<P>
   _ I never thought I'd see the day all our kitchen appliances
would be electric. They are even making electric typewriters now.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's too bad things are so tough nowadays. I see where a few
married women are having to work to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   _ It won't be long before young couples are going to have to
hire someone to watch their kids so they can both work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marriage doesn't mean a thing anymore, Those Hollywood stars
seem to be getting divorced at the drop of a hat.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'll tell you one thing. If my kid ever talks back to me, they
won't be able to sit down for a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Next thing you know is, the government will start paying us
not to grow crops.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm just afraid the Volkswagen car is going to open the door
to a the door to a whole lot of foreign business.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thank goodness I won't live to see the day when the government
takes half our income in taxes. I sometimes wonder if we are
electing the best people to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _ Why in the world would you want to send your daughter to
college? Isn't she going to get married? It would be different if
she could be doctor or a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is no sense going on vacation. It costs nearly $15 a
night to stay in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anyway no one can afford to be sick, $35 a day in the hospital
is too rich for my blood.
</P>
<P>
   _ If a few idiots want to risk their necks flying across the
country that's fine, but nothing will ever replace trains.
</P>
<P>
   _ I don't know about you but if they raise the price of coffee
to 15 cents, I'll just have to drink mine at home.
</P>
<P>
   _ If they think I'll pay 50 cents for a hair cut, forget it.
I'll have my wife learn to cut hair.
</P>
<P>
   _ We won't be going out much anymore. Our baby sitter informed
us she wants 50 cents an hour. Kids think money grows on trees.

   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA _ The tire crisis for
Bridgestone/Firestone has become a crisis for other tire
manufacturers as well. As consumers look for alternatives as
replacement tires, other manufacturers find that this windfall of
sales has left them unable to respond to the unexpected demand.
Goodyear expects to ramp up production of the tires sizes in
question by as much as 50 percent. Other manufacturers are planning
similar increases in production.(Sharp, Atlanta

robbed of a normal childhood. Growing up is hard enough. Imagine
having to do it in front of millions of people watching your every
move or snickering about every goofy-looking pimple you get. The
pressure to perform is also insanely intense. Many adult actors
can't even take the heat and often resort to drugs and alcohol to
cope. Just think what it's like for a kid to overhear a producer

 &HT;    If Bush loses
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Some Texas Republicans have been contemplating
their slots in a George W. Bush presidential administration. Others
are looking ahead to the political musical chairs that will start
when the Texas governor moves into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Texas Senate are jockeying, with varying
degrees of subtlety, to become lieutenant governor when Rick Perry
moves up to replace Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But as Democrat Al Gore's bounce in the polls was a little
stronger than the Bush folks would have hoped and Bush has
struggled to fill in the details of his trillion-dollar tax cut
idea, ponder this:
</P>
<P>
   What if Bush loses?
</P>
<P>
   Personally, it may not be all that devastating. Bush has lost
before _ a Midland-to-Lubbock congressional seat in 1978 to
then-Democrat Kent Hance _ and watched his dad lose in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But a loss might change Bush's oft-stated belief that as
governor, he has the best job in the world. What if his hard-won
1999 tax cut runs into a too-tight state budget in 2001?
</P>
<P>
   And then, take legislative and congressional redistricting _
please. Even with Republicans playing strong roles for the first
time ever, it will have the grace of the Houston Fat Stock Show. It
won't be pretty. And probably not fun.
</P>
<P>
   And a defeated, lame-duck Bush might not be able to keep the lid
on the Republicans pols' ambitions for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Perry has said he'll run for governor whether Bush wins or
loses, assuming Bush doesn't seek a third term. U.S. Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison says she probably wouldn't run against an
incumbent Republican governor. But if Bush loses, she's running.
</P>
<P>
   Expect her to spend a few million bucks of her federal campaign
swag this year to swamp Democrat Gene Kelly, who won the nomination
even though he's never danced in a movie and has no money to spend
on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose is to keep the Hutchison brand hot, just in case.
Word filters back that she'd much rather be one governor living in
a mansion in Austin than one of a body of 100 in D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Perry continues to fill his coffers using Washington-style,
heavy-handed fund raising so he can stare down other competitors,
including Hutchison. As the most powerful lieutenant governor in
the land, he's in a good position to do that.
</P>
<P>
   But as an incumbent senator who'll still be around if she loses
a governor's race, Hutchison also is in a good fundraising
position. If Bush loses, it'll be interesting to see who blinks.
</P>
<P>
   Some political prognosticators speculate about a Perry-Hutchison
deal: Perry defers to Hutchison for governor and runs for
re-election; she then appoints him to the U.S. Senate. But that
kind of deal could be troublesome for Perry in the special election
that would come soon after the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Attorney General John Cornyn, who like Perry was
making the speechifying rounds to other state delegations at the
Republican National Convention, continues to look like the guy
central casting would pick for a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander reportedly is eyeing the
lieutenant governor's job if Perry leaves for whatever reason.
</P>
<P>
   Land Commissioner David Dewhurst, a millionaire a couple hundred
times over, has seemed pointed at senator or governor _ maybe with
lieutenant governor as a stepping stone. But he is facing a
divorce, which could affect his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Face it: 2001 and 2002 are going to be intriguing political
theater, whether the governor is in Austin or in Washington.

 &HT;    Dispatches from Dreamsville: Bitten by the stinging snake
 &HT;    For release Friday, Sept. 1, 2000
 &HT;    (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional column in
which readers share with Cox senior writer Joe Murray their
memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or at
least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
 &HT;    By Clarence Roy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not often that you have a chance to witness a historic
event. Mine came on a spring day in 1952 at Lafargue High School,
located near the banks of the Red River in Avoyelles Parish, La. It
was during an eighth-grade science class I was teaching.
</P>
<P>
   I was lecturing on the characteristics of poisonous snakes when
Elton Lee Lofton, a redhead from lower Vick, raised his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe in stinging snakes?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Elton, I don't,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandpa said you wouldn't,'' Elton said.
</P>
<P>
   This last remark annoyed me somewhat, but I ignored it.
Addressing the class, I explained:
</P>
<P>
   ``What Elton is referring to is a superstition, in which a
particular kind of snake, when cornered, defends itself by
injecting its venom through a stinger lodged on the tip of its
tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no scientific evidence that such a snake
exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Elton's hand was up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got proof that there are stinging snakes,'' he announced.
</P>
<P>
   He was not going to drop the subject. ``All right,'' I said,
``make your case.''
</P>
<P>
   All eyes turned toward Elton. He folded his arms, leaned forward
and with uncharacteristic gravity began this tale:
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer Grandpa decided that he needed a new barn. He made
a drawing of it, figured out the lumber and calculated how many
logs it would take. Then he got his good friend Jessie Cole to help
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bright and early the next day, they hitched up the team,
packed the saws and axes, and took off for the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they didn't know is that a little farther down the trail
was a stinging snake all coiled up waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That snake knew he couldn't get Grandpa or Jessie because they
were too high up in the wagon, but he could sting one of the mules.
</P>
<P>
   ``At just the right time when the team was in range, that snake
pointed his stinger at the closest mule and struck. But his aim was
off, and instead of hitting the mule, he hit the wagon tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stinging snakes have a lot of trouble hitting the target.
That's because the stinger is going one way, and the eyes are
looking the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, sir, those mules reared up something awful, and it took
the longest time to settle them down. In all the confusion, the
snake slithered away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that snake must have put a bunch of poison in the wagon
tongue because it started swelling and swelling, and kept on
swelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandpa, Jessie and the mules just watched, mouths open, not
believing what they were seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that tongue finally quit swelling, it was huge. Grandpa
looked at it for a long time before he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Jessie,' he said, 'I got an idea. We're not going to saw up
logs for that barn, no sir! We're going to saw up this here swole
up wagon tongue!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they walked back home, got plenty of help and hauled
that tongue to the sawmill where it was cut up for lumber - enough
lumber to build his barn and then some.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a while, but Grandpa and Jessie built that barn. Man,
it was pretty. There were stables for the mules, a corncrib,
hayloft, even room for his wagon to get it out of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so proud of it that he decided to paint it bright red.
But he didn't have enough paint. So, in order to make it stretch,
he thinned it with turpentine _ a lot of turpentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandpa and Jessie finished painting that barn one afternoon,
but the next day when they went to admire it, they were really
shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barn had shrunk! It was so small it wouldn't accommodate a
family of mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandpa said he could've just kicked himself real hard. He
should have known that the turpentine would have drawn the poison
out of the lumber.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough was enough. Elton had gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that you don't expect us to swallow this preposterous
yarn,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandpa said you wouldn't believe it,'' Elton said, ``so he
told me to bring the proof.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Elton reached under his desk and pulled out a brown
wrinkled bag. With great care, he removed the contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thar she is!'' he said proudly as he laid the tiny structure
on his desk. Right before our eyes, sitting on Elton's desk was his
Grandpa's barn, complete in every detail. Elton had single-handedly
taken on the scientific community, and with undeniable proof,
backed it down.
</P>
<P>
   I broke the silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to apologize for being skeptical, Elton, but you must
admit that without that barn, you story would have been hard to
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   I then sent for the principal, Richard Guillory, who when told
the story and shown the evidence, was so impressed that he declared
that day ``Stinging Snake Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Elton graduated from Lafargue High School some years later, and
I lost track of him.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever I recall this incident, I feel of debt of gratitude
for all of the Elton Lee Loftons of this world.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a striking sunset affects an otherwise dull and dreary
sky, they find a way to add a little color to our sometimes very
ordinary days.
</P>
<P>
   So here's to you, Elton Lee Lofton, wherever you are.
</P>
<P>
   Others may have forgotten, but I will always remember the time
you ``proved'' to me and your classmates that stinging snakes are
for real.

 &HT;    Reputable dealers best bet in getting replacement tires
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The tire crisis for Bridgestone/Firestone has become a
crisis for other tire manufacturers as well.
</P>
<P>
   As consumers look for alternatives as replacement tires, other
manufacturers find that this windfall of sales has left them unable
to respond to the unexpected demand. Goodyear expects to ramp up
production of the tires sizes in question by as much as 50 percent.
Other manufacturers are planning similar increases in production.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone has recalled about 6.5 million of its truck and
sport-utility tires after reports of tread separations leading to a
series of accidents mostly involving Ford Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   A dangerous byproduct of the lack of replacement Firestone
tires, coupled with some consumers' unwillingness to use Firestones
on their vehicles, has produced a situation where owners are close
to panic, looking at anything that is black, round and holds air
for their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   That is a very dangerous scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear's Chuck Sinclair reports, ``Despite the best efforts of
all tire companies to supply the market as quickly as possible with
replacement tires ... any consumers seeking replacements may find
the tires extremely difficult to find . . . or even end up with the
wrong tires on their vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Goodyear, it's a serious mistake to use the wrong
size tires that could put the passengers at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips to be an informed vehicle owner and consumer
for buying replacement tires _ or any tires, for that matter:
</P>
<P>
   Refer to your vehicle owner's manual for recommended replacement
tire information and adhere strictly to those standards. If the
manual requires a tire with the designation ``P'' for p-metric
(which means the tire is a passenger car tire, which produces a
less trucklike ride), it should not be replaced with an ``LT'' or
light truck tire.
</P>
<P>
   Shop at a reputable retailer. Go to someone you trust who will
assist you in finding the right tire for your application.
</P>
<P>
   If you are unable to find a suitable replacement tire for your
vehicle, Goodyear engineers offer the following precautionary steps
until your tire of choice arrives at your retailer:
</P>
<P>
   Have your tires visually inspected by a professional. Any
reputable retailer should do this free of charge. Be advised that
the visual inspection can only detect what the eye can see, and
doesn't mean that there are no potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Check your tire inflation once a week to be certain they meet
with the acceptable vehicle recommendations. There likely is a
difference between the maximum inflation listed on the sidewall of
the tire and what the tire vehicle manufacturer recommends for the
vehicle. Use the vehicle recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Do a walk-around inspection of your vehicle before driving it.
</P>
<P>
   Always fasten your seat belts, and make certain everyone in the
vehicle has their seat belt fastened as well.
</P>
<P>
   Obey all posted speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   Get in touch with your retailer to reserve a set of replacement
tires.

 &HT;    EDS: This is the first in a five part series on air pollution.
 &HT;    It took human faces to alert Houston on air quality
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON, Texas _ It is said that Texas air pollution got built
into an issue in 1999 because Texas' jogger-in-chief was running
for president. Actually in this city it took some other runners to
make it so.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Deer Park High School girls cross country team
went for its daily four-miler. The whole squad shortly was bent
over coughing and wheezing, throats raw. Coach Mike Walker
instantly knew something was wrong. He was right.
</P>
<P>
   They had been flexing their lungs in what Los Angeles would have
classified a Stage 1 Smog Alert, which to the Houston man on the
street was a day without discernible alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle stories about the events at Deer Park brought
it all home.
</P>
<P>
   Though a smog advisory had been issued that day on a city Web
site, Houston had done little to warn anyone. Two days later, a
judge ordered the city to start advising schools on smog alerts.
</P>
<P>
   The respiratory distress signals of these runners were the
sounds of a city and state in denial.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Park is situated near the Houston Ship Channel close to
refineries and a host of petrochemical industries. As a source of
wealth, the refinery hub is a gold mine. As a source of pollution,
it is ground zero.
</P>
<P>
   However, experts say that if every refinery in the ship channel
closed, Houston could still be out of compliance for federal air
standards because of automobiles, utilities and other industrial
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Houston supplanted Los Angeles for the No. 1 ranking
in most air non-attainment days. Houston had 52 days in 1999 in
which it exceeded the federal level for ozone, Los Angeles had 41.
</P>
<P>
   This year, pressured by the Environmental Protection Agency, the
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission issued a set of
lifestyle-crimping proposals for Houston, including:
</P>
<P>
   A 55 mph speed limit starting in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   An average 90 percent reduction in major industries' emissions
of smog-producing nitrous oxide.
</P>
<P>
   A ban on the use of heavy construction equipment and
gasoline-powered lawn equipment from 6 a.m. to noon.
</P>
<P>
   Such an attention-getter is not Houston's plight alone.
Dallas-Fort Worth, reclassified from ``moderate'' to ``serious'' in
non-attainment of federal air quality standards, also faces similar
restrictions, with Washington threatening to withhold $300 million
in highway funds.
</P>
<P>
   Tough? Merciless? Some will say the federal gods actually have
been merciful. The EPA is enforcing the Clean Air Act of 1990,
after all. That means, Thelma, that our policy makers have been on
the lamb 10 years. Texas is some runner.
</P>
<P>
   The Deer Park coach whose girls had such problems on that
October day now says they train with pollution in mind. If an alert
is issued, work-outs are abbreviated. And the team runs more often
in the evening, when the sun's cooking of nitrous oxide into ozone
is starting to subside. Walker admits that he now knows more about
ozone than he ever wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of a single night's run aren't what bothers Walker,
a lifelong Houston resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major worry is the long-term exposure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, much of Texas is being welcomed to Walker's world.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings start this month on the Dallas and Houston pollution
reduction plans. El Paso continues to struggle with some of the
nation's worst air pollution. Meanwhile, Austin, San Antonio, Tyler
and Longview are on the bubble for potential EPA sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   After soft-pedaling a major public health issue too long, Texas
is hearing foot steps.

   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ Think times are good now?
You haven't lived until you've lived in the 1950s. A friend sent me

is interesting to compare just how far we've come in half a
century. (Ernest Murray is managing editor of The Lufkin Daily

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ It is not often that you have a chance to
witness a historic event. Mine came on a spring day in 1952 at
Lafargue High School, located near the banks of the Red River in
Avoyelles Parish, La. It was during an eighth-grade science class I
was teaching. I was lecturing on the characteristics of poisonous
snakes when Elton Lee Lofton, a redhead from lower Vick, raised his
hand. ``Do you believe in stinging snakes?'' he asked.''No, Elton,
I don't,'' I said. ``Grandpa said you wouldn't,'' Elton said.

years, I can identify with the feeling that one has entered a
strange if fascinating land with a culture quite different. Here is

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Some Texas Republicans have
been contemplating their slots in a George W. Bush presidential
administration. Others are looking ahead to the political musical
chairs that will start when the Texas governor moves into the White
House. Several members of the Texas Senate are jockeying, with
varying degrees of subtlety, to become lieutenant governor when
Rick Perry moves up to replace Bush. But as Democrat Al Gore's
bounce in the polls was a little stronger than the Bush folks would
have hoped and Bush has struggled to fill in the details of his
trillion-dollar tax cut idea, ponder this:

 &HT;    Reputable dealers best bet in getting replacement tires
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The tire crisis for Bridgestone/Firestone has become a
crisis for other tire manufacturers as well.
</P>
<P>
   As consumers look for alternatives as replacement tires, other
manufacturers find that this windfall of sales has left them unable
to respond to the unexpected demand. Goodyear expects to ramp up
production of the tires sizes in question by as much as 50 percent.
Other manufacturers are planning similar increases in production.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone has recalled about 6.5 million of its truck and
sport-utility tires after reports of tread separations leading to a
series of accidents mostly involving Ford Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   A dangerous byproduct of the lack of replacement Firestone
tires, coupled with some consumers' unwillingness to use Firestones
on their vehicles, has produced a situation where owners are close
to panic, looking at anything that is black, round and holds air
for their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   That is a very dangerous scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear's Chuck Sinclair reports, ``Despite the best efforts of
all tire companies to supply the market as quickly as possible with
replacement tires ... any consumers seeking replacements may find
the tires extremely difficult to find . . . or even end up with the
wrong tires on their vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Goodyear, it's a serious mistake to use the wrong
size tires that could put the passengers at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips to be an informed vehicle owner and consumer
for buying replacement tires _ or any tires, for that matter:
</P>
<P>
   Refer to your vehicle owner's manual for recommended replacement
tire information and adhere strictly to those standards. If the
manual requires a tire with the designation ``P'' for p-metric
(which means the tire is a passenger car tire, which produces a
less trucklike ride), it should not be replaced with an ``LT'' or
light truck tire.
</P>
<P>
   Shop at a reputable retailer. Go to someone you trust who will
assist you in finding the right tire for your application.
</P>
<P>
   If you are unable to find a suitable replacement tire for your
vehicle, Goodyear engineers offer the following precautionary steps
until your tire of choice arrives at your retailer:
</P>
<P>
   Have your tires visually inspected by a professional. Any
reputable retailer should do this free of charge. Be advised that
the visual inspection can only detect what the eye can see, and
doesn't mean that there are no potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Check your tire inflation once a week to be certain they meet
with the acceptable vehicle recommendations. There likely is a
difference between the maximum inflation listed on the sidewall of
the tire and what the tire vehicle manufacturer recommends for the
vehicle. Use the vehicle recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Do a walk-around inspection of your vehicle before driving it.
</P>
<P>
   Always fasten your seat belts, and make certain everyone in the
vehicle has their seat belt fastened as well.
</P>
<P>
   Obey all posted speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   Get in touch with your retailer to reserve a set of replacement
tires.

robbed of a normal childhood. Growing up is hard enough. Imagine
having to do it in front of millions of people watching your every

pressure to perform is also insanely intense. Many adult actors
can't even take the heat and often resort to drugs and alcohol to

UPN CUTS SMASH AND TRASH FROM HIP-HOP AWARDS BASH

 By RICHARD ROEPER  
 c.2000 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When UPN announced it would be airing the Source Magazine
Hip-Hop Music Awards as planned on Aug. 29, I made a note to
program the VCR menu for two hours of rompin', stompin'
entertainment. This would be better than the WWF!
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I cared to have a video record of performances by
the likes of Mos Def, Dead Prez, Cash Money Millionaires or even
Lil' Bow Wow _ although I do prefer the work of Lil' Bow Wow to the
musical musings of Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg and Underdog, come to
think of it.
</P>
<P>
   I just wanted to see the fights.
</P>
<P>
   The awards program itself took place Aug. 22, at the Pasadena
Civic Auditorium. (As is the case with those cutting-edge MTV
Awards programs, the not-so-cutting-edge execs behind these shows
like a built-in time delay _ the better to delete expletives, edit
some of the more incoherent ramblings, ``tile out'' any inadvertent
nudity and most important, find the best slots for all the
commercials.)
</P>
<P>
   But there was trouble even before the presentations began. For
example, West Coast rapper DJ Quik reportedly was slugged as he
walked down the red carpet, drawing the attention of police
officers who briefly detained the Quik-meister before allowing him
to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's the kind of thing you don't see happen at the Academy
Awards, though it's amazing that some big-gowned starlet hasn't
gone after Joan Rivers or her equally frightening daughter by now.
</P>
<P>
   The Hip-Hop Awards taping was supposed to begin at 5 p.m., but
audience members were still hanging in the lobby and in the aisles
well after 6 p.m. _ and according to one source who was at the
show, the aisles never were fully cleared.
</P>
<P>
   An altercation broke out in the center aisle near the beginning
of the program, but the show continued, and five awards were handed
out before the real trouble started. (Note: Eminem was the winner
in the Best Lyricist category. Then again, Paul Simon wasn't
nominated this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after a performance by Lil' Kim and Mobb Deep, fights
broke out behind the stage and in the audience, resulting in the
surreal onstage image of awards presenters, uniformed police
officers, bodyguards, muscle-heads in Death Row T-shirts, TV crew
members and assorted other characters all milling about.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, audience members were finding a creative use for
their ``gimme bags,'' which contained such goodies as bottled water
and CDs _ they began hurling the freebies at each other and at the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the cops decided enough was enough, and they shut down
the show and cleared the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests were made that night, but Pasadena police later
announced they were seeking rapper E-40 (real name Earl Stevens) to
question him about allegedly assaulting rival rapper Andre Dow,
whose facial injuries required a brief hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, the televised images of the fights on newscasts
across the country did nothing for hip-hop's already badly bruised
image.
</P>
<P>
   So when I heard UPN was proceeding with plans to air the show, I
made rare plans to actually watch UPN. Maybe after showing some
documentary-style footage of the night's events, they'd have an
electronic town hall meeting featuring rappers, eyewitnesses, reps
of the major record labels, police officials and fans. It could be
a combination of ``Cops'' and ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what happened. Instead, they pretended the fights
never happened and showed a sanitized version of the evening,
augmented by footage taken days after the actual event.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those awards that had not been given out, we'll be taping
those presentations between now and the broadcast,'' a UPN
spokesman before the broadcast. ``So it should be seamless for the
viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, seamless _ and completely unrepresentative of what
actually happened on the night in question.
</P>
<P>
   Kinda reminds me of the 2-hour, 30-minute Woodstock '99 video,
which is all about the music and the carefree baring of breasts and
the mud and the friendly moshing, but somehow manages to sidestep
the complaints about price gouging and unsanitary conditions, the
presence of harder drugs, the nearly catastrophic fires, the
vandalism and the numerous reports of sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Rock or rap, no matter. There's no need to let reality get in
the way of a tidy and neatly packaged profit machine.

<P>
   BURLINGTON, Mass. _ Need a bathroom fireplace for cocooning in
the loo? Then maybe a visit to Expo Design Center is in order.
</P>
<P>
   At this huge new showroom store, the claim is that customers can
find just about everything they possibly could want for indoor
remodeling projects, including ``shower towers,'' whirlpool baths,
steam cabinets _ and, yes, even fireplaces _ for transforming a
humble bathroom into a sumptuous sanctuary for private retreats.
</P>
<P>
   There are also opulent kitchens on display that might wow
home-decor guru Martha Stewart, and other sections focus on
flooring, rugs, appliances, windows, lighting, and patios.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Home Depot Inc. to help sustain company growth, Expo
Design Center is opening its first Massachusetts store here.
</P>
<P>
   If Home Depot targets do-it-yourselfers, Expo Design Center aims
to provide one-stop shopping and service to a more upscale crowd
that wants wall-to-wall style and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Expo Design Center prominently features kitchen and bathroom
showrooms that look like something straight out of Martha Stewart
Living, but Expo president Bryant Scott insists the store is
affordable for nearly all homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Expo Design Center uses a good-better-best strategy that means
merchandise is available in several price ranges.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a kitchen redone for $50,000, but you can also
have one redone for $7,000,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   If Home Depot is known as a no-frills paradise for handy men and
women, Expo Design Center targets consumers who may hire private
contractors to help them on big remodeling projects.
</P>
<P>
   Expo Design Center customers are more ``buy-it-yourselfers''
than ``do-it-yourselfers,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   With only about a 10 percent product overlap, Expo Design Center
seeks to complement Home Depot. One merchandise category that
neither store stocks in depth is furniture.
</P>
<P>
   With about 1,000 stores and $38.4 billion in 1999 sales,
Atlanta-based Home Depot is a retail legend of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   But even as it reports solid quarterly earnings, Home Depot has
seen its stock price drop by nearly 20 percent this year. Among
factors cited for the drop are low lumber prices, fears of slowing
consumer spending, high investor expectations, and Wall Street's
general disenchantment with retailers.
</P>
<P>
   For Home Depot, Expo Design Center gets the company into a
business with some pricier product lines. It also gives Home Depot
a second vehicle for domestic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot has been testing Expo Design Centers since 1991, and
nearly 20 stores are now open. The plan is to have about 200 Expo
stores throughout North America by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois-based Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co. is experimenting with a
similar, even larger store concept called the Great Indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Three such stores are currently open _ none on the East Coast.
But there are plans to quickly ramp up to 150 locations over the
next few years, a Sears spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Could the two titans battle it out over the home-decor market
some day? That's a possibility, some Wall Street analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Scott thinks Expo Design Center fulfills an unmet need. ``Expo
provides a unique atmosphere where customers can easily see how
various interior design elements fit together, helping take the
guesswork out of home design.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Burlington store manager Jack Racine: ``This is an idea
store. It tries to get people excited about interior design.''

INSULATING BASEMENT CEILING WILL SAVE ON FUEL BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My basement ceiling joists sit right on top of the concrete
foundation. Can I insulate the space between the joists where they
meet the outside border joist? There is only a 1 1/2-inch joist at
the border of the basement, between me and the cold outdoors, and I
think I am losing a lot of basement heat in winter.
</P>
<P>
   TRYING TO KEEP WARM
</P>
<P>
   A. It is unusual to have joists directly on the concrete, but,
then again, many weird things are done to houses. There is usually
a wood sill between joists and concrete or stone, but what you have
will do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you're right about there being very little protection
between you and the great outdoors through those border joists, but
you can insulate between the joists where they meet the border
joists. And, why not insulate the entire ceiling while you're at
it? You will save big bucks in heating bills because heat is lost
through any uninsulated barrier from inside to outside, including
the cold basement.
</P>
<P>
   Buy 6-inch-thick fiberglass with a paper backing. This paper, a
vapor barrier, goes face up, touching the floor above. Hold the
insulation in place with pointed wires, stuffed between each set of
joists, every 24 inches. Do this whether you live in the basement
or not.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The fireplace in my condo does not draft enough. The chimneys
were cleaned, but that was not the problem. When I burn Presto or
other compressed-fiber logs, I get an odor throughout the house.
Not smoky, but hazy. When I burn wood, this does not happen. But
wood is hard to store without getting termites on my deck.
</P>
<P>
   I have heard that real wood burns hotter, and causes smoke to
draft better. Could this be what is happening? If so, I'll have to
give up on the Presto and burn real wood. What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   SHARON ALLEN, California
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you answered your own question: Firewood burns hotter
than the Presto and creates a better draft. You can store small
amounts of wood on your deck, say a day's worth, without fear of
termites. Besides, termites do not infest all wood, and if they are
in firewood they will not last very long because they must go to
their nests in the ground twice a day. They are in the wood only to
eat it. Firewood is more likely to be infested by carpenter ants.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to improve the fireplace draft is to open a window
in the same room as the fireplace, to provide it with more air.
This is not practical, but it will work. Or, install a duct from
the outside to your fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I live in a loft downtown, and I would like to strip the
paint off the brick walls. There are 450 square feet of it. How can
I do it? Would sandblasting work?
</P>
<P>
   BRUCE EDWARDS, Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. Don't even think of it. That is the domestic equivalent of
the Big Dig. It will take forever and be plagued by cost overruns.
I don't even think sandblasting is allowed anymore, and if it is,
it would be very expensive. So would any other method of
professional stripping. Maybe you could apply thin brick facing, or
let New England Brickmaster do it; it is real brick, but also
pricey.
</P>
<P>
   Live with the paint; if it is a light color at least you are
getting some light reflection off it.
</P>
<P>
   But you could try a cartoon treatment: paint the brick (brick)
red, then paint the mortar joints white or gray. It will look like
a stage set, but might be fun, even a small area. Or, paint
different sections different colors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How long should I wait after power-washing siding before
painting? I'd guess that some wait would be necessary for siding to
dry out.
</P>
<P>
   JOSEPH DeLAURENSON, Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Wait two to three weeks during dry weather to let painted
wood or fiber cement dry out. Do not power-wash vinyl, aluminum, or
asbestos-cement shingles. Water that gets caught behind the vinyl
or aluminum will take forever to dry out, and power-washing can
release asbestos fibers from asbestos cement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My bathroom exhaust fan is in the ceiling, attached to the
joists. The fan is not excessively loud, but vibrations on the
floor above are annoying. How can I dampen the vibrations? The
house is 175 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ANNOYED, in Bath, Maine
</P>
<P>
   A. For starters, put a heavy pad and rug on the floor above.
Next, dismount the fan housing and try to separate it from the
joists, using connectors like those used to mount an engine in an
automobile. Or, dismount the housing and insert nylon or neoprene
washers between housing legs and the joists.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have an old clothes rack secured to the wall. How can I
refinish it so I can hang clothes on it without staining them?
</P>
<P>
   DAN DANIELS, Harwich, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. For a clothes rack, it is best to keep the wood plain and
unfinished. To do that, wash the rack with straight bleach, rinse
thoroughly, and let dry. It would be a good idea to sand the dowels
to take off any raised grain caused by the water in the bleach. If
you want to paint the rack, apply a latex enamel undercoater,
followed by an eggshell-finish latex wall paint or semigloss latex
enamel.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, replace the dowels.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Mass. _ This is a story of coincidences in life, of
the way that life meanders sometimes before bringing you around
full circle.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, 9-year-old Joshua Winer moved to a house
on a cul-de-sac in suburban Wayland, next door to a girl named
Sharon Halperin. She was 9, too, and they became best friends. They
went bicycling together, walked to school together, and did art
projects at Winer's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always painting,'' Halperin recalls. ``We'd do
paint-by-number paintings all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But by high school they'd drifted into separate orbits. Winer
studied painting at Yale and architecture at Harvard, and today is
a prominent Boston muralist and public artist known for his trompe
l'oeil decorations on buildings.
</P>
<P>
   After Hampshire College and five years of selling advertisements
for a radio station, Halperin took a trip around the world, during
which met a Frenchman, whom she married. In 1988, they moved to
France.
</P>
<P>
   Winer and Halperin kept in touch sporadically, but their paths
didn't cross again in a significant way _ until Halperin and her
husband bought a 500-year-old castle in the French Alps two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange reprise of their childhood, the two, now 44, are at
work on an art project once again. Winer is painting Halperin's
castle, and she is lending a hand.
</P>
<P>
   With 30 rooms to adorn, unlimited opportunities for trompe
l'oeil, faux marbling, and elaborate stenciling, the fixer-upper in
the town of Crots is a muralist's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mix up the colors for her and tell her what order to put
them in,'' he says. ``It's basically paint by number.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as Winer put it in an interview at his Arlington home, it's
also a tale of how ``everything gets woven together in life.''
</P>
<P>
   As someone who makes his living painting pictures on the sides
of buildings, Winer has followed a career path that could never be
called conventional. His works include the Kennedy family trompe
l'oeil in Brookline; the Harvard Square Theatre facade; the
half-mile-long trompe l'oeil stone wall at the Mall at Chestnut
Hill; and the S &AMP; S Restaurant-Deli mural in Inman Square in
Cambrige, for which he won the 1991 Boston Society of Architects
annual Public Design Award. One of his best-known interior works is
the 100-foot-long cultural mural re-creating historic Jewish
Boston, located in the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for Aged in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Decorating a castle might seem like a stretch. Still, when he
heard that Halperin and her husband, Jacques Peureux, were planning
to renovate it into a conference center, he knew he wanted to be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I was the man for the job,'' says Winer. ``I
pushed really hard for this.''
</P>
<P>
   The turreted castle, named Picomtal, is a storybook-like
medieval edifice on a hillside in a small village in the southern
Alps, about 30 miles from the Italian border. It has three floors,
3-foot-thick stone walls, and pointy, slate-covered tower roofs,
called chapeaux or hats. It lacks a moat, but does have ``a little
pond,'' says Halperin, interviewed by telephone from Picomtal,
which sits on 25 acres of land. There is a lake about half a mile
away.
</P>
<P>
   The castle, which was enlarged several times over the centuries,
was originally a military defense fortress, and then home to a
series of families, all of whom were French nobility. Halperin and
Peureux purchased it from a 77-year-old man who had inherited it
from his grandfather. The property had been in his family for 125
years but was in serious disrepair and had not been modernized
beyond the 19th century. It had all of one bathroom. Only a couple
of rooms had electricity, and it lacked a heating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was broken-hearted about selling it,'' says Halperin. ``His
four kids didn't want it. It was just too expensive to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Halperin's husband saw it as a fixer-upper, and he decided
to take a chance on it. He'd operated a successful business in
France importing multimedia software from the United States, and
was ready for a new professional challenge.
</P>
<P>
   For years Peureux had been dreaming about finding a large
building in an attractive place and turning it into a conference
center that could be rented out for meetings. He considered a farm.
He looked at a nunnery. But when he saw the castle on a ski trip
and heard it was for sale, he knew he'd found his dream business.
He bought the castle for the price of a small Tudor in a Boston
suburb _ about $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   And this is where Winer enters the picture. By coincidence, he'd
been spending a fair bit of time in France himself. In 1993, he'd
met and fallen in love with a French woman, Albertine Williams, who
happened to be living in Boston. They had a son, Charles, now 5
1/2. When the relationship didn't work out, Williams took Charles
back to France, to live in Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   But Winer visited him often, and took the opportunity to
reconnect with his childhood buddy from Wayland. Halperin is now an
English teacher and the mother of three girls, aged 10, 8, and 5.
</P>
<P>
   She told him about the castle. ``At the beginning, I thought it
was too crazy an idea to turn a castle into a business center,''
Winer says. ``But the thing that made me believe it would work was
spending more time with them, and seeing how they were handling the
problems that came up with the castle. They are trying to not just
do a good job, but a perfect job. And you sort of get sucked into
the whole thing. It's very inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   The renovation had to satisfy the French government, which
regulates such restorations, Peureux said in an interview. Every
room _ designed for business clients, not vacationers _ would have
a fax machine and a computer. Many of the 30 rooms were to be
renovated in different historical periods over the 500-year-life of
the castle _ Renaissance rooms, French Empire style rooms, and
Provencal rooms, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized they needed an artist in there,'' Winer says. And
he knew just the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Why not?' '' says Halperin. ``It was a mutual
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Winer acknowledges he would have loved to paint an entrance
mural on the ceiling, with architectural framing _ but Peureux had
his own ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacques just wants to create an atmosphere in there, and let
the castle be the focus of attention, which is more the French
mentality,'' he says. ``My job is to provide the background.''
</P>
<P>
   So far he has worked on the castle for a total of 15 weeks, over
three different visits, and expects to do at least five or six
months' more work over the next two years. He is restoring the
chapel interior in the north tower, which is decorated with murals
he estimates are a century old. He has done stencil work using
chaux, a pigmented Provencal plaster paint. He has painted faux
tile on fireplaces, and moldings and flourishes at a tower
entryway, and trompe l'oeil door knockers on the flat new doors, to
make them look three-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   And all these years later, Halperin works with Winer on the art
project, as his new assistant. ``He is teaching me to do trompe
l'oeil, so I can continue working on it,'' she says with a laugh.
``He is a very good teacher, very patient, and a very good
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   They have even drafted their children into the process, setting
up a painting studio in the French Empire room. For Winer, the
symmetry of it all is the assignment's greatest pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met when we were 9, and now our own kids are around that
age, and it all seems pretty repetitive,'' he says. ``Except that
instead of Wayland, it's across the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of amazing. We could not have planned it this way,
to be sure.''

MUSCOVITES, BEREFT OF TV, REDISCOVER SURROUNDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ There has been a mini-boom for video-rental outlets,
Internet providers and hourly-rate hotels. Longer walks for dogs. A
palpable dropoff in the numbers of politicians making promises to
the Russian public that they cannot keep.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the side-effects of life without television in
Moscow after a fire Sunday at the main television tower blacked out
television screens across the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The fire at the 1,772-foot Ostankino Television Tower claimed at
least four lives and added another dark chapter to a
disaster-strewn month that has become known here as ``Black
August.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy has overshadowed the fact that one of the world's
largest cities has been undergoing a spontaneous social experiment
unprecedented for peace time in the modern era that suggests
tantalizing answers to the question: What would happen if suddenly
the TV screens went blank?
</P>
<P>
   The shutoff has forced millions of viewers who spend an average
of five hours a day planted in front of the tube to get outside, do
some gardening, spend time with friends and enjoy life, according
to Muscovites interviewed Wednesday. But a TV-less existence has
also left many people cut off from their daily dose of news and
affordable entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with television, entire areas of the reality we inhabit
disappeared,'' commented Avtandil Tsuladze, a columnist for the
newspaper Segodnya. ``There are no more politicians with their loud
promises, no streams of compromising materials, no analytical
programs, even the president himself has disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin, who has been a fixture on Moscow
television since coming to power in January, has ordered regular
broadcasting service to be restored within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Using a temporary transmitter jury-rigged to the trunk of the
fire-ravaged Ostankino tower that provided a somewhat grainy
signal, two of Russia's main television channels resumed limited
broadcasting in Moscow late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As their lives slowly returned to normal, many people
interviewed Wednesday said the temporary loss of television was not
all that bad _ after the initial shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day was hard, but then I realized, this will
undoubtedly raise the birth rate,'' said Vadim Byrkin, who works in
Moscow as the spokesman for the governor of Yaroslavl, one of
Russia's 89 regions. ``Someone should do a study in nine months, to
see how many children were conceived in this week. My own activity
has increased drastically.''
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the Russian parliament voiced a similar sentiment
about the potential demographic value of life without television _
Russia's declining birthrate has become a serious political issue
in a country where the population decreased by 425,000 in the first
half of this year alone _ but neither legislator wanted to go on
the record.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the manager of The Pillow, a Moscow hotel that has
hourly rates. She did, however, say that sales these past three
days were booming.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has filled their sudden surfeit of free time so
wantonly.
</P>
<P>
   In the rush for information, Muscovites who have computers have
turned to Internet sites. Vladislav Borodulin, editor in chief of
the internet newspaper Gazeta.ru, said visits to his site have
increased by 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main news is no news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another winner was the company Media Most, which had come under
pressure from the Kremlin over differences between its owners and
other leading businessmen. Media Most's flagship station, NTV, is
the only Russian network to have a satellite broadcasting system,
which allowed the station to stay on the air for viewers who could
pick up the signal. Cable operators, who in Moscow usually provide
a single channel to apartment buildings, also made a small killing,
charging residents to hook up signals from national networks.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually long lines at kiosks that sell and rent video
cassettes indicate that some Muscovites were still glued to their
sets. This being Russia, some have peered into the newly dark
screens occupying their living rooms and found an answer to larger
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps, the hurricane tempo of life is good for distracting
us from thoughts about the tragic nature of our existence in this
world,'' wrote Semyon Novoprudsky in the daily Izvestiya.
</P>
<P>
   Still others have taken a break and gone outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things to do,'' said Yury Novoselsky, a
security guard who lives in Odintsovo, a suburb of Moscow that
normally has 16 channels to choose from; this week, only one UHF
frequency was working. ``The garden, the car, everything needs
work. I'm walking the dog longer than usual. I'm resting.''
</P>
<P>
   But some have warned that the TV blackout could have negative
consequences for thousands of people addicted to daily viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Russians, in common with people around the world, have
become avid fans of soap operas and psychologists have expressed
concern that, without their daily fix, many problems will emerge,''
the Troika Dialog investment bank said in its daily report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian police precincts had been on the lookout for increased
domestic violence because of the loss of programming, according to
media reports, and some precincts have staffed special counselors
to help people cope with the absence of their favorite soaps.
</P>
<P>
   The limited programming that most Muscovites will be able to
view beginning Thursday includes ``Santa Barbara'' and a Mexican
soap opera along with news programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that more than anyone pensioners have suffered,''
Tsuladze of the newspaper Segodnya commented. ``Television is for
them about the only pastime they can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   For Antonina Mitkina, a retiree playing in a sandbox with her
granddaughter Katya, the TV could not come back on fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has changed without television,'' she said. ``First of
all, we don't hear what is happening in the world. And of course we
are upset over the guys who died fighting the blaze. We want to
know what will happen next. And of course, we are sorry for Putin,
who has taken over such a country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much our whole life is television,'' she said.

BLANCHE PASSES GO 
By Barbara Neely 
Viking. 275 pp. $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She heard him before she saw him. Then, suddenly, she was
reliving him.
</P>
<P>
   The terror of the night David Palmer raped Blanche White crashed
in on her like a falling concrete wall. While she was at a party
that she was helping her best friend cater, he stood laughing and
drinking, untouched by the destruction he had caused her years ago.
She had to flee the room:
</P>
<P>
   ``A stomach cramp nearly doubled her over. The light grew dingy;
a smell, bitter and fruity, like milk about to turn, stung her
nose; the music went flat; and she was suddenly cold. The pleasant
buzz and of people talking and laughing rumbled ugly, like a mob
forming. She covered her mouth and hurried toward the kitchen,
vomit burning her throat.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Blanche Passes Go,'' the new mystery by Boston writer
Barbara Neely, the smoldering rage over the rape of the
African-American main character by a white wealthy man propels a
tale that deals with murder in a New South that clings to old
racist ways, the settling of old scores, and the healing of wounds
so deep the bleeding won't stop.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth novel Neely has written in this enjoyable
series featuring Blanche White, the quick-witted, full-figured,
crime-solving domestic with a nose forever stuck in other people's
business.
</P>
<P>
   As in all her novels, the author again manages to tell a story
full of murder and other serious issues while infusing it with a
pleasant element of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Neely's preceding novel, ``Blanche Cleans Up,'' had the cook and
housekeeper living in Roxbury and working for a Brookline
politician and his wife and, of course, figuring out who done what
to whom.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Blanche Passes Go,'' the main character is taking a trip
home that is as much a symbolic journey as it is a literal one.
Leaving Boston and returning to Farleigh, N.C., where she was born,
she plans to help her childhood friend Ardell get her catering
business off the ground during the town's busy bicentennial
celebration. But also by revisiting the past, Blanche hopes to move
forward with her life.
</P>
<P>
   While home, Blanche has a full plate. She starts dating a
handsome train conductor and has to do that delicate dance of
letting go while holding on tight to independence. She begins the
difficult process of loosening her grip on two children (now
teenagers) whom she has been raising since her sister died. She's
finding new layers to people she thought she knew, including Ardell
and her strong-willed mother, who holds a secret Blanche never
imagined. And, of course, there is the unfinished business of David
Palmer to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Blanche didn't have the courage to go to the police when she was
raped. In the Southern town, who would believe the black
housekeeper over the wealthy white man, and would they care, given
the disregard for abused black women dating back to slavery? And,
could she survive the shame and the anticipated looks of pity?
Blanche knew the answers too well.
</P>
<P>
   But, she could no longer live with her decision not to do
anything because ``she'd been frozen for the last eight years, as
though her life were a game of Monopoly in which she was stuck at
Go. Certainly she had gone on with her life and she'd done all
right . . . But she could see now that a part of her was still back
there, curled up like a broken child.''
</P>
<P>
   When the perfect opportunity to find some dirt on Palmer
presents itself, she takes on the risky business. And, readers are
taken along on the ride as she sets out to ruin him.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Neely uses her character to explore the issues of
race and class that she has addressed in all her novels. And, it is
never a one-sided attack. She gets in just as many licks against
black folks who discriminate within their own race because of skin
tone as she does against white bigots who do so.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the novel, abused women _ including the murdered
white girl Blanche can't get out of her head _ are a reminder of
how much battering, harassment and deception women can sustain in
this world, often at the hands of someone who ``loves'' them.
</P>
<P>
   Neely has a remarkable way with description. (Blanche's new man
has ``eyes the color of burnt sugar.'') The characters who populate
her stories seem ordinary enough until some weird little quirk
springs up like a loose hair. (Twin sisters who cook for Ardell
finish each other's sentences and are cheating Ardell a couple of
pounds of butter at a time.)
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Neely tells a great story that touches on
many complex themes, from jealousy to redemption. It is not until
the end that the author becomes a bit heavy-handed and gets on the
preachy side as she drives home the point about abused women.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the delicious surprises that mark the end of any good
mystery novel are a little less satisfying because there are one
too many coincidences here. The loose ends are tied up too neatly.
Yet, one important issue doesn't feel resolved. Ultimately, is
Blanche's revenge as sweet as she'd hoped?

 PASHMINA PASSE? NOT IN COOL CLIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 888-346-9867 or (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patti Scialfa, Bruce Springsteen's wife and bandmate, dropped
$550 in Bergdorf's last week on a pumpkin pashmina. Apparently, she
didn't get the memo, first circulated via British Vogue last
August, declaring that the soft cashmere wraps are as passe as that
chestnut ``Born in the USA.'' Then the stateside Vogue affirmed the
news last November _ timed as if to save women from being inundated
with packages of pashmina under the Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who want one, or who got one and may be about to
pull it out of the cedar closet in preparation for fall, the
question is: are they in or out?
</P>
<P>
   While some retailers are refusing to carry the cache-less
commodities one year after stocking the shelves with them, others
are piling them up under the heading ``Don't say the pashmina's
dead!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We still feel very strongly about them,'' Debbie Seidenberg,
merchandise manager at Neiman Marcus in Boston, said of the wraps,
priced between $375 and $2,000 in that store. ``It's a necessity at
this point. Being here in the Boston area, it's very practical to
have a wrap and a shawl.''
</P>
<P>
   But because pashminas were copied by mail order vendors, some of
whom used wool or silk to bring down the price tag and because they
became ubiquitous at cocktail parties (paired with little black
dresses), fashionistas panned the popular wrap.
</P>
<P>
   What's different this year is that pashminas are being decorated
with jets (small black beads) or sequins or embroidery and are
showing up in more vibrant colors. The idea has also metamorphosed
into tatty, open-work shawls, as well as ponchos or light capes,
which can be thrown over blazers with the same ease as a pashmina
on a cool fall day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pashmina dilemma cries out for another opinion. So we
turned to Kate Betts, editor of Harper's Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're out,'' Betts said over the phone from
New York, sounding bored by the topic. ``They've just become a
mainstream part of the fashion vocabulary. It's something that
really didn't exist before in our culture. I still see people
wearing them.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's the clincher: ``People in the fashion crowd have
replaced the pashmina with this fall's fur tippet or the fox collar
that Prada and Marc Jacobs did,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fur tippet?
</P>
<P>
   Barry Alterwitz, another merchandise manager at the Boston
Neiman Marcus, explained Betts's pick. Yes, he said, ``the tippet''
is the hottest thing going. Essentially, it's a free-standing fur
collar with ties on the ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fabulous,'' Alterwitz said. You can place tippets
around the neckline of a coat, a T-shirt, a blouse, or an evening
dress. And they come in many colors, from purple to brown, and in
faux furs or real ones, ranging from rabbit to mink. Some of the
dyed rabbit furs start at $75.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're thinking a pashmina is less politically
incorrect, consider that the cashmere wrap's popularity spurt has
had broad consequences.
</P>
<P>
   China, which produces two-thirds of the world's cashmere from
goat wool, has been raising the prices for the raw material
produced in other countries. And in neighboring Mongolia, goat
herding has become a trendier job prospect, prompting
environmentalists to worry about overgrazing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many believe China is overpaying for the imported
material in an effort to get a lock on the world's cashmere supply.
(China makes about two-thirds of the 16,500 tons of cashmere
worldwide, compared to Mongolia's 3,000 tons.)
</P>
<P>
   The result: In the past two years, a pound of cashmere has gone
from $4 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   But it could take a while before such costs trickle down to the
consumer. Luxury retailers are bracing for steep increases in
cashmere products next year. In other words, stock up now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Fancy footwear for fall &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What else should ``mainstream'' shoppers be buying?
</P>
<P>
   Betts of Harper's Bazaar said footwear is an important accessory
this year, especially the '40s-style platform heel with an open
toe, which is perfect with a suit at the office.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for women going into shoe shock over the
displays of stilettoes and pointy-toe torture chambers more
effective as pieces of artwork than footwear. Betts sees the
spikier, sexier contraptions as more appropriate for evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``For day, that kind of chunky '40s heel is going to be very
fashionable and it looks great with a tweed suit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In stores, salespeople are reporting that older customers who
have always been accustomed to wearing heels, are loving the return
of more elegant footwear, as are the fashion-conscious young. But
women in the middle demur.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane Andersen, a member of the American Podiatric Medical
Association, says she has been seeing more young women hobbling
into her office with foot ailments caused or aided by their
unhealthy shoe choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do see young professional women who are beginning to wear
those shoes again,'' said Andersen, whose practice is based in
Durham, N.C. ``I consider anything over 1 1/2 inches to be high.
The pointed toe box is really detrimental. Number one, people get
corns on their toes or blisters. That can cause a lot of problems
that can make your toes curl up. You get hammer toes.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also side effects from wearing high heels, including
the increased risk of a ``traumatic event,'' such as a sprained
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen added that the Achilles tendon and muscles in back of
the leg can also shorten _ permanently _ from wearing high heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, it makes it difficult to wear flats,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And then what are we to do when flats are back in style?

WHEN SHOPPING PRESENTS A CARLOAD OF CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's go shopping for a car, but let's impose some rules.
</P>
<P>
   Here's $23,000 to spend, but as you shop, you can't use your
legs. You can only look at two-doors because you have to be able to
squeeze a wheelchair in behind the driver's seat, and the center
pillar of a four-door makes that impossible. You have to buy an
automatic. You must be able to reach and close your car's open
trunk lid from a seated position.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did I mention you can't take any cars for test drives? You
don't find cars fitted with handicap controls sitting on dealer
lots. You might find yourself shopping not for what you want, but
for what works.
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenge that has put Betsy Pillsbury, 47, into the
driver's seats of an eclectic lineup of autos in the 30 years she
has spent using a wheelchair. First car? A Gremlin. Chair went onto
the front seat beside her and had a tendency to slide off and hit
the accelerator in sudden stops. Then an AMC Pacer _ before Wayne
and Garth from ``Wayne's World'' made that car cool. Then a Nissan
Pulsar. Awful car, says Pillsbury, who is the assistant director
for special projects in the Massachusetts Office on Disability.
Today, she owns a 1991 Volkswagen Jetta, a car she likes, but also
a car that she must enter from the passenger's side and that she
has had to alter radically inside.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping goal on this Saturday? Find a car Pillsbury can
enter from the driver's side and simplify the complicated
entry-exit routine she goes through each time she drives.
</P>
<P>
   To get into the Jetta, for instance, she wheels up to the
passenger side door. Using her arms, she hoists herself into the
seat. Then she slides the seat forward. Reaches out and folds her
chair and lifts it onto the floor behind her. Slides the seat back.
Uses her hands to lift her legs into the car. Shuts the door. Uses
her upper body to pull herself across to the driver's seat _ an act
made possible only because she has had the center console ripped
from the car, and only then after she shifts from park to first so
her legs can clear the shift lever. Each time she exits the car,
she does all this in reverse, each time knowing that a slip puts
her on the ground, where she'll need help getting up or that _ and
this has happened _ her chair might roll away on a hill before she
can get into it.
</P>
<P>
   A string of simple acts to most folks can be a long chain of
challenges in Pillsbury's world. Her solution: simplify by
shortening the skein. Getting in on the driver's side would be a
big step in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   She likes her Jetta and has long had her eye on a Cabrio, so the
first stop is the Volkswagen Gallery in Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Levy, a sales and lease manager, steps forward to help.
Pillsbury tries a Beetle and finds the distance between her chair
and the outer edge of the driver's seat to be a bit wide. But she
says she could get used to it. Then she tries, after sliding the
driver's seat as far forward as she can, to fit her chair in behind
her. It won't go. And even if it did, the space between the back of
her seat and the front of the rear seat is too small to allow her
to slide the driver's seat back once she is ready to drive.
</P>
<P>
   As we shop, it is surprising to realize just how small that
space is. How small? Let's say you have average-size hands. Spread
your fingers and thumb as far apart as they will go. Look at the
distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger.
All she needs is two inches more than that. She doesn't get it in
the Beetle and, alas, the Cabrio is virtually the same size.
</P>
<P>
   But not all is fruitless at Volkswagen. Levy sincerely engages
Pillsbury in her challenge. He goes out to the lot to see if a Golf
might work. No. Neither will a Passat. So then he does something
Pillsbury says she has seen only once before. He starts
recommending cars made by other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   So it's back out into the Jetta _ where years of putting in the
chair and taking it out have worn away the fabric on the back of
the front seat _ and off to the Saturn dealership. Saturn sells a
three-door, with the third door on the driver's side. The rear door
opens toward the rear of the car, there is no center pillar, and
that leaves ample space through which to put a chair. The problem
is, there is little space behind the front seat and the chair would
only fit if placed on the back seat. That could be an arduous lift
and, in an accident, it could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But Pillsbury's biggest problem with the Saturn is that once the
third door is open and she is in the driver's seat, she can't reach
back to close that door. The salesman suggests tying a string to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strings break, and then where would I be?'' Pillsbury asks
later.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Focus, with a big front door and a trunk whose base is
at lap level, offers promise. But Reidar Davies at Jack Madden Ford
says that automatics are in short supply and the power seat
Pillsbury longs for is not an option. To fit her chair behind the
driver's seat, she'll have to remove one wheel, another task, but
one she is beginning to realize she might have to take on.
</P>
<P>
   At Boch Toyota, Steve Wight goes out to the back lot to bring in
a Solara, a relatively luxurious two-door that comes with Toyota's
reputation for longevity and power seats. At about $23,000, it's at
the top of her price range, though Wight says the manufacturer will
help out with the costs of installing special gas and brake
controls for Pillsbury.
</P>
<P>
   She goes back and tries the trunk _ can't reach it from the
rear, but because it is counterbalanced, she can easily close it
with a gentle touch from the side. She gets into the power seat,
slides it forward, and tries the chair. Still too wide, it misses
by about an inch. But she likes the car, and that causes her to
re-examine her possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the wheel off the chair is not a complicated task. Push a
button and pull off the wheel. Just don't drop it and let it roll
away. And it clicks right back on. And with the Solara, she'd only
have to remove one wheel, the floor space is plentiful and, Wight
shows her, the floor-anchor for the seatbelt folds out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a tradeoff, taking the wheel off _ or ripping out
the console'' and continuing to enter from the passenger's side,
Pillsbury says. By Monday morning, she sounds as though she's made
a choice. No more climbing between seats. She'll learn to deal with
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toyota looks like a winner,'' says Pillsbury, who played by
the rules.

HYUNDAI TIBURON: ONE OF THE HIP ENTRY-LEVEL CARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the Ford Focus _ wagon, four-door, hatchback _ that has
become the latest exemplar of hip and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   In these times of renewed interest in entry-level cars that are
more than basic econoboxes, Consumer Reports magazine just named
the Focus its top-reated small sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler PT Cruiser falls into this category, though with
dealer-primed prices it's a bit expensive compared to others, and
so do the Volkswagen New Beetle and Toyota's Echo, although the
Echo does not seem to have caught on the way Toyota had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   So how about a surprising addition to the list? Can you say
Hyundai?
</P>
<P>
   The Hyundai Tiburon, two doors and seating for four, is a smooth
blend of sports car and sedan. Aimed at younger drivers, both in
price and appearance, its outside says verve, from its bulging
front fenders to the arc of spoiler that graces the plump rear
deck.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it's young and high-tech all the way: the center console
and its controls are angled toward the driver; techno-metal-looking
trim surrounds gauges, knobs, vents, and the shift housing (though
real metal would look a lot better than this aluminum-painted
plastic). There is one odd grouping of controls on a single pod on
the dash _ windshield wipers, cruise control, and rear window
defogger. But overall, the layout, with big knobs and easy access,
is quite functional.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that when you look at the Tiburon from the outside
you see sports car, it is surprising that it is as roomy inside as
it proves to be. The front-seat passengers have plenty of legroom,
and side-to-side space is made pretty good because of the way the
doors curve, giving concave space to the outer body.
</P>
<P>
   The back seat, also, can hold two adults in reasonable comfort,
a pair of children in plenty of space.
</P>
<P>
   For about $3,000 over base price, the tested Tiburon came with
an upgrade package that included leather power seats, better sound
system, the rear spoiler, and a power sun roof.
</P>
<P>
   The front bucket seats were wonderful, with firm ridges on the
outsides of the thighs and the back. Thigh support at the front of
the seat was firm and the backs were broad enough to support even
big-shouldered folks. I've seen far worse seats in far more
expensive cars.
</P>
<P>
   Since it's aimed at a younger crowd looking for performance, the
Tiburon needs at least a modicum of quickness and it has it _ in
places.
</P>
<P>
   When it was introduced in 1997, it came with a standard
1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine that bopped out 130 horsepower. Now, at
2.0 liters and 140 horses, it's reasonably peppy. It's not so much
that it's real quick from a standing start, but once it gets
cranking it loves to romp in the high RPM band.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its engine pushed regularly over two weeks of driving,
it managed just under 24 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   I found the five-speed manual shifter a bit sloppy and too long
in the throw. But for those tuners who like to tinker with their
inexpensive performance cars, I'm sure there's a conversion kit out
there that would tighten up the shift sequence and cut the throw by
40-60 percent _ at not a particularly high cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiburon, with gas-charged struts, stabilizer bars, and a
rigid body is a stiff little car. You feel the rigidity in corners
and it can be a bit jarring on bumps. But that's the case with lots
of sports cars and sports sedans and a price many enthusiasts are
willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off is a smooth, solid straight-ahead ride on the
highway, easy lane-to-lane transitions when passing, and virtually
no body roll when cornering.
</P>
<P>
   On my favorite rising and twisting hill, it made the transition
from corner to corner to corner with a sure-footed stickiness that
surprised me. Just as it comes off the assembly line, this car
could handle even more power from its engine.
</P>
<P>
   In testing cars, it is useful to ask how each might be used by
its buyer. The Tiburon _ it will be bought by adventurous types in
their first jobs, college-bound students (or their parents), or
enthusiasts looking for an inexpensive base from which to tune up
to a performance car _ can fill lots of needs.
</P>
<P>
   It seats four comfortably. It has a fairly large trunk that
becomes absolutely huge if you accept it as a two-seater and fold
the rear seats down. And on different days and on different
missions, it can be different cars for you. And in these times of
adventurous lifestyles, that is a good selling point.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that Hyundai's remarkable warranty _ 10 years, 100,000
miles for the power train, five years, 60,000 miles bumper-to
bumper, and five years, unlimited mileage roadside assistance
(including towing) _ and you've got an inexpensive, fun car well
worth looking at.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The air vents built into the front of the doors. Great
position from which to direct air flow right back at passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The wasted space between the front seats. You get a small,
covered bin toward the rear and the console slopes down _ slashed
by two tiny slots for paraphernalia _ toward the shifter. A bigger
box would have provided more storage and arm support as well.
</P>
<P>
   --A bit of humor:
</P>
<P>
   Open the ashtray (it's where I toss coins) and you see that the
Korean manufacturers have made sure to label this item for those
who might be confused. ``ASSY-TRAY,'' it says right there in raised
letters. So, that's where you put your butts.

 &HT;     THE ABCs OF DRESSING BABIES  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROSE MARY BUDGE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Babies are so adorable they deserve to goo over
Gucci and wear nothing but the best. But it doesn't necessarily
take big bucks and designer clothing to turn the little darlings
into haute tots. You just need to know the fashion trends from A to
Z and where to find them.
</P>
<P>
   A is for applique
</P>
<P>
   Applique on everything from onesies to overalls is a big fall
trend. Favorite motifs? Animals, flowers, airplanes and cars. You
can find appliqued baby clothes at specialty stores. Or you can
head for mass-market retailers such as Kmart, where appliqued
outfits and separates are $12 and less.
</P>
<P>
   B is for bib
</P>
<P>
   Many designers are including matching bibs with little dresses
and suits. If you prefer to buy bibs separately, brighten burp time
with fun prints, neon colors and stylish logos. Tommy Hilfiger
offers a white terry bib embroidered with his logo (about $12). Or
you can go for the minimal look _ a plain cotton bib from
Walgreen's for $2.
</P>
<P>
   C is for corduroy
</P>
<P>
   A staple that takes spills in stride, corduroy is a top seller
this season. Retailers suggest wash-and-wear pink, purple, teal or
orange for her. Navy, dark green, khaki or bright blue looks good
on little boys.
</P>
<P>
   D is for denim
</P>
<P>
   Babies can wiggle and crawl in denim _ it's tough stuff. She'll
go gaga over denim capris. He will look darling in denim jackets
and jeans.
</P>
<P>
   E is for embroidery
</P>
<P>
   Embroidery can make even the simplest, most inexpensive baby
clothes look like couture. Among the popular embroidered motifs for
fall are lions, tigers and bears. Oh, my!
</P>
<P>
   F is for fun
</P>
<P>
   And fanciful. Think jumpsuits with appliqued bunnies peeking out
of the pockets. Think jumpers embroidered with frolicking felines.
There are plenty of years ahead for grownup, serious styles.
</P>
<P>
   G is for Gucci
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. You really can get Gucci and other big-name labels
for baby. Designers are discovering big bucks in the mini market
where it's oh-so-hard to resist. Department stores such as
Dillard's and Foley's have the Tommy Hilfigers and the Polos by
Ralph Lauren. Pink and tan slippers printed with distinctive Gucci
G's can be ordered for $90 in sizes 2 to 12 months. Or how about
the designer look without the price? Tiny slippers minus the
flourishes are about $5 at J.C. Penney and Sears.
</P>
<P>
   H is for hat
</P>
<P>
   Babies never should leave home without one. A hat can protect
your little darling against the sun, and it can brighten the day
for everyone who sees your child. Choose soft materials and
crushable shapes.
</P>
<P>
   I is for important
</P>
<P>
   Though style counts in baby clothes, practicality is more
important. Is the material fire-retardant? Will the fabric itch or
scratch? Will buttons or trimmings be easy to pull off and even
easier to swallow? If the outfit is questionable, avoid it _ even
if it is a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   J is for jumper
</P>
<P>
   Jumpers are comfy and can be worn with or without blouses _ and
bargains in versatility because the pieces can be worn with baby's
other things.
</P>
<P>
   K is for knits
</P>
<P>
   More and more baby clothes are coming in comfy, easy-care cotton
knit, according to Talbots Kids &AMP; Babies. The material won't
wrinkle and never feels scratchy against tender skin, which adds up
to happy babies and even happier parents.
</P>
<P>
   L is for lightweight
</P>
<P>
   Baby will go from sweetie to sourpuss if the outfit you pick is
hot and heavy. Even in fall and winter, it's better to go with
lightweight materials and layer on a sweater or jacket if the
weather turns cool.
</P>
<P>
   M is for mix and match
</P>
<P>
   Designers are mixing and matching bold colors and patterns for
fall, putting hot pink with lime green and polka dots with plaids.
Pick up some inexpensive separates and give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   N is for navy
</P>
<P>
   If you can only afford one new garment for your little one, pick
versatile and seasonless navy. A navy jumper for her and navy pants
for him can mix and match with almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   O is for orange
</P>
<P>
   Designers have a crush on orange, and it's adding flavor to tiny
tees and cotton-knit pants. A single shot of orange can bring high
fashion to baby's wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   P is for prints
</P>
<P>
   Florals, stripes, plaids and animal prints dominate in the
infants department. Hunt for clothes trimmed with leopard, zebra,
tiger, pony and snake. Or try a bit of fake fur to add luxury to
any garment.
</P>
<P>
   Q is for quilting
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cutest outerwear for fall features quilting. It's
best in airy nylon or featherweight fleece.
</P>
<P>
   R is for ribbing
</P>
<P>
   Ribbed sweaters in every style from turtleneck to cardigan are
showing up in tiny sizes. Fire engine red is the hottest color.
</P>
<P>
   S is for stretch
</P>
<P>
   Many baby fashions include Lycra _ just enough so the garment
moves comfortably and easily with the body. And socks can dress
things up with lace cuffs or embroidered cartoon characters and
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   T is for terrycloth
</P>
<P>
   You can't beat this old favorite for comfort and practicality.
Terry works beautifully in practical onesies and snuggly robes to
wrap up after bath time.
</P>
<P>
   U is for urban edge
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't think baby clothes would have attitude, but it's
the trend. Watch for cool decorated denim, tiny tees, itty-bitty
halters and bootleg jeans for tots 6 to 12 months old.
</P>
<P>
   V is for vests
</P>
<P>
   Little boys will be wearing vests. So will little girls.
</P>
<P>
   W is for waffle knits
</P>
<P>
   Waffle knits add textural interest to fall baby fashions. The
tiny, slightly raised squares in the fabric feel puffy and fun to
little fingers while locking out the cold.
</P>
<P>
   X is for ``xtras''
</P>
<P>
   When designers include packets of replacement buttons or
embroidery threads, it's worth paying a little more for the
garment. These packets, usually found next to price tags, save
frustration when clothes need a quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   Y is for yellow
</P>
<P>
   Some parents like to outfit boys in blue and girls in pink. But
why not yellow, the unisex color? This fall, honey tones are hotter
than pastel.
</P>
<P>
   Z is for zippers
</P>
<P>
   Zippers can be decorative as well as utilitarian. But if you
pick zippered jeans or a zippered jacket for baby, be sure the
zipper is smooth and well set. You don't want to pinch or irritate
sensitive skin and cause the little one to dread getting dressed.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... bad student.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During World War II, Danto served in the Army Corps of Engineers
in North Africa and Italy. ``I learned a lot about life,'' he says
with a grin. ``I learned a lot about myself. It was like 20 years
of psychoanalysis!''
</P>
<P>
   Danto studied art under the GI Bill at what is now Wayne State
University, in Detroit, and got his BA in two years. This meant he
had two years of benefits left as a veteran. ``When people say to
me, `Why did you go into philosophy?' I say, `To tell you the
truth, to collect GI Bill checks. . . . My idea was, I'm going to
go to New York to be an artist. But I've got these two years I
might well do something with. I didn't want to go to art school. So
I thought, what will I do? I'll study philosophy, because you don't
have to read so much. You're supposed to think, and I do that all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting his PhD, Danto spent a year in Paris on a
Fulbright Scholarship, where he became friendly with the sculptor
Alberto Giacometti. He spent a year teaching at the University of
Colorado, then returned to Columbia. It was a golden age on
Morningside Heights. To name some of Danto's colleagues, with all
of whom he was a friend, suggests what a rich faculty the school
boasted: the Nobel Prize-winning physicist I. I. Rabi, the literary
critic Lionel Trilling, the historian Richard Hofstadter, the art
historian Meyer Schapiro (one of the finest pieces in the new book
is Danto's obituary tribute to Schapiro).
</P>
<P>
   Friendship, in a more general sense, is a key attribute of
Danto's art criticism. For one thing, it got him started: It was
the recommendation of a friend, Ben Sonnenberg, the then-editor of
the literary quarterly Grand Street, that brought him to the
attention of The Nation. More important, in an art world largely
defined by combativeness and what Danto has called the
``denunciatory stance'' of Clement Greenberg, his predecessor as
The Nation art critic, his writing stands out for its consistent
generosity of spirit. ``I try to give people a break,'' Danto says.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say he's a cheerleader. (His opposition to
Richard Serra's controversial sculpture ``Tilted Arc'' put him on
the map as a critic _ and in a minority in the art world). But
precisely because he reviews such a small amount of work, doing
only 10 to 12 pieces a year, he prefers to write about art that
inspires his enthusiasm. ``What am I going to do,'' he shrugs,
``wipe the floor with somebody I'm writing about? Once you're in
there, once you see what someone's trying to achieve with his or
her art, you're already, in a way, on the artist's side.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he has to go a ways to reach the artist's side, but
the philosopher in Danto finds it a journey worth making.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I look within, I encounter a pretty conservative little
soul,'' Danto says of his tastes. ``There are certain things I
really like: usually little, luministic paintings, like Chardin's,
for example, or Morandi's. And I go into a gallery, and I see
something, and I say, `Do I have to deal with this?' Then the
little voice says, `Well, if you want to be an art critic, you have
to deal with it.' So I deal with it and try to put it in place and
try to see what's happening. Often, I wind up liking it a lot. So I
haven't, personally, caught up with myself as a critic, you might
say. I'm still fairly conservative and reluctant. But luckily I've
got this philosophy which kind of keeps me moving and says, `Come
on, don't close up shop; you've got to get in there.' That's the
blessing.''

LOTS OF SELFISH FREE RIDERS OUT THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've heard that the entertainment industry is all atwitter
over Napster and Gnutella and Scour Exchange, the so-called
peer-to-peer file sharing networks that allow folks to swap music
and video files with millions of their closest friends. You've
heard that people are trading like crazy in this benevolent digital
community where the motto is, ``My CD is your CD.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's something you may not have heard. The systems are
full of free riders who don't like to share.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. According to a recent study, 70 percent of
Gnutella users take files from others but don't give away any of
their own. Apparently, some people weren't listening that day in
the sandbox when the teacher taught all the good little boys and
girls the virtues of sharing. Or perhaps they misunderstood the
immortal words of Polonius _ ``Neither a borrower nor a lender be''
_ and thought he said, ``To take is human, but to give endangers
your hard drive.'' Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, it really shouldn't come as any surprise that
Napster and Gnutella are full of free loaders. Human nature is no
different on the Internet than it is in real life _ despite all
that idealistic chatter about the great digital democracy. It's why
utopian communities never work: Some folks bear the brunt of the
load, while everybody else coasts. When is the last time you threw
a potluck dinner and a few people brought lobster and caviar while
others showed up with the gastronomic equivalent of a can of soup
(or empty-handed, even worse)?
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the Gnutella study call this phenomenon the
``tragedy of the digital commons'' and suggest that it could lead
to the collapse of the file sharing craze. ``The social dilemma
rears its ugly head,'' says Bernardo A. Huberman, co-author of the
study and a research fellow at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. He
and his colleague, Eytan Adar, monitored Gnutella for 24 hours
earlier this month and discovered two different kinds of free
riders: those who don't share at all and those who share
undesireable files that nobody ever downloads (like the people who
donate junk to the local library and keep all the good books for
themselves).
</P>
<P>
   The study also claims that the top 1 percent of Gnutella users
contribute 40 percent of the total files shared, and the top 20
percent of users provide 98 percent of all files traded. Gnutella
was designed as an alternative to Napster, which is being sued by
the Recording Industry Association of America for copyright
infringement. Unlike Napster, Gnutella does not have a central
server; the idea is that if there is no central repository, there
is no one to sue. But when a few users are responsible for the bulk
of the shared files, those traders become vulnerable, the study
claims. ``If you hide in a crowd and you are among the 17 people
wearing a red jacket, everyone will notice,'' says Huberman.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? Teach the kids how to share? Watch the lawyers
get richer? Huberman, for one, doesn't think file sharing networks
will grow as fast as the entertainment industry fears _ unless
someone develops an incentive to encourage people to cooperate. One
thing's for sure. Peer pressure alone doesn't work. When you opt
out of sharing on Scour Exchange, a window pops up with this
message: ``Sharing your files helps the community. Are you sure you
want to disable file sharing?'' According to an unofficial study I
conducted among friends, the answer is usually yes.
</P>
<P>
   Huberman himself is a case in point. He says he only used
Napster once, when he tried unsuccessfully to locate a certain
Schumann quartet. Did he share his files? ``No,'' he admits,
laughing. ``I was a free rider as well, I guess _ but I was just
testing the system.'' That's what they all say.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Roger, we hardly knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   The fugitive hiding out in Berlin was nabbed Monday, only a week
after he went underground. The contestant in an interactive game
was apprehended after bounty hunters gleaned information about him
on the game's Web site, www.RealityRun.com.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? Roger isn't really Roger. He says he is a
``normal Dutch guy,'' but he doesn't live in Amsterdam. He lives
near Frankfurt and speaks fluent German, even though the game's
organizers claimed that his German was nicht sehr gut.
Disinformation on the Internet? Shocking!
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Roger to divulge his real name now. ``I signed a
contract to keep my mouth shut,'' he says. He's now working as a
consultant to the game's organizers, who plan to repeat the manhunt
in several cities before a final Reality Run in New York next year.
As for his sudden celebrity, Roger says he was touched by
conversations in the Reality Run chat rooms. ``People said, `I love
you.' It was incredible. It wasn't love in the McDonald's way. It
was real.'' Really. Roger. Over and out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the irony.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the Web animation company Camp Chaos produced
an animated series poking fun of the recording industry's response
to Napster. That series got the attention of executives at Warner
Bros. Records, who hired the firm to produce a series for its
annual meeting. In the new cartoon, record execs Howie Klein and
Phil Q hire Tony Soprano to send Napster for a ride down the river.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was fine until Sunday, when Camp Chaos posted the
series on its Web site; suddenly it wasn't a laughing matter.
Warner Bros. demanded that the files be taken down. Camp Chaos
president Bob Cesca says he thought he had negotiated a lower fee
in order to maintain the rights for Web distribution. The Warner
Bros. folks contend that the films were commisioned for private
viewing only. Cesca complied: ``I'm not into the idea of getting
into a battle with Warner Bros.,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But it's already too late. Thousands of people have already
downloaded the first two films, and they're being traded on Scour
Exchange and Gnutella. Cesna isn't sure if he will be able to post
the rest of the series, though, which leaves a lot of unanswered
questions. Will Tony nab Napster? Will Phil Q and Howie K defend
their honor? And what about all those free riders? Will they learn
to share or will the network implode?
</P>
<P>
   As they say in Hollywood, To Be Continued.
</P>
<P>

Note to readers: COMPUTERS-CYBERSPACE is going on hiatus; it will
be back next year.

THIEVERY'S FRIENDS IN   HIGH PLACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My late father often entertained cops at his secondhand store on
the west side of Chicago. They popped in to make sure he wasn't
peddling stolen goods. When they left, Daddy didn't go with them,
so I assume he was clean, or at least very clever.
</P>
<P>
   If he'd been busted, I somehow doubt that any major corporations
would have come to his defense. But some purveyors of stolen goods
have friends in high places. Just look at who's going to bat for
Napster, the Internet music-swapping company.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of the recording industry, US District Judge
Marilyn Patel last month issued a sweeping injunction against
Napster, where millions of music lovers swap digital copies of
their favorite tunes without paying for them. Essentially, Patel
agreed with music industry executives _ and me _ that Napster's
primary business is the facilitation of thievery. She ordered
Napster to stop its users from trafficking in copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   An Appeals Court stayed Patel's order, giving Napster's stunned
legal team an opportunity to recoup. Meanwhile, an extraordinary
group of Napster sympathizers has begun to rally around the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of American Physicians &AMP; Surgeons has filed a
friend-of-the-court brief in the case, along with Eagle Forum, a
conservative group best known for its successful campaign against
the Equal Rights Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups say the Napster injunction menaces the free exchange
of ideas over the Internet. They warn that corporations may use the
Napster ruling to limit online criticism of their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if the owner of (the drug) Ritalin asserted its
intellectual property rights, and demanded that Yahoo only provide
authorized links on Ritalin?'' this brief thunders. ``The outcome
would be that criticism of the use of Ritalin would be effectively
silenced.''
</P>
<P>
   But the record companies aren't complaining about people who
post scathing reviews of the new Metallica album. They're upset
about people stealing it, with the help of a company founded to
facilitate such theft. Consider the following quote from a Napster
official: ``We are not just making pirated music available, but
pushing demand.''
</P>
<P>
   A rather more serious objection to Patel's ruling comes from a
powerful coalition of technology firms _ the Consumer Electronics
Association, the Digital Future Coalition, and the Computer &AMP;
Communications Industry Association. Among them, these three groups
represent most of the world's biggest providers of computer
hardware and software, home electronics gear, and Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jaszi, a law professor at American University, helped
write this amicus brief. It doesn't exactly amount to a ringing
defense of Napster _ ``The brief certainly doesn't say that Napster
should win or Napster should lose,'' Jaszi insists. Still, their
argument takes aim at the heart of Patel's ruling, by making a
point with a good deal of merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are technologies that have multiple uses, some
obviously good and some perhaps bad, copyright law ought not to be
a means for stamping out those technologies,'' Jaszi argues.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what would have happened in the early 1980s if the movie
studios had succeeded in halting the sale of video cassette
recorders?
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios sued Sony
Corp. for mass producing its Betamax home video recorders. The
Betamax machines were a license to steal, the movie moguls alleged.
People would launch a trade in illegally copied movie and TV
programs that would cost the studios billions. There was only one
solution _ ban Betamax.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, a federal Appeals Court agreed. Fortunately,
the US Supreme Court stepped in. In 1984, the court ruled that even
if VCRs could be used to steal the studios' intellectual property,
the devices also had many legitimate uses. It would therefore be
foolish to ban the technology altogether, merely to prevent its
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It's a telling argument that suffers from a single flaw _ Patel
didn't try to ban Napster. Her ruling leaves the company free to
offer its service to those who trade in legal copies of digital
music.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this restriction threatens the company's doom
tells you all you need to know. It's a tacit admission of the
obvious _ the Napster business model is all about trading in stolen
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know that Napster alternatives like Gnutella and Freenet
ensure that the music thefts will continue. But that doesn't change
the fact that Napster has been well and truly busted, for
forgetting something I learned at my father's knee _ dealers in hot
merchandise generally get burned.

AS ELECTION NEARS, BOND TRADERS DREAM OF GRIDLOCK'S POTENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon after he was elected president, Bill Clinton made a
discovery that shocked him: The bond market matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you mean to tell me the success of my program and
reelection hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of (expletive)
bond traders?'' he asked his staff, according to an account
provided by Bob Woodward in his book ``The Agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton found out, the bond market has a political agenda,
too. It likes politicians who can deliver low inflation, moderate
growth, and budget surpluses _ the bigger the better. When it gets
what it wants, the bond market responds with lower interest rates.
When it doesn't, rates can head in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Migliozzi, a managing director at Fleet Investment
Advisors, thinks the bond market is already starting to focus on
the November election. And the bond market has a preferred outcome
too, says Migliozzi: gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Bond traders would like to see one party control the White House
and the other party control at least one house of the Congress.
That is the way it has been for the past six years, and the bond
market would like to see more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gridlock has been a success,'' says Migliozzi, speaking like a
true bond trader.

   In a gridlocked world, nothing much gets done in Washington. The
Democrats block Republican tax cuts, and Republicans block
Democratic spending plans. ``It's a new set of checks and
balances,'' says Nicholas Perna, an economic consultant in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, budget surpluses pile up like drifting snow
during a winter storm. During the Clinton era, the annual federal
budget went from $290 billion in deficit to more than $200 billion
in surplus. The strong economy and several different
deficit-reduction packages contributed to the fiscal shift.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of budget surpluses for the bond market is simple.
When Washington takes in more money than it spends, it uses the
extra money to pay down outstanding debt. That, in turn, reduces
the supply of bonds, which pushes up bond prices and reduces the
yield, or interest rate. With bonds, high prices and low rates is
the ideal combination.
</P>
<P>
   What could threaten this happy picture? A clean sweep in
November by one party. ``Faster policy changes will be possible if
one party wins control of the presidency and the Congress,'' the
economic team at Goldman Sachs wrote recently in a paper called
``Bush versus Gore: A Budget Referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goldman team concluded that the bond market has the most to
fear from a Republican sweep. (Given that they already control
Congress, the Republicans also have a better chance of winning it
all in November than the Democrats.)
</P>
<P>
   According to the Goldman economists, George W. Bush's tax-cut
plan would eat into the surplus and increase the risk that the
already hot economy would overheat. That would boost inflation and
force the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates. The economists
estimate that the Bush plan would add about 50 basis points, or
half a percentage point, to rates over time.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would use up part of the surplus with his plans for higher
spending on education and health care. But the Goldman economists
assume his scheme would have less impact on the surplus and on
interest rates than the Bush proposal.
</P>
<P>
   David Jones has a somewhat different take on the matter. While
he agrees that a sweep in November would probably be a negative for
the bond market, he doesn't see much difference between the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush will give part of the surplus back in tax cuts; Gore will
do it with spending. To me they come out about even,'' says Jones,
chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., a New York investment
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Jones makes another point: We are not talking about huge swings
in interest rates here. ``None of this is going to shake the
foundation of our being,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given their druthers, virtually everyone involved with
bonds would like to see a split decision in November. If a
President Bush faced a Democratic Congress, he would be
hard-pressed to win approval for a big tax cut. If a President Gore
had to contend with a Republican Congress, he would have to
compromise on his spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bond traders go to bed at night dreaming of such scenarios.
Their motto might be: ``Four More Years of Gridlock.''

LIEBERMAN'S RELIGIOUS ZEAL POSES DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the presidential campaign enters a crucial stretch,
Democratic vice &UR;  &LR; presidential nominee Joseph Lieberman's belief in
God has suddenly emerged as a major story, posing real challenges
for journalists and raising questions of media bias.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, after the Anti-Defamation League criticized
Lieberman for injecting too much religion into politics, all three
networks covered the flap in the opening minutes of their evening
newscasts. CNN's interactive ``Talkback Live'' show hosted a debate
on whether God belongs ``on the campaign trail.'' Wednesday, the
issue made front pages from The Boston Globe to the Los Angeles
Times and The Washington Post editorialized that Lieberman had
wandered ``too far across a line that separates politics from
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Lieberman's nomination shone the spotlight on
Orthodox Judaism, there'd been no shortage of heavenly invocations
in the campaign. George W. Bush was eager to point out that Jesus
Christ was the philosopher he most identified with, and Al Gore
revealed that he thinks about what Jesus would do to guide him in
crucial situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole campaign has been marked by prominent discussions
of faith,'' says David Briggs, religion writer at The (Cleveland)
Plain Dealer. ``One logical reason is a reaction to President
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman's embrace of religion represents a dramatic new
wrinkle on that theme. For one thing, he is a member of a minority
faith. For another, while most political displays of religious
fervor originate from the conservative Christian right, Lieberman
is a Jewish Democrat with moderate-to-liberal social leanings. All
this has left journalists struggling with the question of how to
cover this new brand of Bible thumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political piety is no longer in the Republican domain,'' says
Matthew Felling, media director for the Washington-based Center for
Media and Public Affairs. ``I think Lieberman is presenting a
definite challenge. Since he became the big story, we've seen it
(his religion) shift from a novelty to a nuisance. And the
reporters are in a kind of Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the debate is whether the mainstream media _ often
accused of treating religious conservatives with near open
hostility _ are giving Lieberman something of a pass.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, ABC religion correspondent Peggy Wehmeyer
interviewed a member of the National Association of Evangelicals
who stated that if ``an evangelical or Bush has said something like
this, the press would have been on him like so many tigers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Globe interview, Wehmeyer acknowledged that ``Lieberman has
surprised me most in how far he's gone. In so many words, he said
in Detroit the other day, `You can't be good without God.' You
would not hear Bush or Gore or Clinton say something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, there is a basic journalistic debate forming over
how much attention Lieberman's religious beliefs deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really off the mark . . . It's unbelievable, the
superlatives about his integrity or his morality,'' says Jeff
Cohen, founder of the liberal media watchdog FAIR. ``I think the
news media should be focusing less on the politician's rhetoric of
morality and more on whether a politician's record jibes with the
rhetoric of morality.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that he doesn't want to beat the story to
death, Kevin Eckstrom, national correspondent for the Religion News
Service, says, ``To us, Lieberman talking about religion . . . is
the point of who he is. It's part of his persona. It's as
legitimate as anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who regularly cover religion voice concern that faith
in politics, and religious conservatives in particular, are
unfairly stereotyped by the media. And they suggest that the same
harsh standards have not yet been applied to Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well there definitely seems to be a double standard,'' says
Eckstrom. ``Honestly, what I've sensed here is that there's been a
real reluctance to call Lieberman on this because people didn't
want to be seen as anti-Semitic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the term `Religious Right' became a pejorative,'' says
Briggs, who believes the Lieberman case could help educate ``some
journalists who have stereotyped Christian conservatives . . .
Because he is different, (there may) actually be some potential
postive developments coming from the Lieberman candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lieberman has somehow gotten away with saying things that a
Born Again Christian would get hammmered for perhaps,'' adds
Wehmeyer. ``It's new and unusual because he's a Jewish leader who's
speaking openly about God. Should he be held up to the same
scrutiny? I should think so. If you're gonna analyze God on the
campaign trail, we should treat Jews, Christians, and Muslims all
the same.''

 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arthur C. Danto has a soft, seductive voice that
syncopates in unexpected ways. It's a voice that inflects a lot,
which can make for sentences that sound poised between the
interrogative and declarative. That would be maddening in most
people, but for Danto it's more in the way of a job description. As
one of America's most eminent philosophers, he has spent half a
century working that profound ground where eternal questions sprout
tenative answers.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophers, at least in theory, are seekers after truth.
Truth, the poet says, is beauty. Thus it makes perfect sense that
Danto, who philosophizes by day, should moonlight as one of
America's best-known art critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been such a joy,'' Danto, 76, says of writing about art.
``I never knew there was anything so good as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming art critic of The Nation magazine in 1984, Danto
has published more than half a dozen books of art criticism and
theory, the most recent of which is ``The Madonna of the Future:
Essays in a Pluralistic Art World.'' He has won the National Book
Critics Circle Award, the College Art Association's Frank Jewett
Mather prize for criticism, and in 1995 delivered the prestigious
Mellon Lectures at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an art critic, Danto moves across eras and cultures of art
in ways that can be breathtaking,'' says Cynthia A. Freeland,
professor of philosophy at the University of Houston and author of
``Art Theory: A Very Short Introduction,'' which Oxford University
Press will publish this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing body of work,'' says David Carrier, himself a
philosophy professor, at Carnegie-Mellon University, and art
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Danto is Johnsonian professor emeritusof philosophy at Columbia
University, where he did his graduate work and has been on the
faculty since 1952. Freeland likens him to another Columbia
philosopher, John Dewey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although their theories of art are quite different, Dewey was
interested in the actual arts of his time, and in some of the
broader social and cultural aspects of how the arts function, as is
Danto. Both of them have what I would call broadly cognitive views
of art _ they think that art plays a meaningful role in human
communication; art embodies ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that Danto named one of his collections
``Embodied Meanings.'' ``Art appreciation'' interests him less than
``art understanding.'' ``I really try to find a context for the art
I'm writing about,'' he says, ``what's its connection with life,
what's it mean. Art isn't an end in itself for me.''
</P>
<P>
   An eclectic philosophical background has served Danto well in
his criticism. Before he started writing for The Nation, he
published books on subjects as diverse as the philosophy of
history, Jean-Paul Sartre, Asian thought, and Friedrich Nietzsche.
Danto had also long been interested in aesthetics, and Freeland
calls his 1981 book, ``The Transfiguration of the Commonplace,''
``one of the most important works in aesthetics in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as striking as the intellectual grounding of Danto's
criticism is its relative uninterest in formal properties. ``He's
more interested in the allusions, the philosophical smoke, he can
get out of the art,'' says the painter Joseph Solman. ``He's
thought-provoking, but that's not enough for me (as an artist).''
</P>
<P>
   It's a frequently voiced criticism of Danto's criticism, which
makes it all the more striking that he started out as an artist.
Throughout the '50s, he earned as much doing prints (mostly
woodcuts) as he did teaching philosophy. ``I was considered OK,''
Danto says of his artwork. Though highly gestural and influenced by
Abstract Expressionism, it's very much focused on the human figure.
``De Kooning had a lot of influence on me,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Danto's work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of
Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the
Walker Art Center, and the Seattle Art Museum. ``Every once in a
while, something of mine comes up at auction, which always makes me
feel funny,'' he laughs. ``I also am not nuts about the work, I
have to tell you, for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Danto closed up his workshop in 1962. ``One day I was working on
a print _ I loved cutting _ and I thought to myself (it was like a
real speech), I'd really rather be writing philosophy. So I said to
myself, if that's how you feel, it's time to stop. So I did, cold
turkey. I put everything away, and that was it. I never even
doodled after that. I just became a pure and simple philosopher.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Danto looks the part. With his bald pate and
patriarchal beard, he resembles a flesh-and-blood version of a bust
of Socrates. The effect is underscored by his prominent brow and
deep-set eyes. His left eye is slightly askew, which makes his
expression seem never quite at rest. This is in keeping with a
general impression he conveys of encompassing eagerness: an air of
perpetual curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur's one of the youngest people I know in terms of his
attitudes and sensibility,'' says Carnegie-Mellon's Carrier. ``He
has this straightforwardness and lack of pompous dignity. You don't
feel you're with a statesman. You feel you're with this person who
looks and listens, who's always doing new things.'' Pretty much
everything he encounters seems to interest Danto, and (this is
perhaps the crucial thing to know about the way his mind works) to
interest Arthur Danto is to delight him. The intellectual and the
actual come together for him in surprising and energetic ways.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Beyond the Brillo Box'' (1992), Danto describes an
experience that's emblematic. He was standing at a nondescript city
intersection. There were used-car lots on two corners, a gas
station, and a supermarket on the others. He recalls the motion and
color and excitement of so seemingly mundane a scene as traffic
whizzed past, plastic pennants fluttered, and radios blared.
Suddenly, it hit him: ``Good heavens. This is just remarkable!''
It's an epiphany many people have had, no doubt, but how many of
them went on to serve as president of the American Philosophical
Association and American Society for Aesthetics?
</P>
<P>
   Blending interestedness and delight, Danto communicates a sense
of constant, low-grade merriment. His manner _ open, genial,
unemphatic _ is that of the perfect intellectual host: someone
happy _ no, determined _ to freshen everyone's mental glass. He is
a man with, as he acknowledges, a ``sense of the world as such a
marvelous place, really, so long as you can escape the horrors. I'm
trying to write about (the 18th-century French painter) Chardin
right at this point, and it's that feeling about ordinary objects
(in Chardin's canvases) _ the pots, a basket of plums, something
like that _ it always knocks me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Danto neither looks nor acts his age (``When they took the
census, the guy asked me how old I was, and I said 76. He was
really surprised''). Yet as one who has lived more than
three-quarters of a century, he's aware that he's not going to live
another three-quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it all the time,'' he says. ``It doesn't do you
any good to be a philosopher. It doesn't give you a leg up. A
friend of mine who has multiple sclerosis and contemplated suicide
said, `What philosophy should I read?' I said it won't help. You
can read the `Crito' of Socrates, but it won't help. Heidegger? It
won't do you any good. But one thinks about it. I really enjoy life
a lot. So the idea of it snapping out like a light, this
deprivation of the world in that way, I sort of hate the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Danto lives near Columbia, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, with
his second wife, the artist Barbara Westman. They've been married
20 years. He has two grown daughters by his first wife, who died in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Their apartment houses a small, and vigorously varied, art
collection. Artists include Robert Motherwell, Mark Tansey, Sean
Scully, Saul Steinberg, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Robert Mangold.
Yet the most cherished piece of art may be a collage made out of
the inside of cigar boxes and old rotogravure photos done by
Danto's father as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   He was a dentist, in Detroit, which is where Danto grew up. The
future critic's first experience of art was being taken by his
mother to see Diego Rivera paint the murals at the Detroit
Institute of Arts. ``I had a nice upbringing,'' Danto says, ``but I
was muddled. Later, I realized I had a philosophical mind, but
there was no way of knowing I had a philosophaical mind, so I was a
very bad student.''

IN BUSH STRATEGY, ECHOES OF '94 DEBATE AGAINST RICHARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The race was close, his record was under attack,
and he was up against an incumbent with a reputation as an
excellent debater.
</P>
<P>
   Yet George W. Bush more than held his own in 1994 during his
only debate against Texas Governor Ann Richards, the silver-tongued
orator who lambasted Bush's father in her speech at the 1988
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after that debate, the former oil businessman and
baseball team owner prevailed and was elected leader of the
nation's second-most-populous state.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bush is in a familiar position: He is running for the
highest office in the land against Vice President Al Gore,
considered one of the Democrats' best debaters. Nearing the
traditional Labor Day kickoff of the general election campaign,
public opinion polls show an even race. The two campaigns are
haggling over the number and format for debates, with each side
knowing that these widely viewed meetings may tip the scales on
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   While verbal gaffes and his less than a term-and-a-half in
elective office have raised doubts about Bush's debating skills, a
look back at his 1994 face-off with Richards shows he was able to
effectively fend off criticism of his record and present himself as
an agent of change in the impending election.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who tuned into public television and radio stations
broadcasting the Oct. 21, 1994, debate heard many of the lines that
Bush uses on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, if Texans are happy with the status quo, if Texans
want someone who has spent her entire public life in politics, they
should not vote for me,'' Bush said then. It presaged his current
take-me-or-leave-me statements as Bush pitches himself as an
outsider against Gore, who has spent most of his life in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When Richards attacked Bush's business record, as Gore does in
criticizing his gubernatorial results, Bush retorted as he does
with the vice president. He accused the then-governor of negative
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   He said Richards was trying to ``smear my business record'' as a
``diversion away from talking about the issues facing Texas such as
education, welfare reform, and juvenile justice reform.'' It was,
he said then as he does now, ``just old-style politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a political science professor at the University
of Texas, said, ``The dominant impression I have of that debate was
Ann going after him with sarcasm and humor and Bush managed to stay
cool and not rattled by any of her efforts to do those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Slater, a political reporter for The Dallas Morning News
and one of the debate panelists, recalls: ``The expectations were
low and he met them. He answered the questions, he did well, he
seemed very respectful of Ann Richards.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the dynamic is much the same, so much so that Bush
campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said last week that Gore may have
already been ``outnegotiated'' in the debate process.
</P>
<P>
   Confident in his skills as a debater, the vice president had no
sooner secured the Democratic presidential nomination than he
e-mailed Bush and offered to drop all TV advertising in favor of
twice-weekly debates. He also accepted the three commission debates
and all others offered him, now totaling 42.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has yet to agree to any, including the proposed debate Oct.
3 at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, seeking leverage in
the negotations. But the impression that Gore will excel and Bush
may falter has left the vice president with high expectations and
Bush with decidedly low ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's up against someone who's supposed to knock him out of the
park, so if he just keeps from drooling on his tie or visibly
shaking, he should come out of it OK,'' said Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Those who watched in 1994 remember that Richards, unlike Gore,
was not overly eager to debate. The campaigns ended up settling on
one meeting, on a Friday night, a time when most Texans are not in
front of their TVs but in the stands for their local high school
football game.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was held at the Loews Anatole Hotel in Dallas,
immediately after one between US Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and
her Democratic challenger, Richard Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   The debate had a town-hall format, with a panel of 21 citizens
asking questions and four reporters asking followups.
</P>
<P>
   Richards used part of her opening statement to ask voters to
pray for the victims of recent floods around Houston. Immediately,
Bush disarmed her by declaring, ``Well-spoken, governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards then spoke of her top priority, education. Bush said he
wanted to ``change of culture'' so Texans were held accountable for
their actions, much as he says today of his goal for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   During the rest of the hourlong debate, the two spent time
clashing over the use of state lottery money, welfare reform, and
school reform.
</P>
<P>
   The core of Richards's argument, however, was that Bush was not
experienced enough to run the state. Richards, 61, had served as a
county commissioner and state treasurer before being elected
governor in 1990. Bush, 48, had lost his only bid for elective
office, a run for Congress in west Texas in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really serious,'' Richards said. ``This is not a joke.
We're talking about who is going to run the state of Texas. You
have got to have had some experience in the public sector before
you get the chief executive's job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush suggested his lack of experience was an asset, since he
would not be ``constrained by the current way of doing things in
Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards also attacked Bush's business record, saying that the
five companies he had run or served on the board of had lost a
combined $371 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may not seem like a lot to a businessman, but it seems
like a lot to those of us who have to balance a government
budget,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush disputed her analysis, said he was proud of his record, and
cited his work as managing general partner of the Texas Rangers. He
invited listeners to ``come and see The Ballpark at Arlington as an
example of entrepreneurship.'' The gleaming new stadium was built
with taxpayer money, but owned by the team.
</P>
<P>
   In a line of questioning that is expected to be echoed this
fall, a reporter asked Bush about his enlistment in the Texas Air
National Guard during the Vietnam War and whether he used the
influence of his father, a congressman from Houston at the time, to
avoid more-dangerous duty.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who flew a fighter jet, bristled at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting an F-102 jet in afterburner in a single-seat,
single-engine aircraft was a thrill, but it also wasn't trying to
avoid duty. Had that engine failed, I could have been killed, so I
was at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush went on to win the election, those who watched him in
1994 remember a far worse debate performance in 1998 and say it,
too, offers an important lesson to those who will watch this year's
debate.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent governor, squaring off against Democrat Garry
Mauro in El Paso, appeared uptight, despite having a strong lead in
the polls. ``All he was doing was trying to play defense,'' said
Paul Burka, executive editor of ``Texas Monthly'' and the
magazine's chief political writer.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls Bush being asked about funding for the University of
Texas at El Paso and replying that the solution was to take it out
of the ``PUF,'' the Permanent University Fund, and put it into the
``HEAF,'' the Higher Education Assistance Fund. Burka and others
felt it was the kind of bureaucratic answer for which he would have
skewered Richards four years earlier.

&HT;     LAKE DOMINATED REGION WHERE VILLAGES ONCE STOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN WECHSLER  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To most users, the Great Sacandaga Lake is a place for
recreation: Hundreds of camps line its shore, hundreds of boats ply
its waters, while below the dam, people in rafts, tubes and kayaks
cavort in the warm water released to the lower Sacandaga River.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sacandaga, by far the largest man-made lake in New York,
was not built for fun. It was built to prevent flooding, and its
creation drowned hundreds of farms and villages that had been in
families for generations.
</P>
<P>
   As early as the 1860s, people talked about building a dam on the
Sacandaga. A major tributary to the Hudson, the Sacandaga would
often flood in the spring when the massive Adirondack snows would
melt. Flooding along both rivers was routine.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, a drought could cause the Hudson to become too low
for safe boating. If boats were unable to come up the Hudson,
commerce in upstate New York was crippled.
</P>
<P>
   But the flood that really got the effort going was in March
1913, when parts of Albany, now some 40 miles southeast of the
lake, were inundated. When the waters receded, a typhoid epidemic
broke out.
</P>
<P>
   It took nine more years to do something about it. In 1922 the
Hudson River Regulating Board was created by the New York
Legislature. Made up mostly of private business owners, the
organization was to fund the project using private money.
</P>
<P>
   But they also had public muscle, which was needed when the
locals found out what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacandaga River valley was home to a dozen villages,
including West Day, Osborne's Bridge, Day, Conklinville, Fish
House, Bennedict, Batchellerville, Edinburgh, Mayfield, Cranberry
Creek and Munsonville. There was also a train track owned by the
FJ&AMP;G Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   And there was an amusement park, Sacandaga Park, which was owned
by the railroad and built on the banks of the river.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Regulating Board quietly bought up property in the
valley. But once word got out, buying was not so easy, or so cheap.
FJ&AMP;G sued the board over the planned drowning of its park and
railroad, and won $1.7 million. Locals, though, had little money to
sue and could only protest by refusing to leave their homes until
they were forced out by state agents.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of homes, and much of Sacandaga Park, were purposely
burned down to make way for the lake. Four whole hamlets were
drowned, as well as parts of many others.
</P>
<P>
   The earthen dam was completed on March 27, 1930. The
1,100-foot-long bridge contained 790,000 cubic yards of dirt and
rock and another 15,000 cubic yards of concrete. It cost $2
million, with another $500,000 for the half-mile-long
Batchellerville Bridge.

&HT;     PERSISTENCE MADE REMOTE LAKE PLACID A RESORT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN WECHSLER  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ One hundred thirty years ago, wealthy
adventurers loved Lake Placid. They just hated getting to it.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, a steamship would take someone as far as the west
shore of Lake Champlain. From there, a stagecoach covered the
40-odd miles to Lake Placid. The dirt tracks were not bad at first.
But as the road made its way up and over several mountain passes,
it became tougher and tougher, and not terribly enjoyable for
someone riding a stagecoach without shock absorbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten miles of rocks and mudholes,'' is how writer A.D. Mayo
described the road leading into the upstate New York village in his
1869 article, ``Adirondacks in August,'' for Old New Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But bad public relations still did nothing to hurt Lake Placid.
Soon after Mayo's less-than-glowing review, the area became the
first real winter resort in the United States. Today, it is one of
the Adirondacks' most popular destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of today's visitors don't realize it, but Lake Placid
village is actually located on Mirror Lake, not Lake Placid. The
much bigger Placid, with its huge islands, undeveloped shoreline
and waters that stop at the bottom of Whiteface Mountain, is
accessed at the western end of the village.
</P>
<P>
   Settlements on both lakes predate even the name ``Mirror Lake,''
a moniker that caught on in 1873 after a young girl staying in a
local hotel came up with the name. In 1810, it was called Bennett's
Pond, the name of the first settler to come to the area.
</P>
<P>
   The area around it _ the town of North Elba _ was used before
the Civil War by abolitionist John Brown as a farming community for
freed slaves. But it didn't work out; the weather was fierce, and
most of the former slaves had little experience working their own
farm.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Placid village was founded in 1850, but the area was mostly
known for several large farms. Then, in 1871, a farmer built a
hotel on Bennett's Pond. It was so successful that hotels cropped
up by the dozen during the next several decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1900,'' said Lake Placid historian Mary MacKenzie, ``we
were a very well-known summer resort.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the area attracted sportsmen and fishermen. Then, when
a train line was established from Saranac Lake in 1893, even more
people seeking mountain fresh air visited the area.
</P>
<P>
   History was also made in 1904 when the Lake Placid Club (started
by Melvil Dewey, inventor of the Dewey Decimal System) left part of
the club open in the wintertime. A group of 10 people came to enjoy
such winter sports as cross-country skiing, skating and
tobogganing. Word spread about how much fun they had that winter,
and the club never closed again for the winter. Lake Placid's
winter playground was born.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the village hosted the Olympics in 1932, it was the
first winter resort in America.

&HT;     BOOK DRAWS ON HISPANIC HISTORY SINCE THE ARRIVAL OF COLUMBUS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Ilan Stavans and Lalo Alcaraz are CQ)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RENE A. GUZMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new Hispanic history book written by Ilan Stavans and
illustrated by Lalo Alcaraz carves bold black-and-white strokes in
depicting the nation's varied shades of brown.
</P>
<P>
   An Amherst College professor and self-professed comics fan,
Stavans said the graphic novel made the perfect, powerful medium to
express his ``fiesta of types, archetypes and stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to tell the standard, predictable history you
find in textbooks,'' Stavans, 39, said in a telephone interview
from his office in Amherst, Mass. ``I wanted to create the idea
that history is not unchangeable. It's not a unity but a
multiplicity. I thought that it would bring in all the essential
elements of what our culture is about. Instead, it should be seen
as a kind of crossroads, many rivers coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   If culling Latin history seems a precarious trek across thin
ice, then Stavans' ``Latino U.S.A.: A Cartoon History'' (Basic
Books, $19.95) is a mad dash across frozen waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latino'' spans more than 400 years along the Latin timeline,
from Columbus hitting the Americas to the North American Free Trade
Agreement bringing them together. Like the ``Culture Clash''
television specials, ``Latino's'' kaleidoscopic perspective bubbles
with an irreverent mix of Latin politics, wit, self-reference and
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things that's missing from all Latinos when
presenting ourselves is the incredible humor we have privately,''
says Stavans. ``We share that with each other, but we don't expose
that. I wanted this (book) to be humorous, to laugh at history and
laugh at ourselves in the most democratic sense of the term. I
think you can do that in cartoons. You can be suggestive and
imaginative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Latino'' might wear culture on its book cover, but don't
expect it to read like ``Maus,'' Art Spielgelman's serious
comic-book allegory about Jews and the Holocaust. The book's
cultural tableau mostly resembles ``The Simpsons,'' making pointed
cultural observations from the safety of its own heady cartoon
trappings.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel ``Meme'' Castillo, executive director of San Anto
Cultural Arts Inc. in San Antonio, co-created the ``Los Necios''
comic strip and the city's El Placazo monthly newspaper. He said
the comics medium makes a great teaching tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's a more universal way or easier way to
understand history, regardless of your educational or financial
background,'' Castillo, 31, said. ``It definitely makes it more
interesting. `Maus' was an awesome book, easy to understand and not
boring. So people should not be criticized for reading historical
comic books.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Latino,'' the author's fifth-grade teacher (simply called
``Maestra'') narrates the cartoon epic. Along the way, Toucan (a
magical symbol from Mexican fantasy novels) and Calavera (the
grinning skeleton made famous by artist Jose Guadalupe Posada)
acerbically inject their own two centavos worth on every page.
</P>
<P>
   Famous Mexican icons Cantinflas (heralded as the ``Hispanic
Charlie Chaplin'') and El Santo (the wrestler folk hero of the
barrio) throw in some occasional barbs as well.
</P>
<P>
   The history begins with deconstructing the body of water that
simultaneously divides and unifies Mexico and the United States _
the Rio Grande, or Rio Bravo. The setup is a theme prevalent
throughout the text: History's facts and fictions are shared by
several different cultures regardless of borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words,'' Maestra said, ``there isn't a single Latino
history but many.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why a lot of people don't take to the Hispanic label,''
said Castillo, ``because you can't generalize us. Social
backgrounds and educational backgrounds have a lot to do with the
way you view life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to tell your own story,'' he said, ``and not be
complacent about or comfortable with what's being fed to you by
mass communications.''
</P>
<P>
   Stavans, whose books without pictures include ``The Hispanic
Condition'' and ``The Riddle of Cantinflas,'' said ``Latino'' is
really no different than his other works in that they simply strive
to challenge thought and debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should at least be doubt,'' he said. ``Leave the reader
or viewer with a question mark. By this, I don't mean that it's
right or wrong, but if you at least have this inquisitiveness that
would be enough. You may never have `The Truth' in front of you,
but that's life. And that's fine.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Probing beyond the pale
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 3, 2000
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man at the book store ran my credit card through the
machine, then turned and asked my e-mail address. My response was
impulsive: ``I don't have e-mail.'' He then proceeded to finish
ringing up the purchase. At the conclusion, I asked, ``Why did you
want my e-mail address?''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we can e-mail you promotions and offers,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought so. That's why I told you I didn't have one.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does this stuff end? First, retail businesses were
insisting on our zip codes, then addresses, then telephone numbers,
now e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Here, I have turned over to this person a plastic card with my
name and credit card number on it, but that's not enough. Now, I'm
asked to provide more so he can fill my computer with solicitations
to go along with the dozen or so others that now, without
authorization, arrive on a daily basis _ including some pretty ugly
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Moreso, with the information on my credit card, he already could
have found my life story if he wanted to -- and possibly charged a
flight to Paris on my account.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days earlier, I purchased a TV accessory in a nearby
electronics discount megaplex. I paid cash, under $50. When I got
home, I discovered the clerk had misrepresented my need and I
returned to the store, receipt in hand, for my money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I see your driver's license,'' the Returns clerk asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't in the mood for an argument, so I acquiesced by
flipping open my wallet to show the license in a credit card
window. ``Take it out, please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What for?'' I protested again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make a copy of it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a line beyond which I cannot be pushed, and this was
it. ``Listen, I paid cash for this lousy little thing. It says so
on the receipt, and I want cash back without having to go through
this deep an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The clerk, properly trained to be unyielding, stood her ground
until I demanded to see the manager. I was determined that this
line was not going to be crossed. An affable sort arrived. I
explained my irritation and, being as he was his own authority, he
advised the clerk to return my money without further scrutiny. (I
believe his decision was prompted by the vociferous manner of my
complaint, which was not lost on a dozen or so other customers in
our vicinity.)
</P>
<P>
   Back, in the early '60s, I once balked at identifying my race on
an application for a check cashing card at a discount store. I
thought it unnecessary and discriminatory. As the clerk insisted on
a race, I eventually wrote ``Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not a Negro!'' the clerk exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aha!'' I responded. ``You noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   I was denied the card. It's just as well. The store went out of
business shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when addresses were being demanded for some purchases, I
would perversely put down 77 Wistful Vista, which was the address
of Fibber McGee and Molly of radio show days. To this day, I still
don't put down my telephone number. They can find me anyway,
everyone else seems to have done so.
</P>
<P>
   I have full sympathy for establishments that have been
victimized by thieves with bad checks, phony credit cards and the
like, but the intrusion into my life as a result has grated me to a
raw edge.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past year, at an office supply store, a clerk asked
my zip code. Inasmuch as I was paying cash then as well, I told him
_ amiably, as I recall -- that no information from me was required
for the payment of legal tender. He advised that he could not ring
up the purchase without my zip code, whereupon I went to another
office supply place that could.
</P>
<P>
   We are living in a horrible era, one in which brigands abound
seeking to steal your credit card number, your phone number, your
e-mail address, your Web access. Through the phenomenon of
computers, so much of that is readily available without your direct
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: How many waiters and waitresses or store clerks _
strangers all _ have you given your credit card number to while
simply paying your bill? Who checks them out? What's their phone
number and e-mail address?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Morality play has played out on the stump
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you've forgotten, it's a president we'll be electing
this November, not a national pastor, priest, imam or rabbi. It
would be easy enough to forget, what with the candidates
hosannahing around the country as if they were caught up in a Great
Awakening rather than in what, properly, ought to be a down and
dirty, eye-gougin', ear-bittin' partisan wallow, as God intended.
</P>
<P>
   This holier-than-thou stuff is far more dangerous than partisan
scrapping to national comity and general well-being, which is why
the Anti-Defamation League, a defender of religious freedom, has
asked its co-religionist, the Democratic vice presidential nominee
Joseph Lieberman, to cool it with the God thing.
</P>
<P>
   It is fine for politicians to be religious. Presidential
candidates always have been, or have pretended to be. (Ronald
Reagan, who earlier had never seemed to give a fig about church, at
least put on a good show, as he did in most matters.)
</P>
<P>
   It is quite another thing to open politics up to a bidding war
in piety. That way lies a politics formed around sectarianism, with
all its potential for majoritarian bullying and for disallowing
even the deeply religious candidate who prefers quiet faith to
noisy testimony.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush started all of this by wearing his religion on
his sleeve. As governor, he had proclaimed an official Jesus Day in
Texas. He declared Jesus his favorite political philosopher and
pitched himself to the televangelists and televangites at Bob Jones
University, an academy of Christian exclusivity.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore parried with a gratuitous claim that when stumped, he
often asks himself, in the words of the fad bracelet, ``What would
Jesus do?'' And when Bush kept trying to hang him with President
Clinton's supposed scuzziness, Gore took up the formally religious
Lieberman as a talisman against guilt by association.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, rather than letting his faith be duly noted and
getting on with politics, has been working that line ever since,
equating Medicare with the commandment to honor your mother and
father, declaring ``Our nation was chosen by God'' and Americans
are the ``children of God'' and saying we're ``the most religious
nation in the world,'' which is so, but lamenting that we often
hide that, which isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   And that, in turn, set GOP vice presidential candidate Dick
Cheney off on a Bible Belt tour, with a Christian athletes' group
as his first stop.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a sinner and Baptist, a muddle most of us recognize
as both deplorable and richly precedented. Republicans, however,
have him as the virtual anti-Christ and, by dint of his misalliance
with an eager intern, figure him for a one-man moral sump who will
drag Gore down. And Democrats are afraid the Republicans are right.
</P>
<P>
   By now, though, the electorate has long since gotten the
message. All four men, in their various ways, believe in and honor
God. Fine. Isn't it time, gentlemen, to get out of the pulpit and
back on the stump?

<P>
   The decades-old notion that stomach ulcers were caused by
stress, spicy foods and other stomach irritants was officially
debunked by a National Institutes of Health study six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By then, a consensus of doctors had been converted to the notion
that most duodenal ulcers were caused by the bacterium Helicobacter
pylori and could be cured with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the new notion was another case of overreaction.
Evidence gathered in the last six years shows that less than half
the cases of stomach ulcers are caused by the bacterium, reports
The Washington Post. The other major cause is now thought to be
frequent use of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), though the causes of at least 10 percent of cases can't
be explained, the newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
   H pylori is naturally dying out, thanks partly to improved
sanitation worldwide, says the newspaper. Up to 60 percent of
Americans born before World War II are infected, while only 20
percent of younger Americans carry the bacterium, the report says.

   ARTHOUSE-FILMS (Undated) _ A Critic's Notebook: From the rosiest
perspective, the art film is far from moribund. And most critics
would agree that the cinemas of China, Iran, France, Denmark,
Taiwan and Spain, among other countries, are flourishing
artistically, if not producing many masterpieces. By Stephen
Holden.
</P>
<P>
   BELATED-CATS (New York) _ ``Do I see with my own very eyes a man
who's not heard of a jellicle cat?'' The speaker, bewhiskered, from
the stage of the Winter Garden Theater _ Munkustrap was his name _
wasn't looking at me, but I felt the accusation. What kind of
person was I, what kind of New Yorker, when for more than 17 years
I had never participated in the kitty culture of Grizabella, Old
Deuteronomy and the Rum Tum Tugger? Until a few months ago, when
its closing was first announced, I had never seen ``Cats.'' So sue
me. My defense? A bad one. Call it pride in avoidance, or elitism
selectively applied. Certain popular phenomena so saturate our
culture that for the ordinary purposes of staying current in a
useful, rudimentary way it isn't necessary to see them. I can
whistle ``Memory,'' the treacly anthem of ``Cats'' (under duress),
and the show's inherent puddy-tat cuteness is something I managed
to infer (accurately, it turns out) years ago. Still, ``Cats'' is
no nominal survivor; it's the real thing. By Bruce Weber.

   MAINE-MUSEUMS (Undated) _ Art museums are not what you think of
first in connection with the natural glories of Maine, but there
are no less than seven significant ones in this sparsely populated
state. And why not? With its wealth of woods, water and mountains,
Maine has always lured artists, among them Winslow Homer, Martin
Johnson Heade, Marsden Hartley, Childe Hassam, John Marin, Alex
Katz, Robert Indiana and Maurice Prendergast. Where there are
artists, there are museums to reap their work, and that's the case
here. By Grace Glueck.

<P>
   GETTYSBURG-MUSEUM (Gettysburg, Pa.) _ The National Park Service
recommends on its Web site that visitors to the Gettysburg National
Military Park spend at least four hours touring the battlefield and
museum, ``though an entire day is more desirable.'' As
understatements go, this is a keeper. You could spend a lifetime
here and never outlast the topic or the topography. But a weekend
excursion to this 6,000-acre shrine is a start. It can help to
explain why Civil War buffs are so ardent, why veterans of more
recent wars come here as if to communion and why historians,
novelists and filmmakers can't leave Gettysburg alone. By Charles
Strum.

week, is the delicate, blithely sentimental story of a retired
teacher and his devoted former students. Reviewed by A.O. Scott.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Titanic Town'' is by no means
the first film to portray the profoundly disruptive effects on
everyday life of the long-running troubles in Northern Ireland. But
in its harshly realistic scenes of British army tanks rolling
across the lawns of a middle-class housing development in West
Belfast, it stirs your blood. Reviewed by Stephen Holden.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPPED-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Whipped'' may set an all-time
record for raw tonnage of sexual fear and loathing spewed per
minute by a Hollywood movie. This bottom-feeding monstrosity of a
comedy was produced, directed and written by Peter M. Cohen, whose
screenplay conjures more leering euphemisms for male body parts and
sexual acts than any film in recent memory. Reviewed by Stephen
Holden.
</P>
<P>
   WILDFLOWERS (Undated) _ Melissa Painter's ``Wildflowers'' is a
dreamy, impressionistic inquiry into the legacy of the 1960s, but
it's less concerned with history than with mood. Reviewed by A.O.

&HT;     SEBASTIANI SELLS SOME BRANDS TO WINE GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VICTORIA COLLIVER and JENNY STRASBURG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sebastiani Vineyards Inc. has agreed to sell its
high-volume, lower-end wine division and its marketing unit to the
Wine Group Inc. as part of its effort to concentrate on premium
wines.
</P>
<P>
   The sale includes Sebastiani's Turner Road Vintners along with
its two wineries and a distribution center near Woodbridge, Calif.
Turner makes such brands as Farallon, Heritage, La Terre, Nathanson
Creek, Talus and Vendage.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of the sale is Sebastiani's marketing unit, Humphrey
and Brown International Wine Marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sebastiani and the Wine Group, the San Francisco company
that is known for its wine-in-a-box brand Franzia, are privately
held and declined to reveal the terms of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only key difference you'll see, from past to future, is
that the central focus of everything we do will be at the very high
end of the market,'' said Don Sebastiani, chairman and chief
executive of the winery.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastiani said his winery would start producing more estate
wines and other premium offerings. ``You'll see basically the best
of Sonoma in terms of the fruit we have available,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said Sebastiani's decision makes sense since
high-end labels are the fastest growing sector of the American wine
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real growth in the profitability in the industry has been
in the premium, upper-price categories,'' said Vic Motto, a wine
industry consultant based in St. Helena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile Sebastiani family, a name synonymous with
winemaking in Sonoma County, split ranks in the 1980s, with Don
Sebastiani sticking to the family label and brother Sam Sebastiani
and his wife, Vicki, starting the Viansa Winery in 1988 at the
southern edge of Sonoma Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Sebastiani has done well with his premium Viansa brands,
Motto said. Meanwhile, ``his brother Don took over the (Sebastiani)
winery and moved it to a more volume operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the family namesake winery is changing directions again,
focusing on its proprietary, estate and other high-end labels.
Motto predicts success in Sebastiani's $10-and-higher price range
during a time when the California wine industry is booming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have access to some very good vineyards in Sonoma
County, and certainly are one of the great names in Sonoma
County,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Sebastiani played down the 15-year-old split with his
brother, saying Sam Sebastiani is a shareholder in the family
company and a partner in its future: ``This deal was basically
driven by the people who have control over Sebastiani and that's my
sister, my brother and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sebastiani sold about 8 million cases of wine in its 2000 fiscal
year ending June 30, of which Turner produced about 7.8 million
cases, according to the company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In selling some of its divisions, Sebastiani said the Wine Group
would essentially trade up for some of Turner Road's higher brands,
such as Farallon.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, Wine Group chief executive Art Ciocca said:
``The Sebastiani family and their organization have done a
tremendous job of building strong brands, which is very much a
shared value of our company.''
</P>
<P>
   Sebastiani described Ciocca as an old friend. ``I feel more like
I'm gaining a son-in-law than losing a daughter,'' he said.

   CHENEY _ LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Dick Cheney, the GOP vice

school in Lake Worth. Earlier in the day, a bit of a political row
erupted in Broward County, a Democratic bastion just south of Palm
Beach County, when Democratic school board members attempted to
force a cancellation of a Cheney visit to a school there. His visit

You haven't lived until you've lived in the 1950s. A friend sent me

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ It is not often that you have a chance to
witness a historic event. Mine came on a spring day in 1952 at
Lafargue High School, located near the banks of the Red River in
Avoyelles Parish, La. It was during an eighth-grade science class I
was teaching. I was lecturing on the characteristics of poisonous
snakes when Elton Lee Lofton, a redhead from lower Vick, raised his

I don't,'' I said. ``Grandpa said you wouldn't,'' Elton said.

years, I can identify with the feeling that one has entered a

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Some Texas Republicans have
been contemplating their slots in a George W. Bush presidential
administration. Others are looking ahead to the political musical
chairs that will start when the Texas governor moves into the White
House. Several members of the Texas Senate are jockeying, with
varying degrees of subtlety, to become lieutenant governor when
Rick Perry moves up to replace Bush. But as Democrat Al Gore's
bounce in the polls was a little stronger than the Bush folks would
have hoped and Bush has struggled to fill in the details of his
trillion-dollar tax cut idea, ponder this:

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ HOUSTON, Texas _ It is said that Texas air
pollution got built into an issue in 1999 because Texas'
jogger-in-chief was running for president. Actually in this city it
took some other runners to make it so. Last October, the Deer Park
High School girls cross country team went for its daily four-miler.
The whole squad shortly was bent over coughing and wheezing,
throats raw. Coach Mike Walker instantly knew something was wrong.
He was right. They had been flexing their lungs in what Los Angeles
would have classified a Stage 1 Smog Alert, which to the Houston
man on the street was a day without discernible alarm. (John Young

   TIRE-DEALERS _ ATLANTA _Local tire dealers say things seem to be

tires, particularly Michelins. Many customers want their Firestones
off whether recalled or not. At least 5 percent of NHTSA complaints
(and maybe 28 percent) are Firestone tires of other sizes than

   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA _ The tire crisis for

manufacturers as well. As consumers look for alternatives as
replacement tires, other manufacturers find that this windfall of

Goodyear expects to ramp up production of the tires sizes in
question by as much as 50 percent. Other manufacturers are planning
similar increases in production.(Sharp, Atlanta

   CHILD-STARS _ I've always wondered why any parent would let
their child go into show business. Sure, the potential for huge
paydays is tempting. But is the price that must be paid for that
possible fortune worth it? Child stars, for instance, are often
robbed of a normal childhood. Growing up is hard enough. Imagine
having to do it in front of millions of people watching your every
move or snickering about every goofy-looking pimple you get. The
pressure to perform is also insanely intense. Many adult actors
can't even take the heat and often resort to drugs and alcohol to
cope. Just think what it's like for a kid to overhear a producer
angrily talking about low ratings and possible cancellation.

it's all part of his secret to longevity. ''I'm a spin doctor,'' he

into his hands. The Dorseys were one day into a five-day,
cross-country trip from their home in Orinda, Calif., to the UM
campus when a wave of doubt and homesickness struck the 18-year-old
quarterback. ``You know mom, I don't know if I've made the right
decision going so far away,'' said Dorsey, his voice quivering.
``I'm going to be a million miles from my friends, my family,
everyone and everything that I know. Did I do the right thing?''
Maggie Dorsey assured her son that he had, but if further

residence director of the boys ranch, was expecting a troubled
13-year-old, but this person didn't fit the description of a
typical rising ninth-grader. ``I thought some college kid had come
in,'' said Bouchard, now president of the Florida Sheriffs Youth
Ranches. But this big, strong boy was Bullard, a child who had just

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As good as the economy is and as wonderful as
the job market is, a lot of people still are struggling. They
really are trying to land a better job, but nothing seems to be
going their way.
</P>
<P>
   If you are one of them and have no idea why the world is passing
you by, consider these possible causes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A weak resume.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it to one page. In the initial screening, your resume will
be glanced at for five or 10 seconds. Long-windedness works against
you. If you get called in for an interview and think the one-page
resume doesn't adequately display your talents, bring a longer
version with you.
</P>
<P>
   Tailor it to the company. What kind of skills does the company
emphasize? How would you fit into a particular job there _ or,
better yet, why should the company create a job that would be
perfect for your skills? If they find the right people, smart
managers are adept at making room for them.
</P>
<P>
   If you are sending an electronic resume, make sure you use the
same job titles and buzzwords the company does. Companies use
software to search for keywords.
</P>
<P>
   List your e-mail address so the company will know you are
familiar with computers. Unless your references are incredibly
influential, don't bother listing them in the early stages. And
make sure that you and a friend proofread the resume; don't rely on
your computer's spell checker.
</P>
<P>
   _ A lack of sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Applying to dozens of companies at once is almost always a waste
of time. Find a company that you really want to work for and a job
that you really want to have, then go for it. If nothing is
available right now, let people know that you're interested. And
stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   Do your homework about the company, its needs and its culture.
Write a sincere cover letter explaining why you want to work there
and why you'd be the best person for the job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Poor networking.
</P>
<P>
   Your chances of getting a job at any company are tremendously
greater if you know people there and they think highly of you. Let
friends and associates know you're looking, and go to professional
conferences and workshops to meet people. Don't push acquaintances
for job help right away, but build relationships so you can help
each other in the future.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bad interviews or references.
</P>
<P>
   If you have made it to several job interviews but just can't
seem to get hired, you are either shooting yourself in the foot or
someone is doing it for you.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare for interviews by thinking about anecdotes that show how
you perform under pressure, how you deal with difficult situations
and what skills you have picked up in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Try having a mock interview with a friend or trusted colleague.
If possible, ask an interviewer who rejected you how you could
improve your chances for the future.
</P>
<P>
   If your interviews seem to go well, check your references. Do
you get permission from references before people call them? Do you
alert them about what your prospective job involves so they can
think about which qualities of yours make you particularly suited
for it? Do the interviewers actually call the references? Do you
let your references know that you appreciate their help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes workers think they are more mature than they really
are.
</P>
<P>
   By all means, set tough goals for yourself, but realize that
some top employers demand a lot of experience before they'll hire
anyone. Even you. We all want to be millionaires overnight, but
sometimes it can actually take a week or two. Be patient.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in a dying industry or tight market, you might get
turned down many times before landing a job. Make sure your past
failures don't lead to future ones. If you walk in looking like a
loser, that's just how you'll walk out.

Prudhoe Bay as oil and natural-gas production begins. Newfoundland,
long Canada's poorest province, stands to reap the biggest benefit.
Of the 11 oil fields larger than 100 million barrels discovered
worldwide since 1979, four have been off the coast of Newfoundland,
on the Grand Banks. Although Atlantic Canada's oil industry is now
taking its baby steps, the newest fields can only cement the

Canada already is the top supplier to the United States of natural

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Delays in opening the new international terminal
at the San Francisco airport have bumped up costs another $4.5
million to compensate the retail tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The city Airport Commission approved the payments Tuesday, two
weeks after approving $3.1 million to reimburse restaurants at the
terminal for construction costs and lost earnings caused by the
delay. The most recent action covered construction work that
retailers had to do on their own, including the extension of
utility lines, said airport spokesman Peter Nardoza.
</P>
<P>
   More costs were likely, he said, and the opening date is still
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Some retail tenants of the new terminal have incurred huge costs
in hiring employees in anticipation of an earlier opening, and some
have loan payments that begin before the new facility is open.
</P>
<P>
   The five-story international terminal, the centerpiece of the
San Francisco International Airport's $2.4 billion construction
project, was scheduled to open Sept. 26. Airport officials
announced Aug. 12 that they needed more time to test safety and
communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   A charter company, Sky Service, will begin using part of the
terminal around mid-September, Nardoza said. If all goes well, he
said, other airlines could move in sometime in November.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, originally $850 million, has grown to the $975
million-$1 billion range and could increase by an extra $25 million
to $50 million, Nardoza said. But he said the project is covered
and is not in the red. The increases are due to expansions in
building space available for retail business, approved by the
Airport Commission, and changes in design requested by the
airlines, Nardoza said.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners believe the prime contractor, Tutor-Saliba Corp.,
is taking longer than it should, and will consider going to court
to recover some of the costs if an agreement cannot be negotiated,
Nardoza said. The company has said changes in project
specifications by the commission are responsible for the delay.

   ARTHOUSE-FILMS (Undated) _ A Critic's Notebook: From the rosiest
perspective, the art film is far from moribund. And most critics
would agree that the cinemas of China, Iran, France, Denmark,
Taiwan and Spain, among other countries, are flourishing
artistically, if not producing many masterpieces. By Stephen

   BELATED-CATS (New York) _ ``Do I see with my own very eyes a man
who's not heard of a jellicle cat?'' The speaker, bewhiskered, from
the stage of the Winter Garden Theater _ Munkustrap was his name _
wasn't looking at me, but I felt the accusation. What kind of
person was I, what kind of New Yorker, when for more than 17 years
I had never participated in the kitty culture of Grizabella, Old
Deuteronomy and the Rum Tum Tugger? Until a few months ago, when
its closing was first announced, I had never seen ``Cats.'' So sue
me. My defense? A bad one. Call it pride in avoidance, or elitism
selectively applied. Certain popular phenomena so saturate our
culture that for the ordinary purposes of staying current in a
useful, rudimentary way it isn't necessary to see them. I can
whistle ``Memory,'' the treacly anthem of ``Cats'' (under duress),
and the show's inherent puddy-tat cuteness is something I managed
to infer (accurately, it turns out) years ago. Still, ``Cats'' is
no nominal survivor; it's the real thing. By Bruce Weber.

   MAINE-MUSEUMS (Undated) _ Art museums are not what you think of
first in connection with the natural glories of Maine, but there
are no less than seven significant ones in this sparsely populated
state. And why not? With its wealth of woods, water and mountains,
Maine has always lured artists, among them Winslow Homer, Martin
Johnson Heade, Marsden Hartley, Childe Hassam, John Marin, Alex
Katz, Robert Indiana and Maurice Prendergast. Where there are
artists, there are museums to reap their work, and that's the case
here. By Grace Glueck.

   GETTYSBURG-MUSEUM (Gettysburg, Pa.) _ The National Park Service
recommends on its Web site that visitors to the Gettysburg National
Military Park spend at least four hours touring the battlefield and
museum, ``though an entire day is more desirable.'' As
understatements go, this is a keeper. You could spend a lifetime
here and never outlast the topic or the topography. But a weekend
excursion to this 6,000-acre shrine is a start. It can help to
explain why Civil War buffs are so ardent, why veterans of more
recent wars come here as if to communion and why historians,
novelists and filmmakers can't leave Gettysburg alone. By Charles
Strum.

   NIRELAND-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Titanic Town'' is by no means
the first film to portray the profoundly disruptive effects on

in its harshly realistic scenes of British army tanks rolling
across the lawns of a middle-class housing development in West
Belfast, it stirs your blood. Reviewed by Stephen Holden.

   WHIPPED-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Whipped'' may set an all-time
record for raw tonnage of sexual fear and loathing spewed per

screenplay conjures more leering euphemisms for male body parts and

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two middle-aged Parisians meet through an ad in a rather racy
singles magazine for the expressed purpose of impersonal,
no-strings attached sex and remain nameless to one another until
the affair plays out to its nervous, frustrated break.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Affair of Love'' is not a remake of ``Last Tango in
Paris,'' though you might think so based on its original French
title, ``A Pornographic Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathalie Baye (``The Return of Martin Guerre'') and Spanish
leading man Sergi Lopez (``Western'') play the lonely lovers, who
recall their brief love affair for an unseen interviewer. The mock
documentary interview framework, which comes from Ingmar Bergman's
``Hour of the Wolf'' (Woody Allen also used it in ``Husbands and
Wives''), is like a mediated confession to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Their first meeting is awkward and apprehensive, charged with
both discomfort and excitement as they force small talk over drinks
before leaving for a hotel room. When they enter the room, the
camera discretely backs out of the hallway, staring at the closed
door fading away.
</P>
<P>
   It's an arch beginning to a film that loosens up to an easy
naturalism. Baye's nervous smiles become genuine and joyful as she
grows more confident and assured, and Lopez nicely straddles the
line between nonchalant openness and emotional defensiveness. The
purely physical meetings turn romantic and the discomfort dissolves
into relaxed conversations and passionate looks, until the camera
is invited into their hotel room for a spontaneous, unplanned
coupling.
</P>
<P>
   The original title to the contrary, the discreetly shot portrait
of pillow talk and passionate lovemaking is anything but
pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   Director Frederic Fonteyne briefly discards his naturalism for a
surreal vision of the hotel, a claustrophobic, hellishly crimson
red hall more literary device than dramatic realism, with a cool
blue sanctuary behind the door, a heaven on the other side of
purgatory. It effectively removes their affair so far from the
social world that when it intrudes, first in petty fears and then
in the form of an old couple suffering a loveless marriage, it
shatters their sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The film is framed in flashback so there are no surprises, but
watching romance unravel is as painful as it is inevitable and
Fonteyne captures it with delicate modesty. Baye and Lopez create
fragile, vulnerable characters whose defensive instincts overcome
their courage as self doubts and second guesses get in the way of
their own honesty, and their performances are rich and nuanced.
</P>
<P>
   It's a modest film but rich with observation and unspoken
regret, and the texture of their performances bring it to life.

`WHIPPED' IS A REAL PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: F  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood seems to be having a competition this year to come up
with the most vulgar, vile and repulsively scatological comedy ever
made _ a reaction, the trade papers say, to the box-office success
of last year's celebration of sex and the bathroom, ``American
Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whipped'' is very much in this tradition. But since its studio
_ Destination Films _ is a little guy trying to make a name for
itself, it's gone all out to beat the competition with its volume
of crudity and the sheer gusto with which it rubs its audience's
face in the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of three unbelievably odious and moronic
Manhattan bachelor buddies (Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and
Zorie Barber) and their married pal (Judah Domke), who get together
every week to brag about their sexual exploits in numbingly graphic
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The plot deals with what happens when they each independently
meet the same perfect woman (Amanda Peet), and suddenly find
themselves in competition for her _ a conflict that's complicated
by the fact that she's quite happy to bed all three.
</P>
<P>
   But this story line _ which rips off the 1962 Kim Novak comedy,
``Boys' Night Out'' _ is only the thinnest imaginable premise for
first-time director-writer-producer Peter M. Cohen to string
together a succession of lame and/or intentionally disgusting sex
and bathroom gags.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, this kind of humor can be a guilty pleasure if it's
done with even a modest comic flair or comes out of an ingratiating
characterization. But this movie was made by a harrowingly
untalented filmmaker, and never comes close to an authentic laugh
or a recognizable human being.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a Woody Allen movie in which the characters endlessly
talk about their bowel movements instead of the incongruity of the
human condition.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps my distaste for this movie is an accumulation of
distaste for all the movies this summer that aim this low. Perhaps
there is a more excruciatingly painful and self-abusive way to
spend 82 minutes. But I honestly can't think of what it would be.

&HT;     DEAD LAKE SHOWS A FEW SIGNS OF REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DINA CAPPIELLO  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG MOOSE LAKE, N.Y. _ For fifty years, Big Moose Lake has been
the poster child for the slow poisoning of Adirondack waters by
acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   Big Moose isn't the most acidic lake in New York's vast
Adirondack Park. But it's size _ 1,266 acres of tea-colored water _
has earned it the reputation as the largest lake to die from acid
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say 500 of the roughly 2,800 lakes scattered
throughout the New York's 6-million-acre park show few signs of
animal or plant life. And unless conditions change _ mainly by
diminishing air pollution generated by power plants hundreds of
miles south and west of the mountains _ half of the Adirondack
lakes could be dead 40 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Moose is a tragedy,'' said Karen Roy, the project
coordinator for the Adirondack Lakes Survey Corporation, an
affiliate of the state Department of Environmental Conservation
(DEC) that has studied Big Moose since the mid-80s.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is more complex. Those who have lived on Big
Moose for generations and watched acid rain slowly unravel its web
of life have witnessed some recent signs of recovery. Loons now
glide across the lake, a signal that there are fish in its waters.
Beavers and otters roam its shores and wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more wildlife than I can recall going back to the '50s
and '60s,'' said Jon Martin, a handyman whose family has lived and
worked on Big Moose for 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the DEC began restocking the lake, something it refused
to do for 12 years, during which time the pH level dipped as low as
4, a level too low to support most life. Now, with pH readings as
high as 5.5 _ close to natural rainfall _ scientists believe fish
have a chance at survival.
</P>
<P>
   But the recovery could be only a quirk of nature and may not be
permanent. Big Moose hasn't had much snow or rain the past few
years to drive its pH down and make it more acidic. A return to
normal precipitation levels, with the acid it would carry, could
reverse the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always like this.
</P>
<P>
   Edith and Ennis Pilcher bought a 14-acre camp, accessible only
by boat, on Big Moose's East Bay in 1966. They hoped to distance
themselves from civilization. But they soon found that even in the
center of the Adirondack rain and snow belt, wind carried
pollutants from factories hundreds of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came to this spot, kids used to fill buckets with
clams and crayfish. You could see them disappear year after year,''
said Ennis Pilcher, a retired physics professor at Union College in
Schenectady, sitting in the living room of the house he and his
wife built on Big Moose's shore.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Pilcher looked out the window to a lake filled so much
with rainwater that their boat dock was drowned on a recent
morning. Absent from the horizon are the forests' tallest trees _
the white pine _ which have succumbed to the toxic aluminum acid
rain releases from the soil. Weakened, the pine trees fall prey to
white-tailed deer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our skyline used to be full with white pines, but one by one
they all disappeared,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Living intimately with their environment, those around the lakes
notice the subtle changes acid rain brings. It first attacks the
base of the food chain, microscopic plants and animals upon which
fish and other life depend. Slowly, over decades, the rest of the
chain of life crumbles.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not only the acid that knocks out life. The rain seeps
into the lake after a journey through the soil, bringing with it
toxic metals such as aluminum and mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Residents know it will take time to reassemble all the
connections that sustain an ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's insidious,'' said C.V. ``Major'' Bowes, a Big Moose
resident since 1951. ``It sneaks up on you, and you may not know it
by looking at the lake.''

 &HT;    The top drivers in the Busch Grand National series
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are our picks for the top five drivers on the Busch
circuit:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1. Jeff Green: Green, from Owensboro, Ky., has a realistic
chance to claim the Busch Grand National championship by late
September. He has enjoyed a brief stint in Winston Cup with
less-than-stellar results. Green seems content running up front
each week in the No. 10 Chevrolet. He has two racing on the Busch
circuit, David and Mark.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  2. Jason Keller: Keller, who drives the No. 57 Chevrolet, is a
very solid driver. He's good for at least one victory each season.
Staying in Busch seems to be his best option, because he may not be
as marketable as some of the younger drivers. He is Jeff Green's
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3. Kevin Harvick: It's unusual for a rookie to be listed among
the top overall drivers. But Harvick has displayed veteran
tendencies in 21 of 22 races he has run. Two victories in a rookie
season is commendable, especially on a circuit where more than 50
cars attempt to qualify each week.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4. Todd Bodine: Dogged by hard luck, the youngest of the three
racing Bodine brothers seems to have found a comfortable home in
the Busch Series after testing the Winston Cup waters in the early
1990s. Bodine would like to get back to Winston Cup, but realizes
he can be a star in Busch. Live television, large crowds, and
Sundays off is hard to walk away from when you consistently run in
the top five. He won this year in Busch for the first time since
1997 and substituted for Terry Labonte in the Winston Cup Series at
Indianapolis and Watkins Glen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  5. Ron Hornaday: Busch's ``other rookie'' also has two
victories this year. Hornaday inherited the cars used the last two
years by Dale Earnhardt, Jr., who won back-to-back Busch
championships.
</P>
<P>
   He is a hard-nosed driver who has successfully made the jump
from the Craftsman Truck Series.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Q&AMP;A: JIM HUNTER, DARLINGTON RACEWAY PRESIDENT
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Darlington Raceway hosts NASCAR's oldest race, the
Southern 500. Jim Hunter, president of Darlington Raceway, spoke
this week with Cox News Service reporter Rick Minter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How special is it for you to be a South Carolina native and
be president of Darlington Raceway?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's more than a job, it's a lifestyle. When I was growing
up, there were two races on the radio every year _ the Indianapolis
500 and the Southern 500. I listened to both of them faithfully. I
didn't get to come to a race at Darlington until 1961 because I was
always playing football. Little did I know that the first race I
would see here would be as a sportswriter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which Southern 500 do you consider the best race?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably two years ago with Jeff Gordon and Jeff Burton.
Gordon was running for a million dollars from Winston. Burton got
about halfway up to him going into the third turn. They banged
fenders and got squirrelly. Jeff Gordon cut him off and went on to
win the million dollars. Jeff Burton said afterwards that if he had
known that was going happen he would have hit him a little harder.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who do you consider to be the best driver that ever ran
Darlington?
</P>
<P>
   A: David Pearson. He could run dirt, short asphalt, big asphalt,
road courses. Darrell Waltrip said you could run 400 miles of a
500-mile race and you'd never know David Pearson was on the same
racetrack. All of a sudden, in the last hundred miles, he'd come
roaring to the front. He was he first driver who raced for the
money. In the last few years, Dale Earnhardt has become a lot like
Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With NASCAR expanding into new markets, how long can
Darlington continue hosting two races a year?
</P>
<P>
   A: I feel pretty comfortable with our two dates right now.
They're adding two race next year _ at Chicago and Kansas _ and if
you're going to go to another big new market, a new race track is
going to have to be built. That will take at least two years. And
there are three or four tracks that they're going to have to look
taking a race from before they look at Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are you picking to win Sunday's race?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think you'll see Rusty Wallace finally win Darlington. But
the Burton boys have won the last three Darlingtons, so it's going
to be pretty interesting.
</P>
<P>
   DID YOU KNOW?
</P>
<P>
   The Darlington Raceway track is shaped like an egg to protect a
minnow pond outside turn four. When the track was built in 1949, a
nearby landowner refused to budge, causing the track to be built
with wide turns one and two and narrow turns three and four. The
pond no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   No Rainbows for Gordon: If Jeff Gordon isn't wrecking with Tony
Stewart, then he's burdened with faulty engine parts. It happened
last week at Bristol. ``If we didn't have bad luck, we wouldn't
have any luck at all,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the No. 24 car placed 23rd at Bristol and is
struggling to hold his position in the top 10 in the points
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott laying low
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott is a tough man who has spent a career racing with
injuries. Ray Evernham had to talk Elliott, who is recovering from
a broken left kneecap, out of driving at Bristol last week. Elliott
hates to sit on the sidelines, but he needs to lay low until the
knee heals.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger not always better
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Bristol night race did not have one of its
classic finishes, it still was exciting from start to finish. And
alone that was a change from most races this summer. Only three
short tracks remain on NASCAR's schedule. But bigger doesn't always
translate into better.
</P>
<P>
   Wells struggles for respectability
</P>
<P>
   When team owner Cal Wells selected Andy Houston to drive the
McDonald's-sponsored car in Winston Cup next year, he took a big
step toward respectability. Wells was the laughingstock of
stock-car racing earlier this year when he signed two open-wheel
drivers to participate in Busch and Winston Cup. Wells made a key
move by hiring Brad Parrott, the brother of Dale Jarrett's crew
chief, to be the top wrenchman with Pruett. Houston is the son of
Busch legend Tommy Houston and had far more potential than the
other finalist, Chad Little.
</P>
<P>
   Safety concerns muted
</P>
<P>
   The heated safety issue has cooled off in recent weeks. Jeff
Burton was one of only a few of big-name drivers to call for
big-time changes, which included a plea for modifications at New
Hampshire. The drivers return to the sport's ``most dangerous
track'' in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ince inks deal with MB2
</P>
<P>
   James Ince, the youngest crew chief in the Winston Cup Series,
has signed a two-year contract with MB2 Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Ince, 29, is in charge of the No. 10 team of Johnny Benson this
year, and will remain so at least through the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   Are drivers really athletes?
</P>
<P>
   Golfers and race drivers have this in common: People always want
to know if they consider themselves to be ``athletes.'' As
expected, the question infuriates golfers and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I have to say to anyone that thinks it doesn't take good
physical condition to drive one of these cars is that I'll give
them a two-second cushion and all they have to run is 18-second
laps at Bristol and let them run 50 laps straight and let's see
what they look like after 50 laps,'' Wally Dallenbach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care if they think we're athletes or not. When
you sit in one of these cars and do it yourself, then you can
answer for yourself whether we're athletes or not. I don't get
wrapped up in that,'' Dallenbach said. ``I think anybody that's
gone through the Richard Petty Driving School or any of those
driving schools has a little bit better appreciation for what a
race driver goes through in four hours in a stock car. When it's
hot, I've lost up to six pounds in a car.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR goes Hollywood
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood stunt man Stanton Barrett will drive the Jimmy
Spencer-owned car in the Busch Series race at Darlington. Barrett
has appeared in such movies as ``The Patriot'' and ``Last of the
Mohicans,'' and in the ``Baywatch'' and ``Beverly Hills 90210''
television series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're testing the grounds to potentially put together a
program for next year,'' Barrett said. ``We have had a few
companies show an interest in sponsoring a car with me driving and
Jimmy as the owner, and we're looking at some other opportunities
too. With my experience as a driver and his experience as an owner,
we think we can do some pretty great things together.''

 &HT;    New tires may tame Darlington
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darlington Raceway is known as the ``Track Too Tough to Tame.''
But to many Winston Cup drivers, it is the ``Track Too Tough For
Tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Tires get devoured on race days at the aging South Carolina
track. The abrasive surface of the egg-shaped oval ``chews up tires
like a cheese grater munching warm cheddar,'' according to one
NASCAR team member.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear, official tire supplier for the Winston Cup Series, is
doing its best to solve the problem. Today, the company will
introduce a tire with a new compound for Sunday's Southern 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will still see some tire wear and lap time give-up at the
event, but it will be dramatically reduced,'' Goodyear's Tony
Fruend predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Dale Jarrett in the 1999 Southern 500, we will see teams
not have to pit at every caution flag to gain valuable track
position. We believe the tires are on their way to taming
Darlington.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of tires is always a popular topic in the garage
area, especially before the Darlington and Rockingham races. Ward
Burton, who won the spring race at Darlington last March, isn't
thrilled about the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Goodyear would leave the tires alone,'' Burton said.
``It doesn't seem like these tires are nearly as consistent as the
brand that we had before, so it creates some problems for us at
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it definitely throws a whole other dimension to not only
using your notes, but also to trying to do your homework properly
before you take a car to the racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   The new tire supposedly won't have as much grip, but it is
supposed to last longer. Two weeks ago, Tony Stewart's team
practiced with the tire at Darlington under the same hot and humid
conditions forecast for this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see that it lasted much longer as far as speed was
concerned,'' said Greg Zipadelli, the No. 20 crew chief. ``It had
less grip and the wear wasn't as bad. It seemed like it worked a
little bit, but we gave up a bunch of grip. It was a little
frustrating at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Tire management figures to be the key this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track is so abrasive on tires that you like to pit on your
qualifying lap to get fresh tires,'' John Andretti said with a
chuckle.

DESPITE POTENTIAL, `PSYCHO BEACH PARTY' STUCK IN THE SAND 
</HEADLINE>
   Our Grade: C+  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Psycho Beach Party'' desperately wants to be the ``Rocky
Horror Picture Show'' of the surf-and-sand movie set.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the campy stage play by Charles Busch (who co-stars as
the butch cop Capt. Monica Stark), it mushes the Frankie and
Annette beach parties with slasher films and psychological
thrillers and stirs it all up with an undercurrent of sexual
repression and homoerotic lust. It's a promising recipe for comedy
that goes flat in the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Ambrose plays Chicklet, a spunky, schizophrenic Gidget
with two alternate personalities: a trash-talking homegirl and a
lusty dominatrix. Chaste cutie Chicklet, clueless to the dating
scene, joins the local surf clan led by Kanaka (Thomas Gibson) and
falls for college psych major dropout Starcat (Nicholas Brendon)
while Kanaka flirts with her dark side.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a blonde, bubble-headed B-movie starlet moves into
the haunted beach house and has a coed slumber party and a
mysterious slasher turns the teenage population into shish-kabobs.
With more hormonal urges and frustrated desire oozing out from the
lacquer of social conformity than a season of ``Dawson's Creek,''
anyone in this community could be the killer, and Chicklet's
tart-tongued alter ego leads the list.
</P>
<P>
   Bright and spirited, with a terrific surf-rock guitar score by
Ben Vaughan, wild go-go dancing credits, and cheesy B&AMP;W mock
drive-in movie clips, the film overflows with quotes from ``Attack
of the 50-Foot Woman'' to ``Marnie'' while ringing every teen movie
cliche this side of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   So why isn't it funnier? Director Robert Lee King never gets his
young cast beyond their self-consciously gee-whiz spoofing. From a
Scandinavian exchange student with an accent this side of the
Swedish chef from ``The Muppet Show'' to a pair of hunky surfers
whose Greco-Roman gropes and cross-dressing horseplay belies their
heterosexual pose, the one-note parodies wear thin by the time the
film is through with them.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is Busch himself, who channels Eve Arden doing
Dirty Harry to give the best drag gag performance since Divine. He
doesn't overplay the part or wink at the audience, and he's
hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   The overbaked performances and campy melodrama flail in a flat
and functional sitcom style where dialogue comes in sputters and
pauses, as if waiting for the laugh track to kick in. King misses a
prime opportunity to pump up the parody and really shoot this
send-up into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   For all its energy and inspired moments of giddy goofiness,
``Psycho Beach Party'' gets stuck in the sand.

 Healthy FANatics :STUDIES FIND GOING ALL-OUT FOR A SPORTS TEAM CAN (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   OK all you know-it-alls, let's see
how you do with this one.
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to several research studies _ including one conducted
at the University of Kansas _ what can you do to foster feelings of
self-worth while insulating yourself from alienation and
depression?
</P>
<P>
   A) Give all your possessions to the poor?
</P>
<P>
   B) Turn off the TV and meditate?
</P>
<P>
   Ha! Some know-it-all you are. The correct answer is of course:
</P>
<P>
   C) Dress up in a weird costume, give yourself a nutty name and
scream your guts out for the sports team of your choice. YEAHHH
BABY! WOOOOOOO!
</P>
<P>
   (Grease paint and silly hat optional.)
</P>
<P>
   OK, we're kidding. But only a little.
</P>
<P>
   A growing body of research suggests that passionate, die-hard
sports fans _ far from being the lonely, alienated get-a-life
losers psychologists once suspected them to be _ are in reality
just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   It all goes back to primitive times when warriors fought to
protect their tribes, psychologists say. Fans at that time might
quite literally have been cheering for their survival. Today sports
teams symbolically fill that same role for a city, and people still
react to them the same way.
</P>
<P>
   And that can be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Wann, a psychologist at Murray State University in
Kentucky, has done several studies _ including one in 1991 in which
ardent University of Kansas basketball fans were the subjects _
that suggest that ``highly identified'' fans are not only happy and
largely well adjusted, but also suffer fewer bouts of depression
than those who are uninterested in sports _ even when their team
loses.
</P>
<P>
   You realize what this means, of course? It means it's entirely
possible that ``Arrowman'' _ that crazy Chiefs fan who attends
every game with dozens of arrows sticking out of his body _ could
be a better role model for your children than the majority of the
athletes on the field.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, not really crazy after all.
</P>
<P>
   Mom, I wanna grow up to be just like Arrowman.
</P>
<P>
   That's wonderful, Billy. And look! I bought you a new arrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, for me? (Billy jabs the arrow through his shirt and runs
off doing the chop.) You're the best, Mom.
</P>
<P>
   Recently we caught up with Arrowman, aka Monte Short, to see if
he really did fit the kinder, happier theory about super fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, uhh, tell us, Monte. You're not really some sad, lonely,
alienated loser searching for meaning in your otherwise bleak and
miserable life, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Short is a successful real estate developer with a
beautiful home and an otherwise normal life. He said he's thrilled
that research has shown that ardent fans such as himself are just
regular Joes who just like to have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   He's also glad he no longer has to worry about the rest of his
screwball dress-up friends around the league. He knows them all.
They call him, send him pictures, stay at his house when their team
plays in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   It's just one big happy weird well-adjusted family.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Short was inducted into the Visa Hall of Fans at the
Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. All the other teams'
super fans were there, too, all happy and bursting with
self-esteem, Short said.
</P>
<P>
   There were Spike and the Violator from the Oakland Raiders, who
paint their heads in silver and black and dress in post-apocalyptic
gear complete with shoulder spikes. There was Barrel Man from
Denver, who spends Sundays substantially naked with an orange
barrel around his waist. There were the Fin Heads from Miami, Larry
the Packalope from Green Bay, Green Man from Philadelphia, Big Dawg
from Cleveland's infamous ``Dawg Pound'' and Mikey T, the Boss
Hogette from the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a comic book that's come alive,'' Monte's wife,
Stacie, said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago area therapist Aaron Shimmel has studied intense fans
for five years. His conclusion: They're nuts.
</P>
<P>
   But not in a bad way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their devotion and loyalty to teams and players is truly
admirable,'' he said. ``By and large these are happy, healthy
people who've simply found something they really love. Not all of
us can say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Michael Torbert, alias ``Boss Hogette,'' who formed a
cheerleading squad for his beloved Washington Redskins. The squad
consists of 11 men who wear long dresses, sunglasses and pig snouts
and cheer as wildly as their attire will allow.
</P>
<P>
   Weird?
</P>
<P>
   Sure.
</P>
<P>
   Sad-pathetic-living-in-the-basement weird?
</P>
<P>
   Actually no. Torbert is a responsible and happy adult. He's also
a nuclear engineer. What's more, he and the Hogettes make more than
100 charity appearances a year. And since 1983, Torbert said, they
have helped raise more than $60 million for children's charities.
</P>
<P>
   While he'll never stop being a crazy fan, Torbert said, he
realizes there are things that are more important.
</P>
<P>
   Like children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into sick kids' rooms and they light up like a
Christmas tree,'' he said, ``it's worth all the time in the dress
and the snout.''
</P>
<P>
   So remember. The next time you're tempted to worry about the
dress-for-the-game, live-for-team, odd-looking, rebel-yelling
sports maniac whose whole identity seems to be wrapped up in a
sports team, be careful.
</P>
<P>
   They're as sane, or saner, than you.

&HT;     REFORM PARTY RIVALS FIGHT OVER $12.6 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Sept. 3.)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly three weeks after their convention in
California ended with chaotic infighting, Pat Buchanan and John
Hagelin, his rival for control of the Reform Party, have shifted
their battle to Washington, D.C., where federal campaign funds
totaling $12.6 million remain up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission (FEC), which will decide who
gets the money, must choose between commentator Buchanan, a former
Republican, and physicist John Hagelin of Iowa, who is also running
on the Natural Law Party ticket. Each was nominated by competing
Reform Party conventions last month in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC decision will not be easy. The party forged by Texas
billionaire Ross Perot, who garnered 19 percent of the 1992
presidential vote, is in shambles. At its convention, shoving
matches broke out among delegates with differing loyalties after
days of angry negotiations that eventually collapsed and led to the
party's split.
</P>
<P>
   Now the FEC is being forced to sort through the mess and choose
the party's true nominee. But the commission has never faced
anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   Ask what standard the commission will use to decide which
candidate receives the money, FEC spokeswoman Kelly Huff said:
``This is truly a new situation, one that we'll have to deal with
as we go along.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's nominee is entitled to the money because Perot,
running again 1996, received 8 percent of the presidential vote,
exceeding the commission's 5 percent requirement. Since both the
Buchanan and Hagelin campaigns are running low on funds, the
federal money would provide a significant boost.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan joked last month that if he doesn't get the money, his
campaign will ``be on short rations.''Huff said the FEC's first
task will be to certify that both Buchanan and Hagelin are on the
ballot in at least 10 states as the Reform Party candidate.
Buchanan already has submitted documents claiming to have the
Reform Party ballot line in Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Idaho,
Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah and West
Virginia. Hagelin is expected to submit his state list early this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are scrambling to get their name on more ballots
to bolster their case before the FEC. As a result, some states _
many of which have no procedure to decide who is the party's
nominee _ have resorted to unorthodox methods of choosing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Iowa officials pulled Buchanan's name out of a
glass bowl, while in Montana, Hagelin's name was drawn from among
20 cards inside a ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC's next step will be to determine whether both men
followed the party's own nominating rules.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin supporters have accused Buchanan of massive vote fraud.
They claim he sent about 500,000 primary ballots to people on his
Republican donor list, asking them to vote for him in the Reform
Party's mail-in primary. They say the vast majority did not request
the ballots, which party rules require. Hagelin allies claim that a
random check of 14 Buchanan primary voters in Iowa found that 12
had not asked for the ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan campaign denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's evidence of any illegal actions, we'll look into
it, but as of now, we haven't decided on any investigation into
vote fraud,'' Huff said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the FEC will ``do its best'' to decide within 10 days
after Hagelin submits his state ballot documents. However, Huff
added, the loser may ask for another hearing, which would extend
the final deadline by 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the need to get this issue resolved as quickly
as possible and not have it interfere with the election campaign,''
she said. ``But some things are out of our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Huff was referring to threats from both sides to challenge in
court some states' decisions on which candidate represents the
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   M. Miller Baker, an expert in election law here, said he expects
the FEC to certify Buchanan as the nominee and release the funds to
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there's some type of wrongdoing, Buchanan won the
majority of primary votes and has the support of the Reform Party
Chairman (Gerry Moan),'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The final tally of the Reform Party Convention in Long Beach was
49,529 votes for Buchanan and 28,539 for Hagelin. At the rump
convention Hagelin won.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who gets the FEC's blessing, the matter will
almost certainly end up in federal court since each side has
promised to fight any decision that favors the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Verney, founding chairman of the Reform Party and a Hagelin
supporter, said: ``Pat Buchanan will be going out the wrong end of
a nursing home before he sees that money.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In fact, the legal wrangling has already begun. Last month,
Buchanan supporters filed a federal lawsuit in Lynchburg, Va.,
seeking to prevent Hagelin from calling himself the Reform Party
candidate. But last Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Norman K.
Moon said he lacks jurisdiction to decide the case because it
raised no constitutional issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some political experts say that even if Buchanan wins FEC
approval, the Reform Party's troubles have effectively destroyed
any chance of his garnering much support this year.
</P>
<P>
   J. David Gillespie, a political science professor at
Presbyterian College in Clinton, S.C., and an expert on minor
parties, said, ``It's hard to imagine him having any substantial
impact on this election.''
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll taken last week put his support
among likely voters at 1 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's campaign season, so the presidential candidates are waving.
And waving and waving. And waving some more.
</P>
<P>
   As far as photographs go, a candidate needs a baby there to kiss
and a hand there to shake, but doesn't need anyone on the receiving
end of a friendly wave. So candidates for the highest office in
this land can, and do, wave at absolutely no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I've done it,'' admitted Paul Simon, former Illinois
senator and a 1988 Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Waving at no one while marching in a parade is especially
embarrassing, added Simon, now a professor and director of the
Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt parades were a little phony,'' he said. ``I'm
not criticizing anybody, I've done them myself. You have to. You
wave, and just hope somebody waves back at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Photojournalists currently trailing all these wave-happy pols
are very familiar with this waving-at-no-one technique.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Williamson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning shooter with The
Washington Post, noticed it while covering Vice President Al Gore
on a 24-hour swing through the flooded Northwest several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was leaving from an airport in Idaho in the middle of the
night,'' Williamson said. ``There was nobody there, nobody. And he
still did the wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes and airports seem to trigger the reflex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often when we arrive somewhere the candidate will hop
out of the airplane and instinctively start waving, even if a
crowd's not there to greet him,'' said Rick Wilking, a Reuters
contract photographer and longtime campaign shooter.
</P>
<P>
   As Williamson said of the candidates, ``After awhile they're
kind of like trained seals.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is this: A wave _ even a wave at no one _ works well
to create a positive impression for the cameras, said Bruce Newman,
a DePaul University professor of marketing and author of ``The Mass
Marketing of Politics: Democracy in an Age of Manufactured
Images.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a portrayal of what the candidate is trying to do with
voters, which is connect emotionally,'' Newman said. ``A wave is
good because they look happy, they look like they're in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger the venue, the greater a wave's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Say the candidate is in front of a rally of thousands of
supporters and campaign workers. He waves to the crowd. Of course,
he's not waving at any one individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the workers can go back home and say the candidate waved
at them personally, and they feel like they're getting
recognition,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly the wave is movement. Photographers like movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gestures are a natural way to add video to your audio,'' said
Lillian Brown, image consultant to six presidents (Kennedy,
Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter and Clinton) and an adjunct professor
at Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Brown counsels candidates on how to look and act on the campaign
trail. One of the basic lessons: Develop a wave of your own.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wave is a totally individual matter,'' Brown added. ``It has
to fit the individual. Queen Elizabeth has hers, and President
Nixon had his.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, a wave gives a candidate something to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not engaged in some form of action you look silly,
and a photographer won't take your picture,'' said Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photographer wants the candidate to gesture, to talk to
someone, or to wave,'' added Jamieson, author of ``Everything You
Think You Know About Politics ... And Why You're Wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs of the politicians and the media work together to
create politics as we now know it.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``waving at no one'' actually is part of a larger
phenomenon, Jamieson said. In campaigns nowadays, an audience's
physical presence is no longer necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This began, she added, in 1984 when Rep. Newt Gingrich of
Georgia started giving impassioned speeches to an empty House
chamber _ empty except for the C-SPAN cable TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've transformed the immediate audience, wherever it is, into
essentially a backdrop,'' Jamieson said. ``This is the nature of
contemporary politics.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's campaign season, so the presidential candidates are waving.
And waving and waving. And waving some more.
</P>
<P>
   As far as photographs go, a candidate needs a baby there to kiss
and a hand there to shake, but doesn't need anyone on the receiving
end of a friendly wave. So candidates for the highest office in
this land can, and do, wave at absolutely no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I've done it,'' admitted Paul Simon, former Illinois
senator and a 1988 Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Waving at no one while marching in a parade is especially
embarrassing, added Simon, now a professor and director of the
Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt parades were a little phony,'' he said. ``I'm
not criticizing anybody, I've done them myself. You have to. You
wave, and just hope somebody waves back at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Photojournalists currently trailing all these wave-happy pols
are very familiar with this waving-at-no-one technique.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Williamson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning shooter with The
Washington Post, noticed it while covering Vice President Al Gore
on a 24-hour swing through the flooded Northwest several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was leaving from an airport in Idaho in the middle of the
night,'' Williamson said. ``There was nobody there, nobody. And he
still did the wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes and airports seem to trigger the reflex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often when we arrive somewhere the candidate will hop
out of the airplane and instinctively start waving, even if a
crowd's not there to greet him,'' said Rick Wilking, a Reuters
contract photographer and longtime campaign shooter.
</P>
<P>
   As Williamson said of the candidates, ``After awhile they're
kind of like trained seals.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is this: A wave _ even a wave at no one _ works well
to create a positive impression for the cameras, said Bruce Newman,
a DePaul University professor of marketing and author of ``The Mass
Marketing of Politics: Democracy in an Age of Manufactured
Images.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a portrayal of what the candidate is trying to do with
voters, which is connect emotionally,'' Newman said. ``A wave is
good because they look happy, they look like they're in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger the venue, the greater a wave's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Say the candidate is in front of a rally of thousands of
supporters and campaign workers. He waves to the crowd. Of course,
he's not waving at any one individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the workers can go back home and say the candidate waved
at them personally, and they feel like they're getting
recognition,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly the wave is movement. Photographers like movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gestures are a natural way to add video to your audio,'' said
Lillian Brown, image consultant to six presidents (Kennedy,
Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter and Clinton) and an adjunct professor
at Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Brown counsels candidates on how to look and act on the campaign
trail. One of the basic lessons: Develop a wave of your own.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wave is a totally individual matter,'' Brown added. ``It has
to fit the individual. Queen Elizabeth has hers, and President
Nixon had his.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, a wave gives a candidate something to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not engaged in some form of action you look silly,
and a photographer won't take your picture,'' said Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photographer wants the candidate to gesture, to talk to
someone, or to wave,'' added Jamieson, author of ``Everything You
Think You Know About Politics ... And Why You're Wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs of the politicians and the media work together to
create politics as we now know it.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``waving at no one'' actually is part of a larger
phenomenon, Jamieson said. In campaigns nowadays, an audience's
physical presence is no longer necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This began, she added, in 1984 when Rep. Newt Gingrich of
Georgia started giving impassioned speeches to an empty House
chamber _ empty except for the C-SPAN cable TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've transformed the immediate audience, wherever it is, into
essentially a backdrop,'' Jamieson said. ``This is the nature of
contemporary politics.''

SOUL SURVIVOR:AS AN ORPHAN, FLORENCE B. SMITH BEGAN TELLING STORIES
AND NEVER STOPPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   Sent to an Oklahoma orphanage at age
5, Florence B. Smith cried at nights for her father.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Where are you?'' she wondered. ``Why don't you come get me?''
</P>
<P>
   Now a 71-year-old Overland Park author, Smith can never forget
the paralyzing loneliness of her early life. Neither can she escape
the rejection she felt.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, who was divorced, sent Florence and her younger
sister Martha to the red-brick orphanage in Helena, Okla. Their
mother also got a court order to prevent the father from finding
his children.
</P>
<P>
   A family took Martha almost immediately. But Florence stayed in
the orphanage for seven years, longing to be reunited with her
father.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to escape into his arms, she escaped into her mind. She
made up stories to entertain herself. Fun stories, adventure
stories, stories of girls getting adopted by wonderful families, of
loving fathers finding long-lost daughters.
</P>
<P>
   When there was little else to do, she'd turn to her fellow
orphans and said, ``Want to hear a story?''
</P>
<P>
   They always would.
</P>
<P>
   The children came to love Florence's fanciful tales. They loved
them so much that when she would be sent to the discipline room,
they would get themselves into trouble, too, just so they wouldn't
miss one.
</P>
<P>
   Today Florence B. Smith is still telling stories. Only this time
she's writing them down.
</P>
<P>
   A 35-year member of the Kansas City Writer's Group, Smith
specializes in adventure novels of the Old West, with most set in
the late 1800s. Her books, many spotlighting Kansas counties and
towns, are rich, regional melodramas spiced with romance and
rescues, with a sprinkle of history thrown in for authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   She has submitted her work to publishers but has had scarcely
more than a nibble. So several years ago she began self-publishing
her books. Edited by her husband and proofread by friends, they
sell for an average of $7.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years she has sold more than 1,500 of her
books at regional festivals, fairs and through her Web site,
www.readwest.com//florencebsmith.htm. A selection of her books also
is offered on Amazon.com. She's not getting rich but has cultivated
a growing number of fans who read her religiously.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has no intention of giving up. This year she finished her
38th book. The resolution
</P>
<P>
   It certainly hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   At the orphanage, Florence had settled into a routine. She had
friends there. She went to school there. She had a life there.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed at age 12 when her mother suddenly reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Remarried by then, her mother needed Florence not so much as a
daughter, but as a servant, Smith said. She wanted her to cook and
clean, wash and baby-sit her new son.
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world her mother was an upstanding woman. But at
home, she was too often a monster. One time, after Florence stole a
dime at school, her mother beat her until she was nearly
unconscious. Florence couldn't return to school for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Florence tried to run away several times with no success. It was
only through marriage at age 16 that she finally got away.
</P>
<P>
   If making up stories helped Smith survive the loneliness of the
orphanage, surely committing them to paper would help her deal with
years of abuse at the hands of her mother.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Smith resolved to write. At 36, then living in
Kansas City, she joined a writer's group.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem. She was awful. While smart and
determined to learn, she knew virtually nothing about such writing
basics as punctuation, grammar and sentence structure, not to
mention the more subtle techniques involved in plotting, dialogue
and characterization.
</P>
<P>
   She refused to give up. She took advice, read books, pored over
critiques.
</P>
<P>
   And she got better. A lot better.
</P>
<P>
   To fellow local writer Sophia Myers, Smith is a study in
perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone who is more inspirational insofar as
starting with no education, no opportunities, no one to encourage
her and out of sheer determination becoming a really successful
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   How's this for successful: Smith sat at a small table at a
festival in Troy, Kan., two years ago with stacks of her
self-published novels piled around her. Just then an exhibitor from
a nearby booth walked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got any books about Indians?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' she said, handing him her book Guardian Falls. The man
bought the book, then sat down to read it.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I doubt you can do better than this,'' he said, ``but
have you got anything else like it?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith nodded, then sold him four more books. When the festival
ended, Smith figured she'd never see him again. But four months
later he knocked at her front door. He had driven nearly two hours
to Overland Park to get even more of her books. Smith obliged,
selling the man 29 more on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Although not nationally distributed, her work does get around.
</P>
<P>
   A woman named Nancy D'Alessandro from Los Altos, Calif., sent
Smith a hand-written note thanking her for her book Separated By
Hate, the story of a mixed-race woman with a terrible secret that
threatens to ruin her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the best stories I have ever read,''
D'Alessandro wrote. ``I enjoyed Devil From Franklin County, too.
But Separated I couldn't put down. On hot summer nights I was
reading outside _ by flashlight!'' Growing through words
</P>
<P>
   Over the years writing has been more than an avocation for
Smith; it's been a way to heal the wounds of her past.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good writer she uses her experiences to her advantage.
Therefore her books are teeming with villains, conflicts, hard
times, girls who need rescuing, heroes and romance.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old-fashioned style that fans say makes for a
rip-roaring good read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can put down a great novel like (one by) John Irving and not
worry,'' said Virginia DeCoursey, a longtime friend, proofreader
and fan. ``But I get into one of her things, and I can't put the
darn thing down. I gotta get the girl out of the well or off the
railroad tracks. You get all caught up in the spirit of it. They're
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers, DeCoursey said, don't know what they're missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gets in romance, sex, history, oh, she just twists your
heart. They're just great old melodramas. You want to hiss the
villain.''
</P>
<P>
   But as impressed as friends are with Smith's growth as a writer,
they are even more impressed with her growth as a person.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years she reunited with her father and her sister,
forgave her mother and lived a life of faith, service and love.
</P>
<P>
   Her teen-age marriage to her husband, Ike, has lasted for 55
years.
</P>
<P>
   Although she could not have children of her own, she and her
husband did adopt three children. Their first child, David, a deaf
and mentally challenged 53-year-old, still lives with them. In
addition she and her husband have taken in 25 foster children. And,
yes, she told them stories.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them still call her Mom.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, friends said, some of her most moving writing has
been about her children.
</P>
<P>
   DeCoursey remembers being moved by an article Smith wrote for
Field &AMP; Stream magazine about a fishing trip she and her husband
took with David.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just broke your heart,'' she said. ``David had a real
expensive fishing rod. And he caught a catfish, and when he saw the
catfish he started signing ``Jaws! Jaws!'' It frightened him, and
he let go of the pole, and it washed away. She wrote that she was
never so proud of her husband as when he took David into his arms
and held him. You know, the heck with the rod.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Teresa Peck thinks people could profit from Smith's
example in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who is that good a person, who is that dedicated and
who has overcome so much, is an inspiration,'' she said. Whirlwind
writer
</P>
<P>
   Today you can't get Smith to stop writing, even when her
daughters drop by for a visit. Her friends call her ``The
Whirlwind.''
</P>
<P>
   One time she was in the middle of writing a love scene when she
called out to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a kiss,'' she said, still typing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right,'' he said. ``Am I a 21-year-old buck or a
50-year-old toothless man?''
</P>
<P>
   She hadn't realized she had said the line she was typing out
loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take your pick,'' she said quickly, turning around to give him
a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Others may sell more books, those who know her say. But no one
has more fun writing them.
</P>
<P>
   When researching her historical novels, she typically takes
friends on fact-finding missions. It could be to LeCompton,
Atchison, Council Grove or Cherryvale. She never knows where she's
headed next.
</P>
<P>
   Millie Alport of Lenexa has gone with her as much as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to go anytime,'' she said. ``I've learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith typically visits the towns and counties where she sets her
stories so she can give her tales a tinge of historical
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   She is dogged, Alport said, hitting newspaper archives,
historical societies, libraries and buying as many books about the
area as she can carry. Then she buttonholes locals along the street
or in the corner cafe and learns even more.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite history includes anything involving underdogs and
minorities. Her grandfather was half Cherokee. The locals in Enid,
Okla., used to call him names.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hurtful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She's also sensitive to what she calls the ``bum start''
received in the Old West by blacks, Hispanics and women.
Consequently many of the characters in her book, including some
high-profile heroes and heroines, are minorities. In Black Knights
and Starshine, a strong black character named Molec Ross leads a
group of 120 former slaves from Tennessee on foot to a new life in
Oklahoma, while helping them learn more about life and themselves
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Her historical novels are liable to be about anything, ranging
from true love to serial killers.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how much she writes, the man who once drove two
hours to find her still can't get enough.
</P>
<P>
   He caught up with her again when she returned to the festival in
Troy earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got any more books?'' he wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one,'' Smith said, handing him her latest, Confederate
Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it.''

THE STOCK(ING) MARKET:HOSIERY FINDS ITS WAY ONTO RUNWAYS AND INTO
OFFICES FOR FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   Once upon a time, fashionable women
almost never left home without them. Call them stockings, pantyhose
or nylons, women wore them to church, office, restaurants and
dinner parties.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But times change and so does fashion. A few seasons ago, hosiery
suddenly disappeared from the designer runways; pundits think it
may have started with Isaac Mizrahi and Miuccia Prada.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines took hosiery out of fashion editorial photographs and
poor New York style editors, dedicated to chic at all costs, vowed
to go barelegged through summer heat and winter blizzards. And in
the real world, as backless mules, beach thongs and other sandals
became acceptable street fare, women in all but the most serious
professions found it cool and comfortable in warm weather to drop
hosiery, especially when they wore pantsuits and long skirts. In
New Orleans, from about February on, ``we only wear them for
weddings, funerals,'' said one newspaper writer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pendulum has begun to swing in the other direction.
Covered legs started to show up on fashion runways again a few
months ago. With the designers' new passion for dressier clothes
and suits this fall, hosiery is expected to get a significant
boost.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is hoping new colors, patterns and innovations will
provide the enticement for women to come back to a total look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly it's a good time just to have a lot of fun with
hosiery,'' says Sherri Satalof, a public relations spokeswoman for
a hosiery trade group. ``It's one of the most inexpensive
accessories you can have fun with.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it was a telling fashion moment last winter in Milan
when Gucci's influential designer Tom Ford layered fishnet
stockings in his fall collection. In Paris, Chanel stenciled tights
with the double-C logo. In the United States, Linda Allard at Ellen
Tracy matched her above-the-knee skirts with black opaque tights.
Designers such as Anna Sui, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein covered
legs with everything from sheers to purple and red opaques.
</P>
<P>
   Sid Smith, president and CEO of the North Carolina-based Hosiery
Association, acknowledges hosiery sales had dropped in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, there were about 30 companies making hosiery.
But they consolidated, and now there are half that number, about 15
companies,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But he is seeing optimistic signs. In 1999 sales in sheer
hosiery were about $2.1 billion, he says. In the first quarter of
this year, the numbers were up 4 percent over the first quarter of
last year. ``That bodes well,'' Smith says. Opaque tights meanwhile
were stable at about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is now making an effort to move closer to consumer
needs, he says. The focus is on segmenting products to target
specific ethnic groups and demographics ranging from minorities to
older citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more specialized products include toeless hosiery to
accommodate sandal wearers and hip-riding panty hose to fit beneath
the fashionable low-slung pants. Hanes Silk Reflections offers
opaque tights with microbeads of moisturizers to keep legs soft and
creamy.
</P>
<P>
   When bare legs hit the runways, the hosiery industry moved to
offer natural looking skin-toned pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   But will women come back to covered legs?
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Gabrielle Kaniger, president and CEO of Central
Exchange, a professional women's organization, says she now wears
hosiery on some days, depending on her schedule. But she is ready
to get back to the covered leg this fall and is excited about the
new colors.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Mosby, an architect with CDFM in Kansas City, says
professional women generally ``dress their day, depending on what
they have to do,'' and when meeting clients, hosiery matters.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a city of fashionistas, the idea has not exactly
taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not wearing hosiery, and no one I see from here is wearing
hosiery,'' says Susan Sommers, New York author of two fashion
books, from her dot.com company desk.
</P>
<P>
   Marylou Luther, a syndicated fashion columnist, says she is
seeing some women in sheer dark hosiery in New York, ``but only
when I go to fashion shows,'' on the fashion pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fashion-involved woman will do whatever designers tell her
to do. ...'' Luther says. ``But the same designers who told us not
to wear hosiery are the same ones now telling us to'' wear hosiery.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the weather remains warm, and women are sporting
capri pants and sandals, bare legs are obligatory, the experts
agree. When the weather shifts, hosiery will be put on shopping
lists.
</P>
<P>
   You should start to see it in the next few weeks, says Barbara
Lipton, the Saks Fifth Avenue vice president and divisional manager
in New York. ``When you take a look at catalogs, they are focusing
on the legs. You see hosiery in fashion magazines and catalogs.
People are influenced by that.''
</P>
<P>
   The new fall clothes such as tweeds, plaids and an abundance of
suits indeed scream for coordinated hosiery. ``Part of the whole
suit thing is a skirt. The must-have for fall is a tweed suit. You
need hosiery with that. The must-have shoe is a retro pump. It
requires hosiery,'' Lipton says.
</P>
<P>
   And in the new fashion mix, fishnets in black and nude are
moving into most stores along with new textures, patterns and
colors. As for rules about how to coordinate everything, the
guidelines have traditionally been to match either your skirt or
your shoes or both. But they are not engraved in stone, Lipton
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to be a little edgier and add another color,
say, fuchsia is a great color, and if you have a fuchsia suit and
want to wear purple hosiery, that's fine. It's all in the
customer's attitude.''

   LOS ANGELES _ In his speech accepting the Democratic
vice-presidential nomination recently, Joseph Lieberman made one of
his customary swipes at the gratuitous sex and violence coming out
of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many Americans,'' he told delegates at the party convention
in Los Angeles, ``there is a swelling sense that our standards of
decency and civility have eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Senator Lieberman's worst nightmare has just come to life.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those fortuitous coincidences that are simply too good
to have been manufactured, the film currently topping the U.S. box
office is a veritable orgy of grotesque imagery, stomach-churning
violence, scenes of torture for torture's sake, rape, child abuse
and serial murder.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``The Cell,'' it purports to be a phantasmagorical
exploration of the mind of a vicious killer, a bit like ``The
Silence of the Lambs.'' Instead of the suave, urbane,
psychologically terrifying Hannibal Lecter, however, we have Carl
Stargher, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, who appears to have no
redeeming social skills at all.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite pastime is to kidnap women and imprison them in a
plexiglass cell in the middle of the Mojave desert, where their
slow death by drowning is captured on videotape in gruesome detail.
</P>
<P>
   Stargher then douses the corpses in bleach, lays them on a
coroner's slab, plays back the death video and masturbates over
them while suspending himself from the ceiling with chains attached
to 14 steel rings embedded in his back.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the start of it. Most of the film actually takes
place inside Stargher's head, where FBI agents played by Vince
Vaughn and Jennifer Lopez are transported by the wonders of modern
technology _ I kid you not _ only to watch a horse being sliced and
diced into Damien Hirst-like tranverse sections, observe a woman
drowning in a bath of her own blood and, in one particularly
unpleasant sequence, have their own guts ripped out with a pair of
scissors and twisted on a barbecue spit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cell'' is the debut feature of an Indian commercials
director called Tarsem Singh, previously best known for making the
music video for the REM song ``Losing My Religion.'' (In the spirit
of Hollywood sequels, this venture might have been called ``Losing
My Lunch'').
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, he doesn't think there is anything particularly
violent about his movie. ``It's graphic,'' he told one interviewer
last week, ``but not violent.''
</P>
<P>
   To anyone unimpressed by claims of ``arty'' production design or
modish preoccupation with the bleakness of the human spirit, this
film actually looks like the best argument for censorship the
anti-Hollywood faction in Washington ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it nasty, it is shamelessly directed at teenagers.
Rated R rather than NC17 (which means children can, to all intents
and purposes, get in with little trouble), it made most of last
weekend's $17.2 million take from adolescent boys in search of the
latest celluloid thrill _ exactly the market, and the material,
that got Hollywood into such trouble after the Columbine High
School shootings last year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if this were the only film Joe Lieberman or his
Republican counterpart in the morality crusades, Bill Bennett, got
to see this decade, there's a fair bet the film industry would go
the way of Big Tobacco and be hit with billion-dollar lawsuits for
threatening the health and sanity of the nation's children.
</P>
<P>
   And yet _ the cultural warriors have been remarkably silent
about ``The Cell.'' Film critics have certainly vented their
disgust: the Los Angeles Times called it ``nauseating'' and the
sort of film you are sorry you ever saw. But from the politicians,
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   There are just two words to explain their reticence:
presidential election. The Republicans have never gained any
mileage from Hollywood-bashing on the campaign trail, and know
better now than to shoot their mouths off and risk losing votes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Democrats, both Lieberman and Al Gore may have
expressed concern in the past about sex, violence and profanity in
the entertainment industry, but they have their own constituencies
to think about.
</P>
<P>
   Gore raised a record-breaking $5 million in direct campaign
contributions from Hollywood during the convention week, and can
hardly afford now to bite the hand that fed him.
</P>
<P>
   As for Lieberman, he agreed as part of the price of admission to
the presidential ticket to drop his more confrontational rhetoric.
For example, the Silver Sewer awards, which he and Bennett doled
out each year to products just like ``The Cell,'' have been put on
hold on the grounds they are not ``vice presidential.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Hollywood is home free, and looking remarkably cocky
given that a special Federal Trade Commission report on the
marketing of violence to children is about to be released to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The self-flagellating promises the industry made to police its
own exploitative excesses in the wake of Columbine now appear to be
forgotten. Instead, gore is in vogue once again _ and not the Gore
the Democrats might have hoped for. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is an odd time to be a dissenter in America.
The economy is booming. No Americans are dying in foreign wars.
Unemployment is down, and so is crime. And yet the dissent is
there, and it is being felt across an extraordinary range of public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, we have seen tens of thousands of
people take the city of Seattle by storm and challenge the
globalization agenda of the World Trade Organization; we have seen
John McCain, the populist Republican senator, launch a spirited
anti-establishment campaign to try to wrest his party's
presidential nomination from George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   We have seen the Reform Party, the third force founded eight
years ago by the Texas billionaire Ross Perot, becoming so
exercised about its own critique of the system that it is splitting
into two Reform parties, one libertarian and one far-right
nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we have seen a growing disquiet among rank-and-file
Democrats that their party is losing touch with its roots and
becoming little more than a mirror image of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Warren Beatty, an active champion of liberal
causes who was briefly courted to run for president himself this
year: ``What we need is not a third party, but a second party.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their disparate agendas, there is one unifying theme
binding these dissenting voices, and that is a sense of outrage at
the corruption of the political system.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, the feeling runs, no longer belongs to the people, but
is being bought by big companies able to use their financial muscle
to determine who runs for office and what they do once they get
there.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a trivial matter to be pushed into a file marked
``Campaign Finance Reform''; the very foundation of America's
democracy is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Raising money for political campaigns is, of course, nothing new
in American politics, but what has changed is the ability of
corporations to infiltrate the system to such an extent that they
can all but own candidates for office.
</P>
<P>
   Direct campaign contributions have been strictly limited ever
since the Watergate scandal, but thanks to a regulatory loophole
there is no cap on so-called ``soft money'' _ indirect payments
once intended to cover incidental office expenses but now most
commonly used to pay for television advertising, the biggest ticket
in any campaign budget.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992 presidential election, the two main parties
received $86 million in soft money contributions. By 1996, that
number had jumped to $260 million and this year it could go as high
as $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, interest groups would identify candidates and
platforms that appealed to them and donate accordingly _ big
business generally backing the Republicans while unions, litigation
lawyers and others generally backed the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, companies have understood that it is much
smarter to back both horses in a race so half of their money ends
up working for them. The number of companies contributing at least
$100,000 to both parties has skyrocketed, from 40 in 1996 to 87
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of this infiltration is felt at every level.
Politicians are spending more and more time fund-raising, and much
less acting on behalf of their constituents. The greater their need
to raise funds, the easier it is for contributors to lean on them.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where television advertising rates are among the
highest in the country and political races consequently among the
most expensive, the state insurance commissioner was recently
forced to quit because he had turned a blind eye to gross abuses by
insurance companies who had contributed lavishly to his election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   He had even taken insurance money intended for earthquake
victims and funnelled it into his own campaign war chest.
</P>
<P>
   Also in California, a recent attempt to set up an independent
commission of inquiry into abuses by guards at state prisons was
voted down by the legislature despite a major scandal involving
staged gladiator fights, organized rape and inmate shootings.
</P>
<P>
   One legislator, when challenged by the attorney general on his
vote, admitted that he was ``whoring'' for the prison guards' union
which had contributed a whopping $28 million to candidates in the
1998 state elections.
</P>
<P>
   Such instances are becoming commonplace everywhere. Russ
Feingold, a liberal Democrat senator from Wisconsin who has
co-authored a bill with McCain to ban soft money, calls the system
``legalized bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a system of one person one vote,'' he said at the
Democrats' recent convention, ``but a system of one million
dollars, one million votes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The strength of feeling should not be underestimated. The
protest against the WTO, which was about the same kind of corporate
control on a global level, brought 50,000 people on to the streets
of Seattle _ little short of an earthquake in a country utterly
unaccustomed to such spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   If the street protests have since fizzled, it has partly been
through poor planning and partly because of a failure to see the
connection to domestic politics fast enough. But still, a spirit
has been captured; if there is not yet a movement, there is most
certainly a mood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore have felt obliged to refer to campaign
finance reform on the stump; in his convention speech, Gore went
out of his way to denounce corporate influence and even
acknowledged the spirit of Seattle in a reference to ``fair trade,
not just free trade.''
</P>
<P>
   How sincere these undertakings are remains to be seen. When Sen.
Feingold addressed the convention floor, most of his colleagues
were away at a big corporate fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore had finished his own fine words, he went straight to a
celebrity-studded concert and raised $5 million. As for Bush, he
has beaten all records, raising more than $90 million to date.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins in November will be sorely tempted to wish the
issue away. The corporate sponsors who paid for the election will
be clamoring for their pound of flesh. Besides, politicians will
have little interest in cutting off the source of their own
bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   But neglect could be perilous. There is a rage brewing in the
country, and it crosses all social and political boundaries. No
politician would want that rage to erupt; the next president will
have to find a way to assuage it. &QL;

becoming little more than a mirror image of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Warren Beatty, an active champion of liberal
causes who was briefly courted to run for president himself this
year: ``What we need is not a third party, but a second party.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their disparate agendas, there is one unifying theme
binding these dissenting voices, and that is a sense of outrage at
the corruption of the political system.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, the feeling runs, no longer belongs to the people, but
is being bought by big companies able to use their financial muscle
to determine who runs for office and what they do once they get
there.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a trivial matter to be pushed into a file marked
``Campaign Finance Reform''; the very foundation of America's
democracy is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Raising money for political campaigns is, of course, nothing new
in American politics, but what has changed is the ability of
corporations to infiltrate the system to such an extent that they
can all but own candidates for office.
</P>
<P>
   Direct campaign contributions have been strictly limited ever
since the Watergate scandal, but thanks to a regulatory loophole
there is no cap on so-called ``soft money'' _ indirect payments
once intended to cover incidental office expenses but now most
commonly used to pay for television advertising, the biggest ticket
in any campaign budget.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992 presidential election, the two main parties
received $86 million in soft money contributions. By 1996, that
number had jumped to $260 million and this year it could go as high
as $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, interest groups would identify candidates and
platforms that appealed to them and donate accordingly _ big
business generally backing the Republicans while unions, litigation
lawyers and others generally backed the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, companies have understood that it is much
smarter to back both horses in a race so half of their money ends
up working for them. The number of companies contributing at least
$100,000 to both parties has skyrocketed, from 40 in 1996 to 87
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of this infiltration is felt at every level.
Politicians are spending more and more time fund-raising, and much
less acting on behalf of their constituents. The greater their need
to raise funds, the easier it is for contributors to lean on them.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where television advertising rates are among the
highest in the country and political races consequently among the
most expensive, the state insurance commissioner was recently
forced to quit because he had turned a blind eye to gross abuses by
insurance companies who had contributed lavishly to his election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   He had even taken insurance money intended for earthquake
victims and funnelled it into his own campaign war chest.
</P>
<P>
   Also in California, a recent attempt to set up an independent
commission of inquiry into abuses by guards at state prisons was
voted down by the legislature despite a major scandal involving
staged gladiator fights, organized rape and inmate shootings.
</P>
<P>
   One legislator, when challenged by the attorney general on his
vote, admitted that he was ``whoring'' for the prison guards' union
which had contributed a whopping $28 million to candidates in the
1998 state elections.
</P>
<P>
   Such instances are becoming commonplace everywhere. Russ
Feingold, a liberal Democrat senator from Wisconsin who has
co-authored a bill with McCain to ban soft money, calls the system
``legalized bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a system of one person one vote,'' he said at the
Democrats' recent convention, ``but a system of one million
dollars, one million votes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The strength of feeling should not be underestimated. The
protest against the WTO, which was about the same kind of corporate
control on a global level, brought 50,000 people on to the streets
of Seattle _ little short of an earthquake in a country utterly
unaccustomed to such spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   If the street protests have since fizzled, it has partly been
through poor planning and partly because of a failure to see the
connection to domestic politics fast enough. But still, a spirit
has been captured; if there is not yet a movement, there is most
certainly a mood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore have felt obliged to refer to campaign
finance reform on the stump; in his convention speech, Gore went
out of his way to denounce corporate influence and even
acknowledged the spirit of Seattle in a reference to ``fair trade,
not just free trade.''
</P>
<P>
   How sincere these undertakings are remains to be seen. When Sen.
Feingold addressed the convention floor, most of his colleagues
were away at a big corporate fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore had finished his own fine words, he went straight to a
celebrity-studded concert and raised $5 million. As for Bush, he
has beaten all records, raising more than $90 million to date.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins in November will be sorely tempted to wish the
issue away. The corporate sponsors who paid for the election will
be clamoring for their pound of flesh. Besides, politicians will
have little interest in cutting off the source of their own
bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   But neglect could be perilous. There is a rage brewing in the
country, and it crosses all social and political boundaries. No
politician would want that rage to erupt; the next president will
have to find a way to assuage it. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ It is an odd time to be a dissenter in America.
The economy is booming. No Americans are dying in foreign wars.
Unemployment is down, and so is crime. And yet the dissent is
there, and it is being felt across an extraordinary range of public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, we have seen tens of thousands of
people take the city of Seattle by storm and challenge the
globalization agenda of the World Trade Organization; we have seen
John McCain, the populist Republican senator, launch a spirited
anti-establishment campaign to try to wrest his party's
presidential nomination from George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   We have seen the Reform Party, the third force founded eight
years ago by the Texas billionaire Ross Perot, becoming so
exercised about its own critique of the system that it is splitting
into two Reform parties, one libertarian and one far-right
nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we have seen a growing disquiet among rank-and-file
Democrats that their party is losing touch with its roots and
becoming little more than a mirror image of the Republicans.

&HT;     LAWMAKER SHELVES GUN-LICENSING BILL FOR YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Conceding that Gov. Gray Davis would not
support his gun-control measure this year, a Pasadena lawmaker has
abandoned a bill to require a safety test and a license for handgun
owners.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate had already approved the bill, one of the most
sweeping gun-licensing proposals in the nation, but Davis signaled
that he would do nothing to advance the bill in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for legislative action was Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on conversations with the governor's office, I
reluctantly have become convinced that my best chance for seeing
this bill become law is to pursue it next year,'' said Democratic
Assemblyman Jack Scott, whose 27-year-old son died in a gun
accident.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to get gun-control legislation passed in the
Assembly, where some moderate Democrats from the Central Valley are
skittish about offending conservative voters, especially in an
election year.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat, helped persuade some of these same lawmakers
to pass four tough gun-control measures last year, but declined to
do the same thing during the 1999-2000 session. Davis said he
thought the Legislature should wait to see the effect of the new
laws before writing more gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation Davis signed last year ban the manufacture and
sale of certain high-powered weapons, prohibit the purchase of more
than one gun a month, require trigger locks be sold with every new
gun, and set new safety standards for the manufacturing of
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, the author of last year's trigger-lock bill, said he
understood Davis' concerns about passing new measures, but had
``hoped that I would be able to convince the governor my licensing
bill should be an exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's bill would have required every Californian who buys a
handgun to pass a four- to eight-hour safety class before applying
for a license.
</P>
<P>
   New handgun owners also would have been required to prove their
aptitude at a firing range and on a written exam covering legal use
of deadly force, gun storage and gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would have been the most comprehensive gun-licensing
bill in the nation. Scott said he would take the issue up again
next year ``or however long it takes for it to become law.''
</P>
<P>
   About 780 Californians were accidentally killed by firearms
between 1991 and 1997, according to the most recent state
statistics. Of those killings, 226 were children. During the same
period, 1,924 children and 6,333 adults were injured after
unintentional shootings.

   WASHINGTON _ When the Republican presidential nominee, George W.

there were quips from Bush critics that the ticket was the wrong
way around. Was Not Cheney, a former White House chief of staff and
defense secretary during the Gulf War, better equipped to be
president than the one-and-a-half-term governor of Texas? Now,
though, with opinion polls showing Bush and his Democratic rival,
Vice President Al Gore, running neck and neck into the crucial
Labor Day weekend, that same Cheney is looking increasingly like a

`AN OBVIOUS ENCHANTMENT': MYSTERY UPON MYSTERY IN THE SHADOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The enchantment in the title of this entertainingly piquant
first novel by Tucker Malarkey comes from a line in the Koran and
seems to refer to an attitude of nonbelief, an erroneous conviction
that the faith of the ancestors is a sort of bedazzlement, a
falsehood. But the phrase ``an obvious enchantment'' is also
mysterious, elusive, suggestive of the world of uncertainty in
which Malarkey places her likable heroine, an
archaeologist-anthropologist named Ingrid Holtz who is a flickering
column of light trying to penetrate the shadows of a world of
exotic intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid has garnered an academic grant allowing her to travel to
the island of Pelat off the Indian Ocean coast of Kenya, where her
academic mentor and adviser, Nick Templeton, has disappeared while
doing research. Templeton is a rebel in the world of scholarship, a
man who suspects that we have gotten the history of monotheism all
wrong. He wants to answer the question of ``how cultures all around
the world had all, in their own time and way, come to decide on one
god.'' And he believes that part of the answer lies in
rediscovering a long-ago native king who brought Islam to Africa
three centuries before that event is believed to have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid, too, is absorbed by the history of monotheism, and she
is a believer in Templeton, who is mocked and despised by his
colleagues at the University in Michigan, where he and Ingrid both
work.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the academic questions seem a bit contrived, a
bit airy, unconvincingly portentous. Never mind also that some of
what happens in ``An Obvious Enchantment,'' including some of the
critical turnings of plot, seem unmoored from clear and logical
motivation. Malarkey never entirely solves the mysteries that get
her into her African story in the first place. But she is a gifted
writer with a keen sense of place and a basketful of aromatic
characters, expatriates and Africans alike, who give her book
plenty of romantic charm.
</P>
<P>
   The chief mystery has to do with Templeton's disappearance.
Strangely, when Ingrid arrives on Pelat, he makes no effort to
contact her there, or to let her know where he is, even though she
has always been his star pupil and special moral and scholarly
admirer. Why Templeton behaves so strangely is one of those matters
never fully accounted for in Malarkey's scheme. Still, once you
accept that Templeton has vanished and yet is present in the lives
of the savory inhabitants of Pelat, you can enjoy Ingrid's
adventurous efforts not only to find him but to puzzle out what he
has discovered about the historical king.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Ingrid unearths a host of others, dissolute,
roguish, scheming, vulnerable, drunken and, in one case,
unhealthily irresistible. This latter figure is Finn Bergmann,
whose Scandinavian father, now dead, founded Salama, a luxurious
hotel on Pelat where the island's chatty and catty expats gather.
</P>
<P>
   Finn is a white African. He fishes for a living and is a sort of
male counterpart to a femme fatale. He is strong, handsome and
seductive. But while he is willing to share Ingrid's eager bed, he
is unwilling to have sex with her. He also seems to know something
important about Templeton, but he doesn't share this precious
information with Ingrid, which makes her all the more annoyed that
she can't get Finn out of her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her thoughts were clear,'' Malarkey's narrator intones. ``This
man was a confused drunk, a fundamentally crippled human being. He
could not think, feel or talk. She smiled as politely as she could.
`I'm sorry to have caught you in my confusion.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Don't concern yourself with my opinion of you,' Finn said. `I
have none.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Malarkey's characters risk reminding one of central
casting. What recent cultural product about whites in Africa, for
example, does not have the equivalent of Malarkey's Danny Chisham,
the man who drinks steadily at the Salama and has no purpose in
life other than to be hurt and utter witticisms? Then there is
Fatima, the cloaked Muslim woman whom we see striving to keep Finn
from losing himself among these dissolute Europeans, as she
intrigues from the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that concerns everybody _ and that Ingrid can't quite
get a handle on _ has to do with a new hotel being built by another
cagey expatriate, Stanley Wicks, on the other side of Pelat from
the Salama. The first hotel, built by Finn's father, created an
opposition group on the island, a kind of proto-fundamentalist core
that feared the tourism business would pollute the native way of
life, turning local boys into bartenders and bellhops. Now another
eager European wants to bring more commercialism, more liquor, more
European fashion to the very part of the island where the dissident
faction lives.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Templeton is involved with that faction and is opposed
to the new hotel. Finn, too. But why can't anybody just tell the
mystified Ingrid what is happening? In real life they might have,
but then Malarkey wouldn't have had much of a story, and we would
have been deprived of the entertainment she has given us.
</P>
<P>
   Malarkey's ending involves a kind of showdown among the
contending parties. Again, the stakes, especially for the
Europeans, do not seem quite large enough to justify the grisly
acts that are committed, including some by Templeton, as the final
battle is fought. But by then Malarkey has given us a savory,
intimate dose of Africa and a main character whose combination of
pluck and despair make us want to have as much of her as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Obvious Enchantment'' is far from entirely convincing, but
its virtues are distinguished enough for us to keep reading with
pleasure and a sense of edification about a faraway world that
Malarkey has brought colorfully to life.

   WASHINGTON _ When the Republican presidential nominee, George W.
Bush, named Richard Cheney to be his running mate four weeks ago,
there were quips from Bush critics that the ticket was the wrong
way around. Was Not Cheney, a former White House chief of staff and
defense secretary during the Gulf War, better equipped to be
president than the one-and-a-half-term governor of Texas? Now,
though, with opinion polls showing Bush and his Democratic rival,
Vice President Al Gore, running neck and neck into the crucial
Labor Day weekend, that same Cheney is looking increasingly like a
liability for the Bush ticket....By Mary Dejevsky, The Independent &QL;

`WHIPPED': COOLEST DUDES IN THE WORLD MEET ONE CRAFTY DATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Whipped'' may set an all-time record for raw tonnage of sexual
fear and loathing spewed per minute by a Hollywood movie. This
bottom-feeding monstrosity of a comedy was produced, directed and
written by Peter Cohen, whose screenplay conjures more leering
euphemisms for male body parts and sexual acts than any film in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The characters who sling the dirt are three Manhattan yuppies
who take nasty relish in ``scamming'' attractive young women into
sleeping with them. Brad (Brian Van Holt), the slickest of the
three, likes to approach strangers and pretend to be their best
friend's brother. That best friend is always named Jen, he sneers,
since ``they all have friends named Jen.'' In his mind's eye, Brad
is a sophisticated Manhattan answer to Tom Cruise in ``Risky
Business.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeke (Zorie Barber), who has no doubts that he's the coolest
dude on the planet, identifies with the young Mickey Rourke and
affects a shallow post-Beat hipness. Jonathan (Jonathan Abrahams),
the sensitive one, wears a goatee and talks about being in touch
with his feminine side. Hanging on to their coattails is their old
friend Eric (Judah Domke), who has been married for two years and
tries (but fails) to impress them with his tales of domestic sexual
exploits involving a juicer and an egg beater.
</P>
<P>
   Who are these guys anyway? They must be fairly well heeled. Yet
for men in their 20s, they talk as if their brains were implants
wrested from frightened 14-year-old male virgins. Each week this
pathetic group meets for Sunday breakfast, where they exchange
gross-out descriptions of their latest conquests. These rap
sessions, in which the euphemisms fly, make up most of the movie's
attempts at humor. But the dirty talk is so painfully forced and
emphatic it lacks any comic spontaneity. Even the movie's signature
gross-out bit, in which a young man desperately tries to retrieve a
whirring vibrator from an unflushed toilet is bungled.
</P>
<P>
   At one Sunday brunch Brad, Zeke and Jonathan rhapsodize over
having finally met that special someone whom they can actually
respect. Their dream dates turn out to be the same woman, Mia
(Amanda Peet), who picked up all three within a matter of days. Mia
has that rare knack of being all things to all men: Beautiful,
sensual, caring, worshipful, a perfect companion and sizzling bed
partner.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments when this dirty-mouthed revenge comedy becomes
so mean-spirited that you almost gasp at its cruelty. As the crafty
Mia carries on simultaneous affairs with these besotted idiots,
vowing to each that he's the one she truly loves, they
unaccountably turn on one other instead of on her. When we finally
hear Mia's side of the story, her contemptuous evaluations of these
self-styled Don Juans' sexual performances and physical attributes
carry comic sexual warfare in the movies to a new low. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   GENERAL-ELECTRIC (Undated) _ In a few months, John Welch will
step down as chief executive of the General Electric Co., ending a
remarkable 20-year run of earnings growth and near cultlike
devotion. The three front-runners to succeed this 20th-century
business icon fit a pattern: All are gung-ho results-getters for
the company _ and all are white men. Where are the women? The
blacks? The Latinos? The Asians? Together, these groups make up
about 40 percent of GE's domestic workforce, but they are not easy
to find in the executive corps of GE, which is regarded as
America's most admired corporation. By Mary Williams Walsh.

</P>
<P>
   JOHNNIE-COCHRAN (Undated) _ Talking money with celebrity Johnnie
Cochran. Success is not new to Cochran, now 62. Long before his
mustache and sharp ties became a daily staple of the grisly O.J.
Simpson murder trial, he was a big-time lawyer with a heavy
criminal practice. His disciplined, relentless cross-examination at
the trial, however, made Cochran one of the most famous _ and
controversial _ lawyers in America. But it didn't leave him as rich
as it left him famous. Now, he is determined to close that gap. By
Geraldine Fabrikant.

   HOWARD-BUFFETT-PROFILE (Decatur, Ill.) _ As the eldest son of
the so-called ``Oracle of Omaha,'' a man many consider the greatest
stock picker of all time, Howard Buffett is now positioned to
become the next chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company
his father turned into an investor's gold mine. A profile of the
younger Buffett, an investor in his own right. By David Barboza.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BUSINESS (Undated) _ Despite scandal and huge expense,
Olympic sponsorships remain hugely popular, with revenues from them
setting new records this year. No matter what happens on the track,
in the pool or over the field, there may be no more dramatic an
Olympic comeback in 2000 than the one the IOC has pulled on the
sponsorship front. By Randall Lane.

   DEBITCARDS-STUDENTS (Undated) _ Parents who hope to keep their
college-age kids from getting over their heads in debt often
arrange for them to have debit cards rather than credit cards for
emergencies. Card issuers are sabotaging that strategy by giving
debit-card kids ``overdraft protection'' that amounts to an
expensive revolving line of credit _ in other words, a credit card.

are a rotten deal for all consumers, and especially for financial
novices like college kids. By Nancy Lloyd.

<P>
   FIVE-QUESTIONS-BANKRUPTCY (Undated) _ A decade ago, a trio of
scholars, in an award-winning analysis of bankruptcy filings,
destroyed the myth that most of those seeking refuge from creditors
were blue collar workers. People in every occupation go bankrupt in
rough proportion to their numbers, Elizabeth Warren, Teresa
Sullivan and Jay Lawrence Westbrook found in a widely praised study
of Bankruptcy Court records. Now they have refined their research
and shown that misfortune, not profligate living, is behind most
bankruptcy filings. By David Cay Johnston.

<P>
   &UR; INVESTING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-BROKERAGE (Undated) _ Brokers, according to Wall Street
truism, prosper when the market goes up and when it goes down. But
this year the market has gone nowhere _ no major average has moved
as much as 4 percent from its Dec. 31 level _ and the brokers have
done better than ever. And many in Wall Street think that brokerage
shares, despite rich prices and a history of sharp cyclical swings,
have still more room to fly. A major reason, analysts say, is how
they are taking business from banks in a new regulatory landscape
for which the banks themselves lobbied vigorously for decades. By
Robert D. Hershey Jr.

   INVEST-BONDS (Undated) _ With the bond market outperforming the
stock market for the first time in a decade, a bullish forecast for
Treasuries should offer investors a glimmer of hope, and Dr. Edward
Yardeni, chief global economist and investment strategist at
Deutsche Bank Securities is making just such a forecast. By Robert

   STRATEGIES-COLUMN (Undated) _ Even a new study that credits
mutual fund managers with market-beating stockpicking skill _ a
rare positive finding _ says that their advantage is more than
counteracted by the expensive inefficiency of the fund industry,
leaving investors lagging behind the market anyway. By Mark
Hulbert.

<P>
   CONTRARY-COLUMN-LABOR (Undated) _ In some very important ways,
the National Writers Union is the union of the future, and the
apparatchiks who run more old-fashioned unions had better take
notice. The United Auto Workers did just that eight years ago, when
it took in the writers' union as one of its locals. By Daniel Akst.

   ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ Topic tk. By Steven Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SENIORS-COLUMN-ROLLATORS (Undated) _ As athletes say, the wheels
go first: seniors often find that mobility is their most vexing
problem, even if otherwise healthy and able to be active and
self-sufficient. Enter the little-known rollator, which looks like
a sawed-off grocery cart with fat rubber wheels, bicycle handle
bars and hand brakes. It helps people walk easily under their own
power, over floors, sidewalks and grass. It even has a seat if the
user needs to take a rest, and folds up so it can be taken along in
a car or on a plane. By Fred Brock.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY&AMP;MEDICINE-COLUMN (Undated) _ So, what ever happened to
medical savings accounts? These accounts _ which permit people or
their employers to put away a certain amount of tax-free money
every year to pay for health care costs _ was presented an a
panacea to the Big Health Insurance problem by supporters only a
few years ago. And how it failed to ignite says much. By Jennifer
Stenhauer.

   ``Angel Investing: Matching Start-Up Funds with Start-Up
Companies'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Van Osnabrugge and Robert J. Robinson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   422 pages, Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, $32 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Americans are an enterprising bunch.
</P>
<P>
   If you could read the minds of people on their lunch breaks,
you'd probably find many of them intently thinking about an
entrepreneurial project: a new software product or toy, an online
retail outlet, a unique restaurant, an automobile component or a
print shop. Varied as their ideas are, all of these enterprising
people are challenged by one thing: finding the money to make their
entrepreneurial dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   Brushing elbows with these imaginative and ingenious people are
other people who, through wise investing or good luck, possess
discretionary funds that they would be willing to place with an
entrepreneur _ provided that the potential for returns is
attractive enough.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of Mark Van Osnabrugge and Robert J. Robinson's ``Angel
Investing'' is to establish a sort of mutual admiration society
between the two groups. It educates readers in each category to the
opportunities the other category offers and guides them through the
process of joining forces for mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angels'' _ private financial supporters, rather than banks or
other professional underwriting entities _ provide more funds to
business entrepreneurs than any other source, the authors say, but
their role is little understood.
</P>
<P>
   Osnabrugge and Robinson say that no well-researched study of the
subject has been printed before, and they promise to correct that.
Their book delivers the goods, and not just in a theoretical way.
It presents readers with a comprehensive body of knowledge about
angel investors: who they are, how they operate and how they can be
contacted. Up-to-date documentation of angel-financed businesses,
such as Amazon.com, give the book readability and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Some fascinating details plowed from the book's rich soil
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Many of our largest corporations were initially angel-funded,
including Ford, Apple and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Angels fund 30 to 40 times as many entrepreneurial firms as
the formal venture capital industry, involving three to five times
as much money. About 60 percent of all new technology firms are
angel-financed.
</P>
<P>
   _ The authors estimate that the number of business investment
angels (now estimated at 3 million, investing more than $50 billion
in entrepreneurial firms each year) will double within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many high-earning, successful firms, especially in the
technology and Internet fields, have become angel investors.
</P>
<P>
   The book is arranged into four logical areas.
</P>
<P>
   The first, consisting of six chapters, introduces the subject,
examines funding options and concludes with a chapter on steps for
tapping into funds available from private sources.
</P>
<P>
   The next five chapters cover what the authors call first-time
insights into how business angels and venture capitalists decide to
make investments, stages in the process and important tips for
entrepreneurs courting investors.
</P>
<P>
   The third area covers the nuts and bolts of securing and
investing funds. This material is written for entrepreneurs and
potential angels. It includes negotiation and valuation methods and
suggestions for taking advantage of the changing angel marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   If networking or personal contacts aren't successful in finding
angel funding, the entrepreneur can turn to a matching service,
which leads to the fourth and last area of the book. That section
is made up of three appendices, the first of which lists more than
70 matching services in the United States. Interestingly enough, 58
percent are non-profit and 42 percent are private.
</P>
<P>
   Appendix Two lists further helpful resources, such as
associations (worldwide, by country) and organizations, directories
and trade journals.
</P>
<P>
   Appendix Three gives Dutch-uncle advice on writing a winning
business plan, which the authors say can be the most important and
time-consuming part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   The appendices may be the most useful part of the book to many
readers. But I couldn't help but wonder why the appendices weren't
issued as a separate, updatable workbook. Any long list, such as
the 70 matching organizations, starts to go out of date the day it
is written. Within a year or two, a great many of the addresses,
Web sites, phone and fax numbers and other pertinent information
will change. Why not issue the entire book as an annually updated
and improved directory or at least place the information on a Web
site that can be conveniently accessed and updated periodically?
</P>
<P>
   But that is just being picky. Van Osnabrugge and Robinson worked
for years to make this book the bible of angel investing; any
serious entrepreneur or investor who conscientiously studies it
can't fail to profit from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Van Osnabrugge is a management consultant at Marakon Associates,
an international consulting firm, and has experience as a
matchmaker helping entrepreneurs find investment funds. Robinson is
an associate professor at Harvard Business School.

AN AFFAIR WITHOUT PASSION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``An Affair of Love's'' original title was ``Une Liaison
Pornographique,'' and you don't have to be fluent in French to know
the literal translation of that. It's a good thing the title was
changed, because _ despite some tastefully filmed sex scenes that
wouldn't raise an eyebrow from anyone who's ever seen ``Sex and the
City'' _ the movie is nowhere as salacious as ``A Pornographic
Affair'' would indicate. The bad news is that it is as generic as
the new English-language title would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins with an offscreen interviewer asking a woman
and a man (Nathalie Baye and Sergi Lopez, whose characters are
identified only as ``Her'' and ``Him'') about their fling. It's
never clear whom the interviewer works for, but it's hard to
conceive of a news outlet or documentarian who would be interested
in their story. The man and woman agree that the affair was purely
sexual at first _ they met through a magazine ad, and their trysts
fulfilled a fantasy so outrageous that the filmmakers leave it to
the audience's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with anonymous, no-strings-attached relationships,
however, is that human nature makes people want to attach strings _
and sure enough, the woman and the man begin to have feelings for
each other. That's pretty clear from the new title, leaving the
movie with only one mystery: Will these two stay together?
</P>
<P>
   If it's true that the left brain controls rational thought and
the right brain controls emotions, then ``An Affair of Love'' is a
left-brained movie about right-brained subjects. It's so
dispassionately intellectual about passion that when the man and
woman talk during sex, it's more like coffee-table discussion than
bedroom talk _ which is strange, since they're talking about sex.
It's so detached that when the man cries, although both people say
they're touched, you're likely to wonder why his face is leaking.
</P>
<P>
   Director Frederic Fonteyne and writer Philippe Blasband must
have had something in mind when they came up with this; the movie
is well-filmed, and Baye and Lopez are appealing. But ``Affair''
doesn't seem to be about anything. It's too coy too be about the
dangers of sexual obsession, too arid to be about the risks of
romantic love, and too silly, with its often elliptical dialogue,
to be about communication. The closest that it comes to dealing
with real sexual issues is that it will make some people want to
roll over and go to sleep.

 &HT;    Life behind the scenes for child actors
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I've always wondered why any parent would let
their child go into show business. Sure, the potential for huge
paydays is tempting. But is the price that must be paid for that
possible fortune worth it? On Monday, A&AMP;E will air ``Child Stars:
Their Story'': 9-11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Child Stars: Their Story `` attempts to reveal what it's
really like being a young star. The two-hour documentary, narrated
by Hayley Mills, assembled an impressive array of talent (over 30
in all) from five generations. Patty Duke (''The Patty Duke Show'')
talks about being forced to go to her dad's funeral in her
character's costume and makeup. David Faustino (''Married...with
Children'') remembers what it was like drinking at Hollywood's
hottest nightclubs at 14. Melissa Gilbert (''Little House on the
Prairie''), one of ``Child Stars''' executive producers, recalls
crying, sweating and breaking out in a rash after forgetting her
lines. Diana Serra Cary (''Baby Peggy'') recalls feeling like a
``senior citizen'' at age 15.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to several interviews, ``Child Stars'' also features
a roundtable during which eight former stars, including Kim Fields
(''The Facts of Life''), Jerry Mathers (''Leave it to Beaver'') and
Sara Gilbert (''Roseanne'') talk openly about drugs, rejection and
the pros and cons of having a sexy image.
</P>
<P>
   Child stars are often robbed of a normal childhood. Growing up
is hard enough. Imagine having to do it in front of millions of
people watching your every move or snickering about every
goofy-looking pimple you get. The pressure to perform is also
insanely intense. Many adult actors can't even take the heat and
often resort to drugs and alcohol to cope. Just think what it's
like for a kid to overhear a producer angrily talking about low
ratings and possible cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   And in a business where rejection is the norm, just what kind of
toll does that take on a child's psyche?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, child stars seem to have it all. They make great
money. Get invited to glamorous parties and have adoring fans
screaming their names. But when the cameras stop rolling and the
director yells, ``Cut!'' the bottom line is, many are just sad,
lonely and scared little kids.
</P>
<P>
   When you hear the term ``former child star,'' most people, I'm
sure, immediately think of such troubled actors as Todd Bridges
(''Diff'rent Strokes''). Bridges' brushes with drugs and the law
are now legendary. In the special, he says he always felt more at
home on the ``Diff'rent Strokes'' set because his real dad was a
raging alcoholic who acted like a ``pit bull'' at home.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the stories are tales of woe. Some are downright
hilarious. Bill Mumy (''Lost in Space''), for example, remembers
shooting an ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents ``episode when he was 7.
Mumy kept fidgeting during his scene, which drove the intimidating
director nuts. So, Hitchcock finally told a terrified Mumy that if
he didn't stop moving, he'd nail his feet to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the blood,'' Hitchcock intoned, ``will come pouring out
like milk.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the always delightful Danny Bonaduce (''The
Partridge Family'') who loved his time as a child star. ``I was
short, fat with red hair and freckles,'' he says, ``and I took two
cheerleaders to the prom...life was wonderful.''

   THE GRINCH GETS A SOARING SCORE
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Ron Howard, the director, and James Horner, the
composer, were huddled behind an enormous control panel overlooking
the scoring stage where, minutes earlier, Horner had conducted a
full orchestra in a climactic sequence from ``How the Grinch Stole
Christmas.'' As the scene played back on a movie screen on the far
wall, the two men listened intently to the way the lush music
worked with the dialogue and the on-screen gymnastics of Jim
Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a funny tone in there,'' Howard said. ``What do
you think?'' Horner listened and nodded. At issue was whether the
soaring music was undercutting the comic aspects of Carrey's
performance. It was a tricky question.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is based on the classic Dr. Seuss children's book
about a fuzzy green creature who is so bitter that he conspires to
ruin everybody's Christmas in Whoville, the town beneath his
mountaintop lair. Carrey plays the Grinch in full green regalia,
including long furry fingers and latex snout, but with yellow
contact lenses. In the scene, he bounces around the snow-capped
cliff like a pinball, clutching at his heart.
</P>
<P>
   If the music is too emphatic and emotional, it might drown the
comedy. But if the music is toned down too much, the scene might
not give the audience the emotional catharsis it wants from the
climax. ``It's like being a tightrope walker with one foot in the
air at all times,'' Horner said. ``My feeling is that the funniness
is going to come through whatever, so I tend to err on the side of
making things emotive.''
</P>
<P>
   The scoring stage is about the size of a basketball court,
strewn with instruments awaiting the afternoon session. A gaily
decorated Christmas tree stands in one corner, and brightly wrapped
packages are scattered around the room. Horner's crew members often
decorate the stage to match the film on which they are working. For
``The Perfect Storm,'' the same stage had been festooned with ships
and plastic frogmen.
</P>
<P>
   The score, the computer effects and the final sound mix are
always the last pieces to be put into place in the weeks before a
movie's release. In this case, Horner and his musicians are working
with a little time to spare; ``Grinch'' is not due in theaters
until Nov. 17, vying with films like ``102 Dalmatians,'' ``Rugrats
in Paris'' and the new Adam Sandler comedy, ``Little Nicky,'' for
the lucrative Thanksgiving market.
</P>
<P>
   During the lunch break, Horner walked through the crowded
scoring stage, picking his way through the tangle of cellos and
electronic synthesizers to a line of oddly twisted plastic hoses
resting on the floor. Each of the peculiar objects was a musical
instrument, created by Horner's team to make the kind of odd sounds
that might come from the Baroque-meets-Dali instruments drawn by
Dr. Seuss for his Whoville town band. He picked one up and
energetically blew into it, producing a vibrating honk that sounded
at once plaintive and hostile. ``We had one that had a slide on it,
like a trombone, but it took two people to work it,'' Horner said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most prolific movie composers of the last
quarter-century, Horner has worked on more than 100 film and
television scores, though he is perhaps best known for his
Oscar-winning work on ``Titanic.'' (He won for best score and best
song, ``My Heart Will Go On.'')
</P>
<P>
   Horner said he usually took about six weeks to write the initial
score. ``I do it at a desk with pen and paper,'' he said. ``I don't
use a computer in writing at all. I'm sort of old-fashioned about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the public aspect of his job _ when he must stand up
before a room filled with seasoned musicians, explain what he wants
and then conduct them through it _ is the most uncomfortable. ``I
tend to be a shy person,'' he said. He does not, for instance, go
to the premieres of his films, when he must walk a red-carpet
gantlet of television cameras, unless he is forced to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Horner wandered into a side office to work on that afternoon's
pieces of the score. He is feeling pretty confident about the way
things are going on the ``Grinch'' score.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it makes me cry, then I know I've nailed it,'' he said.
``I can't do any better.''
</P>
<P>
   JOYS OF SUMMER
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tollin was excited. He was preparing to direct the final
scene for ``Summer Catch,'' a romance between a poor boy (Freddie
Prinze Jr.) and a rich girl (Jessica Biel) set in the world of the
Cape Cod summer baseball league, and Ken Griffey Jr., center
fielder for the Cincinnati Reds, was going to be playing a key
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pivotal scene,'' Tollin said. ``We needed a guy who
really transcended the sport, who was more recognizable than the
average baseball player, and Junior said he was up for it. The
scene is a confrontation between him and Freddie's character, and
there is some scripted dialogue and some chances for him to do some
ad-libbing. I think he's really got the chops.''
</P>
<P>
   Tollin, a producer for live-action programs on the Nickelodeon
network, directed his first film, ``Hank Aaron: Chasing the
Dream,'' in 1995. Indeed, he has shown a decided inclination toward
the national pastime. In addition to directing ``Summer Catch,''
tentatively scheduled for release next spring, he is producing
``Hardball,'' another movie for release next year that is about a
young man in the Chicago projects who becomes a Little League
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always enjoyed working with professional athletes,'' he
said. ``Stunt casting _ call it whatever you want. For `Summer
Catch' I got Hank Aaron to come down and do a cameo, Carlton Fisk
plays himself, Richie Allen plays a scout and Curt Gowdy is the
Cape Cod league announcer.''
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET AT SUNDANCE
</P>
<P>
   The Sundance Film Festival, which runs for 10 days every January
in Park City, Utah, has decided to institute an Internet component
next year. Film festival organizers all over the world have been
struggling with how to embrace the work being done on the Web, and
Sundance decided this was the way.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Jan. 18, the opening day of the next Sundance
gathering, the Sundance Online Film Festival _ StreamSearch.com,
the company that staged the Internet Film and Music Festival in
February, is to produce it _ will present work created specifically
for the Web. Festival organizers said they would consider all types
of work, including animation, live-action, documentary, interactive
and experimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamic material currently being generated for the Web is
something we are excited to present,'' said Geoffrey Gilmore, a
co-director of the festival.

 &HT;    Hank Greenberg: Pioneer, hero, star
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a rare film that begins with ``Take Me Out to the Ball
Game'' sung in Yiddish.
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg'' is a rare film
indeed _ a documentary that mixes peanuts and Cracker Jack and
prejudice. It's a film with a decided point of view, yet one that's
drenched in a fan's affection.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Greenberg _ or Hammerin' Hank as he was known when he was
knocking 'em out of the park for the Detroit Tigers in the 1930s
and '40s _ wasn't the first Jewish guy to play professional
baseball. But he was the first not to change his name and the first
to become a superstar. Greenberg batted in 183 runs in one season,
almost broke the Babe's single-season home-run record and was voted
most valuable player as a first baseman and an outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   He also led his team to four pennants and two World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as he was amassing these astonishing on-field feats,
he was subjected to anti-Semitic taunts. ``Throw him a pork chop,''
someone would yell. ``He won't hit that.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Greenberg remained graceful, self-effacing and
focused on the game. In an interview given before his death in
1986, he's more interested in talking about his RBI than
Jew-baiting. Perhaps the most telling statement is made by his son.
Greenberg left baseball the same season that a certain rookie named
Jackie Robinson started. In fact, the two once collided at first
base. ``My dad said he never knew about having it rough until he
saw Jackie Robinson on the ball field.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like her subject, Aviva Kempner is a straightforward,
no-frills filmmaker. There's nothing fancy, just the usual
assortment of documentary footage, period artifacts and talking
heads. Which, in this movie's case, includes such illustrious
Greenberg fans as actor Walter Matthau and attorney Alan
Dershowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the late Matthau's familiar mug adds another layer of
poignancy. He could be speaking for an entire generation when he
admits that simply knowing a guy like Greenberg was out there gave
him hope. ``It meant I didn't have to end up in the Garment
District.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Dershowitz's comments are more combative and
political. He even says he thought Greenberg could have been the
first Jewish president _ an oddly resonant and timely tribute with
Joe Lieberman on the Democratic presidential ticket. Notes
Dershowitz, ``Baseball was a way of saying we were as American as
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg himself was not particularly religious. But he
accepted the mantle of Symbol with the same gracious ease he
brought to his game. The film makes quietly clear that this was no
small thing in a time when anti-Semitism was virulent and more
socially acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Kempner's documentary celebrates a hero, both on the diamond and
off. Robinson sums it up simply: ``He gave me encouragement. Mr.
Greenberg is class.''
</P>
<P>
   So is his movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Life and Times
</P>
<P>
   of Hank Greenberg''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   A documentary about baseball player Hank Greenberg. Directed by
Aviva Kempner. Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A grand slam.

 &HT;    `Tao of Steve' borders on the offensive
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to Dex (Donal Logue), the genially chubby star of
``The Tao of Steve,'' the way to be cool and get all the girls is
to be Steve McQueen. Of course, you don't have to really be
McQueen; you just have to learn how to groove into his unflappable
Steve-ness.
</P>
<P>
   Explains Dex, ``James Bond is a Steve. Michael Jordan is a
Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   Dex, too, is a Steve. He's got the sexual conquests to prove it.
``The Tao of Steve,'' which charmed a lot of folks at last winter's
Sundance Film Festival, is basically about a fat boy who's a babe
magnet. Why this would be inexplicable to anyone _ his pals make
much of a fuss over how he gets as much as he does _ seems
inexplicable to me. Do the names John Belushi, John Goodman or John
Candy ring a bell? Hardly Adonises, but certainly attractive in
their own roly-poly way.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the twist in the movie is that Dex runs into a brick
wall _ or, given the McQueen metaphor, a barbed-wire fence _ when
he runs into a former classmate named Syd at their college reunion.
She's staying on in Santa Fe to design sets for the city's famed
opera company. Dex tries his usual tricks and convoluted come-ons,
but she's impervious. Initially challenged, then obsessed, Dex
finds that not only has he fallen for her but he's violating his
own rule of cool: ``We pursue that which retreats from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture was co-written by two sisters, Jenniphr Goodman, who
also directs, and Greer, who also stars as Syd. Their gender seems
to have given them carte blanche for conjuring a slight,
occasionally charming, but often borderline offensive story. More
is made over Dex's looks than seems necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If Dex were a Dexette practicing The Tao of Gwyneth, the
character would probably be seen as desperate and pitiful (and, of
course, a bit sluttish). Further, the bits of wisdom with which he
entices so many women are embarrassingly stupid and obvious _ the
sort of thing horny college professors have been saying to students
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Logue, who's appeared in such mainstream movies as ``The
Patriot,'' is the best thing in the film, with a shaggy-dog appeal
that transcends his Steve pose. But the movie as a whole is the
sort of thing that no one should take to heart. And that's pretty
much a fatal flaw in a romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tao of Steve''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman. Directed by Jenniphr
Goodman. Rated R for profanity and drug use. 1 hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The Tao of John _ as in Belushi, Candy and Goodman
_ is more like it.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' PG-13 (crude and sexual humor, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence and Nia Long.
</P>
<P>
   Review: It's one super-sized Martin Lawrence. As an FBI agent on
a neighborhood stakeout to capture a vicious bank robber, Lawrence
dons layer upon layer of prosthetics to impersonate a 325-pound,
small-town granny in Cartersville (the movie, however, was filmed
in Los Angeles). The results may be predictable, but with
Lawrence's manic comedic timing they are also occasionally quite
funny. (BL) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' R (violence, drug content and brief
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A junky would-be religious thriller about a little girl
with special powers. The latest cinematic struggle of good vs.
evil, the film swipes everything it can from ``The Omen,'' ``The
Exorcist,'' ``End of Days,'' ``Stigmata'' and other
Catholic/satanic epics, all while managing to bore the pants off
you. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood Simple'' R (violence, sex, nudity , language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dan Hedaya, Frances McDormand and M. Emmet Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Review: The Coen brothers' first film is back in all its
devilishly degenerate glory. Re-released in a spruced-up but
still-smirking so-called director's cut, the movie is pretty much
exactly as it was when it hit theaters in 1984. That is, a
good-old-boy gothic full of flashy camera angles and trashy people.
What's astonishing is how much of the Coens' unique talent was
evident from the start. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring It On''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (sex-related material and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Kirsten Dunst stars in a comedy that pits two rival high
schools' cheerleading squads in a we-hate-you showdown at the
national cheerleading championships. Pretty much all the jokes fall
flat. Actually, the funniest bit involves projectile vomiting. And
what does that say about this movie? (BL) 1 hour, 33 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' R (profanity and sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Call it ``Girl, Intercepted.'' Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is
a cheerleader shipped off to a homosexual rehab center called True
Directions because of certain ``telling'' signs. There's potential
here for some funny, nasty satire, but filmmaker Jamie Babbit soon
backs off the risky stuff. The funniest thing in the movie is
RuPaul as a rehab counselor who proudly disowns his gay past and
wears a ``Straight is Great'' T-shirt. (ERG) 1 hour, 25 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil B. Demented'' R (profanity, sex, violence, substance
abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Melanie Griffith and Stephen Dorff.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Not quite demented enough. There are some amusing bits
and some savvy cinema in-jokes in John Waters' movie about a
Hollywood star (Melanie Griffith) kidnapped by underground
filmmakers and forced to star in their no-budget flick. Like Patty
Hearst (who appears in the film), Griffith becomes a convert to
their cause and their wild-eyed leader (Stephen Dorff). Too much of
the film is slapdash and just plain silly. (ERG) C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cell'' R (violence, language and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Don't get trapped in this one. Jennifer Lopez plays an
intrepid child therapist who, through an experimental sci-fi
technique, can enter the minds of others. A detective (Vince
Vaughn) asks her to stroll through the brain of a serial killer
(Vincent D'Onofrio) so he can find where he's stashed his latest
victim. Visually provocative, narratively impaired, it's like ``The
Silence of the Lambs'' without the compelling characters. (ERG) 1
hour, 52 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run''
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Mel Gibson and Miranda Richardson. G
</P>
<P>
   Review: Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is
about some hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their
villainous owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in
chickens. If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily
deadpan, this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained
entertainment. (ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' PG-13 (sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, Maria Bello and John
Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Dog-face hideous. The come-on is five hot chicks serving
liquor in a rowdy fun-time saloon (they splash whiskey across the
bar and set it afire; they douse each others' T-shirts with big
pitchers of water). But it's really the slapdash story of a young
waif, a struggling songwriter aching for stardom in New York City.
``Coyote'' is profoundly stupid and earnestly inept at conveying a
story. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 34 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crew''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Dreyfuss and Burt Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (sexual content, violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Review: It stereotypes Jews and Hispanics and belittles the
group it's supposed to be celebrating, retirement-age Americans.
Even worse, the movie's not even funny. The stars are old mafia
wiseguys trying to fight a rent increase in their Miami hotel. Lame
plot twists ensue. (SM) 1 hour, 28 minutes. F
</P>
<P>
   ``Croupier''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clive Owen and Alex Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Review: This 1998 film involves a struggling author who takes a
job at a casino running a roulette wheel to look for writing
inspiration. Soon he's convinced to join a robbery scheme.
``Croupier'' has more on its mind than danger and plot twists. It's
a fascinating, hard-edged portrait of a man who swears he doesn't
gamble. (SM) 1 hour, 31 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' PG-13 (sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Della Reese and Julianna
Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Leapin' lizards! The prehistoric critters in Disney's
years-in-the-making, $200 million-plus computer animation do more
than leap. Alas, the plot is worth about two cents _ something
about an Iguanodon raised by lemurs who helps a herd of dinosaurs
find a fabled nesting ground after a disastrous meteor shower.
Parents be aware: while most of the movie is Barney-tame, the scary
parts can be quite scary. (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The End'' Unrated (includes alcohol use, sexual situations and
violence)
</P>
<P>
   Skateboarding flick featuring Tony Hawk and Bucky Lasek.
</P>
<P>
   Review: An action/adventure skateboarding flick full of wild
stunts, slo-mo balletic moves and total 'tude. There is no plot per
se, just skateboard legends like Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek and a half
dozen or so other dudes exhibiting their stuff. When the movie's
not showing staggering stunts, it's stoking the young male,
overadrenalized, grunge-rules lifestyle. (BL) About 41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' PG-13 (some sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary about Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, narrated by
RuPaul Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Review: The rise and fall of evangelical diva Tammy Faye Bakker
Messner, the PTL Club and her marriage to Jim Bakker makes a
fascinating story. But somewhere along the way, directors Fenton
Bailey and Randy Barbato turned the subject of their documentary
into its mascot. Often captivating and informative, but full of
gaps and lacking key interviews. (SM) 1 hour, 19 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl on the Bridge'' R (sexual themes) subtitles
</P>
<P>
   Starring Daniel Auteuil and Vanessa Paradis.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Starts great but loses steam. The fine French director
Patrice Leconte (``Monsieur Hire'') has cooked up a romantic fairy
tale about a suicidal gamin (Vanessa Paradis) and a professional
knife-thrower who persuades her to become his new target. After an
impressive first hour in which the film creates an aura of
unresolved romantic tension and intensity, it goes adrift. (ERG) 1
hour, 31 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 2000'' PG (monster violence and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Takehiro Murata, and Tsutomu Kitagawa (as Godzilla).
</P>
<P>
   Review: ``Godzilla 2000'' is everything hard-core fans want it
to be. So corny and campy. And, God bless it, so badly dubbed in
English it soars. Sure it's bad filmmaking. Sure it's a guy _ actor
Tsutomu Kitagawa _ clad in a nearly vintage latex Godzilla get-up
and stomping through Tokyo, knocking down cardboard mini-buildings
and upending toy-sized cars with his gnarly feet. But that's the
point. (BL) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality, profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief
called back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal
for a British crime lord. ``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car
chase that easily outdoes the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A
few IQ points may be lost while watching the flick. But you'll be
having too much fun to care. (SM) At metro theaters. 1 hour, 59
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' R (graphic violence, nudity, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A high-tech fusion of ``The Invisible Man'' and ``Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' it lets director Paul Verhoeven (``Starship
Troopers,'' ``Total Recall'') show off some gruesome,
state-of-the-art computer effects and exercise his gleeful brand of
brutal action. But his filmmaking energy is wasted on a weak script
and characters so two-dimensional, they're virtually all
transparent. (SM) 1 hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg''
</P>
<P>
   A documentary about baseball player Hank Greenberg. Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Aviva Kempner's documentary is a rare film indeed _ a
celebration of Hank Greenberg, a pro baseball player in the 1930s
and '40s who became the first Jewish sports superstar. Greenberg
broke records, was voted most valuable player twice and led his
team, the Detroit Tigers, to two World Series _ even as he was
being subjected to anti-Semitic baiting by fans, rivals and,
sometimes, his own teammates. Jackie Robinson puts it best: ``Mr.
Greenberg was class.'' So is his movie. (ERG) 1 hour, 35 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Review: It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan
has his own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest
sports story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the
back, it's a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones
in on the 1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team
to a sixth championship before retirement. (BL) 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' PG-13 (crude humor and sexual
content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Review: The big problem in ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' is
the nutty professor. This sequel to the 1996 hit seems designed for
video: You want to fast-forward through all the parts focused on
tubby scientist Sherman (Eddie Murphy) so you can get back to the
rest of his family (played by Murphy, Murphy, Murphy and Murphy,
plus a fat kid). Murphy is jaw-droppingly funny. But the script is
simply not nutty enough. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>

   Review: This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like

   Review: There's nothing that original. It's just a lot of funny
stuff knocked out by four sharp stand-up comics. And under Spike
Lee's direction, it's one of the liveliest concert films in years.
The routines get raucous and rude but hold off on the blistering
verbal assaults of other comedians. Lee looses several cameras
through the venue, capturing audience reactions and giving the
movie the dynamic spark of the live event. (SM)1 hour, 57 minutes.

   Review: Mel Gibson single-handedly wins the American Revolution,
among other historical revisions. The latest from Roland Emmerich
takes the jingoistic spirit of his ``Independence Day'' and amps it
to a feverish, flag-waving pitch. The movie is beautiful on the eye
and crafted with great care. It relies on oversimplification, cheap
sentiment and a villain so two-dimensionally nasty even Satan

does the audience in the latest movie directed by Wolfgang

the battle of men (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg) and women (Mary

   Review: The new Pokemon movie is a lot better than last year's
first flick. And slightly better than a poke in the eye. ``Pokemon
the Movie 2000'' has more accomplished animation, more drama and a
decent-enough sprinkling of jokes, all adding up to something
barely watchable. Still, it's mostly cheaply made, barely
interesting and focused on niche marketing. (Bob Longino) 1 hour,

</P>
<P>
   Review: It's got it all. Bone-crunching football plays.
Boneheaded comedy (the team kicker, a wire-thin Welsh soccer
player, puffs cigs while booting field goals). And a dumb-as-dirt
pep squad whose sideline lap-dance cheers cause the opposition to
fumble a lot. Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman star in this dumb romp
about adult scabs taking over for striking pro players. (BL)1 hour,

   Review: A guiltless, feel-good flick in the ``Waking Ned
Devine'' mold. The film has everything it takes to be hopelessly
twee: steaming teacups and scenic seascapes, eccentric villagers, a
rowdy pub and some naughty business involving marijuana. But to the
credit of everyone involved, especially Brenda Blethyn in the title
role, the comedy mainly skirts the pitfalls of preciousness. (SM) 1

   Review: Propped up by the Wayans brothers _ Keenen
(writer/director), Shawn (writer/actor) and Marlon (writer/actor) _
``Scary Movie'' is a parody of teen horror flicks. The ``Scream''
trilogy, ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' ``The Blair Witch
Project'' and, just because it was popular, ``The Matrix,'' all get
skewered in a thousand jokes that are either hilarious, funny, not
funny or simply crude. (BL) 1 hour, 28 minutes. C+

<P>
   ``Shaft'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Christian Bale and Jeffrey Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Review: You can dig it. Sporting the original Oscar-winning
theme song, the ``Shaft'' 2000, starring Samuel L. Jackson, is one
bad I'm-messin'-with-your-head movie. While the plot is a
trumped-up trifle involving both a suspected racist killer
(Christian Bale) and whacked-out drug lord (Jeffrey Wright), the
movie clicks because of the performances. Wright steals the
picture, directed by John Singleton. (BL) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B-

   ``Space Cowboys'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner and
Donald Sutherland.

   Review: The right stuff. Geezer chic gets a grand showcase in
Clint Eastwood's shamelessly crowd-pleasing comedy-thriller. When a
decrepit Russian satellite threatens to crash to Earth, four aging
astronauts who were axed from the program in the '50s are summoned
into service to repair the thing. The best part of the film is
watching these veterans play off each other like seasoned pros on
the Senior Tour. (ERG) 2 hours, 15 minutes. B

   ``The Tao of Steve'' R (profanity /drug use)

<P>
   Starring Donal Logue ,Greer Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A slight and slightly obnoxious romantic comedy about a
chunky non-hunk (Donal Logue) who's a babe magnet because he
practices the so-called tao of Steve, i.e., the way to get girls is
to emulate the sheer coolness of Steve McQueen. The twist comes
when this lumpen Lothario falls for a set designer (Greer Goodman)
impervious to his method. Logue can be charming, but the whole
premise seems contrived and a bit false. (ERG) At Tara. 1 hour, 30
minutes. C-

   ``Time Regained'' Unrated (sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Catherine Deneuve, John Malkovich and Emmanuelle Beart.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Ultimately it's designed for Marcel Proust readers, who
are likely to love and loathe it in equal parts for its attempts to
give concrete form to his work. It's like a gorgeous silk tapestry
shrouding a statue meant to memorialize decay and regret and
ineffability _ a statue that can't really be seen in its entirety
with the naked eye (or the camera lens). (SM) 2 hours, 45 minutes.

   ``What Lies Beneath''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (terror, violence, sensuality, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Review: What lies beneath ``What Lies Beneath'' is a script that
could have come from a 1970s TV movie. Narratively old-fashioned,
but boosted by star performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and
Harrison Ford and suspenseful direction, it's a lovingly crafted
throwback to haunted-house movies that relied more on suggestion
and slowly building creepiness than over-the-top effects. (SM) 2
hours, 10 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' R (profanity, sexuality.)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gina McKee and Shirley Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Review: In Alice's Wonderland, things got curiouser and
curiouser. In Michael Winterbottom's ``Wonderland,'' things get
grimmer and grimmer. The movie is a series of interconnected
vignettes (a la ``Magnolia'') showing the unfulfilled lives of
three sisters (Gina McKee, Shirley Henderson, Molly Parker) in
South London. Besides the film's bleakness and hyper-realism of
Mike Leigh or Ken Loach, the acting is fine and the observations
acute. It's one of those hurts-so-good films. (ERG)1 hour, 49
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' PG-13 (sci-fi action violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart
and Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   Review: ``X-Men'' never comes close to classic status. The best
movie to work this superhero turf lately was the shamelessly
entertaining ``The Matrix.'' But director Bryan Singer and his
collaborators treat the comic's mythology with seriousness and
respect (unlike other recent, slapdash comic adaptations ``Spawn''
and ``Blade''). It's an engaging popcorn movie in a summer that's
littered with duds. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes.B-

 &HT;    `Wonderland' a gritty, lyrical place
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Alice's Wonderland, things kept getting curiouser and
curiouser. In Michael Winterbottom's ``Wonderland,'' things keep
getting grimmer and grimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a listless corner of South London, the movie is a series
of interconnected vignettes (a la ``Short Cuts'' or ``Magnolia'')
focusing on a few days in the lives of three sisters. It's not a
pretty picture. These young women mostly inhabit a world of singles
bars and single parenthood. The one attached sister, Molly (Molly
Parker), is very pregnant, but her partner, Eddie (John Simm),
finds himself less and less ready for fatherhood as the due date
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Middle sister Debbie (Shirley Henderson) already has a child _ a
watchful, neglected 11-year-old she farms out as often as possible
to her irresponsible ex (Ian Hart) so she can do some partying. The
youngest sibling, Nadia (Gina McKee), is so unaware of her pluses
and so desperate to connect with someone _ anyone _ that she does
the singles scene, places personal ads and sleeps with guys who
clearly don't intend to call her again.
</P>
<P>
   How'd these women get in this fix? Well, take a look at their
parents' loveless marriage. Dad's (Jack Shepherd) a henpecked sad
sack, Mom (Kika Markham) an edgy harridan deeply mired in her own
misery.
</P>
<P>
   The only happy character in the lot is the girls' brother (Enzio
Cilenti). He's cut himself off from the family, but a last-minute
phone call leaves the lingering suggestion that blood ties can't
always be severed so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this is not what anyone would call a feel-good film,
and, for a while, its utter bleakness wears you down. Yet the
ensemble cast is so good, the script's observations so acute that,
after a point, it becomes one of those movies that hurt so good.
</P>
<P>
   Winterbottom isn't just saying that life is empty and
meaningless. He's showing us people with the potential to feel that
emptiness more than most. People who are isolated and without hope.
And then he shows us tiny, tiny rays of light in all the gloom _ an
unexpected smile, the miracle of a new life. He takes us to the
edge of the abyss and asks us to look, but he doesn't give us the
final shove.
</P>
<P>
   The picture's hand-held style echoes the up-close hyper-realism
of Mike Leigh or Ken Loach. But there's an unexpected lyricism,
too. Say, in a shot of the usually stoic Nadia wiping away a tear
as she rides the bus back home. Alone. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' can feel thin, but it also feels real. There's a
grittiness here that's hard to shake. You leave the theater
thinking no one's been let off the hook _ not the characters, not
the filmmaker, not even the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gina McKee and Shirley Henderson. Directed by Michael
Winterbottom. Rated R for profanity and sexuality. 1 hour, 49
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A bittersweet look at some drab London lives.

 &HT;    Hank Greenberg film is compelling but one-sided
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Since she has been toiling for the past 12
years on ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg,'' an affectionate
documentary tribute to the first Jewish baseball star,
writer-director Aviva Kempner could not have intended it as a
metaphor for the current barrier-shattering campaign bid of
Orthodox Jewish Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the film's commercial arrival now, it is hard not to
see parallels to the Democratic vice presidential candidate in the
saga of the New York-born Detroit Tigers slugger who encountered
overt anti-Semitism on his way to baseball's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a film that needs no such topical analogy to make
it compelling, as well as entertaining. It is worth being reminded,
or to learn for the first time, how much Jewish baseball fans lived
vicariously through Greenberg's presence on the field, taking
ethnic pride in his fence-busting heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Such prominent Jews as Sen. Carl Levin, attorney Alan Dershowitz
and the late actor Walter Matthau _ friends of Greenberg or merely
fans of the game _ are recorded speaking adoringly of the hulking
athlete's inspiring exploits amid overt hatred.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stirring tale of triumph but one that Kempner is canny
enough to tell with leavening humor. It begins with a rousing
``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' sung in Yiddish, includes
context-setting film clips from ``Gentleman's Agreement,'' ``Woman
of the Year'' and the television series ``Brooklyn Bridge,''
concluding with a few moments of baseball chaos from the Marx
Brothers. Even with such a fascinating corner of sports _ and
cultural _ history, the challenge is to tell it in a visually
interesting way. Kempner does so with vintage newsreels, Greenberg
family home movies, some stock footage, still photos and talking
head interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Because baseball was such a prime American sports pastime,
particularly in Greenberg's heyday of the '30s and '40s, his
inclusion was all the more symbolic and significant. Factor in his
acceptance in predominantly blue-collar Detroit, the home of such
prominent anti-Semitic figures as Henry Ford and Father Charles
Coughlin, and the story takes on even greater resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg was a two-time Most Valuable Player award recipient, a
runner-up to Babe Ruth's former single-season home run mark (58)
and at one time the highest paid player in baseball ($100,000). As
World War II loomed, Greenberg became a symbol of American Jewish
resistance to Hitler. He served in the army for four years, largely
in a propaganda role, so his career statistics obviously suffered
from his sense of nationalistic duty. And his final ballplaying
days overlapped with color barrier breaker Jackie Robinson. In a
telling anecdote, Greenberg offered the black athlete encouragement
as his teammates continued to hurl abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to become involved in Greenberg's story, even if
your interest in baseball is minimal. At times, however, Kempner
focuses too narrowly on the specifics of the game, recounting the
details of World Series wins and losses that threaten to bog the
film down into the ordinary. She occasionally overplays her hand
trying to pump up the drama, making too much of Greenberg's shift
from first base to the outfield, for instance. And hyperbole like
Dershowitz calling Greenberg ``the most famous Jew in America'' _
What about radio and movie star Eddie Cantor? Supreme Court Justice
Louis Brandeis? _ goes unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg'' is hardly an objective
portrait. It would have helped to hear another side of his story,
or some hint of an imperfection. But for those who like their
sports stars glorified _ and perhaps Greenberg comes close to
deserving it _ this film is a four-bagger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg''
</P>
<P>
   3 - 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 1 hour, 35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A well-researched, affectionate tribute to
baseball's first Jewish slugging star, illuminating sports and
cultural history.

 &HT;    'GOING POSTAL' A BAD RAP FOR POSTAL SERVICE, STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Postal Service employees are no more likely to ``go
postal'' than are other American workers, according to a national
workplace study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going postal is a myth, a bad rap,'' said Joseph Califano,
chairman of the U.S. Postal Service Commission on a Safe and Secure
Workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postal workers are no more likely to physically assault,
sexually harass or verbally abuse their co-workers than (are)
employees in the national workforce,'' said Califano. ``Postal
employees are only a third as likely as workers in the national
workforce to be victims of homicide at work.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, Califano said these findings are the
result of ``the most comprehensive survey ever'' of job site
violence. The two-year, $4 million, independent study was
commissioned by the Postal Service after several highly publicized
shootings by disturbed postal workers. The incidents _ such as a
1986 massacre in the Edmond, Okla., post office when letter carrier
Patrick Henry Sherrill killed 14 co-workers before shooting himself
_ made ``going postal'' a slang term for getting irrationally angry
or violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 'going postal' is meant to suggest that postal employees
are more violent than the national workforce, it is simply
untrue,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the study debunked the notion of postal workers as
teetering on the brink of insane violence, it lent some credence to
the TV stereotypes of malcontent letter carriers Newman on
``Seinfeld'' and Cliff on ``Cheers.'' Postal workers have more
negative attitudes about work than those in the overall job force,
the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Postal employees were twice as likely as other workers to say
they would change jobs for the same pay and benefits. They were
more likely to file grievances and less confident in management's
fairness and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, many postal workers seem to have bought into the
``going postal'' perception. Postal workers are almost six times
likelier than those in the national workforce to believe that they
are at risk from workplace violence from co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a post office ``is one of the safest places in
America'' to work or visit, said Califano, a former Secretary of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Postmaster General William Henderson said he was glad the study
had disproved the perceptions that postal workers were more prone
to violence. But he conceded that the findings were not of ``a
clean bill of health'' for the service.
</P>
<P>
   He said a recommendation to ``overhaul the dispute resolution
system'' will be considered in negotiations with postal service
unions.
</P>
<P>
   As of last April, when the report's researchers completed their
task, Postal Service employees had 126,000 grievances awaiting
arbitration. ``This level of grievance activity appears unmatched
in the public or private sectors,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, in the entire auto industry, only 11 grievances
reached arbitration in 1998. However, with 900,000 employees, the
Postal Service has more than twice as many workers as the auto
industry's 400,000. The Postal Service is the nation's second
largest civilian employer, behind only Wal-Mart, said Califano, who
is president of the National Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   The commission examined 29 incidents of workplace homicide
involving postal workers as either victims or killers from 1986 to
1999. They found 15 postal employees killed 34 postal employees and
19 outsiders killed 14 postal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Such violence had prompted Henderson to analyze the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go to one more postal facility and explain
why some father or mother was murdered,'' the he said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the homicide rates at postal
facilities were considerably lower than in other workplaces. In
major industries, the highest rate of 2.1 homicides per 100,000
workers was in retail trade _ which includes convenience stores,
which are often targets for armed robbers. The next highest rate of
l.66 was in public administration, which includes police officers.
The homicide rate for postal workers was .26 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous occupation was taxi drivers and chauffeurs,
with a homicide rate of 31.54 per 100,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The 249-page report is based on an analysis of data from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, surveys of 12,000 postal employees and
3,000 employees in the national workforce, and more than 300
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that postal workers ``resent the phrase
and the image'' of ``going postal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some employees say they are embarrassed to tell people where
they work because of the violent stereotype,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ One in 20 American workers was physically assaulted on the job
in the past year _ about the same rate for postal workers as
others.
</P>
<P>
   _ About one in six workers were sexually harassed on the job _
14 percent for postal workers compared to 16 percent overall.
</P>
<P>
   _ About one in three workers said they were verbally abused on
the job _ 36 percent of postal workers, 33 percent overall.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that 14 of the 15 postal workers who committed
homicides had histories of violence, mental illness, substance
abuse or criminal convictions. It recommended that the agency
screen job applicants more carefully for potential violence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the American workplace, the level of violence is
``unacceptably high,'' said Califano.

 &HT;    UM's high expectations energize mellow Dorsey
 &HT;    By Jorge Milian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Ken Dorsey's career at the University of Miami nearly
ended before it began.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a restaurant just over the California border into
Arizona one year ago, Maggie Dorsey looked up from her meal and
noticed her son's face plunged deep into his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Dorseys were one day into a five-day, cross-country trip
from their home in Orinda, Calif., to the UM campus when a wave of
doubt and homesickness struck the 18-year-old quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know mom, I don't know if I've made the right decision
going so far away,'' said Dorsey, his voice quivering. ``I'm going
to be a million miles from my friends, my family, everyone and
everything that I know. Did I do the right thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Dorsey assured her son that he had, but if further
affirmation is needed, just ask UM offensive coordinator Larry
Coker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where we'd be without Kenny Dorsey,'' Coker said.
</P>
<P>
   Probably not ranked No. 5, which is where the Hurricanes begin
the season tonight against Division I-AA McNeese State in the
Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   When Kenny Kelly unexpectedly left UM in January to sign a pro
baseball contract, the Hurricanes were in a lurch. Dorsey was the
only other scholarship quarterback on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   But Dorsey had played so well in three starts last season as a
freshman that voters in the AP poll gave the Hurricanes their
highest pre-season ranking in Butch Davis' six seasons as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Subbing for an injured Kelly in November, Dorsey completed
64-of-91 passes for 718 yards (.703 percent), nine touchdowns and
one interception while leading the Hurricanes to three consecutive
victories and their highest three-game point total (155) in school
history.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly returned in mid-December and took over the starting job
for the Gator Bowl, where he struggled before being replaced by
Dorsey in the second half of Miami's 28-13 victory against Georgia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Still, skeptics claimed Dorsey did most of his damage against a
collection of powder puffs. While Kelly made starts against four
teams ranked in the top 10, Dorsey confronted Big East
cellar-dwellers Temple (55-0) and Rutgers (55-0) as well as
struggling Syracuse (45-13).
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are people that have no idea what college football is
all about,'' Dorsey said. ``They weren't the elite teams that Kenny
played against, but they were good teams. I choose not to listen
(to the skeptics).''
</P>
<P>
   It's about the only subject that will get a rise out of Dorsey,
who is mellower than a James Taylor album.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey spends most of his free time watching cartoons and
describes himself as ``boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of those who know him best disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real laid-back,'' said UM offensive tackle Bryant
McKinnie, one of Dorsey's closest friends on the team. ``Kenny
doesn't come out that often. We have to drag him out. He doesn't
like to cause conflict so he comes out to please us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dorsey: ``I love being lazy. I'm probably going to be 300
pounds when I get older.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the wrong impression. Dorsey is no slacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fiercely competitive,'' said Maggie Dorsey, a retired
phone company employee. ``When he was little, he would get very
upset if he didn't play well. He wouldn't say anything, but he
would get this look that told you he was angry.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't often that Dorsey didn't play well at Miramonte High
School. In two seasons, he passed for 4,968 yards and 52 touchdowns
while leading Miramonte to a pair of area championships. He lost
only twice at Miramonte, with both defeats coming on missed extra
points after Dorsey-led comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the field, I'm a lot more intense,'' said Dorsey, who
picked UM over Tennessee and Southern California. ``Sometimes you
can't see it because of my demeanor. That's something that people
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Blades, UM's hard-hitting free safety, is one of those
people. Upon first meeting Dorsey, Blades didn't know what to make
of the rail-thin and peach-fuzzed 6-foot-5, 170-pound freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at him . . . he's thin, no muscles and he's quiet,''
Blades said. ``You might think he's scared, that if you hit him one
time, he might curl up and not want to play anymore. But he's a
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to talk trash to him. He won't talk it back, but he
takes the ball and shows you. It's like he's telling you, 'You can
talk, but I'm going to do my job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey's job this season is simple: Stay healthy. The Hurricanes
are deep with talent, but Dorsey's backups include Ethenic Sands, a
converted wideout with no college quarterback experience, walk-on
Troy Prasek and first-year players Derrick Crudup and T.J. Prunty.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey's intense off-season workout program boosted his weight
to 193 pounds, but, as Davis said, ``He's still not going to win
any He-Man poster awards.''
</P>
<P>
   A bigger concern than size may be Dorsey's ability to handle the
pressure that comes with renewed expectations at UM. He is the
youngest starting quarterback among teams ranked in the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a lot of pride in being a true sophomore and being able
to play at this level,'' Dorsey said. ``I feel like there's no
reason I shouldn't produce and help this team win. A lot of teams
are going to look at that and say, 'Yeah, he's inexperienced so
we'll throw a million different things at him and do as much as we
can to confuse him.' I welcome those challenges.''

 &HT;    'Safe haven' changes Bullard's life
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ When Thaddeus Bullard walked into the
Florida Sheriffs Boys Ranch cafeteria for the first time, he stood
about 6-feet-1, weighed about 175 pounds and was palming a
basketball in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Bouchard, then residence director of the boys ranch, was
expecting a troubled 13-year-old, but this person didn't fit the
description of a typical rising ninth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought some college kid had come in,'' said Bouchard, now
president of the Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches.
</P>
<P>
   But this big, strong boy was Bullard, a child who had just
arrived from Boynton Beach. He, his family and local law
enforcement officials all had agreed he needed help growing up. His
mom hated sending him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do,'' said
Daria Bullard, a customer service representative. ``He was getting
in trouble at school and being hard-headed at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son agreed, although he still can't explain why he had such
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a bad kid with a really bad temper. I got into fights
and had an attitude,'' he said. ``We just needed to find an
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   They found one about 350 miles north at the 3,300-acre boys
ranch near Live Oak. It was a place that changed Bullard's life. It
became his home and his second family.
</P>
<P>
   Without it, he doubts he would be a University of Florida
graduate. He would not be the school's student body vice president.
He would not be a starting defensive end for the Gators. He isn't
sure what he would be without that ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day and probably to the day I die, I will argue with
anyone about that being one of the best programs in the country,''
Bullard said. ``It's a safe haven. People get the impression it's
like a prison. It's not true. There are no bars, no fences.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is structure at the voluntary intervention center.
Administrators fill nearly every minute of every day for the 70-80
boys living at the ranch at any one time. They rotate chores in
their cottages and must get jobs for spending money. They must go
to school, do homework and keep their grades up if they want to
play sports.
</P>
<P>
   That was Bullard's biggest motivation, Bouchard said. His study
habits were poor and staff members had to make sure he completed
his work. They also worked hard to teach Bullard how to handle his
temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful. He about wore us all out,'' Bouchard said. ``He
was 13 years old, but physically he was larger than most of the
adults there. He had learned to get his way through bullying other
people because his physical presence was so intimidating.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard eventually improved his demeanor enough that he could
have gone home, but he never did. He attended Suwannee High in Live
Oak for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more than 10 percent of the kids we work with stay all the
way through high school,'' Bouchard said. ``With Thaddeus, he had a
lot of things he had to work through and even after he was doing
well in the program, he was so involved in athletics and the school
he just really didn't want to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as a high school senior, Bullard left the ranch at
administrators' urging so he could be more independent. He moved in
with then-Suwannee County school superintendent Charles Blalock and
his family, who had become friends.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Bullard also racked up athletic awards and
recognition. He was named a Parade All-America and second-team USA
Today All-America and was wooed by FSU, Ohio State and Tennessee
before choosing Florida. He looked forward to playing close to his
family and his Live Oak home.
</P>
<P>
   But as a freshman, he faced more difficulties. The NCAA
clearinghouse questioned his test scores and he was forced to
withdraw from school as a freshman. It was 1996, the year of UF's
first and only national title. He sat in the stands each week with
a different batch of recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to just sit there and watch every game,'' Bullard
said. ``But as time went on, I thought this might have even been
the best thing that happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard agrees that it was just part of the maturation process
for Bullard. In high school he had learned about handling his
temper. As a college freshman, he discovered football accolades and
physical prowess don't solve life's problems, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw how life might be after football,'' Bullard said. ``I
learned, don't take advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Since first playing in 1997, however, he's had to remember that.
He's had lots of playing time (750 plays) but hasn't become a star.
He made 39 career tackles and 27 so-called big plays but has
started just twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done as much on the field as I've wanted, but I hope
to change that this fall,'' said Bullard, who now is 6-4 and 263
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bullard earned a sociology degree in the spring and now is
taking graduate classes in higher education. He was elected student
body vice president and spends time juggling school, political
responsibilities and football, along with some charitable works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been real proud of him. He's developed a real sense to
give back to kids,'' Bouchard said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a long way from the big kid Bouchard met a decade ago and
remembers sitting with so ma
</P>
<P>
   ny late nights, telling him people would say things he didn't
like for the rest of his life but ``it's up to you how you handle
that.''

 &HT;    Dolphins have to go back a long way for evidence of a big play
 &HT;    By Todd Archer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Dan Marino would give a look. Mark Clayton or Mark
Duper would knowingly nod. The cornerback had no idea what was
about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Ten touchdown passes in that 1984 season were for more than 34
yards. Marino set NFL records for yards passing (5,084) and
touchdowns (48). Clayton and Duper made it to the Pro Bowl. Marino
had 57 completions of 50 yards or more in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The longest pass the Dolphins completed in the exhibition games
went for 39 yards from Jim Druckenmiller to Nate Jacquet.
Druckenmiller is out of football now, and Jacquet was traded to San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Fiedler will be making the second start of his career Sunday
against Seattle. The longest pass he has completed in a
regular-season game is for 25 yards, although he and Jimmy Smith
connected for a 70-yard pass in Jacksonviille's 62-7 playoff
victory against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't simulate game situations as much in practice, but
we're working at it,'' Fiedler said. ``We've thrown the deep ball
for conditioning after practices the last few days. It helps us
work on the timing with the wide receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty passes last season went for 25 yards or more. Damon
Huard's 69-yard pass for a touchdown to Tony Martin was the
Dolphins' longest play from scrimmage. The three deep threats _
Martin, Bert Emanuel and Leslie Shepherd _ have been on the
receiving end of touchdowns of 99, 85 and 73 yards, respectively,
in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has his own style,'' Emanuel said. ``The most
important thing is that it's there. That he drops it in a bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice in practice Sunday, Emanuel said Fiedler threw perfect
deep passes down the sideline to Shepherd and Martin where the
defensive back didn't have a chance to make a play on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to keep throwing it and keep throwing it and keep
throwing it,'' Shepherd said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiedler's hip injury kept him out of practice for three weeks,
denying him the chance to develop a chemistry with his wide
receivers. In the exhibition season finale against New Orleans,
Fiedler's first pass traveled 24 yards to Martin. Emanuel caught a
17-yard pass. Oronde Gadsden caught an 18-yard pass.
</P>
<P>
   The running game, which looked good in the exhibition season,
will help the deep ball. If the Dolphins can move the ball on the
ground, then teams will have to bring a safety up to the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best scenario,'' Gadsden said. ``Teams are going to
have to come after an inexperienced quarterback. If they bring a
lot of people up, then we're going to hit them. That's what you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey's offense calls for a lot of short, crossing passes
and intermediate routes that sometimes result in long passes. Troy
Aikman threw touchdown passes for 90 and 76 yards last year in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, St. Louis' Kurt Warner came to closest to a
Marino-type season, earning NFL Most Valuable Player honors with 41
touchdown passes. He threw the ball all over the field to wideouts
Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt and Az Hakim.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is trust,'' Emanuel said. ``Jay is the type of guy
if he sees one-on-one coverage, he's going to take advantage of it.
He will allow us as a wide receivers to make plays. He's
aggressive, which I like. Sometimes it takes a gutsy throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiedler will have to make the throw at some point. In the past,
that would have led to the Marino look, the Marks Brothers' nod and
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   This year?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a whole lot of film to refer back to in the
pre-season,'' coach Dave Wannstedt said. ``We're going to have to
work on it in practice, like we do, and make them count when we get
the opportunities in the game.''

FOR HARRY BROWNE, LESS IS BETTER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By J.R. Labbe 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Browne doesn't have a double-wide's chance in a F-5
tornado of making it into the White House in January, but that
doesn't mean that the Libertarian Party's presidential candidate
can't shake things up during the campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government has made a mess of everything it has
moved into in the 20th century,'' Browne said during a telephone
interview this week. ``And it's moved into thousands of things it
has no constitutional basis for meddling in.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus is delineated the candidate's bottom line: If you want
smaller government, he's the only real choice on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Republicans talk a good game about the desire for
smaller government, but the GOP's candidate is charging headlong
into areas that have traditionally been the bailiwick of the
Democrats, such as more federal involvement in education.
</P>
<P>
   The functions of the federal government should be expressly
limited to those outlined in the Constitution, Browne contends, and
nowhere does it say the feds should be messing in education, health
care, welfare, law enforcement and the retirement business.
</P>
<P>
   About the only areas specified in the Constitution are national
defense, the federal judiciary, the federal mint and the Postal
Service.
</P>
<P>
   And even those areas are being mismanaged, contends the
67-year-old resident of Franklin, Tenn. Take the Defense
Department, which Browne calls ``the post office in fatigues.'' It
wasn't meant as a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a national offense, not a national defense,'' Browne
said. ``Our military is overextended in almost 100 locations around
the globe, meddling in other people's affairs and making the world
a more dangerous place, yet we have a very vulnerable national
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the United States needs is a missile defense system and a
policy not to intervene in other people's affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   A former investment adviser and committed free-market advocate,
Browne proposes a nationwide contest among private corporations for
developing a missile defense system that will work _ something that
the Defense Department hasn't been able to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put up a reward of, say, $25 billion to the first company that
can produce a missile defense system that works,'' Browne said. Of
course, it would have to be demonstratively reliable, and if no one
can produce such a system, the American people are no worse off
than they are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beauty of the American market system _ whatever the
need, someone out there will step forward to fill it,'' Browne
said.
</P>
<P>
   Browne is so committed to smaller government that he refused to
accept the $750,000 federal campaign funds that he was eligible for
in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Browne confessed that even if the heavens were to align in such
a manner that he were elected, he'd be stifled in many areas by a
Congress ruled by representatives of the two major parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I'm elected, it will be purely because the people want
smaller government. Congress couldn't ignore that reality,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Congress blocked him at every turn, Browne said
there are still actions he could take to make a difference for
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tear out pages of agencies' ridiculous rules, pardon
all nonviolent drug offenders in federal prisons'' _ he promises to
do that the first day in office _ ``bring the troops home, banish
affirmative action programs within the federal government, disarm
the guards on Capitol Hill until such time as Congress repeals all
federal gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll re-arm the guards the day Congress guarantees Americans
the unequivocal right to defend themselves. Those laws put us at a
disadvantage, not the criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Browne isn't everyone's cup of tea. His views
will especially rankle that portion of America that has grown
dependent on federal programs, the people who view life through a
lens of entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   But his voice is one that needs to be heard. It would be a loss
to the American people not to see and hear him during the
presidential debates. Line 'em all up _ Bush, Gore, Nader, Buchanan
and Browne _ and let the voters hear what they have to say.
</P>
<P>
   Browne's a realist. He knows he won't be moving to 1600
Pennsylvania Ave. in 2001. Victory for him would be to break out a
million votes.
</P>
<P>
   That would be double the votes he got when he ran in 1996, but
he's optimistic that he can do it. He's running a campaign based on
ideas that many Americans are hungry to hear.

   OLD BARBIE DOLLS MAY CONTAIN TOXIC CHEMICALS, by Suzanne Leigh
</P>
<P>
   Next time you feel like letting your daughter play with your old
Barbie dolls _ don't.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that old vinyl toys made with certain
plasticizers can disrupt the body's delicate endocrine system,
causing damage to the ovaries and testes and interference with
sperm production.
</P>
<P>
   Plasticizers known as phthalates are added to vinyl toys like
dolls, pacifiers and rattles to make them flexible. The phthalates
used in toys made in the 1950s, such as early Barbie dolls, have
been known to ooze out as they decay, according to Yvonne Shashoua,
a conservation scientist speaking at the recent national meeting of
the American Chemical Society in Washington, D.C. (450 words)

   WESTERN WILDFIRES CAUSING WIDESPREAD LUNG DAMAGE, by Neil
Sherman
</P>
<P>
   The 84 fires burning across 6.2 million acres in 11 western
states are also taking their toll on people's lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Those with asthma, heart disease or chronic lung disease are at
increased risk from the 500-mile, ash-filled smoke plume that's
spread across Montana, the Dakotas and Iowa, health officials say.
And while the smoke is no serious long-term threat to healthy
Westerners, scratchy throats, runny noses, difficulty in breathing,
headaches and irritated sinuses seem as much a part of the
landscape as Montana's burning, and now famous Bitterroot Valley.

   `GENETIC' DECAF MAY TASTE THE SAME AS REGULAR COFFEE, by Nicolle
Charbonneau
</P>
<P>
   Sick of decaf coffee or tea that's got no jitters but tastes
like dishwater? Take heart _ in the future, you may be able to grab
a brew with all the taste but without a trace of caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   British and Japanese researchers report that it may be possible
to grow coffee and tea plants that miss two tiny genetic steps in
the biosynthesis of caffeine, potentially producing full-flavored
decaffeinated brews without using the toxic solvent or fluid
extraction techniques that remove caffeine. (600 words)

   NEW HOPE FOR RELIEF FROM PAIN SYNDROME, by Edward Edelson
</P>
<P>
   It's a condition that can be painful enough to drive some
patients to suicide, so hard to define that even its name is in
question and so hard to treat that even studies involving a handful
of patients warrant publication in a major medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   It is reflex sympathetic dystrophy, RSD, classified as a rare
disease because officially fewer than 200,000 Americans are
believed to suffer from it. Two new studies in the New England
Journal of Medicine describe promising studies on treatment of the
pain and dystonia of RSD. Both studies were done in the
Netherlands, but the treatments are available in the United States.

   OSTEO DRUG HELPS BUILD MEN'S BONES, TOO, by Adam marcus
</P>
<P>
   Men with osteoporosis can boost their bone density and cut their
risk of fractures with a drug approved to treat the crippling
condition in women.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year study by international researchers showed that men
who used the drug alendronate had stronger skeletons and suffered
fewer broken bones than those who didn't get the therapy, according
to the study, which appears in the New England Journal of Medicine.

&HT;     HOUSING OFFICIAL DESCRIBES BRIBERY SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LANCE WILLIAMS and CHUCK FINNIE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A former San Francisco Housing Authority
official testified in federal court that she earned a salary of
$52,000 while taking thousands of dollars in bribes to provide
clients with government rent subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Section 8 subsidies for poor people, Yolanda
Jones told a U.S. District Court jury on Wednesday that on a
typical workday, ``I went out and sold Section 8s.''
</P>
<P>
   The subsidies amount to as much as $1,000 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 39, spent three years as city relocation specialist,
which ended when she left on a workers' compensation claim in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who also is known as Yolanda Bradley, is the daughter of
Hunters Point trucker Charlie Walker, a friend and former law
client of Mayor Willie Brown. She is the self-described goddaughter
of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   She has emerged as a star government witness in the corruption
trial of her boss, longtime Housing Authority official Patricia
Williams, a $72,000-per-year executive accused of masterminding a
lucrative bribery scheme that, Jones testified, occupied most of
Jones' time as a city employee.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has pleaded guilty to 10 counts of conspiracy and bribery
in connection with the alleged scheme, in which she and Williams
allegedly charged tenants as much as $2,500 to create a bogus paper
trail entitling them to rent subsidies that are supposed to go only
to eligible poor people.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, testifying Wednesday, was matter-of-fact about her own
activities. ``I had to take responsibility for my wrong,'' she told
the jury.
</P>
<P>
   But she said none of it could have happened without Williams,
57, whom she described as a greedy and corrupt boss who happily
accepted bribe money ``at home, at the store, McDonald's,
wherever.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who faces as many as 12 years in federal prison, has
pleaded not guilty. Wednesday, she listened intently and took notes
as Jones was questioned by prosecutor John Hemann.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jones' story, she and her boss cooked up the
bribery scheme in 1996 at a time when the city was demolishing or
remodeling five big public housing projects, forcing thousands of
poor people to move at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Tenants dislocated by the upheaval were offered either places in
other public housing projects, or Section 8 subsidies to help them
rent apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Jones described the relocation process as chaos. Because of lax
procedures and the city's rush to move the tenants, it was obvious
that many people who didn't even live in the projects were
receiving aid, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a man who had been sleeping in a tent in the
parking lot of the Hayes Valley project was approved for aid as a
displaced tenant, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the relocations, Jones said that an old
acquaintance, Tracy Baker, who is a niece of the football legend
O.J. Simpson, had approached her and offered a bribe in exchange
for a Section 8 certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she had taken the idea to Williams, who as relocation
manager had the power to make such a thing happen.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Williams liked the idea. They charged Baker $1,500 to
qualify her for Section 8 certificates, splitting the bribe money
between them, she testified. After that, they took $1,500 from
Baker's sister to get her Section 8 vouchers, as well.
</P>
<P>
   And after that, Jones said, they were off, taking bribes from as
many as two dozen other people.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she had recruited tenants, and Williams had provided
phony addresses in the projects awaiting demolition.
</P>
<P>
   The tenants were then instructed to swear out false affidavits
saying that they had lived at the fake address, and also were told
to supply birth certificates and other identification. Jones said
she would deliver the package _ and half the bribe money _ to
Williams, who would walk the paperwork through.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Williams had set the prices, charging $1,000 for a
public housing unit and as much as $2,500 for Section 8 vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of her plea agreement, Jones won't be sentenced
until after Williams' trial concludes. Testimony continues Thursday
before Judge Charles Legge.

 &HT;    ONCE TRAILING, GORE EXUDES A NEW CONFIDENCE AS RACE ENTERS
STRETCH
 &HT;    Eds: Can be twinned with story slugged BUSH.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 3
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Vice President Al Gore is right where he wants to
be in his race for the White House with Texas Gov. George W. Bush _
ahead or dead even in most polls, with voters increasingly
demanding substance over style, issues over personality.
</P>
<P>
   And with the traditional Labor Day start of the general election
campaign, Gore is following a strategy that not only has erased the
double digit lead Bush held in the polls less than a month ago, but
also has dramatically altered the rules of engagement between the
two presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than try to match the Bush charm offensive, Gore has
drawn the governor into the more treacherous terrain of comparison
politics, offering a long list of specific policy proposals and
challenging his opponent to ``put up or shut up'' with his own set
of proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has taken the bait, at least on the potentially potent
issue of providing prescription drug benefits under the
federally-funded Medicare health care plan for seniors. In response
to Gore's challenge, Bush plans to put forth a detailed
prescription plan this week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used an issues-laden club to dispatch former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, his sole opponent, in the Democratic
presidential primaries. But there is no guarantee it will work on
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let Al Gore do to Governor Bush what he did
to Bill Bradley,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Don Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is always the prospect that Gore could slip
back into the attack dog style that he finds so comfortable in the
clutch. It's a style he recently admitted ``probably did'' turn off
voters earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the whole nature'' of the presidential campaign has
changed in the month since both candidates formally accepted their
party nominations, said Thomas Mann, an analyst at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``can no longer just give the back of his hand to a
discussion of the issues,'' Mann added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's travels, speeches and advertising in the weeks since
accepting the Democratic Party's presidential nomination suggest
why.
</P>
<P>
   They also reveal the broad contours of the game plan Gore
intends to follow in the weeks ahead. It is a general election
strategy that:
</P>
<P>
   - Targets the swing states of the industrial Midwest in order to
reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   - Ties Bush down in several Southern states, notably Florida and
Georgia, and perhaps splits what has been a solidly Republican area
of the country in presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   - Woos working family voters, especially younger married women
who don't have college degrees and disillusioned younger voters,
with populist rhetoric .
</P>
<P>
   - Emphasizes domestic issues, such as targeted tax cuts, health
care, education, Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   - Involves TV ads that retell Gore's life story, contrasting his
Vietnam military service, family life and pre-politics career in
journalism with Bush's less directed youth.
</P>
<P>
   - Attacks Bush's record in Texas, especially on the environment,
education and health care for children .
</P>
<P>
   - Anticipates a powerful performance by Gore in the October
debates.
</P>
<P>
   - Relies on grassroots get-out-the-vote efforts by labor and
activist groups that promote abortion rights, civil rights and
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   - Limits President Clinton's role to fund-raising, appearances
before core Democratic constituencies and helping his wife Hillary
in her Senate campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race is right where we want it to be,'' said Mark Fabiani,
a senior Gore official at the campaign headquarters in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that we were right on the issues and that
once the voters started focusing on the issues, that they would see
that Al Gore stands with the people and not the powerful,'' said
Chris Lehane, Gore's traveling press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the year, Gore has trailed Bush in national
polls, largely as a result of Bush persuading voters that he would
do a better job in handling government functions that typically
have favored Democrats _ most notably education, Social Security
and health care.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest Gallup Poll results, which were released last
Thursday, show that Gore now leads Bush by 10 points or more on all
three issues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Gallup Poll shows that Gore has wiped out the
19 point lead Bush once held on cutting taxes, the cornerstone
issue of the Bush campaign. Forty-seven percent said Gore would do
a better job on taxes, 43 percent favored Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unprecedented economic growth of the last eight
years, Gore is trying to tap into the discontent of ``working
families'' _ those who are not necessarily better off than they
were when the Clinton-Gore administration took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He is appealing especially to younger, white married women with
families who did not attend college. Gore pollster Stan Greenberg
describes this group as ``financially squeezed, even in the strong
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   These women are also ``fairly traditional in terms of values,''
according to Greenberg, and are likely to find Gore's family ties
and running mate Joe Lieberman's religious faith appealing.
</P>
<P>
   To further appeal to these women and their families, Gore is
offering not only federal income tax cuts targeted to the middle
class, but also expanded government services, such as quality
preschool.
</P>
<P>
   He also has proposed tax credits for college tuition for middle
class families and new opportunities for health care coverage for
working families unable to afford insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But even the issues aimed at older voters are presented by Gore
in terms of how they benefit the entire family.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida last week, for instance, the vice president cast his
enhanced Medicare prescription drug coverage as a ``family value''
and one that relieves middle class families of some of the expense
of elderly relative's health problems.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that Gore pitched his prescription plan so
hard in Florida, a state with a heavy elderly population and 25
electoral votes. And it is not surprising that Gore is kicking off
his Labor Day week of campaigning in Pennsylvania, another state
with a large elderly population and 23 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is that Gore is competitive in Florida and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brother Jeb is governor of Florida and, consequently, the
state was once viewed as out of reach for Gore. But the state's
senior population and hotly contested race to replace retiring GOP
Sen. Connie Mack has given Gore a strategic opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is a real Achilles' heal for the Republicans,'' said
Tad Devine, a senior Gore strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Pennsylvania once was widely regarded as a sure thing
for Bush if he chose the state's governor, Tom Ridge, as his
running mate. But Bush passed over Ridge, a supporter of abortion
rights, and instead chose former Wyoming congressman Dick Cheney, a
staunch opponent of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, Gore is following the same strategy as
Clinton in finding the right combination of states to reach the 270
electoral votes needed to win the White House: carry California and
the Northeast, pick off a few key Southern states and battle it out
in the pivotal industrial Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Gore has solidified his lead in California and
New York, which represent 87 electoral votes. He believes he is
competitive in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Louisiana,
although his home state of Tennessee is closer than he would like.
And he has wiped out Bush leads in such important Midwestern states
as Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton carried most of the Midwestern states in 1992 and 1996,
but Gore has had trouble breaking through in the region, largely
due to the free trade policies of the administration and the
president's impeachment-related troubles.
</P>
<P>
   But union leaders in the Midwest are warming to Gore. The United
Auto Workers finally endorsed him just before the Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   And since declaring himself his ``own man'' and stepping out
from Clinton's shadow, the vice president has surged ahead in the
polls in Michigan, one of the most important states in the Gore
electoral strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's finally cut the umbilical cord with Bill Clinton,'' said
Lansing-based pollster Ed Sarpolus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Gore campaign views the election as close, one in
which most voters will not make up their minds until the final two
weeks of the campaign. Consequently, Gore strategists view the
debates scheduled in October as crucial to the vice president, a
fierce debater.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is still unclear whether the debates, as set by the
Presidential Commission on Debates, will take place.

 &HT;    `Soul' possesses a muddy, multiple personality
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few things can be said with certainty about ``Soul Possessed,''
the Debbie Allen dance drama opening the Alliance Theatre's
2000-2001 season. It apparently wants to be deeply mystical, but
the results are deeply mystifying. It can be safely stated,
however, that the show:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Is about a woman in love with two men, and heartbroken about
it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Is set in a timeless version of Louisiana bayou country.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Contains terrific dancers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Features one of them as ``Death,'' who with his bare torso,
skintight leather pants and endless writhing resembles a
Chippendale stripper with the world's worst crick in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these observations, we enter heavy fog. The bayou country
is indeed fascinating by virtue of its many cultures and religions,
its mix of the graceful and the raw, but Allen _ as writer,
director and choreographer _ overloads it with dissonant dance
styles and religious references.
</P>
<P>
   There's no cohesive vision or tone. Instead of flavorful,
indigenous music we get the urban-contemporary, FM-radio sound of
co-composers Allen and James Ingram, which has about as much
cultural authenticity as an L.A. sound stage.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: There's more to cooking gumbo than throwing everything
in the kitchen at the pot.
</P>
<P>
   The evening does benefit from striking, elegant leads. Tai
Jimenez is Ysabel, the willowy, high-spirited bride-to-be. Destan
Owens is Luke, her distinguished but somewhat aloof betrothed.
Carmen de Lavallade is the icy mother-in-law-to-be who dismisses
Ysabel with a haughty toss of her regal head. Miguel Angel _
although he sounds uncomfortable with his few lines of dialogue _
is the soulful, handsome drifter who tempts Ysabel away from her
wedding preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Allen strives for originality, then trips up by trying to give
the tale a spiritual dimension, always tricky in popular musical
theater. Beyond the art form's built-in challenge, it's hard to
decipher what Allen is really trying to say, spiritually.
</P>

Square massacre are suing Li Peng, the second highest-ranking

abuses, the first time that such a legal action has been taken
against a Chinese official. The lawsuit was filed on Monday. Among
the five plaintiffs are Wang Dan, a prominent student dissident who
organized talks at Beijing University, and Zhang Liming, whose
sister was killed by a single bullet in the chaotic early morning
hours of June 4, 1989. Li, the head of China's parliament, was
attending a conference of world leaders at the United Nations this
week and was served with a court summons early Thursday morning at

TRIAL OF INDONESIA'S EX-PRESIDENT SIDETRACKED BY HIS CLAIM OF
ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ By calling in sick on the first day of his
corruption trial, Indonesia's former leader, Suharto, has put up
another hurdle to this country's tortuous effort to come to terms
with its past.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors said Thursday that they would plow ahead
with their prosecution of Suharto on charges that he siphoned about
$590 million in state funds through several charitable foundations
under his control when he was president.
</P>
<P>
   But with the trial adjourned until Sept. 14 _ and then only to
hear testimony from doctors who declared Suharto unfit to attend
the opening session Thursday _ it is far from clear that the
79-year-old former president will ever stand in the dock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suharto will never be convicted,'' said A.M. Fatwa, a member
of parliament, as he stalked angrily out of the courtroom. ``This
is only a game, a conspiracy between the politicians and lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, for a hushed moment after the judge asked whether the
defendant was present, there was palpable drama in the courtroom.
To hear Suharto's name read out in a criminal case was a momentous
event in a country where for three decades he was synonymous with
untold wealth and unassailable power.
</P>
<P>
   When the judge's question was met with silence, the 300
spectators in the cavernous courtroom booed half-heartedly, like
people who had hoped for more but did not expect to get it.
Outside, a small crowd of rain-soaked protestors called for Suharto
to be brought to justice, by force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does not come in two weeks, I will drag him to the court
myself,'' said Bambang Dwi, a 23-year-old student at the Institute
of Technology in Jakarta, who held a megaphone over his head to
ward off the downpour.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Given the judgment of Suharto's doctors, it is not clear the
government can compel him to attend. Attorney General Marsuki
Darusman says the former president cannot be tried in absentia, so
the two sides are in a standoff.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the prosecutors have asked for an independent panel of
doctors to examine Suharto. His own doctors say he suffers from a
number of ailments including heart trouble, hypertension, and
diabetes. They say that Suharto, who has had three strokes, has
lost his memory and ability to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client is not in a position to defend himself,'' said Juan
Felix Tampubolon, Suharto's chief lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto may be unable to mount a defense, but he has mobilized
an army of lawyers and doctors to do it for him. Twenty-three
doctors gathered Thursday morning to examine Suharto at his house
here. Later, more than 100 police officers took up positions to
protect the house from demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto tried to wrap his dealings in a cloak of legitimacy. In
the 45-page indictment, he is accused of issuing presidential
decrees that funneled hundreds of millions of dollars from state
banks, companies, and even employees into his seven charitable
organizations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a 1995 decree, Suharto ordered the government to transfer 2
percent of the total revenue from taxes paid by Indonesian
companies into one of the foundations. In another decree, he
ordered state-owned banks to contribute a chunk of their revenues
to two other foundations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Suharto then distributed the
proceeds _ nearly $600 million _ to firms controlled by his
children and friends. These accusations cover only a fraction of
the financial legerdemain that Suharto is accused of during his 32
years in power. But the government says it did not have enough
evidence to try Suharto on the broader charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to deal with the excesses of an
autocratic regime through democratic means,'' said H.S. Dillon, a
member of Indonesia's Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Although Indonesia is awash in trials and investigations these
days, protestors have channeled their passions into the Suharto
case. People here view the trial as the litmus test of the
government's campaign to cleanse Indonesia _ not just of
corruption, but of its legacy of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to find this man culpable, or you won't be able to
find all his cronies culpable,'' Dillon said. ``They will just say,
`We were acting on orders.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon acknowledged that Indonesia had made paltry progress so
far.
</P>
<P>
   While Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, authorized the
investigation of Suharto, he too has been implicated in two
Parliamentary investigations of misappropriated funds that seem an
echo of the Suharto era.
</P>
<P>
   There may more disappointment to come. On Friday, Darusman is
expected to disclose the names of officials who will prosecuted for
human rights abuses in East Timor, during the rampage that followed
last summer's referendum on independence for the former Indonesian
province.
</P>
<P>
   According to people who have seen the list, it does not include
two ranking military officers, retired Gen. Wiranto, who was
defense minister during that period, and the retired chief of
military intelligence, Gen. Zaki Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   While the 30 names do include the former regional military
commander and the former police commander, the lack of top-level
officials could sow doubts about how far Indonesia is willing to go
in assigning blame for the bloodshed that erupted in East Timor
while its troops were putatively keeping order.
</P>
<P>
   More doubts were raised by a recent amendment to Indonesia's
constitution that forbids individuals from being prosecuted under
laws that did not exist when their crimes were committed.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups protested that the amendment would allow military
officers accused of abuses in East Timor to claim immunity from
prosecution. The United Nations, which has so far held off
convening its own tribunal to investigate East Timor, said the
amendment might lead it to reconsider.

MEETING WITH IRANIAN LEGISLATORS, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BACK CLOSER
TIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ohio, N.Y.)   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A group of Iranian legislators, in New York for
a meeting of parliamentary speakers from around the world,
encountered some unusual guests at a reception on Wednesday evening
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art: Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and
Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, were there to open a dialogue with their
counterparts from a country with which the United States has no
direct relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went because I think it's very important to have a dialogue
with Iran, and the idea of parliamentarians meeting is one step
removed from government-to-government,'' Specter said in an
interview Thursday. ``I think it something that ought to be
promoted.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter, who said he had been trying to visit Iran since 1989,
after the end of the Iran-Iraq war, added: ``I've always had a
strong sense that if members of Congress met with foreign leaders
where our relations were not the best, we could open up the
dialogue and relations would improve. They ought to hear what we
think, and we ought to listen to what they think.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a chance encounter. The Iranian lawmakers had been
told by one of the reception's organizers, Hooshang Amirahmadi, who
is president of the American Iranian Council, to expect several
members of Congress and leaders of American Jewish groups concerned
about the recent espionage convictions of a group of Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Amirahmadi had invited the Americans, who included Rep. Gary L.
Ackerman, D-N.Y., and Rep. Eliot L. Engel, D-N.Y., and Malcolm
Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents
of Major American Jewish Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi Karroubi, speaker of the Iranian parliament and leader of
his delegation, told reporters Thursday that the conversations had
been cordial despite apprehensions on both sides. He said he had
told the congressmen of Iran's objections to the continuing U.S.
embargo and had raised other issues, like the denial of visas to
two members of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Karroubi is considered a compromise speaker who was chosen to
preside over a reformist parliament aligned with President Mohammad
Khatami against a very conservative Islamic hierarchy that has
tried to roll back changes. He is in New York to attend the first
international conference of legislative leaders, with delegates
from more than 150 countries. The meeting, organized by the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, is being held just before a summit
meeting of heads of government next week at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not supposed to have such talks during our visit to
the museum,'' Karroubi said. But he added that after an exchange of
pleasantries, the two sides got down to some tough questions on
issues that Karroubi said were ``poisoning relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said he had accepted the invitation because ``strong
messages have to be delivered to the Iranians.'' He said he had
seen very little action in Iran to give credence to reports of a
more moderate political climate. But he described the conversations
as ``extraordinary,'' in that the Iranians advocated more cultural
exchanges and dialogues between the people of the two countries.
Ackerman was also struck by the inclusion of a woman and the only
Jewish member of parliament in the five-member Iranian delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to show inclusiveness,'' Ackerman said,
interpreting the gesture as something of a response to ``the noise
we were making.''
</P>
<P>
   The sole Jewish member of the Iranian parliament, Mouris
Motamed, told reporters Thursday that he had tried to reassure the
Americans that the Jews in Iran _ down to between 25,000 to 30,000
from a high before the 1979 revolution of 80,000 to 100,000, he
said _ were living as well as their Muslim neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Motamed added, however, that it was reassuring to Iranian Jews
that others outside the country were concerned about their fate.
``Of course, we value this kind of solidarity, this sympathy that
exists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the reception, Ackerman said, he asked the Iranians to
consider how more formal exchanges of legislators could be
arranged, a request members of Congress made in a letter to Iran
this spring that was never answered. Motamed said Thursday that the
idea would be discussed, but would have to be presented first to
Khatami, who will be in New York next week for the summit talks.

THE ART GLASS OF MURANO SPARKLES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The renowned Murano glassmaking industry, on an
island in the Venetian lagoon, has gone through several
reincarnations since it was founded in 1291. Its last great period
began in 1921 and continued through the 1950s, and it is this era
that is now the focus of museum curators, gallery owners and
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, the idea of art glass really starts in the 20th
century in Murano,'' said Tina Oldknow, curator of contemporary
glass at the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y. In the 1920s
Murano's ancient guild system was infiltrated by outside artistic
talent, probably for the first time, and it revolutionized the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Three Manhattan exhibitions of 20th-century Murano glass are
coming up. ``Masters of Italian Glass: 1900-2000'' is at the Barry
Friedman Gallery, from Sept. 12 through Oct. 28. The American Craft
Museum will show Venetian glass from the collection of a New York
couple, Nancy Olnick and Giorgio Spanu, from Sept. 13 through Jan.
8. At the Corning Inc. Gallery at Steuben, ``Art and Design in
Italian Glass: The Steinberg Foundation Collection'' will run from
Nov. 6 through Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The frilly glass ``souvenir-johnnies'' that Americans have been
bringing home for a century _ glass seahorses and pastel
chandeliers _ are still made in Venice. But Murano art glass is a
different species: bigger, bolder, brighter, organic, often
asymmetrical and far more original.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, a dealer in 20th-century furniture, photography,
ceramics, silver and glass since 1967, began collecting
20th-century Murano glass in the early 1980s. ``There were no books
on the subject then,'' he said. He sold 60 pieces in 1986 and 1987,
he went on, because ``my son was born and I had no safe place to
put them.''
</P>
<P>
   He began buying again in the 1990s when ``the market for Italian
art glass was poor and the prices went way down,'' he said. In the
late 1990s the Murano market picked up; in 1996 an encyclopedic
show organized by the Kunstmuseum in Duesseldorf, Germany, traveled
to the Corning Museum and the Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum.
The show's catalog, ``Italian Glass: Murano-Milan, 1930-1970''
(Prestel Verlag, 1997), by Helmut Ricke, the director of the
Kunstmuseum, and Eva Schmitt, a glass scholar, has become a bible
for collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The modern art glass movement in Italy started about 1921, when
an enterprising Milanese lawyer, Paolo Venini, founded a new glass
company in Murano with a Venetian antiques dealer, Giacomo
Cappelin. ``Venini wanted to develop a modern style in glass, to
bring Murano into the new century,'' Oldknow said. ``Cappelin was
the local with all the contacts. Venini was an outsider from Milan
whose friends were post-World War I intelligentsia.''
</P>
<P>
   He hired a painter, Vittorio Zecchin, as his artistic director.
Zecchin opposed the decoration of glass. As Ricke writes:
``Venini's fundamental decision, which proved extremely hard to
impose on the island's proud master craftsmen, was undoubtedly the
renunciation of all those decorative curlicues and filigree-glass
fripperies.''
</P>
<P>
   Venini and Zecchin persuaded the blowers to produce vessels with
the clean lines and the classic proportions of Renaissance and
ancient Roman glass. Instead of pastels, Zecchin chose sober,
monochromatic hues. These vessels, far from being delicate, had
solidity and monumentality. It did not take long for the work to
gain popularity, beginning an in 1923 at the first International
Exhibition of Decorative Arts at Monza, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Artists often designed for different houses. Friedman is
selling, for $27,000, a piece from the 1920s that Zecchin designed
for Compagnia Venezia Murano: a large unembellished
amethyst-colored vase.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925 Venini hired the sculptor Napoleone Martinuzzi, who also
designed elegant modern vessels but introduced intense colors.
Friedman has a fire-engine red, handblown vase he designed for
Venini. It has a black band at the neck and base, and black glass
handles. The body is a brilliant red with gray specks incorporated
into the surface. The price is $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, Venini hired two Milanese architects, Tomoso Buzzi and
Carlo Scarpa. Scarpa (1906-1978) became one of the most important
Italian architects of the 20th century. He did interiors, furniture
for Simon International, lamps for Flos and exhibitions as well as
buildings. Friendly with Louis Kahn and Frank Lloyd Wright, he
taught architecture and industrial design.
</P>
<P>
   In glass, he was interested in surface and tactile values. He
mixed colorless glass with opaque, introducing colorful threads and
ribbons. He frosted glass, made it look ancient and corroded, cut
it and ground it in new ways. ``Scarpa was consciously looking back
at history,'' Oldknow said. ``Scarpa introduced new principles of
light and space into glass by using a variety of forms combined
with engraving techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman has a few Scarpa vases. One made by Venini around 1936,
called ``Carroso,'' is a hand-blown glass vase in iridescent dark
green and lavender. The surface has protruding irregular ribs that
resemble clouds. ``It's the only one I've ever seen,'' Friedman
said. It costs $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Scarpa pieces have surfaces like chipped wood. One has
facets cut like fish scales. Another has thin glass filaments
joined together, and the thin walls have been subtly carved. These
vessels remind you of the collaborative quality of art glass. Each
piece requires a designer, a master glass blower and a cutter.
</P>
<P>
   Buying art glass from Murano is tricky. Because certain models
were reissued and made by two or three generations of glass
blowers, they can be hard to date. Signatures matter, but not too
much.
</P>
<P>
   The Venini family sold the company in the 1980s to Royal
Copenhagen of Denmark, which continues to produce models, but in
different forms. ``They change the colors and proportions, so
Venini products are quite different from what they were when the
family controlled the company,'' Oldknow warned.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the art glass influenced other more commercial sectors
of the Murano glass industry. Web sites like antique-glass.co.uk
and circline.com offer anonymous 20th-century Murano vases and
decorative pieces for less than $1,500 apiece. Antiques shops like
Neo-Studio in Sag Harbor, N.Y., have midcentury unsigned Murano
lamps, bowls and vases for a few hundred dollars apiece. The
Manhattan galleries Primavera and the Gansevoort both have several
name pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Who is buying it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie people love Murano,'' said Jean-Yves Legrand, the
owner of Neo-Studio. Friedman said half of his customers were
European. ``Art dealers like Bruno Bischofberger and collectors of
contemporary art are the most serious collectors,'' he said. ``The
market is still evolving.''

   ``Monday Night Football'' kicks off its 31st regular season
tonight at 9 on ABC, as the Denver Broncos visit the St. Louis
Rams. The real test tonight, though, is for new ABC color man
Dennis Miller, who was the network's out-of-left-field choice to
take the third seat in the booth alongside Al Michaels and Dan
Fouts.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects Miller to return the festivities back to the days
of Howard Cosell and Dandy Don Meredith. But it would be nice for
ABC if he could at least make things entertaining. By itself, an
improved game schedule probably won't be enough to help ``Monday
Night Football'' stem the ratings decline that resulted in an
all-time low last season.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has had a couple of preseason games to warm up, and the
results have been mixed. He knows a lot about the game, as ABC
promised, and he's had moments of inspired wit. But he's obviously
been trying hard, and the great ones make it look effortless. If
he's going to truly find the groove, it'll start tonight.
</P>

   With the Sydney Olympics just over a week away, expect a lot of
shows to take a look at Australia. Likely to be among the best of
them is ``Australia: Beyond the Fatal Shore,'' a six-part
documentary by Time magazine art critic Robert Hughes, a native
Australian. It debuts tonight at 9 on most PBS stations. Hughes
wrote the bestselling history ``The Fatal Shore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond'' seems to mean a further linking of the disparate
elements of the culture, from the complex relationship between
whites and aborigines to the equally complex relationship between
whites and their own pleasure-seeking instincts. Hughes is good
company _ if this were a movie, Albert Finney might play him. This
may be more interesting than many of the Games themselves.

<P>
   Art museums are not what you think of first in connection with
the natural glories of Maine, but there are no fewer than seven
significant ones in this sparsely populated state. And why not?
With its wealth of woods, water and mountains, Maine has always
lured artists, among them Winslow Homer, Martin Johnson Heade,
Marsden Hartley, Childe Hassam, John Marin, Alex Katz, Robert
Indiana and Maurice Prendergast.
</P>
<P>
   Where there are artists, there are museums to reap their work,
and that's the case here. Each of the seven institutions _ three
``free standing'' and four attached to colleges _ has its own
distinctive collection, primarily in American art, and its own
approach to acquisition and display.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland Museum of Art owns a signature group of works by
Homer, including his first oil painting, ``The Sharpshooter.'' The
Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, with enormous holdings of work
by the Wyeth family, devotes itself to delineating Maine's role in
American art. The Ogunquit Museum of American Art has a magical
setting and a medley of works by artists of the turn-of-the-century
Ogunquit Art Colony.
</P>
<P>
   A problem for the museums was to make themselves more
accessible. The answer was a collaborative effort: among other
initiatives, they banded together to form the Maine Art Museum
Trail, inspired by the tourist-luring Connecticut Impressionist Art
Trail set up by a group of museums a few years ago. The Maine Art
Museum Trail is outlined in a 12-page color brochure and map that
highlights the attractions of each.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in greater detail, is what you'll find should you follow
the trail.
</P>
<P>
   The best known of the Maine Seven, the PORTLAND MUSEUM OF ART,
was founded in 1882 by local art patrons as the Portland Society of
Art. Today it occupies three buildings of architectural
significance _ the latest opened in 1983 _ in the downtown Portland
arts district, a lively area fronting Casco Bay where sea gulls
scream incessantly overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven, Portland's collections are the most extensive, if
not the most wide ranging. (That distinction goes to the Bowdoin
College Museum of Art.) The Portland holdings consist of more than
15,000 objects in the fine and decorative arts, from the 18th
century to now. The heart of the museum is its Maine collection,
which includes works by Homer, Marin, Edward Hopper, Louise
Nevelson and Andrew Wyeth. Degas, Picasso, Monet and Rodin are
among the European masters represented, and there are strong
holdings in prints and photography.
</P>
<P>
   Portland's two big current shows are ``Alberto Giacometti'' and
``N.C. Wyeth: Precious Time.'' The Giacometti show is said to be
the first ever in Maine for this influential Swiss sculptor
(1901-1966), who obsessively explored the way figures and objects
occupy space. On view are more than 50 paintings, sculptures,
drawings and prints from the collection of Herbert Lust, a New York
investment banker and longtime friend of the artist who contributes
a lively memoir to the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights are a highly charged 1949 painting of
Giacometti's brother, Diego, that reveals the energetic intensity
with which the artist worked over his subjects. A haunting bronze
head of Diego (1961) and a half-size bronze, ``Chignon Woman''
(1949), done in Giacometti's famously attenuated style, demonstrate
his ability to suggest the provisional, existential presence of
humanity. And the drawings and lithographs give a sense of his
constant inquiry, through line, into spatial relationships.
Altogether a rewarding show.
</P>
<P>
   Quite different in character is the show of work by Newell
Convers Wyeth (1882-1945), the father of Andrew and the grandfather
of James. A justly famous illustrator known for his flamboyant
depictions of derring-do, N.C. aspired to be known as a fine-art
painter. The show contrasts his illustrations, like the
swashbuckling cover for a 1911 edition of ``Treasure Island,'' with
the lower-key paintings of landscape, home and family that he did
between commercial assignments.
</P>
<P>
   In these the style ranges from realism to Post-Impressionism,
but the work, compared with that of more venturesome artists of the
period, rarely rises above convention.
</P>
<P>
   There are some fine scenes of the wild Maine coast, a crisp view
of ``Eight Bells'' (1936), his home in Port Clyde, Maine, and
several canvases of lobstermen at work. One of these, ``Untitled
(Lobstermen)'' (1927), is a half-stab at modernism, done in a
fractured, prismatic style that bespeaks an acquaintance with
Cubism. He will be remembered for his illustrations. Farnsworth Art
Museum
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot more Wyeth work _ by all three generations _ at
the Farnsworth, which houses an impressive collection of American
art, some 8,000 works strong, from the late 18th century to the
present, with a special focus on Maine-related work.
</P>
<P>
   The chronological range is from Gilbert Stuart and Washington
Allston to Nevelson (born, like the museum, in Rockland) and
lesser-known current artists like Dozier Bell and Brett Bigbee. It
also has the most extensive collection of Wyeth art in the world:
several thousand works by N.C., Andrew and James.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, in the coastal town of Rockland, opened in 1948 in
the crisp white Greek Revival mansion bequeathed _ along with a
$1.3-million endowment _ by Lucy Copeland Farnsworth and augmented
after her death by a handsome red brick Colonial Revival building.
The Center for the Wyeth Family in Maine, a study and exhibition
center in a 19th-century church building, opened in 1998, and in
June of this year the unveiling of the Jamien Morehouse Wing
completed the museum's Main Street facade.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also owns the Olson house, seen at the top of the
hill in Andrew Wyeth's famous ``Christina's World'' (1948). The
painting has just been lent to the Farnsworth by its owner, the
Museum of Modern Art, and for the first time in 50 years will be on
view at the Farnsworth, starting tomorrow and continuing through
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Farnsworth's current show, ``One Nation: Patriots and
Pirates Portrayed by N.C. Wyeth and James Wyeth,'' pairs
grandfather with grandson. Its 80 paintings and drawings depict
various manifestations of patriotism since the early 1900s. The
show reinforces the adage that the apple doesn't fall far from the
tree: the White House is seen by N.C. in a mannered illustration of
its construction done for Hallmark Cards (circa 1930); James
renders it in a snowy, starry platitudinous glow on Christmas Eve,
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Other N.C. chestnuts include a Norman Rockwell-ish rendering
(circa 1923) of Lincoln giving his second inaugural address in
1865, and various World War II propaganda pieces, among them
``Soldiers of the Soil'' (1942), in which a farmer tills his land
watched over by a clutch of Allied flags hovering among puffy
clouds. As for James, works like his posthumous close-up of
President John F. Kennedy, hand placed thoughtfully to mouth
(1967), and ``Islanders'' (1990), a couple seated on the porch of a
weatherbeaten house sporting a large American flag, demonstrate
that his development as a painter has not gone much beyond that of
his father, Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ogunquit Museum
</P>
<P>
   Ogunquit, once a small fishing village, has been an artist's
colony for more than 100 years, frequented at various times by the
likes of Hopper, Robert Henri, George Bellows and Walt Kuhn, and
reaching its peak in the 1920s and '30s. The Ogunquit Museum of
American Art, built in 1952 and since expanded to almost double its
original size, is the only one in Maine devoted exclusively to
20th-century American art. Another incentive to visit is its
spectacular siting on a rocky cove, with nearly three acres of
landscaped grounds, punctuated by outdoor sculptures, that offer an
unimpeded view of the mighty Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The museum sprang from the Ogunquit Art Association, founded in
1928 and later led by Henry Strater, a prolific realist painter who
took up summer residence and became a leader in the art
association. In the early 1950s, believing that Ogunquit was ready
for a museum representing a wide spectrum of 20th-century art, he
bought land on the cove and hired an architect.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is a light, airy structure that combines Maine
granite and hard pine with classical motifs. It now has about 7,500
square feet of space and a permanent collection of more than 1,400
paintings, sculptures and graphics. The artists include Marin,
Hassam, Homer, Hopper, Thomas Hart Benton, Charles Demuth, Charles
Burchfield, Morris Graves, Rockwell Kent, Fairfield Porter, Gaston
Lachaise and a multitude of lesser-knowns.
</P>
<P>
   The fun of it is that you never can tell what you'll find among
this miscellany, from the truly mediocre to the fine but relatively
unknown portraits of Harmon Neill to Hartley's marvelous ``Still
Life With Eel'' (circa 1914), a small, lighthearted charmer in
high-keyed colors, in which sinuous shapes are played off against
hard-edged geometrics.
</P>
<P>
   Ogunquit mounts several exhibitions a season, and although it
usually closes on Sept. 30, this year for the first time it will
stay open through Oct. 15. The current show is ``Painted Air:
American Impressionism,'' with more than 130 oils, pastels and
watercolors covering the period 1880 to 1920.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no denying that the American brand of Impressionism
lacked the elan of the European movement, and its works tend to
pale by comparison. Along with stellar names like Bellows, Hassam,
Henri, Prendergast, Mary Cassatt, Lilla Cabot Perry, John Singer
Sargent, Julian Alden Weir and James Abbott McNeill Whistler, this
show includes much weaker talents. It needs pruning.
</P>
<P>
   Bowdoin College Museum
</P>
<P>
   The Bowdoin College Museum of Art's permanent collection goes
back to 1811, making it the earliest collegiate art collection in
the United States. The bequest of James Bowdoin III (1752-1811),
who served as Thomas Jefferson's minister to France and Spain in
the early 1800s (and for whose statesman father the college was
named), bestowed 70 paintings and 141 drawings on this small but
choice college. But it took almost another century before art crept
into the Bowdoin curriculum, and the gift was fully appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1894 the Walker Art Building opened on campus, given by two
sisters, Harriet and Sophia Walker. Wishing to honor their uncle,
Theophilus Wheeler Walker, a Boston businessman who had helped
establish a modest gallery at the college, they commissioned the
prestigious firm of McKim, Mead &AMP; White to design the new building.
The firm did a splendid, all-out Beaux-Arts job, including a copper
dome and the placing of four murals by prominent artists of the
period in the rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   A plaque set into the rotunda floor by the sisters warns that
the building is to be used ``solely for art purposes.'' And that it
has, expanded and augmented in 1975 by a Visual Arts Center
designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes. Next summer the Walker building
is slated to be renovated and expanded again, by the New York
architectural firm of Tod Williams, Billie Tsien and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Today Bowdoin has a distinguished permanent collection whose
14,000 objects span a wide range of cultures and periods. The
American holdings are the strongest, and include one of the most
important groups of Colonial and Federal portraiture in the
country, with works by John Singleton Copley, Robert Feke,
Rembrandt Peale, Thomas Sully and Gilbert Stuart. Outstanding is
Feke's monumental portrait of Brig. Gen. Samuel Waldo (circa 1748)
done up in red and gold finery, to commemorate this Bostonian's
victory over the French at Louisbourg in Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   A recent find was a lively 1805 portrait of Sarah Bowdoin, wife
of James Bowdoin III, by the French painter Louis-Leopold Boilly.
It surfaced last year in an estate sale in northern France.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 19th- and 20th-century artists represented are
Hartley, Heade, Homer, Sargent, Thomas Eakins, and of course Andrew
Wyeth. A major gift in the 1960s added paintings by Arshile Gorky,
Alex Katz, Franz Kline and Jack Tworkov. Such diverse artists as
Man Ray, Eva Hesse and Jack Tworkov are also in the collection.
</P>
<P>
   But that's by no means all. On permanent view also are Assyrian
bas-reliefs from the ninth century B.C.; sculpture, coins and other
objects from a strong ancient Mediterranean collection; and a
selection of European paintings and decorative arts that focus on
the Italian Renaissance. Changing exhibitions occur here, too,
including a much-acclaimed show devoted to Emily Nelligan, a
little-known Maine artist who chronicles the natural phenomena of
Cranberry Island in remarkable charcoal drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Colby College Museum
</P>

   The student population of this beautiful neo-Georgian campus in
the heart of Maine is only 1,750 strong. But the Colby College
Museum of Art, founded in 1959, has rapidly become _ with three
major additions over the last decade _ the largest in the state. It
houses a deep and varied collection of American art, covering three
centuries, in 28,000 square feet of elegant gallery space.
</P>
<P>
   The collection began with a small group of works and one gallery
in the early 1950s, a sidebar to the college's growing art history
and studio programs. But alumni and other donors, gently persuaded
by a strong board and a dedicated director, Hugh Gourley III, have
swelled the holdings to some 3,500 objects and an acquisitions fund
of $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   One enhancement is the Paul J. Schupf wing, opened in 1996 for
the display of works by Alex Katz, a Maine summer resident since
the 1950s. Covering five decades, the more than 500 objects were
given by Katz starting in 1992, with the proviso that a gallery be
built to house them. Schupf, a longtime Katz collector, obliged.
One of the few museum wings in the country devoted to a single
artist, it shows his paintings, cut-outs and drawings in rotational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another strength is the new Lunder wing, made possible by a
challenge grant from Peter and Paula Lunder of Waterville ( Lunder
is a Colby alumnus) and opened in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Built to display the museum's outstanding collection of early
American, Impressionist and early-20th-century art, much of which
lay in storage, it contains 13 spacious galleries, showing the work
of artists from Copley, Stuart and Charles Willson Peale to
Hartley, Porter, Georgia O'Keeffe, Rockwell Kent, Chuck Close and
Nevelson. Two galleries display more than 50 paintings,
watercolors, drawings and prints by Marin, many given by the
artist's son.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has recently gone in for large commissions as well. A
big, bright wall painting by Sol LeWitt greets visitors in the
lobby, and a monumental work by Richard Serra has just been
installed in a new sculpture court, made possible by Schupf, that
has become part of the main facade.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Colby neglect temporary exhibitions: its ambitious
program includes the current ``Modernism and Abstraction: Treasures
From the Smithsonian American Art Museum,'' a survey of
20th-century developments illustrated by artists including Hartley,
Joseph Stella, Stuart Davis, Jennifer Bartlett, David Hockney and
Eric Fischl.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a place that's going places.
</P>
<P>
   Bates College Museum
</P>
<P>
   Founded in honor of Lewiston's most famous native, Marsden
Hartley (1877-1943), the Bates College Museum of Art is the largest
repository of his drawings, which serve as the cornerstone of the
museum's collection. The 99 sheets, along with oil sketches and
memorabilia, were donated in 1955 by Hartley's niece, Norma Berger.
The drawings include Maine landscapes, but most are of people,
including the fishermen and women he sketched in the mid-1930s and
early '40s while living in New England and the Canadian maritime
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The gift prompted the designation of a single classroom for
showing the drawings and other works, but as enthusiasm built for
the visual arts at this small college, the classroom gave way to a
museum, opened in 1986 as part of the Olin Arts Center, financed by
a gift from the F.W. Olin Foundation in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's collection of 4,000 objects, mostly works on paper,
has largely been shaped by the Hartley founding gift. Drawings by
some of his friends, including Carl Sprinchorn and Mark Tobey, were
added, along with photographs of the artist by George Platt Lynes
and Alfredo Valente, dating from the 1930s. The photographs
attracted others, and today the museum has a good collection that
includes work by Walker Evans and Arthur Rothstein as well as more
contemporary talents like Paul Caponigro and Jonathan Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   American art had been given to Bates since shortly after the
college's founding in 1855. Some of it came from local artists,
like D.D. Coombs (1850-1938), a painter in the Romantic tradition
who turned out boring landscapes. But there are also works by
artists who came to Maine and stayed, like William and Marguerite
Zorach, their daughter Dahlov Ipcar, and the painter of Maine
woods, Neil Welliver.
</P>
<P>
   A print collection of some 3,000 works has also been
established. Some of its artists can be studied in depth, with more
than 100 wood engravings by Homer and the entire print output of
Joseph Pennell (1860-1926). Bates also mounts temporary shows, like
this summer's ``Eloquent Objects,'' a group of still lifes by
well-known and emerging artists.
</P>
<P>
   If not the most exciting stop on the trail, there are, still,
all those wonderful Hartleys.
</P>
<P>
   University of Maine Museum
</P>
<P>
   The big news about this underfinanced museum, which specializes
in works on paper, is that it is pushing hard to on leave its
University of Maine campus in Orono for nearby Bangor, where it
will occupy the first three floors of a renovated former department
store.
</P>
<P>
   The move results from a partnership between the City of Bangor
and the university. In its new site the permanent collection of
some 6,000 works will get improved climate control and
museum-quality storage space, along with _ it is hoped _ a much
larger audience.
</P>
<P>
   The museum of Art began in 1946 as the University of Maine Art
Collection, with Vincent Hartgen, a painter who taught at the
university, serving as curator. The collection _ primarily works on
paper _ ranged from Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo to Marc Chagall and
Hassam. In 1988 the collection was officially designated as a
museum, and is housed on campus in a weather-beaten neo-Classical
granite structure built in 1903 to serve as the university's
library.
</P>
<P>
   By ``begging, borrowing and stealing,'' as the current director,
Wally Mason, puts it, the museum has succeeded in assembling a
presentable small collection that includes paintings by Alfred
Bricher and George Inness and prints and photographs by artists
ranging from Homer and Marin to Richard Diebenkorn, Roy
Lichtenstein and Berenice Abbott. About a third of the artists
represented come from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The Robert Venn Carr Collection of 285 works on paper, acquired
in 1986, has contributed much to the museum's holdings in
contemporary art, representing artists like Max Beckmann, Jim Dine
and Robert Rauschenberg. Recent temporary shows included one of the
photographer Evelyn Hofer. And, lacking exhibition galleries for
its permanent collection, the museum wisely rotates it in
exhibitions, like the current ``Jump Into It: Water as Muse,'' a
medley of watery themes that includes 79 works by 58 artists, among
them Marin, Willem de Kooning, Carl Sprinchorn, Jennifer Bartlett,
David Hockney and Susan Shatter.
</P>
<P>
   Things are looking up, and meanwhile the museum is performing
its functions of acquiring, conserving and exhibiting in very
positive ways.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bush fires up `failed leadership' theme
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush, fired up and on the attack, berated the Clinton
administration today for seven years of ``flowery speeches,'' big
talk and failed leadership. Turning combative, a re-energized Bush
lashed out at Al Gore as a member of an administration that failed
to lead for seven years and could not ``make the case'' for four
more. Bush, who has been hammered by Gore over his lack of
specifics on big-ticket issues, told reporters in Toledo, Ohio,
''The reason they're pounding me is because this administration, of
which Al Gore is a part, has been unable to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVE AD AT THE READY
</P>
<P>
   Making an issue of Al Gore's credibility, Republicans are
planning to air an ad reminding voters of his fund-raising visit to
a Buddhist temple and his suggestion that he invented the Internet.
``There's Al Gore reinventing himself,'' a woman says in the
Republican National Committee ad. The 30-second spot _ which
Republicans described as tongue-in-cheek _ would be the party's
most direct attack yet, and Gore spokesman Mark Fabiani reacted
strongly: ``When (George Bush's ) back is against the wall, he will
do anything to get elected. He visited Bob Jones University, he
saluted the Confederate flag and now he's going to break his own
promise . . . that he would not engage in personal negative
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH VISITS 100TH SCHOOL
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush visited the 100th school of his presidential
campaign today to highlight his $47 billion education plan. He
marked the occasion in the gymnasium of Springfield (Ohio) High
School, an event intended to symbolize his commitment to giving
school systems more control and holding them accountable for poor
student performance. He also highlighted what he said were
opportunities for education reform missed by the Clinton-Gore
administration, saying, ``We must not allow children to be trapped
in schools that will not teach and will not change.'' Al Gore's
campaign said the visits are more like ``100 photo ops'' about
misguided proposals.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH HITS BACK ON JUDGE'S ORDER
</P>
<P>
   En route to Ohio today, George W. Bush dismissed criticism of
the way Texas provides health treatment for poor children, saying
that a court order demanding action came from ``an activist,
liberal judge'' and that Democrats were only trying to change the
subject from their own poor record. U.S. District Judge William
Wayne Justice said in his order that Texas was not adequately
providing health services to children despite the state's promise
four years ago to make changes. Bush defended his record: ``We are
doing everything in our power to take care of the disadvantaged
children of the state of Texas.'' He criticized the federal
government for refusing to grant waivers that he said would have
made the process easier.
</P>
<P>
   PUSH FOR `PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS'
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and Joe Lieberman say all Americans are entitled to a
``patients' bill of rights'' that sets minimum standards of care,
and they challenged George W. Bush to offer the same. Gore and
Lieberman pushed their idea at a rally today in Seattle, the
culmination of a weeklong focus on health care issues. Before that,
they were up early to greet commuters arriving from Baybridge
Island across Puget Sound by ferry. They then boarded the ferry to
ride to the island and back. Gore used the occasion to urge
additional funding for alternate forms of mass transit, saying of
the ferry, ``This is mass transit in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE AS MOUNTAIN TOUR GUIDE
</P>
<P>
   For almost 15 minutes, while his plane was en route from
Portland, Ore., to Seattle, Al Gore fondly recalled three days he
spent with his son, Albert III, last year climbing Mount Rainier, a
peak of 14,4le to lift this country up to its national
possibilities.'' Nader said he expects to be on the ballot in 45
states ``and the overwhelming population will have a chance to vote
for the Green Party candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   NATURAL LAW-REFORM PARTY ALLIANCE
</P>
<P>
   It's ``a marriage made in heaven,'' John Hagelin said today,
announcing an alliance between his Natural Law Party and a faction
of the Reform Party that favors him over Pat Buchanan. Hagelin, an
Iowa physicist, made the announcement at the Natural Law Party's
convention in Alexandria, Va., where he accepted the presidential
nomination. The convention was attended by about 400 people, about
half of them delegates. Hagelin and his running mate, Silicon
Valley entrepreneur Nat Goldhaber, assured the crowd that a general
election victory was possible.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY WOULD REDUCE TROOPS OVERSEAS
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney said today that if he and George W. Bush are elected
they'll look at scaling back U.S. troops in the Balkans and letting
European allies take on more responsibility for peacekeeping. ``I
haven't seen yet any proposal from the administration to get out of
Kosovo or Bosnia,'' Cheney said at a school in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla. ``One approach would be to have our European friends and
allies pick up a bigger share of the burden there.'' Cheney has
accused the Clinton-Gore administration of running down the
military, but he said today he's not ready to say where he would
recommend increases until a new Bush administration does a complete
military review.
</P>
<P>
   BATTLE LINES FORM OVER MILITARY
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's claim that the next president will inherit a
military ``in decline'' is producing a political tug of war among
present and former Pentagon commanders. Al Gore's campaign has put
forth Defense Secretary William Cohen, the only Republican in the
Cabinet, and former Clinton Defense Secretary William Perry to
dispute the assertions. Colin Powell, the retired chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff during the presidency of Bush's father,
joined the fray. ``Readiness has declined, investment has declined,
maintenance has declined, training has declined,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   STRAW VOTE FOR VETERANS
</P>
<P>
   Jumping into the debate over defense readiness, the American
Legion invited the nation's 27 million veterans and active-duty
military today to vote in a presidential ``straw vote'' on the
Internet. A new Web site (www.mylegion.com) will tabulate the votes
and provide information on the military positions of candidates
George W. Bush and Al Gore, said Al Lance, national commander of
the 2.8 million-member veterans' organization. Lance said there
also would be a process by which respondents could voice their
views on related issues such as health care, education and the
problem of unemployment among veterans.
</P>
<P>
   GERALDO RIVERA AS MAYOR?
</P>
<P>
   Geraldo Rivera wants to run for mayor of New York City, and he
doesn't mind if that makes people laugh. ``I expect the first
reaction to be, `Geraldo as mayor, ha ha,' `` Rivera told The New
York Times. But the television journalist, who anchors a talk show
on CNBC, says he is serious about an independent campaign for
mayor, after a ``totally self-financed'' petition drive to get his
name on the ballot. ``I think the city needs someone from the
outside,'' Rivera, 57, said today on NBC's ``Today.'' The election
is in November 2001. Mayor Rudy Giuliani is barred by law from
seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   ETHNIC NERVE IN BLACK COMMUNITY
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness of a feud between two black Democrats in the 11th
Congressional District in Brooklyn, N.Y., has torn apart a
longstanding friendship and has spread the anguish. The political
contest has brought to the surface simmering _ and often unspoken _
tension between African-American New Yorkers and those with
Caribbean heritage. In her campaign for Congress, Una Clarke, a
Jamaican-born city councilwoman, has not only heralded her
Caribbean roots but has accused her old friend and mentor, Rep.
Major Owens, of being anti-immigrant. Owens, born in Memphis, has
accused Clarke of trying to turn black Brooklynites against one
another by using ethnic chauvinism to get votes.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN: ADL OVERREACTED
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman said the Anti-Defamation League misunderstood him
earlier this week when he advocated a greater role for faith and
religion in American public life. He said the response to his
remarks at a black church in Detroit on Sunday and an interfaith
breakfast in Chicago on Monday was ``a bit of an overreaction.''
After those speeches, the ADL urged Lieberman, the first Orthodox
Jew on a national party ticket, to tone down his references to
religion. ``I respect the ADL, but I respectfully disagree,'' he
said. ``I think they misunderstood part of it, part of what I was
trying to say. And the whole point of it is that I think faith has
a constructive role that it can play in American life.''
</P>
<P>
   NADER WINS UNION BACKING
</P>
<P>
   The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America
voted to endorse Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader,
its first departure from backing Democrats. Nader had addressed the
union's 200 delegates at its 65th national convention in Erie, Pa.,
offering himself as an alternative to the two major party
candidates, even though the Democratic Party has traditionally been
labor's partner in politics. Before Nader, the union had endorsed
only four presidential candidates, all Democrats: Franklin
Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, George McGovern and Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   GORE GOING TO LETTERMAN
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for questions about The Kiss. Al Gore has accepted an
invitation to appear on David Letterman's ``Late Show'' on Sept.
14. Gore undoubtedly will be asked about his convention lip-lock
with his wife, Tipper. Letterman has repeatedly run taped footage
of the lengthy kiss. It'll be Gore's first appearance with
Letterman since they both donned eye goggles in 1993 to watch Gore
smash ashtrays with a hammer. George W. Bush appeared via satellite
on Letterman's show March 1.
</P>
<P>
   REMEMBER THOSE HEALTH CARE REFORM ADS?
</P>
<P>
   A Republican group plans to air a new TV ad criticizing Al
Gore's proposal to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. The
Republican Leadership Coalition spot warns that Gore would dip into
seniors' Social Security checks to pay for the program. But an
elderly woman seated at a table has a message for Gore: ``Get your
hands off my Social Security check!'' Viewers could easily be
misled, however. The government currently deducts Medicare premiums
from Social Security checks before issuing them. And Gore's program
would be optional; seniors would be charged only if they sign up.
The ad doesn't make either of these points.
</P>
<P>
   POSITIVE CAMPAIGNS GET HIT, TOO
</P>
<P>
   With three weeks to go before the Democratic primary in
Washington state, Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn unveiled her
TV ad campaign for the Senate nomination. Senn accuses her
better-financed opponent, ex-Rep. Maria Cantwell, of dodging
debates and ``hiding in a TV'' via her own ads. Cantwell, who
became a millionaire several times over as an Internet exec after
being turned out of office in the 1994 Republican takeover of
Congress, has been showing ads pointing out her business experience
and other credentials and all but ignoring Senn. The winner of the
Sept. 19 primary will face Republican Sen. Slade Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-LIEBERMAN, HEBREW-STYLE
</P>
<P>
   It was bound to happen. At a late night rally in downtown
Portland, Ore., Al Gore and Joe Lieberman were greeted by
supporters waving placards that spelled out Gore-Lieberman in
Hebrew letters. The New York Times said it should be noted,
however, that the signs said ``Gore-Lieberman 2000,'' not
``Gore-Lieberman 5761,'' the year of the coming election in the
Hebrew calendar.
</P>
<P>
   PACKER FANS PUT TO THE TEST
</P>
<P>
   The love affair between the Green Bay Packers and their fans
faces the ultimate pocketbook test the week after next. The
question is whether to enact a half-percent sales tax to help
finance a $295 million facelift and expansion of Lambeau Field,
home of the Packers. The answer is not a sure thing heading into a
Sept. 12 referendum in which about 170,000 Brown County, Wis.,
residents will decide the tax's fate. Emotions are strong on both
sides, and a recent poll had the election a virtual tossup. The
stadium was built in the late 1950s for $960,000.
</P>
<P>
   GOVERNORSHIP BALANCE SEEMS ON HOLD
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 states are holding elections for governor in November.
By all accounts most of the races are too close to call, but the
biggest swing that either party realistically envisions is two or
three seats. The real test of the parties' struggle for the
nation's statehouses is not likely to come until the off-year
elections of 2002, with governors' races in 36 states. In 1994, two
years into President Clinton's first term, voters reversed the
Democrats' 30-18 advantage in governorships. The Republican Party
now has 30-18 advantage in governorships. (Maine has an
independent, Angus King, and Minnesota has Jesse Ventura, now with
the Minnesota Independence Party.)

`WILDFLOWERS': A  ' 60S MARIN COUNTY MAP   WITH VIETNAM LEFT OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Melissa Painter's ``Wildflowers'' is a dreamy, impressionistic
inquiry into the legacy of the 1960s, but it's less concerned with
history than with mood.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1985, the film circles around the identity crisis of a
17-year-old named Cally (Clea DuVall), who spent her early
childhood on a Northern California commune and now lives on a
houseboat in Marin County with her father (Tomas Arana). In San
Francisco one evening, Cally encounters a mysterious blond woman
named Sabine (Daryl Hannah), who she decides must be her long-lost
mother.
</P>
<P>
   The '60s figure in this movie less as a period in American
history _ or even in the history of a specific American subculture
_ than as a vague set of ideas, most of which have to do with
clothes and interior decoration. Everyone looks as rugged and
beautiful as the California coast, where Cally and her friends are
shown frolicking as if they lived in a high-end natural-fiber
clothing catalog _ something between Whole Earth and J. Crew.
</P>
<P>
   The muzzy indirection of the narrative, which is often buried
altogether in beautiful images and slow, contemplative scenes of
Cally wandering through various landscapes, disguises the story's
essential thinness. Painter's attempt to avoid both moralistic
disapproval of the '60s counterculture and romantic celebration of
it leaves her without much of a context for her characters. Cally's
father and his old commune pals talk about the ``craziness'' and
``chaos'' of the time, and there is mention of ``radicals'' and
``the feds,'' but these words seem devoid of reference, even to the
mellowed-out relics who utter them. The word Vietnam is never
spoken.
</P>
<P>
   But DuVall, who attracted some notice as one of Winona Ryder's
fellow patients in ``Girl, Interrupted,'' has a knack for
understatement that makes her performance believable and affecting.
Cally's feelings _ her ardor, her longing, her confusion and her
humor _ register in DuVall's eyes and skin. But her intuitive grasp
of emotion makes it all the more unlikely that she could be the
daughter of the wildly emoting Daryl Hannah, who conveys Sabine's
volatility by lurching inexplicably from bedraggled fatigue to
cuddly empathy to keening rage.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Eric Roberts, who, in the real mid-1980s, appeared
with Hannah in ``The Pope of Greenwich Village,'' has some good
moments as a leathery drug dealer who once loved Sabine. He
balances sensitivity and sleaze nicely, though a bedroom scene with
DuVall tips the balance in favor of sleaze. The former poet
laureate Robert Hass turns up, reading some of his own poems, as a
poet named Robert, another man who loves the wild Sabine but cannot
tame her. There's also a live, blithely anachronistic performance
by the band Blues Traveler.
</P>
<P>
   All of these people seem to live and suffer, in a low-key,
with-it kind of way, in a vacuum. They inhabit a world in which
relationships, politics, literature and art are pretty gossamer
decorations, like the skirts and dresses Sabine favors.
``Wildflowers'' is a tapestry of muffled cultural associations that
distract the eye and the mind from its pervasive atmosphere of
groovy emptiness.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   GETTYSBURG, Pa. _ The National Park Service recommends on its
Web site that visitors to the Gettysburg National Military Park
spend at least four hours touring the battlefield and museum,
``though an entire day is more desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   As understatements go, this is a keeper. You could spend a
lifetime here and never outlast the topic or the topography. But a
weekend excursion to this 6,000-acre shrine is a start. It can help
to explain why Civil War buffs are so ardent, why veterans of more
recent wars come here as if to commune and why historians,
novelists and filmmakers can't leave Gettysburg alone.
</P>
<P>
   Until you have walked the stone walls and trekked the woods
along Seminary Ridge (the Rebels' line before their final infantry
assault) and then switched sides to gaze back across the fields
from Little Round Top (the fabled knob of stone-strewn Union high
ground), you cannot truly understand what happened here from July
1-3, 1863. The best books on the subject are merely informed
preparation. You must bring your imagination and suspend your
disbelief. Because no one can explain, really, why 170,000 men from
Maine to Mississippi came here to kill one another.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they did, and the history they made is worth at least one
sunny summer day 137 years later.
</P>
<P>
   My 14-year-old son, Alec, and I made the trip together. Both of
us brushed up on history before we set out, but I was more manic.
</P>
<P>
   I bought several hour-by-hour guides to the battle, consulted
Shelby Foote's multivolume ``Civil War'' (Random House, 1963) and
scoured the library for books that profiled commanders and analyzed
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The best book of all turned out not to be a history book but a
novel that many people had recommended as both good reading and
good history: Michael Shaara's ``Killer Angels,'' which won a
Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Shaara personalizes the battle, which
he presents and analyzes through imagined thoughts and
conversations. In the novel, Gen. Robert E. Lee and Gen. James
Longstreet are at odds over Lee's plan to take the battle to the
Union lines. Gen. John Buford, a cavalry officer, is the first to
skirmish with the Confederates on July 1. Col. Joshua Lawrence
Chamberlain, commander of the 20th Maine Volunteers, saw some of
the most desperate fighting of the battle on the second and third
days.
</P>
<P>
   I had never been a Civil War buff.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the misleading name: Civil War, a flagrant
contradiction. It was more likely, though, that I had been numbed
by the perpetual tape loop of my childhood social studies
curriculum. It unwound each September with Columbus' voyage to the
New World and halted abruptly each June just shy of James
Buchanan's inauguration. In junior high school we touched on the
Missouri Compromise, Fort Sumter and John Brown. Grant drank, we
learned, and Lee's horse was named Traveller. We memorized the
Gettysburg Address. History as film strip.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, long after college and in pursuit of
self-education, I picked up ``This Hallowed Ground,'' Bruce
Catton's highly regarded one-volume account of the war. I was
hooked on the concept: a dysfunctional young country tears itself
apart, creating heros and villains and gory legends at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   In a blood feud between two starkly different cultures, one
slave, one free, place names pop up like so many tombstones in a
family plot: Bull Run, Fredericksburg, Antietam, Vicksburg. A
rancorous social and political drama played out in the dangerous
confusion of 19th-century warfare _ a war waged by gentlemanly
generals, North and South, many of whom attended West Point
together in the 1830s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   In all of this, Gettysburg stands out, and not just for its
ruthlessness. Mistakes were made here, some in the name of glory.
But it was the beginning of the end for the Confederacy, the
so-called High Water Mark, that ended with the repulse of Gen.
George E. Pickett's charge against the center of the Union line on
the third day. It was, too, a crushing and bitter defeat for Lee.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the two armies came upon it, Gettysburg was a market
town of 2,000, a quiet crossroads whose dusty pikes led to the
state capital, at Harrisburg, as well as to Carlisle, Chambersburg
and York. It was home to a Lutheran seminary and Pennsylvania
(later Gettysburg) College. Nothing much happened here until, by
chance, the Army of the Potomac, under Gen. George G. Meade, and
the Army of Northern Virginia, under Lee, caught wind of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   They had last engaged in Chancellorsville, Va., at the start of
May, when Lee's army, outnumbered 2-to-1, had brilliantly
outmaneuvered the Yankees under the feckless command of Gen. Joseph
Hooker.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened, Lee and the Confederate government in Richmond had
decided to bring the war into Pennsylvania, hoping for a chance to
cut off the Union Army, now under Meade's command, from Washington,
forcing Abraham Lincoln to recognize the Confederate States of
America.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen. On July 4, 1863, after three days of
fighting, Lee's army pulled back and headed south. More than 51,000
soldiers on both sides had been killed, wounded or captured.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the battlefied, which surrounds and includes the
town itself, Gettysburg would still be the same quiet hamlet it was
in the middle of the 19th century. Today, with a population of
7,000 and a tourist influx of 1.5 million a year, it is an antique
stage set for restaurants, pubs and souvenir shops of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   There's a wax museum, a Hall of Presidents and a business that
offers tours of ``haunted Gettysburg.'' The Gettysburg Address is
reproduced on plaques, brochures and dinner menus. You can visit
the home of Jennie Wade, the only civilian killed during the
battle; she was shot through the door of her house by a Louisiana
marksman as she baked biscuits for Union soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The battlefield, in its scope and the bountiful greens and tans
of summer, is a serious monument, and the Park Service treats it as
such.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to Gettysburg unschooled: with just two brochures,
offered free at the visitor center, the war and the battleground
become instantly accessible. A foldout map pinpoints all the
significant skirmish and battle lines. It includes a 16-point
self-guided auto tour, a synopsis of the fighting and diagrams of
troop positions on each day. The other pamphlet, ``Planning Your
Visit,'' is a schedule of daily educational programs offered by
park rangers, who know their stuff. Their spiels tend to be as
entertaining as they are informative.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sunday we were there, Matt Atkinson, a ranger from
Mississippi, conducted a 35-minute tour of the National Cemetery,
which Lincoln dedicated on Nov. 19, 1863, four months after the
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of you probably had to memorize the Gettysburg Address,''
he said, speaking to a gathering largely made up of Northerners.
``That wasn't a priority where I came from.'' Pause for laughter.
``Just kidding,'' he added quickly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   For our full day at the park, Alec and I bought an auto-tour
tape cassette for $10 that includes yet another map of the
battlefield. Road signs with stars on them clearly mark the route.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost impossible to get lost. But I had a habit of
listening so intently to the narration that I stopped either too
soon or too late. Often Alec caught me pointing to what I thought
was the famous Peach Orchard or McPherson's Barn when actually I
had parked at Stop 4 and not Stop 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it must have been like following some general
around,'' Alec said. ``And he didn't have a tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. So a suggestion: before you take the tour, stop at
the visitor center, tour the museum of relics _ guns, bugles,
cannons, uniforms _ and go to the electric map. For $3 you'll see a
room-size relief map with blinking lights and hear a 30-minute
narration that allows you to get a sense of the park and the
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting but less important, perhaps, is the cyclorama of the
final day's assault, the charge led by Pickett at Lee's orders:
12,000 men walked a mile toward the heavily fortified center of the
Union line; fewer than half came back. The 360-degree painting,
housed in its own specially designed building, was completed in
1883 by a French artist, Paul Philippoteaux, whose work was all the
rage at the end of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 p.m. on Friday, having viewed the map and grabbed some
brochures, Alec and I headed to our weekend retreat, the
Battlefield Bed and Breakfast Inn, a five-minute drive on Route 15
at the southern edge of the park. A large comfortable old farmhouse
(the original structure dates to 1809), it is really just a
disguised theme park for its owners, Charles and Florence Tarbox.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Tarbox, 52, is a plump, loquacious and utterly engaging
criminal defense lawyer from California who retired from the
courtroom to pursue his undergraduate love: military history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War,'' he likes to say, ``is the world's
longest-running soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after a year of construction, the Tarboxes opened the
former sheep and dairy farm as an inn on Memorial Day weekend. The
rooms are comfortable, the surroundings (46 acres, a horse barn and
a passel of feral outdoor cats) bucolic and the breakfasts as good
as they look. But the treat is Tarbox, who lectures each morning
from 8 to 9, before breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   He has 15 programs on the war: the cavalry, the artillery, the
soldiers' lives. On Saturday morning he was AWOL, but an able
substitute, Bill Pulig, a podiatrist at the U.S. Army War College
in nearby Carlisle, stood in for him.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 guests occupied plastic lawn chairs on a gravel patio
outside the inn's dining room, sun breaking through, grass still
dewy. Pulig, who is also a Civil War re-enactor, stood before us in
a cavalry trooper's uniform, but with only the collar button
buttoned. ``Regulations,'' he said. ``The uniforms were made of
wool and it got pretty hot. Nevertheless the generals wanted the
buttons buttoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the Army has always been the Army. It insisted on
uniformity at the collar but failed to mention the rest of the
jacket, so most overheated soldiers left the other buttons undone.
</P>
<P>
   Pulig had plenty of props, including a saddle and a trooper's
belt with sword, holster and sidearm. The trooper also carried a
carbine: basically a rifle with a short barrel that was effective
only at close range but had the advantage, for the horse, of not
being long enough to swat its ears.
</P>
<P>
   Props need actors, and Pulig quickly pulled from his audience
the most likely helper, Laura Dietrick, 11. She had come with her
parents, Dave and Jeanne, and her sister, Amy, 6, from Nazareth,
Pa., near Allentown, to see the sights. Suddenly she had become
one.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Pulig was through, Laura was swathed in a trooper's
jacket, a hat, a greatcoat and much more. Pulig told her she would
receive a daily ration of 13 hardtack crackers (basically
kindergarten paste) and enough beans to make six pints of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the romance of soldiering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the stuff you see in the John Wayne movies is totally
inaccurate,'' Pulig said, debunking the notion that a trooper could
fire 8, 10 or 20 pistol rounds without reloading or stopping to fit
caps to miniballs.
</P>
<P>
   Among his more interesting anecdotes:The Union army trained tens
of thousands of horses for its cavalry, but training meant simply
that a horse could stand to have a saddle and a rider on its back.
A federal trooper would still have to train the horse to be ridden
in battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebel cavalry, he said, was often better prepared because
horse and rider knew each other well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Confederate Army, you showed up with your own horse,''
Pulig said. ``Otherwise you'd be in the infantry.''
</P>
<P>
   On our second morning at the inn, Charlie Tarbox appeared, with
mutton-chop whiskers and garbed in a tattered Union uniform. He had
a full house, almost 20 boarders. We sat with fresh coffee and
orange juice. Tarbox explained artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Cannons are everywhere on the battlefield. They all look the
same: iron or bronze barrels resting on two large wooden wheels.
Basically metal tubes to propel solid iron balls.
</P>
<P>
   Not that simple, it turns out. Tarbox, who performs with the
zeal of a patent-medicine pitchman, described in layman's terms how
12-pound cannonballs that once landed with a thud, possibly
injuring just one infantry soldier, eventually became high-velocity
rocks, skipping like stones, hitting one man, then another, then
another.
</P>
<P>
   The record for one cannonball, he said, was 32 soldiers at the
Battle of Zorndorf in 1757, when Prussian and Russian troops
clashed.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Tarbox observation: the romance of war suddenly soured
by reality.
</P>
<P>
   This came through time and again on the tour. Once you see the
wide-open pasture that Pickett's men had to cross, moving without
cover toward the Union redoubts above them, romance seems an alien
concept.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the contradictions of Gettysburg that continue to
keep people in thrall. Pointless death, but death with honor.
Evidence comes from the soldiers themselves, quoted in ``Guide to
the Battle of Gettysburg,'' edited by Jay Luvaas and Harold W.
Nelson. In his after-action report, Maj. Charles S. Peyton, Ninth
Virginia Infantry, commanding Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett's
brigade in Pickett's division, wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``The brigade went into action with 1,287 men and about 140
officers ... sustained a loss of ... 941 killed, wounded, and
missing. ... Never had the brigade been better handled and never
has it done better service in the field of battle. There was
scarcely an officer or man in the command whose attention was not
attracted by the cool and handsome bearing of Garnett, who, totally
devoid of excitement or rashness, rode immediately in rear of his
advancing line, endeavoring by his personal efforts, and by the aid
of his staff, to keep his line well closed and dressed. He was shot
from his horse while near the center of the brigade, within about
25 paces of the stone wall.''

 &HT;    The week on TV
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no official low point of the television season, but the
de facto bottom traditionally comes over Labor Day weekend. Many
people are on vacation or doing something other than watching TV,
and so television just sort of shrugs and gives up.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Labor Day weekend is the calm before the onslaught of
new fall network programs, but this year the networks' big
premieres are being pushed back to the first week in October so
they don't have to go up against NBC's Summer Olympics the last two
weeks of September.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here's what's out there.
</P>
<P>
   Today
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``This Week in History'' (8 p.m. on the History Channel) _ The
date was Sept. 3, 1977. The song was ``It's a Long Way to
Tipperary.'' And Mary Tyler Moore turned out the lights for the
last time at TV station WJM.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Television Show With John Henson'' (10 p.m. on ABC) _
How 'bout that title? This new special, hosted by ``Talk Soup''
smarty-pants Henson, takes a look at everything TV, mainly the
offbeat. It's a pilot that ABC didn't pick up.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Outer Limits'' (8 p.m. on Showtime) _ The anthology
series has its final episode and has lined up a big-name cast. In
``Final Appeal,'' the year is 2076 and a scientist (Amanda Plummer)
is being tried for bringing her time machine to an era that has
outlawed technology. The judges' panel includes Charlton Heston,
Hal Holbook, Cicely Tyson, Swoosie Kurtz and Robert Loggia.
</P>
<P>
   To set up the show (although all episodes stand alone), Showtime
will run eight previous episodes from 2 to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Best Bet
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Association Telethon'' (9
p.m. Sunday on WUPA, continuing for 21 1/2 hours).
</P>
<P>
   OK, scoff all you want, but while you're sitting back in your
recliner looking down your nose at Lewis' ruffled-shirt shtick,
he's actually raising money for a good cause. That's more than you
can say for most of television.
</P>
<P>
   Over its 35 years, Lewis' annual telethon has become a camp
classic, a kind of bizarre hybrid of an old ``Ed Sullivan Show''
marathon and a PBS pledge break, the whole thing just going onnnn
and onnnnn.
</P>
<P>
   What's really happened is that the telethon hasn't changed, but
the audience has. Despite a few bells and whistles here and there,
Lewis and his guests are doing basically the same show they did in
the '60s _ hour after hour of earnest, straight-into-the-camera
stuff and Vegasy schmooze. The audience, meanwhile, has been
Letterman-ized, and we expect irony and arch self-awareness. Lewis
is still old-school, and we've become new-school.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, among those helping Lewis raise money for
research this year are Christina Aguilera, Wayne Brady, Dennis
Franz, Billy Gilman, Casey Kasem, Jack Lemmon, Frank Sinatra Jr.,
Martha Stewart, Regis Philbin and the casts of ``Fosse'' and ``Lord
of the Dance.'' And of course, Ed McMahon.

   ``Monday Night Football'' kicks off its 31st regular season
tonight at 9 on ABC, as the Denver Broncos visit the St. Louis
Rams. The real test tonight, though, is for new ABC color man
Dennis Miller, who was the network's out-of-left-field choice to
take the third seat in the booth alongside Al Michaels and Dan
Fouts.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects Miller to return the festivities back to the days
of Howard Cosell and Dandy Don Meredith. But it would be nice for
ABC if he could at least make things entertaining. By itself, an
improved game schedule probably won't be enough to help ``Monday
Night Football'' stem the ratings decline that resulted in an
all-time low in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has had a couple of preseason games to warm up, and the
results have been mixed. He knows a lot about the game, as ABC
promised, and he's had moments of inspired wit. But he's obviously
been trying hard, and the great ones make it look effortless. If
he's going to truly find the groove, it'll start tonight.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Do I see with my own very eyes a man who's not
heard of a jellicle cat?''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, bewhiskered, from the stage of the Winter Garden
Theater _ Munkustrap was his name _ wasn't looking at me, but I
felt the accusation. What kind of person was I, what kind of New
Yorker, when for more than 17 years I had never participated in the
kitty culture of Grizabella, Old Deuteronomy and the Rum Tum
Tugger? Until a few months ago, when its closing was first
announced, I had never seen ``Cats.'' So sue me.
</P>
<P>
   My defense? A bad one. Call it pride in avoidance, or elitism
selectively applied. Certain popular phenomena so saturate our
culture that for the ordinary purposes of staying current in a
useful, rudimentary way it isn't necessary to see them. I never
took in a moment of ``Survivor,'' for example _ that one I'm not
apologizing for _ but I was aware of the ``10 Little Indians''
rules of the game, and I know that a fellow named Richard Hatch,
who was generally thought of as conniving and unpleasant, walked
off with the $1 million prize. That's enough, right?
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, I can whistle ``Memory,'' the treacly anthem
of ``Cats'' (under duress), and the show's inherent puddy-tat
cuteness is something I managed to infer (accurately, it turns out)
years ago. Still, ``Cats'' is no nominal survivor; it's the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   It is beyond dispute that ``Cats'' _ which opened on Oct. 7,
1982, and will have its 7,485th and final performance on Sept. 10,
ending the theater's version of Joe DiMaggio's unassailable hitting
streak _ is more than a Broadway show. More than 10 million people
have seen it on Broadway alone, where its gross ticket revenues
have surpassed $400 million; the original Broadway cast recording
sold more than two million copies. Its monumental success is so
remarkable as to be laughable, an enduring (now and forever) joke
on the theme of nine lives. How many Leno and Letterman monologues
has it salted? How many New Yorkers, even those who have seen it
(and perhaps claimed not to), have disavowed its allure as tourist
fodder?
</P>
<P>
   Even the producers _ Cameron Mackintosh, the Really Useful
Company Ltd., David Geffen and the Shubert Organization _ engage in
a kind of chagrin over the show's longevity, periodically releasing
goofy statistics that make you shake your head at what they've
spent their money on in support of profits. By last count, 59,705
condoms have been used to protect the singers' body microphones;
maintenance workers have removed 237 pounds of gum from Winter
Garden seat bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   That ``Cats'' was once a hip, had-to-be-there ticket, that it
won seven Tony Awards, including best musical, and a Grammy for
best show album, ceased to be relevant years ago; its legacy is as
New York City's longest-lasting cultural paradox, a paradigm for
the restaurant that, in Yogi Berra's genius phrase, nobody goes to
anymore because it's too crowded.
</P>
<P>
   So, at last, I went. Twice, actually. First, just before it was
supposed to close in June, and then again this week to refresh my,
pardon the expression, memory. A panic, apparently, among ticket
buyers who, like me, had assumed they would always have the
opportunity, kept the show open through the summer on the force of
popular demand. It was fortuitous that I returned because,
curiously enough, I enjoyed myself more the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   I think that's because I knew what to expect from the stage and
was willing _ and more or less able _ to set aside my fundamental
distaste for many of the show's more prominent elements. My
impressions aren't terribly original in this regard, but let's get
them on the record and out of the way: Andrew Lloyd Webber's score
makes syrup out of each and every pop genre he borrows from. Too
many of the show's effects conjure a Vegas-y cheese, unworthy of
the director, Trevor Nunn; does Mistoffelees' toreador jacket
really have to light up?
</P>
<P>
   However gaudily effective John Napier's kitty costumes are (and
they are), the others are just silly, particularly those of the
Siamese invaders who overrun the pirate ship in the reverie of the
old theater cat, Asparagus; the characters, bouncing around in silk
pajamas with helmets that turn their heads into ornate teapots,
look like the progenitors of Teletubbies. The structure of the show
_ that of a feline revue, set in an alternative universe that looks
like a cartoonish junkyard _ is flaccid, unpropelled by a cogent
narrative or singular choreography. And the amplified sound muddles
the lyrics, obfuscating what could be a terrific pleasure for
English-speakers still in the audience (I heard five foreign
languages while in line to pick up my tickets): The rhythmically
virtuosic and delectable anthropomorphisms of T.S. Eliot's
children's poems on which the show is based.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot to complain about, but ``Cats'' has never been a
critic's show. (I'll be the one who finally shuts it down _ ha!)
The second time around, I willfully removed the critical half of my
hat and sought only the pleasures that have been so evident to
many.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Some have to do with the pure talent of performers. Jean
Arbeiter (Jellylorum is her character) gives a lovely, bell-clear
rendering of ``Gus: The Theater Cat,'' the sweetly fond paean, a
lullaby almost, sung by a young girl (kitten?) to the elderly and
feeble Asparagus, played by John Dewar, whose response is perfectly
on pitch _ impressive given the character's trembly, if proud, old
age. The two of them make the most of what is, by my ears, the
purest melody of the Lloyd Webber score, turning one of the show's
quieter and more unheralded scenes into its most affecting _
schmaltz, sure, but delicate and touching as against furiously
wrung out.
</P>
<P>
   Some others are a little subversive. ``Cats,'' like all
successful musicals, has a sensual element to it; Broadway dancers
are sexy, and though it sounds moderately perverse to say so, cats
are, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cat is not a dog,'' Old Deuteronomy reminds us in the show's
final number. (Jimmy Lockett, playing the role now, has a rumbling
bass that gives the pronouncement a pleasing gravity.) But I'd had
the thought already. During the show's busy and rather numbing
dance production numbers, I found myself focusing on one or another
lithe cat in a catsuit on the periphery and watching her stay in
character. You have to overlook the whiskers, but overall it wasn't
a bad strategy; cats bend and nuzzle in diverting ways.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, though, the available joys of ``Cats'' have to do with
its well-conceived and executed plan to seduce the audience. It
was, of course, the show that set the standard for the
bells-and-whistles colossi that transformed Broadway artistically
and economically in the 1980s (a bar Disney has recently raised),
but extravagant as it was, it was extravagance skillfully and
presciently deployed. It all begins with Napier's set, which,
obviating the convention of a proscenium arch, rising to the stage
rafters and wrapping around the balcony facade, turns the Winter
Garden into what museums and theme parks now call an environment.
It's probably the most glamorous rubbish heap the world has ever
seen, and it makes you feel right at home in the recognizable
detritus of civilization. (I found myself wondering whether the
makers of Coca-Cola, Die Hard batteries or any of several cigarette
brands, cereals and pet products paid a placement fee for their
prominence as identifiable garbage. They didn't.)
</P>
<P>
   That's theater magic _ the proverbial word, for lack of a better
one _ of a particularly accomplished sort; if you can make people
comfortable wallowing in the muck, you've suspended their disbelief
big time. And the opening scene perpetuates the effective unveiling
of a theatrical idea. As the actors slink and pitty-pat onto the
stage in their various cat guises and gaits, snuffling and arching,
rubbing against one another and the scratching-post props, a world
is being populated and defined. The calculated brilliance here is
that it's a world as comprehensible to a 5-year-old as to an adult,
and it buys the show an enormous amount of good will.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it is calculated, and as ``Cats'' has evolved, it has
come to milk its audience-friendly and, in particular, its
child-friendly shtick. It's hard to imagine that when it first
opened, the actors played to front-row patrons as often as they do
now, or that they routinely danced with children in the aisles, or
that such a significant percentage of the audience visited the
stage at intermission; it's like the subway at rush hour up there
these days. If you've come to see a show and not be part of it,
it's all a little patience-trying, but you'd have to be a terrible
spoilsport indeed not to recognize the democracy of ``Cats,'' and
not to delight in it. Happy young children, particularly if they're
rapt and behaving, are buoying company. The same might even be said
of giddy grown-ups.

`MADADAYO': IN THE SERENITY OF OLD AGE,   HE GAINS A MORAL
SPLENDOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Akira Kurosawa's last film, released in Japan in 1993
and opening Friday at the Cinema Village, is the delicate, blithely
sentimental story of a retired teacher and his devoted former
students. To call it a story may be something of an overstatement,
since ``Madadayo'' has none of the narrative intensity or epic
sweep for which Kurosawa is best known among American audiences.
The most dramatic and emotionally urgent passage in the movie
concerns the disappearance of a pet cat.
</P>
<P>
   Though the film is set in a specific and eventful period in the
Japanese past _ from World War II to the early '60s _ it takes
account of this history only obliquely, as a background against
which the emotional subtleties of character become visible.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the scenes take place in tranquil, orderly interiors,
which seem especially fragile and precious set against the rubble
and wreckage that lies outside.
</P>
<P>
   The main character is Hyakken Uchida _ a real-life man of
letters played by Tatsuo Matsumura _ whom we meet at the end of his
career as a professor of German at a military academy, as he
regales his final class with the mischievous humor that is soon
revealed to be his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Having decided to devote himself full time to writing, the
professor (or sensei, as he is addressed throughout the film, even
by his wife, played by Kyoko Kagawa), installs himself in a modest
house with his books and his writing desk. When two particularly
adoring students (Hisashi Igawa and George Tokoro) test the house's
security (and steal their teacher's bowler hat), they discover that
he has posted a ``Burglar's Entrance'' sign over his garden gate.
(Later he embellishes a ``urinating forbidden'' sign on a public
wall with a crotch-level drawing of a pair of scissors).
</P>
<P>
   Allied bombs soon force the professor and his wife to move to a
cramped, doorless hut on a burned-out estate, but the old man
maintains his impish good humor and basks in the admiring
solicitude of his acolytes, who organize the yearly birthday
banquets that provide the occasion for the film's title and give
the movie its most memorable scenes. The assembled students, after
offering tributes to the professor, chant ``Maadha Kai?'' (``Are
you ready yet?''). To which he responds, ``Madadayo'' (``Not
yet''), and then cheer him on as he downs an enormous glass of
beer. That's the movie: the portrait of a beloved man who loves
life and isn't ready for it to be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madadayo,'' in spite of its quiet tone and deliberate pacing,
has a similar effect. Its patient, precise camera movements and the
painterly clarity of its visual composition produce an effect of
serene, enveloping warmth. Like the professor, Kurosawa, without
undue fuss or ceremony, invites you into his world and puts you at
ease in it. The selfless, unaffected love that the professor
inspires, and the grace with which he receives it are presented
with a straightforward simplicity that becomes extraordinarily
moving.
</P>
<P>
   We don't learn much about Uchida's writing, his ideas or the
lives of his students beyond their relationship with him. Kurosawa
is interested less in the psychological nuances of this
relationship _ which he presents as entirely devoid of envy or
obsequiousness _ than in its moral purity. At the Maadha Kai
parties, the men sing about ``looking up to our teacher, thinking
of our debt,'' and the words are as heartfelt and unironic as the
Vivaldi on the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madadayo,'' in its exquisite and respectful sincerity, stands
out against both the cynicism and the maudlin excess that
characterize so many recent American movies and perhaps this is why
its release in this country has been so long delayed. But the fact
that it arrives posthumously _ Kurosawa died of a stroke two years
ago at the age of 88 _ gives it a quiet, valedictory power. With
its mellow, wry view of a man growing old, ``Madadayo'' is also
something of a counterweight to ``Ran,'' Kurosawa's overpowering
adaptation of ``King Lear,'' made in 1985 and re-released last
month.
</P>
<P>
   One of the professor's students calls him ``a lump of gold
without impurities,'' a judgment that might extend to ``Madadayo.''
It's not one of Kurosawa's great films; the compass of feeling is,
in the end, too narrow, the scope of human reference too
restricted. But it is, within its own proportions, nearly perfect.

 &HT;    CLINTON VETOES ESTATE TAX BILL
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton vetoed a bill Thursday that would
have repealed the federal estate tax, saying the measure was too
costly and that it would benefit only the wealthiest 2 percent of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other 98 percent of the American people literally get
nothing out of this,'' said Clinton. ``It is wrong on grounds of
fairness. It is wrong on grounds of fiscal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., criticized Clinton's
action. But he stopped short of threatening to try to override the
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has just given the back of his hand to
working families who want to leave their hard-earned family farm,
small business or Internet start-up to their children after they
die,'' Lott said in a statement. ``Apparently, even death can't
protect you from the Clinton-Gore administration's insatiable
desire for higher taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   By phasing out the estate tax, the bill, passed earlier this
summer by the Republican-led House and Senate, would have provided
wealthy families with a projected total of $105 billion in tax cuts
over the coming decade. White House analysts said only 54,000
American families, farms and small businesses would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Clinton, half the benefits would go to just 3,000
wealthy families, each of which stood to gain a tax-cut windfall
that he said would be worth, on average, $7 million per family.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the road, said Clinton, repealing the estate tax
would cut $750 billion from federal revenues between 2011 and 2021.
That's when the cuts, which would have been phased out gradually
under the Republican plan, would take full effect, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes referred to as the death tax, the estate tax is levied
against the assets of someone when they die and pass along their
estate to others.
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans actually pay such a tax, because the first
$675,000 of a personal estate is exempt from the tax, under current
law. Farms and small businesses get even larger exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton supports Democratic efforts to hike the personal estate
exemption further to $4 million, over time, and he held out the
prospect of compromise with congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party is not against reasonable estate tax relief,''
Clinton told reporters gathered in the White House East Room
minutes after he vetoed the legislation. ``But we have to proceed
on grounds of fiscal responsibility
</P>
<P>
   and fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to repeal the estate tax over 10 years passed in the
Senate in a July vote by 59-39. It passed in the House in June by a
margin of 279-136.
</P>
<P>
   Neither vote carried the two-thirds margin required to override
a presidential veto, and White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said he
was confident the presidential veto would stand.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used his veto to highlight election-year differences
between Democrats and Republicans on competing approaches to tax
and budget issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cast the estate tax repeal bill as part of a larger
package of Republican efforts to extend hundreds of billions of
dollars in tax breaks to wealthy families and large corporations
over the coming decade, a move he said would put the government
budget at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The government is projected to take in roughly $2 trillion more
than it spends over the coming decade, not counting Social Security
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   That is roughly the amount of the tax cuts proposed or approved
by the GOP-led Congress, according to White House tax and budget
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The estate tax repeal is part of a larger Republican strategy
to have now over $2 trillion of tax cuts over the next 10 years,''
said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you add it all up, (it) would take us back to the bad old
days of deficits, high interest rates and having no money to invest
in our common future.''

HYUNDAI TIBURON: ONE OF THE HIP ENTRY-LEVEL CARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the Ford Focus _ wagon, four-door, hatchback _ that has
become the latest exemplar of hip and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   In these times of renewed interest in entry-level cars that are
more than basic econoboxes, Consumer Reports magazine just named
the Focus its top-reated small sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler PT Cruiser falls into this category, though with
dealer-primed prices it's a bit expensive compared to others, and
so do the Volkswagen New Beetle and Toyota's Echo, although the
Echo does not seem to have caught on the way Toyota had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   So how about a surprising addition to the list? Can you say
Hyundai?
</P>
<P>
   The Hyundai Tiburon, two doors and seating for four, is a smooth
blend of sports car and sedan. Aimed at younger drivers, both in
price and appearance, its outside says verve, from its bulging
front fenders to the arc of spoiler that graces the plump rear
deck.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it's young and high-tech all the way: the center console
and its controls are angled toward the driver; techno-metal-looking
trim surrounds gauges, knobs, vents, and the shift housing (though
real metal would look a lot better than this aluminum-painted
plastic). There is one odd grouping of controls on a single pod on
the dash _ windshield wipers, cruise control, and rear window
defogger. But overall, the layout, with big knobs and easy access,
is quite functional.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that when you look at the Tiburon from the outside
you see sports car, it is surprising that it is as roomy inside as
it proves to be. The front-seat passengers have plenty of legroom,
and side-to-side space is made pretty good because of the way the
doors curve, giving concave space to the outer body.
</P>
<P>
   The back seat, also, can hold two adults in reasonable comfort,
a pair of children in plenty of space.
</P>
<P>
   For about $3,000 over base price, the tested Tiburon came with
an upgrade package that included leather power seats, better sound
system, the rear spoiler, and a power sun roof.
</P>
<P>
   The front bucket seats were wonderful, with firm ridges on the
outsides of the thighs and the back. Thigh support at the front of
the seat was firm and the backs were broad enough to support even
big-shouldered folks. I've seen far worse seats in far more
expensive cars.
</P>
<P>
   Since it's aimed at a younger crowd looking for performance, the
Tiburon needs at least a modicum of quickness and it has it _ in
places.
</P>
<P>
   When it was introduced in 1997, it came with a standard
1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine that bopped out 130 horsepower. Now, at
2.0 liters and 140 horses, it's reasonably peppy. It's not so much
that it's real quick from a standing start, but once it gets
cranking it loves to romp in the high RPM band.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its engine pushed regularly over two weeks of driving,
it managed just under 24 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   I found the five-speed manual shifter a bit sloppy and too long
in the throw. But for those tuners who like to tinker with their
inexpensive performance cars, I'm sure there's a conversion kit out
there that would tighten up the shift sequence and cut the throw by
40-60 percent _ at not a particularly high cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiburon, with gas-charged struts, stabilizer bars, and a
rigid body is a stiff little car. You feel the rigidity in corners
and it can be a bit jarring on bumps. But that's the case with lots
of sports cars and sports sedans and a price many enthusiasts are
willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off is a smooth, solid straight-ahead ride on the
highway, easy lane-to-lane transitions when passing, and virtually
no body roll when cornering.
</P>
<P>
   On my favorite rising and twisting hill, it made the transition
from corner to corner to corner with a sure-footed stickiness that
surprised me. Just as it comes off the assembly line, this car
could handle even more power from its engine.
</P>
<P>
   In testing cars, it is useful to ask how each might be used by
its buyer. The Tiburon _ it will be bought by adventurous types in
their first jobs, college-bound students (or their parents), or
enthusiasts looking for an inexpensive base from which to tune up
to a performance car _ can fill lots of needs.
</P>
<P>
   It seats four comfortably. It has a fairly large trunk that
becomes absolutely huge if you accept it as a two-seater and fold
the rear seats down. And on different days and on different
missions, it can be different cars for you. And in these times of
adventurous lifestyles, that is a good selling point.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that Hyundai's remarkable warranty _ 10 years, 100,000
miles for the power train, five years, 60,000 miles bumper-to
bumper, and five years, unlimited mileage roadside assistance
(including towing) _ and you've got an inexpensive, fun car well
worth looking at.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The air vents built into the front of the doors. Great
position from which to direct air flow right back at passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The wasted space between the front seats. You get a small,
covered bin toward the rear and the console slopes down _ slashed
by two tiny slots for paraphernalia _ toward the shifter. A bigger
box would have provided more storage and arm support as well.
</P>
<P>
   --A bit of humor:
</P>
<P>
   Open the ashtray (it's where I toss coins) and you see that the
Korean manufacturers have made sure to label this item for those
who might be confused. ``ASSY-TRAY,'' it says right there in raised
letters. So, that's where you put your butts.

WHEN SHOPPING PRESENTS A CARLOAD OF CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's go shopping for a car, but let's impose some rules.
</P>
<P>
   Here's $23,000 to spend, but as you shop, you can't use your
legs. You can only look at two-doors because you have to be able to
squeeze a wheelchair in behind the driver's seat, and the center
pillar of a four-door makes that impossible. You have to buy an
automatic. You must be able to reach and close your car's open
trunk lid from a seated position.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did I mention you can't take any cars for test drives? You
don't find cars fitted with handicap controls sitting on dealer
lots. You might find yourself shopping not for what you want, but
for what works.
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenge that has put Betsy Pillsbury, 47, into the
driver's seats of an eclectic lineup of autos in the 30 years she
has spent using a wheelchair. First car? A Gremlin. Chair went onto
the front seat beside her and had a tendency to slide off and hit
the accelerator in sudden stops. Then an AMC Pacer _ before Wayne
and Garth from ``Wayne's World'' made that car cool. Then a Nissan
Pulsar. Awful car, says Pillsbury, who is the assistant director
for special projects in the Massachusetts Office on Disability.
Today, she owns a 1991 Volkswagen Jetta, a car she likes, but also
a car that she must enter from the passenger's side and that she
has had to alter radically inside.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping goal on this Saturday? Find a car Pillsbury can
enter from the driver's side and simplify the complicated
entry-exit routine she goes through each time she drives.
</P>
<P>
   To get into the Jetta, for instance, she wheels up to the
passenger side door. Using her arms, she hoists herself into the
seat. Then she slides the seat forward. Reaches out and folds her
chair and lifts it onto the floor behind her. Slides the seat back.
Uses her hands to lift her legs into the car. Shuts the door. Uses
her upper body to pull herself across to the driver's seat _ an act
made possible only because she has had the center console ripped
from the car, and only then after she shifts from park to first so
her legs can clear the shift lever. Each time she exits the car,
she does all this in reverse, each time knowing that a slip puts
her on the ground, where she'll need help getting up or that _ and
this has happened _ her chair might roll away on a hill before she
can get into it.
</P>
<P>
   A string of simple acts to most folks can be a long chain of
challenges in Pillsbury's world. Her solution: simplify by
shortening the skein. Getting in on the driver's side would be a
big step in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   She likes her Jetta and has long had her eye on a Cabrio, so the
first stop is the Volkswagen Gallery in Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Levy, a sales and lease manager, steps forward to help.
Pillsbury tries a Beetle and finds the distance between her chair
and the outer edge of the driver's seat to be a bit wide. But she
says she could get used to it. Then she tries, after sliding the
driver's seat as far forward as she can, to fit her chair in behind
her. It won't go. And even if it did, the space between the back of
her seat and the front of the rear seat is too small to allow her
to slide the driver's seat back once she is ready to drive.
</P>
<P>
   As we shop, it is surprising to realize just how small that
space is. How small? Let's say you have average-size hands. Spread
your fingers and thumb as far apart as they will go. Look at the
distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger.
All she needs is two inches more than that. She doesn't get it in
the Beetle and, alas, the Cabrio is virtually the same size.
</P>
<P>
   But not all is fruitless at Volkswagen. Levy sincerely engages
Pillsbury in her challenge. He goes out to the lot to see if a Golf
might work. No. Neither will a Passat. So then he does something
Pillsbury says she has seen only once before. He starts
recommending cars made by other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   So it's back out into the Jetta _ where years of putting in the
chair and taking it out have worn away the fabric on the back of
the front seat _ and off to the Saturn dealership. Saturn sells a
three-door, with the third door on the driver's side. The rear door
opens toward the rear of the car, there is no center pillar, and
that leaves ample space through which to put a chair. The problem
is, there is little space behind the front seat and the chair would
only fit if placed on the back seat. That could be an arduous lift
and, in an accident, it could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But Pillsbury's biggest problem with the Saturn is that once the
third door is open and she is in the driver's seat, she can't reach
back to close that door. The salesman suggests tying a string to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strings break, and then where would I be?'' Pillsbury asks
later.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Focus, with a big front door and a trunk whose base is
at lap level, offers promise. But Reidar Davies at Jack Madden Ford
says that automatics are in short supply and the power seat
Pillsbury longs for is not an option. To fit her chair behind the
driver's seat, she'll have to remove one wheel, another task, but
one she is beginning to realize she might have to take on.
</P>
<P>
   At Boch Toyota, Steve Wight goes out to the back lot to bring in
a Solara, a relatively luxurious two-door that comes with Toyota's
reputation for longevity and power seats. At about $23,000, it's at
the top of her price range, though Wight says the manufacturer will
help out with the costs of installing special gas and brake
controls for Pillsbury.
</P>
<P>
   She goes back and tries the trunk _ can't reach it from the
rear, but because it is counterbalanced, she can easily close it
with a gentle touch from the side. She gets into the power seat,
slides it forward, and tries the chair. Still too wide, it misses
by about an inch. But she likes the car, and that causes her to
re-examine her possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the wheel off the chair is not a complicated task. Push a
button and pull off the wheel. Just don't drop it and let it roll
away. And it clicks right back on. And with the Solara, she'd only
have to remove one wheel, the floor space is plentiful and, Wight
shows her, the floor-anchor for the seatbelt folds out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a tradeoff, taking the wheel off _ or ripping out
the console'' and continuing to enter from the passenger's side,
Pillsbury says. By Monday morning, she sounds as though she's made
a choice. No more climbing between seats. She'll learn to deal with
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toyota looks like a winner,'' says Pillsbury, who played by
the rules.

REPORT CRITICIZES LIECHTENSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO MONEY LAUNDERING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A government-sponsored inquiry into whether
Liechtenstein is a center for money laundering found shortcomings
in the way the country handles the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Liechtenstein's justice system has been at a ``partial
deadlock,'' with some cases sitting idle for years, and its
assistance to prosecutors in other countries has almost ground to a
standstill, the special prosecutor, Kurt Spitzer of Austria,
concluded Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal proceedings remained unprocessed for years, hampered by
such things as inaction by judges and failures to respond to
requests for legal investigations and residential searches, he
reported. In some cases, any possibility of prosecution was
eliminated because of the time elapsed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The principality, which sits between Switzerland and Austria,
asked Spitzer, a prosecutor at home, to examine allegations that
Colombia drug cartels, a Sicilian Mafia group and Russian criminal
gangs were cleaning up sums by passing them through Liechtenstein's
asset managers and 300 banks. With a population of just 32,000,
Liechtenstein has some 300 banks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Liechtenstein was listed as one of 15 countries
failing to cooperate in fighting money laundering, and last month
millions of dollars linked to the late Nigerian dictator Sani
Abacha were traced to the country's banks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer shook up the country's clubby atmosphere when he had
documents seized from the bank owned by the realm's royal family.
The brother of the deputy prime minister and a member of Parliament
were detained for questioning during the inquiry.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, in his report, Spitzer concluded that white-collar crime in
Liechtenstein is ``no different'' than elsewhere in Europe. ``Most
assets that wound up in the principality to be laundered have
already undergone a pre-wash in other countries. This ought to
serve as a reminder to those countries which are now pointing the
finger at the principality,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mario Frick, the country's prime minister, acknowledged
``blunders'' in pursuing illegal assets but said the report showed
that ``Liechtenstein is not and never has been a criminal state.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liechtenstein has become a wealthy enclave by exploiting its
status as an offshore banking center. But pressures from the United
States and European countries to stamp out havens for criminals and
tax cheats forced the country in July to abandon its system of
anonymous accounts. Banks and fiduciaries are now required to
identify their clients and the source of their deposits.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's report singled out ``unjustifiable delays'' by the
judiciary and other legal officers in aiding other countries'
efforts to ferret out concealed funds. The principality has made a
pledge to give legal assistance to other nations, which has quashed
much of the vocal criticism of it from Switzerland. &QL;

RIGHTS GROUPS HAS SUMMONS SERVED ON LI PENG IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (Eds: This story will be updated as necessary) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four Chinese student dissidents and a man whose
sister was killed in the Tiananmen Square massacre are suing Li
Peng, the leader of China's Parliament, in a federal court in New
York, accusing him of human rights abuses. The case is the first of
its kind in this country against a Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed on Monday in U.S. District court in
Manhattan by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a non-profit
legal group that specializes in human rights cases. Among the five
plaintiffs, all of whom are living in the United States, are Wang
Dan, a prominent student dissident who organized democracy seminars
at Beijing University, and Zhang Liming, whose sister was killed by
a single bullet in the chaotic early morning hours of June 4, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Li was attending a conference of world leaders at the United
Nations this week and was served with a court summons early
Thursday at the condominium tower where he was staying in
Manhattan. In a tense confrontation, the summons was handed by a
process server to a State Department employee who was guarding Li.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit charges Li, who was prime minister during the
Tiananmen Square incident, with being ultimately responsible for
``crimes against humanity, including summary execution, arbitrary
detention, torture, and other torts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to prove that he is accountable for the crime, and
that this kind of crime, the human rights violation, is beyond
China's borders,'' said Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human
Rights in China, a New York-based group, which brought together the
plaintiffs and the lawyers. Qiang said that the lawsuit was quickly
assembled this summer in anticipation of Li's visit to New York,
which provided the lawyers with the opportunity to serve the court
summons.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from the Chinese consulate
general in New York or the embassy in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of similar lawsuits have been filed in the United States,
most of them brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights on
behalf of human rights victims in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has never apologized for sending in
soldiers who killed hundreds of student demonstrators at Tiananmen
Square. The government continues to insist that the student-led
demonstrations of the spring of 1989 constituted a
counterrevolutionary rebellion justifying the military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese perception of this will be that once again we are
attempting to interfere in what they view as a domestic matter,''
said Bob Berring, a professor of law at the University of
California at Berkeley who studies the Chinese legal system. ``I
think they would view this as the height of American arrogance. But
for the human rights community, they have to seize on an
opportunity like this to put human rights issues on the table. It's
a purely symbolic act, but that's what they need to get things like
this back on the agenda.''

`TITANIC TOWN': HOW AN IRISH MOTHER BECAME A WARRIOR FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Titanic Town'' is by no means the first film to portray the
profoundly disruptive effects on everyday life of the long-running
troubles in Northern Ireland. But in its harshly realistic scenes
of British Army tanks rolling across the lawns of a middle-class
housing development in West Belfast, it stirs your blood. As
helicopters hover overhead and armed gunmen dart from house to
house to flush out Irish Republican Army guerrillas in the middle
of the afternoon, the community appears to be a besieged enclave
continually terrorized by a ruthless occupying army.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that simple, of course. In 1972, the year this
beautifully acted film remembers with an acute eye and ear for
period detail, the Andersontown section of West Belfast, in which
``Titanic Town'' is set, was an IRA stronghold. But although
``Titanic Town,'' which opens today at the Loews State in New York,
aspires to be nonpartisan and on the side of peace, its portrayal
of British officials as supercilious and conniving, and the Irish
Catholic residents of Andersontown as victims, leaves little doubt
as to where the movie's political sympathies lie.
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Roger Michell from a screenplay by Anne
Devlin, is based on Mary Costello's autobiographical novel of her
own adolescence in Andersontown in the early 1970s. No sooner have
the McPhelimys, a family of six, moved to the area than they are
horrified to find themselves trapped in a war zone where sporadic
violence erupts at all hours of the day. The situation is so
stressful that before long Aidan (Ciaran Hinds), the McPhelimys'
pessimistic, sad-faced paterfamilias, develops a severe case of
bleeding ulcers and has to be rushed to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Bernie (Julie Walters), however, is so outraged by the
daytime skirmishes that she impulsively takes action and comes up
with the faintly comical notion of requesting that both sides
schedule their conflicts at hours that are less hazardous to
children. The final straw that drives her to undertake what evolves
into a full-scale peace movement is an IRA gunman's accidental
shooting of an innocent neighbor who is caught in crossfire.
Refusing to acknowledge its mistake, the IRA gleefully fans the
flames of hatred by blaming the British.
</P>
<P>
   When Bernie naively accepts an invitation to speak at a meeting
organized by local Protestant women, it is disrupted by an angry
mob of her neighbors, who storm the meeting hall, screaming curses.
She is deemed a traitor to the Irish Republican cause, and the
McPhelimys become neighborhood pariahs, harassed with death threats
and bricks tossed through their windows.
</P>
<P>
   All this is viewed through the frightened and resentful eyes of
the McPhelimys' teen-age daughter, Annie (Nuala O'Neill), who just
wants a boyfriend and a normal teen-age life. But her mother turns
a deaf ear to her misery. The harassment has only stiffened
Bernie's resolve to work for a peaceful solution to the violence.
Eventually she comes up with the notion of circulating a petition
among the women of Andersontown, calling for a cease-fire. The rest
of the film follows her uphill, eventually successful campaign for
support.
</P>
<P>
   Michell, a South African-born theater director and playwright
who was a resident director of the Royal Shakespeare Company and
created a splash with his adaptation of Jane Austen's
``Persuasion,'' emerges with ``Titanic Town'' as a gifted realist
filmmaker. Walters' powerful performance underplays Bernie's
heroism, emphasizing her bull-headedness, political naivete and
indifference to her family's needs. But as Bernie evolves, she
learns to become a more sophisticated political strategist and a
bit more sensitive to her loved ones' anguish. This blunt,
rough-hewn character is entirely devoid of vanity, even after she
becomes something of a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Devlin's screenplay shows a fine ear for everyday conversation.
But except for Hinds' haunted, anxious Aidan, the movie falters in
bringing the other McPhelimys (including Annie) fully to life. When
the movie ends with their departure from Andersontown, we still
don't know enough about who they are, where they came from or where
they're going.
</P>
<P>
   The soundtrack makes exquisite use of the early 1970s recordings
of John Martyn, the Scottish singer and songwriter whose romantic
growl also memorably embellished the end credits of ``The Talented
Mr. Ripley.'' &QL;

SOMETIMES, THERE'S NO FREE LUNCH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use on or after Mon., Aug. 4, 2000, by NYTimes News Service

Three days a week, around noon, Christine Robertson joins a bunch
of co-workers for a three- to four-mile jog. On the other two days,
she lifts weights and does a cardio workout at the on-site gym at
Countrywide Home Loans headquarters in Calabasas. Then it's back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   That period would be termed her ``lunch hour,'' but Robertson
never uses it for lunch, preferring instead to exercise and eat
later at her desk. Actually going out for a sit-down,
salad-entree-dessert affair at Chili's or California Pizza Kitchen?
Out of the question, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a desk job, you're sitting all the time, and by
the afternoon, you're lethargic,'' says Robertson, a treasury
technician. ``If I exercise, I come back invigorated for the rest
of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Refueled and invigorated. Sounds kind of like what nutritionists
say a good lunch is supposed to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Her use of the mandatory break for purposes other than eating is
hardly unusual. When they bother to take a lunch hour, American
employees are using less than half their allotted time to actually
eat.
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted by the International Dairy Association and
the National Cheese Institute says the average American uses 24
minutes to eat lunch with only 8 percent actually using the full 60
minutes to savor a meal. The term ``leisurely lunch'' is
practically dropping out of the English language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eat at my desk,'' says Rita McGuire, human resources manager
at Catalina Express in San Pedro, ``or I do 20,000 errands. There's
not a lot of time in our lives to do all that stuff. It's not just
me. Out of the 30-35 salaried people, I would say less than half
take lunch every day.''
</P>
<P>
   That 24 minutes of true munch time is down from other recent
surveys that placed the average eating time at 36 and 29 minutes.
Our workers aren't necessarily skipping the meal, however. The
Dairy Association/Cheese Institute survey showed that during a
typical work week, the average American eats lunch 4.2 times.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that doesn't specify (BEGIN ITAL)how(END ITAL)
they're eating. Technically speaking, you're not skipping the meal
if you eat at your desk, hit a drive-thru or log onto the Internet
and have one of those new lunch delivery services drop something
off at your office.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely classified as ``the most important meal of the day,''
lunch is still, doctors and nutritionists say, the natural midday
refueling point for anybody working an eight-hour day shift. And
even if we're not using that time to eat, most of us have it at our
disposal. Both federal and state labor codes require employers to
provide their workers with at least a 30-minute break for every
four hours worked.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch is also the meal people skip most often, according to
research conducted by the NPD Group, a consumer research
organization based in Rosemont, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's saying you have to synchronize your chewing and
swallowing to the cadence of a 60-minute oven timer, but doctors
say that, ideally, workers should be eating healthy meals, not
bolting the quickest thing they can pull through a drive-thru
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is anything you can swallow; fuel is what the body runs
on: whole grains, berries, nuts, vegetables; not McNuggets, Jamba
Juice and protein bars,'' says Dr. Michael Hirt, an internist and
the director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at the Encino
Tarzana Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The more time you take to eat and relax, the easier the
digestive process, doctors say. Still, being the resilient agent
that it is, your body will adapt and function even if you give it
30 minutes of refueling. Or even 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It will not, however, accept deprivation, and will signal you
with fatigue and low blood sugar once the proverbial tank gets too
low.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you fill up your car with gas, you don't expect it to take
you from L.A. to Seattle. That would be crazy,'' said Hirt, who has
a sub-specialty in nutrition. ``If you skip a meal, that's what
you're expecting the body to do _ take you to Seattle without
refueling. That's not the way the body works.''
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors see the increasingly scrunched lunch hour as
another indication that Americans are already stressed practically
to the breaking point. Got a free moment? Better do something,
quick! Time's a-wasting. Our quick eating habits, Hirt says, are
simply further proof that we don't know how to use a break like a
break.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Yellen, a clinical psychologist who practices in
Northridge and Sherman Oaks, says making full and personally
satisfying use of that hourlong break is as important
psychologically as it is physically. Most of us don't get the
luxury of the European siesta _ an extended nap before returning to
work _ but we do our bodies a favor by getting away from the work
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if somebody doesn't like eating lunch, the idea of the
midday break is important,'' says Yellen. ``A lot of people feel
that they have to get their work done. They don't understand that
they're losing efficiency because they won't be able to concentrate
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy it when I do go out,'' says McGuire, who
recently took a rare full-hour lunch to celebrate a co-worker's
birthday. ``The idea is great, and it's very healthy, but we just
don't do it in human resources or any level of management.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? If we need to eat, if most of us enjoy eating and
socializing, where does that hour go? Or why is a meal less a
priority than getting more work done, running errands or fitting in
a workout?
</P>
<P>
   It's too easy to blame that tyrannical boss or your own
professional ambition. Who can think of lunch _ or any kind of down
time _ when that report is due first thing Monday morning and
Smithers two desks over is just waiting for me to slip up so he can
move into my corner office? Remember that T-shirt that hard-core
exercisers wear: ``You can rest when you're dead''? In today's
labor market, some employees feel it applies to them as well.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the paranoid view. Some workers say that by offering
services like cafeterias, gyms, postal facilities and dry cleaners
on site, large corporations are actually trying to make their
employees' lives (BEGIN ITAL)easier((END ITAL). With every resource
nearby, organizing your life becomes less complicated, and you
don't necessarily need to burn up your lunch hour to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different work environment,'' agrees Kyser,
chief economist with the L.A. County Economic Development Corp.
``Today, there are a lot of single-person households,
multiple-earner households. People are trying to cram more things
into the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal thing _ to go sit and have a nice lunch and just
sort of refuel for the afternoon or to have a social lunch with a
friend or colleague _ is really a luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyser says he has no set lunch-hour routine, although he is
often giving presentations at lunch meetings, meaning he gets fed.
With offices so near the downtown branch of the L.A. Public
Library, sometimes employees will spend time reading and chilling
out. There's also a gym, a shoe repair, dry cleaners on site, and a
shopping mall and YMCA close by.
</P>
<P>
   Even without considering the competitive frenzy, Americans'
lives have become more complicated since the 1990s. Simply put,
we're busier. The hours we spend away from work aren't enough to
get everything done.
</P>
<P>
   It's the rare employees, then, who can take that 60 minutes and
just put the rest of the world on hold. They do exist, and Catalina
Express's McGuire has seen them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a group here that sits in a room and watches a
one-hour soap from 1 to 2 p.m. every day,'' McGuire says, ``eating
and talking and laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in the process, making certain an important and very
healthy tradition doesn't slip away. &QL;

&HT;     PENTAGON OFFICIAL SAYS MISSILE DEFENSE ISN'T READY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Clinton administration divided over
whether to deploy a controversial missile-killing weapon by 2005, a
top Pentagon official says the complicated system of rockets,
satellites and sensors faces so many technological hurdles that it
won't be ready by that date.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's chief of testing, Philip Coyle, said the project,
known as National Missile Defense (NMD), ``has demonstrated
considerable progress'' in three flight tests to date, two of which
failed and one of which scored a direct hit. But he stressed that
``test results so far do not support a recommendation at this time
to deploy in 2005.''
</P>
<P>
   In an internal Pentagon memorandum dated Aug. 11, Coyle took the
Pentagon to task for not including more ``realistic'' flight tests
that would better replicate actual enemy missile launches against
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the $36 billion program have complained that the
Pentagon was not testing NMD against the types of intercontinental
ballistic missiles an enemy such as North Korea or Iran might
employ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deployment means the fielding of an operational system with
some military utility which is effective under realistic combat
conditions, against realistic threats and countermeasures when
operated by military personnel at all times of day or night and in
all weather,'' said Coyle. ``Such a capability is yet to be shown
to be practicable for NMD.''
</P>
<P>
   Because much more work needs to be done, it is time, said Coyle,
that Pentagon officials consider shifting the program ``toward a
realistic'' deployment date.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, stamped ``For Official Use Only,'' is an
acknowledgment that NMD won't be ready when the military asserts
that North Korea will have ballistic missiles capable of striking
the United States. Additionally, the comments could undermine the
rationale for President Clinton to move ahead with the program.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was first reported by Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen is scheduled to make a
recommendation to Clinton in the next few weeks about whether to
build a specialized radar station on Alaska's Aleutian Islands.
That radar, which would be used to scour the horizon for signs of
enemy missiles bearing down on the United States, would be the
first step in deploying NMD.
</P>
<P>
   The memo comes as the administration is sharply divided over how
to proceed _ if at all _ with NMD. Some in the State Department
assert that even just letting contracts for construction of such a
radar would violate a 1972 arms control treaty with Russia. Cohen,
however, has said that construction could begin without violating
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the decision-making process, Cohen and his staff are
assessing the missile defense program's technical progress to date,
cost, arms control implications and the potential enemy threat.
Coyle's comments are part of the input Cohen will weigh.
</P>
<P>
   The arms control implications of NMD have emerged as a major
concern for NATO allies, Russia and China, which have argued that
the nuclear balance of power could be thrown off kilter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Washington says that NMD would be used only against
so-called rogue nations such as Iran and North Korea, Moscow and
Beijing are worried that NMD might render their nuclear arsenals
obsolete. They have warned that NMD could force them to build
improved classes of nuclear weapons, thereby triggering an arms
race.
</P>
<P>
   NMD also is being designed to provide protection against an
accidental nuclear missile launch in Russia, sparked by decaying
Soviet-era equipment or a weapon that falls into the hands of a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   According to current Pentagon plans, the program will be
constructed in several phases. At first the anti-missile system
will use 20 interceptors based in Alaska. But by 2007, the Pentagon
plans to add another 80 interceptor missiles, which would increase
the cost to about $60 billion.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unrelenting heat will cover much of the southern Plains and
lower Mississippi Valley on Friday as sinking currents of air in a
strong high pressure zone continue to suppress clouds. Isolated
afternoon thunderstorms may form near the western Gulf Coast.
Meanwhile, cooler air will remain north of a stalled front in the
northern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   A sluggish low-pressure area surrounded by clusters of clouds
and showers will continue to drift west across the eastern Gulf
Coast States. Clouds and rain will be most persistent near the
central and southern Appalachians where moist winds ascend the
sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will remain humid with early fog yielding to areas
of limited sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Cool air and scattered rain will prevail over the Northwestern
States while the Southwest is warm with ample sunshine.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SUMMER'S CRESCENDO
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock, Ark., the heat and drought of the summer reached
a peak on Wednesday. Under a cloudless sky, the mercury soared to
111 degrees, a record high temperature there. Combined with a
stifling low of 83 degrees, the average daily temperature of 97
degrees was also the highest recorded in Little Rock. In addition,
Wednesday was the 26th straight day without rain, the longest dry
period in Little Rock weather history. Cooling showers spreading
west across the Gulf States are unlikely to reach Little Rock this
weekend. &QL;

HOME VIDEO: SOVIET MUSICALS; NEW RELEASES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   IN STALIN MUSICALS THEY SING OF COAL
</P>
<P>
   In a week of giant DVD releases, it's good to note smaller ones
like Dana Ranga's ``East Side Story,'' about Soviet bloc musicals
from the 1930s through the '60s. ``We have sex _ we have all that
here,'' says a proponent of the lyrically limited but often wildly
colorful shows Stalin loved and indeed rescued when he personally
lifted the ban on ``The Jolly Fellows'' in 1934. On Tuesday Kino
will release the disc along with a DVD of Carlos Marcovich's ``Who
the Hell Is Juliette?'' (1997) a partly fictionalized documentary
about a free-wheeling 16-year-old Cuban girl whose gambols, ranging
from Havana to New York, have the makings of a musical themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In Marcovich's film, Juliette (Yuliet Ortega) befriends a
Mexican model several years her senior (Fabiola Quiroz), makes a
music video and frolics in front of the camera, childish one minute
and seductive the next. And behind what was once the Iron Curtain
in ``East Side Story,'' the workers get frisky. ``Rocka docka,''
someone sings. ``We sing the song of the coal press.''
</P>
<P>
   Together these films make a sporty pair out there in some mighty
big company. DVD has entered the era of the 1-million-disc release,
another sign that it is on its way to becoming the format of the
future. ``Jaws,'' issued in July, was the first older title to
reach 1 million. This week there are ``Braveheart,'' Mel Gibson's
13th-century Scottish saga, and ``The Sound of Music'' from Fox.
Always good for another sellout edition, come whatever the
anniversary or format introduction, George Cukor's film version of
the Trapp family musical is so clear on DVD, wrote a reviewer, that
one notices the texture of the nuns' wimples when they're praying
in the abbey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Braveheart'' has an entertaining documentary about the making
of the movie, with Gibson sprinting from the start of battle scenes
he leads as the rebel William Wallace to a position behind the
camera, where he takes up the rest of the fray as director. Another
thing one learns about making a film near Inverness in the chilly
Scottish north is that when it rains one might as well keep
shooting because it isn't going to stop anytime soon. It was almost
enough to keep Gibson from taking his shirt off _ almost.
</P>
<P>
   In the week's third big DVD release, a two-disc edition of Paul
Thomas Anderson's ``Magnolia'' from New Line, it is raining frogs
in California as the director trots frenetically around various
sets in an excellent documentary included on the disc. Slickly
packaged in a slip case, ``Magnolia'' probably won't break the
million mark, as is certainly the case with ``Men in Black,'' to be
issued in three editions next week by Columbia Tri-Star. In its
most elaborate version, Barry Sonnenfeld's sci-fi action comedy,
starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, includes editing workshops
that let viewers chop up a scene to their liking and other extra
features from ``character animation studies'' to ``tunnel scene
deconstruction'' and for more along those lines, the ``Edgar Bug
fight scene deconstructed using angles.''

   With his legendary quarterback out for the season, Tony D'Amatao
(Al Pacino, left, yelling his head off), coach of the Miami Sharks,
turns to the erratic young backup Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx), while
in the stadium's luxury suites the Sharks' cold-blooded owner
(Cameron Diaz) plots to get the team's asking price up to $800
million. In sync with a sports-crazed society, Oliver Stone's big,
loud movie has fun with the Associated Football Franchises of
America, his commerce-crazy equivalent of the National Football
League. On the field it's war, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York
Times, in a ``crude morality play in the style of Stone's `Wall
Street.'''

   `AMERICAN PSYCHO'
</P>
<P>
   Mary Harron's film trims the body count and number of high-end
consumer items from Bret Easton Ellis' novel. By day a budding Wall
Street master of the universe, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale)
becomes a homicidal maniac by night. As an arrogant smoothie one
minute and a hysterical wimp the next, Bale gives a star-making
performance, and Harron's direction produces a horror comedy
classic ``so surprising that when the movie's over, it feels you've
just seen a magician pull a dancing rabbit out of a top hat''
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   2000. Universal. $107.37. 104 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
Release date: Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   `THE NEXT BEST THING'
</P>
<P>
   Using the words ``It's me, not you,'' a lot of men have begged
out of relationships with Abbie Reynolds (Madonna), a Los Angeles
yoga teacher. Having helped bear her woe, Robert Whitaker (Rupert
Everett), an aging gay Hollywood party boy, shores her up when
necessary and, as a consequence of one giddy, drunken occasion,
fathers a child with her. But then she falls for a New York
investment banker (Benjamin Bratt), which leads to a messy
parenting conflict and turns a film with smart promise into ``a
stumbling, poor man's ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' (Holden).

   2000. Paramount. $107.37; DVD, $29.99. 107 minutes. Closed
captioned. PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   `SIMPATICO'
</P>
<P>
   Trying to sketch in information that Sam Shepard's play omits,
Matthew Warchus' offbeat, gawky adaptation thrives with gripping
performances and a screenplay that skillfully imitates the
playwright's language. Horse racing is the metaphor for the
adrenaline-pumped American dream as a corrupt breeder (Jeff
Bridges) and his wife (Sharon Stone) tangle with a hard-drinking
eccentric (Nick Nolte) who threatens to expose some slippery
dealings over a high-priced steed. At least the film has integrity.
``Far from being a typical Hollywood desecration of a difficult
play, it stays true to the work's quirky, renegade spirit''
(Holden). &QL;

<P>
   `LONGITUDE'
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Dava Sobel's international best seller, Charles
Sturridge's film tells the parallel stories of John Harrison
(Michael Gambon), the 18th-century carpenter, clockmaker and
musician whose nautical timepieces attempted to solve the
complexities of longitude at sea, and Rupert Gould (Jeremy Irons),
the World War I Royal Air Force veteran who rescued Harrison's work
from oblivion. With plenty of political intrigue stirred in, Julie
Salamon wrote in The New York Times, ``the film surprises, much as
the book did, by taking what might seem a worthy but dull subject
and making it sparkle.'' 2000. A&AMP;E. $59.95, four cassettes; DVD,

Impromptu in A flat and Chopin's Mazurka in A minor. Filmed at the
Alte Oper in Frankfurt, Verdi's Messa da Requiem is performed by
the European Symphony Orchestra and the Neubeuren Choral Society.

HOWARD BUFFETT INVESTS, TOO, BUT CORNFIELDS COME FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 3)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ill. _ Howard Buffett, the 45-year-old son of the
investing legend, does not spend his days surveying stock charts or
analyzing corporate growth prospects. He surveys cornfields from
the cab of his John Deere tractor.
</P>
<P>
   He also drives a Ford pickup, wears battered blue jeans and
flashes an aw-shucks grin. If people still don't understand, he
puts it more pointedly: he may have a dad who is worth roughly $29
billion, but his grain bins here are not Fort Knox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have that much money,'' he said with a grin
burnished by frequent use. ``I'm not the guy listed on the Forbes
400 list.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the eldest son of Warren E. Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha,
Howard Buffett stands to become the next chairman of Berkshire
Hathaway, his father's holding company-turned-gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors circulating on the Internet last winter about his
father's supposedly failing health made the succession a delicate
subject. In fact, though the senior Buffett did have surgery in
July to remove a section of colon containing noncancerous polyps,
he celebrated his 70th birthday last week in good health at home in
Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't feel better,'' he said in a telephone interview
last week. But if he were hit by a car tomorrow, he said, his
chairmanship would pass to Howard.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Buffett has arranged matters so that, although his son
will not run the company himself, he will provide crucial
oversight. ``I want Berkshire and the culture to continue, and he
would be there to ensure that happens,'' Warren Buffett said. ``And
he has my ideas about who I think should be running it.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Buffett, meanwhile, is content to farm a 700-acre spread
near here where he lives with his wife, Devon, a 16-year-old son,
Howard, and one of his four step-daughters. He serves as chairman
of the GSI Group, a maker of agricultural equipment. He also does
charitable work on conservation and health issues and travels
regularly to countries like Uganda and Zimbabwe to photograph
exotic wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love wildlife,'' he said. ``I used to sleep out in the
back yard with my dog when I was growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Howard Buffett and his two siblings, Susan, 47, and
Peter, 42, have staked out their own lives, quite apart from the
world of value investing that Warren Buffett has come to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Peter found music, and made a name for himself in Hollywood by
writing the score for a scene in ``Dances With Wolves.'' Susan
worked at The New Republic and at U.S. News &AMP; World Report, then
switched to philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   And Howard? Well, Howard chose tractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved the outdoors,'' he said. ``I'm very
mechanical. When I got out of college, I just wanted to run a
bulldozer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on his farm, though, he cannot avoid intrusive questions
about his father's publicly stated intention to leave the bulk of
his fortune to charity rather than to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he leaves me 1 percent, I'll be OK,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Even scraps of the Buffett empire would be a colossal
inheritance. As things stand now, a mere 10 percent bequest divided
among the children would still give them each nearly $1 billion, to
add to the ``small gifts'' of stock that Howard Buffett said that
he and his siblings have received from their father at
Christmastime.
</P>
<P>
   What the Buffet children do not inherit, they may yet control.
Susan and Peter already serve on the board of the Buffett
Foundation, which is expected to become one of the world's largest;
Howard has a seat on Berkshire's board. All three have charitable
foundations of their own, financed by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   If Warren Buffett planted a seed of succession early on, it may
have been in naming his first son, Howard Graham Buffett, after two
men he greatly admired: his own father and Benjamin Graham, his
mentor and former professor.
</P>
<P>
   He also passed along to his son a love of sports. Saying that
Howard worships the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team doesn't
really tell it: His office at GSI is festooned with Cornhuskers
autographed footballs, sweatshirts and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   After attending three different colleges himself _ and working
as a bulldozer operator, farmer and real estate salesman _ he
served as a county commissioner in Omaha. Then he moved to Decatur
to work for Archer Daniels Midland, the giant grain handler.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after the company became mired in a price-fixing
scandal in which he was not involved, he resigned, sold his stock
and bought the farm _ a proposition that did not pass his father's
value-investing test but won paternal approval anyway. ``It's not a
good business,'' Warren Buffett said of farming last week. ``But
it's a satisfying business.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Buffett also bought a stake in GSI, one of the largest
makers of grain storage bins, betting _ as his father might _ that
the growth of genetically engineered crops would oblige farmers to
erect separate storage facilities for conventional and biotech
grain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is he a chip off the old block? He answers the question with an
avuncular, plain-spoken tour of his office, a joke about his weight
and a confession that he has been known to accept chocolate milk
shakes during interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in my dad's philosophy, buying for the long term and
holding,'' he said at last.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father, Howard Buffett has bought a few technology
stocks. But both men have a weakness for well-known brands and
neither is above a bit of boosterism. Howard speaks effusively of
his love for John Deere tractors; his father is often seen at
Berkshire's annual meeting swigging Cherry Coke and snacking on
Dairy Queen ice cream, both made by companies in the Berkshire
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, when Howard Buffett met a guest at local
restaurant for a meal of pork chops and mashed potatoes, he
jokingly snarled at a waiter who was showing off a Pepsi logo
tattooed on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   When his guest ordered a Coke, Buffett feigned a trot to the
men's room. In fact, he left the restaurant and made a beeline for
a Coke machine in a nearby parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's your Coke,'' he said when he returned. ``The Buffetts
don't drink Pepsi.'' &QL;

   NEW SERVICE E-MAILS MUSIC TO SUBSCRIBERS
</P>
<P>
   By BOB KEEFE
</P>
<P>
   c 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ As its executives battle Universal Music Group over
copyright issues in a New York courthouse, online music company
MP3.com Inc. teamed up with another record label on Thursday to
launch a service
</P>
<P>
   that e-mails new music to some subscribers as soon as songs are
released.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com said the Internet service it's rolling out with Time
Warner Inc.'s Elektra Entertainment label was the first of its
kind. It's also the first time an independent online music company
has done a major joint venture with a traditional record label.
</P>
<P>
   As the entire online music industry struggles to find ways to
stay alive after being hammered by several negative court rulings
nationwide, San Diego-based MP3.com has been the most aggressive in
trying to forge
</P>
<P>
   better relationships with major recording companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to,'' explained Nitsan Hargil, senior Internet
analyst with the Kaufman Brothers investment banking firm. ``They
were not only humbled in court, but they had their heads taken off.
They know that
</P>
<P>
   becoming more legitimate is the only way they can go.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, a federal judge found MP3.com guilty of infringing on
five recording companies' copyrights. Since then, MP3.com has
reached settlements with four of them, including Time Warner, under
which it will pay for the use of their songs.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth company, Universal, opted not to settle. A judge in
New York heard testimony in the case this week and is expected to
make a decision on penalties against MP3.com by Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com isn't the only company whose courtroom woes are changing
the fledgling online music industry, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Napster Inc. in July lost a separate but similar copyright
infringement lawsuit filed by the Recording Industry Association of
America. A three-judge panel in San Francisco is scheduled to hear
that case on
</P>
<P>
   appeal during the first week of October.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com and Elektra hope to make money with their new service by
pairing the e-mail music with advertising. Internet links also will
take listeners to the artists' or Elektra's Web sites, where they
can
</P>
<P>
   purchase complete CDs immediately.
</P>
<P>
   For Elektra, the service _ dubbed ``singleserving'' _ also gives
it a new advertising medium without a major expense. And with
MP3.com's extensive database, where users have described their
tastes, ages and other
</P>
<P>
   information, Elektra can target particular markets or listeners
with particular tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The singleserving e-mail service is groundbreaking in that it
gives major labels the opportunity to achieve full media saturation
immediately upon the release of new music,'' Michael Robertson,
chairman
</P>
<P>
   and chief executive of MP3.com said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, MP3.com took another step toward the
mainstream, striking a deal with a company planning a chain of
stores and entertainment complexes. Under that agreement, patrons
of Outernet
</P>
<P>
   Inc. could use computer kiosks to digitally download different
songs from different artists using MP3's site and ``burn''
custom-made compact discs for $1 a title.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Hargil said he expects MP3.com and other online music
companies to continue seeking new ways to become more legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for a business model that can work,'' he said.

   `THE REPLACEMENTS'
</P>
<P>
   Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Brooke Langton, Jack Warden, Ace
Yonamine, Orlando Jones
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Howard Deutch
</P>
<P>
   Rating: PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 105 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The movie's tag line gets the point across like a tackle
rumbling along with a recovered fumble: ``Pros on strike. Everyday
guys get to play!'' After that, everybody might as well go home
because absolutely nothing happens that one hasn't seen before in a
sports movie.
</P>
<P>
   With his $5 million-a-year players walking the picket line, Ed
O'Neill (Warden), the natty, boozy owner of the Washington
Sentinels, enlists Jimmy McGinty (Hackman), that great old coach
from the 1980s, to put together a team of scabs to carry on the
season. McGinty rounds up a crowd of characters he has known (we
all have known, actually): the mad-dog linebacker, the swift
receiver who couldn't catch a balloon, the inevitable convict on
loan from prison, the 400-pound lineman down from 600 pounds. (He's
a sumo wrestler.) ``I love to see a fat guy score!'' McGinty
exclaims. He's come to the right place.
</P>
<P>
   For a quarterback he hires a sad sack named Shane Falco
(Reeves). While at Ohio State, Falco was so badly whipped by
Florida State that he has quit the sport in shame and now scrapes
barnacles off yacht bottoms. The point McGinty wants to get across
to him and all his misfits is that they aren't losers and for this
one moment they can be all they ever dreamed of. So crank up those
self-images, get out there and kick some shins.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty strikers turn over Falco's pick-up truck, but he swallows
his self-loathing and starts to throw touchdown passes. What's
more, he's a selfless leader, which impresses Annabelle (Langton),
who heads a very hot crew of cheerleaders from a local strip joint.
But to reach the playoffs, the fill-in Sentinels will have to
defeat the genuine Dallas team, the league champions, who have just
crossed the picket line. That's absurd, of course, but do you doubt
that redemption is at hand?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Football bumps and bruises are augmented by a
whistling-good barroom brawl.
</P>
<P>

   ``You should be working,'' reads a message taped to the spot on
the ceiling where Sebastian Caine (Bacon) occasionally gazes when
he's at his computer. The hard-driving Caine heads one of the more
sensitive research projects around Washington. He and his team
inject animals with blue fluid and make them invisible. Trouble is,
they can't make them visible again _ until one night when Caine
cracks the reversion problem and they reconstitute a gorilla named
Isabel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's sensitive. There's no stating how badly the Pentagon
wants this stuff. But without telling the military, Caine decides
to take the project to level three _ humans, specifically himself.
This alarms his assistants: Caine's ex-lover Linda (Shue), Matt
(Brolin) and Sarah (Dickens), the project veterinarian, who already
has a problem with Caine over his vivisectionist's attitude toward
the animals caged at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Caine injects himself and disappears. Unlike
Isabel, however, he can't be brought back. At first he is annoyed,
but soon he begins to enjoy popping around the lab scaring the
daylights out of his team members, who can't detect him unless they
wear infrared glasses or he's in contact with liquid, which
outlines his form. Later there's nothing to do but escape from the
lab and have some fun on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this brings out darker elements in Caine, who
immediately rapes a neighbor he's previously only admired through
the venetian blinds. Then, while invisibly spying on Linda, he
discovers she is having an affair with Matt, which sends him back
to the lab for a gory run of terror. The glasses would help.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Graphic and extreme, with people and animals skewered,
ripped and snapped.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Caine strips down completely (rear view) before his
injection, and there is partial nudity at other times.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: As pronounced as the violence.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE: Not that children should find their way into this
film, but if they do, many will be upset at the treatment of their
animal friends. &QL;

   There she sits, all dewy and ripe and positively gurgling at the
notion of taking up with the nicely notorious, crinkly-eyed
millionaire restaurateur 26 years her senior. This being fairly
routine for the graying, tousled 48-year-old Will (Gere), it is
with a kind of weary, amused resignation that he's drawn into an
affair with 22-year-old Charlotte (Ryder). It's OK for now, he
tells her, but she should understand that they have no future.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he doesn't understand the ramifications of that
remark. Will is old enough for Charlotte's mother, and in fact he
was involved with her mother before her death. As for Charlotte,
she is ill with a tumor and a heart problem that has her collapsing
around town at dramatic moments. She hasn't long, he learns _ a
year at most.
</P>
<P>
   Will being Will, he has a rooftop fling with an old girlfriend.
To him, that is as consequential as walking the dog, but it rankles
Charlotte. He encounters another attractive young woman
(Stringfield), only this time it's his daughter, whom he's never
met. Mulling that one over and deciding he can't do without
Charlotte, he begs her to let him love her.
</P>
<P>
   After reuniting very cute, she glows and acts adorably feisty
while he stays devoted and trots around looking for a surgeon to
operate on her when the time comes. Then, around Christmas, the
crisis strikes.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: None.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Will and Charlotte make love, but gauzily and mostly from
the shoulders up.

   NEW SERVICE E-MAILS MUSIC TO SUBSCRIBERS
</P>
<P>
   By BOB KEEFE
</P>
<P>
   c 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ As its executives battle Universal Music Group over
copyright issues in a New York courthouse, online music company
MP3.com Inc. teamed up with another record label on Thursday to
launch a service
</P>
<P>
   that e-mails new music to some subscribers as soon as songs are
released.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com said the Internet service it's rolling out with Time
Warner Inc.'s Elektra Entertainment label was the first of its
kind. It's also the first time an independent online music company
has done a major joint venture with a traditional record label.
</P>
<P>
   As the entire online music industry struggles to find ways to
stay alive after being hammered by several negative court rulings
nationwide, San Diego-based MP3.com has been the most aggressive in
trying to forge
</P>
<P>
   better relationships with major recording companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to,'' explained Nitsan Hargil, senior Internet
analyst with the Kaufman Brothers investment banking firm. ``They
were not only humbled in court, but they had their heads taken off.
They know that
</P>
<P>
   becoming more legitimate is the only way they can go.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, a federal judge found MP3.com guilty of infringing on
five recording companies' copyrights. Since then, MP3.com has
reached settlements with four of them, including Time Warner, under
which it will pay for the use of their songs.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth company, Universal, opted not to settle. A judge in
New York heard testimony in the case this week and is expected to
make a decision on penalties against MP3.com by Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com isn't the only company whose courtroom woes are changing
the fledgling online music industry, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Napster Inc. in July lost a separate but similar copyright
infringement lawsuit filed by the Recording Industry Association of
America. A three-judge panel in San Francisco is scheduled to hear
that case on
</P>
<P>
   appeal during the first week of October.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com and Elektra hope to make money with their new service by
pairing the e-mail music with advertising. Internet links also will
take listeners to the artists' or Elektra's Web sites, where they
can
</P>
<P>
   purchase complete CDs immediately.
</P>
<P>
   For Elektra, the service _ dubbed ``singleserving'' _ also gives
it a new advertising medium without a major expense. And with
MP3.com's extensive database, where users have described their
tastes, ages and other
</P>
<P>
   information, Elektra can target particular markets or listeners
with particular tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The singleserving e-mail service is groundbreaking in that it
gives major labels the opportunity to achieve full media saturation
immediately upon the release of new music,'' Michael Robertson,
chairman
</P>
<P>
   and chief executive of MP3.com said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, MP3.com took another step toward the
mainstream, striking a deal with a company planning a chain of
stores and entertainment complexes. Under that agreement, patrons
of Outernet
</P>
<P>
   Inc. could use computer kiosks to digitally download different
songs from different artists using MP3's site and ``burn''
custom-made compact discs for $1 a title.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Hargil said he expects MP3.com and other online music
companies to continue seeking new ways to become more legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for a business model that can work,'' he said.

HIGHER INTEREST RATES FAIL TO STEM EURO'S SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ It was supposed to be a show of steely
toughness, an antidote to the chronic weakness that has plagued
Europe's single currency, the euro, ever since its debut in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
   But when the European Central Bank raised interest rates
Thursday for the sixth time in less than a year, the euro continued
to founder near its all-time low amid widespread fears that it will
sink even lower. Indeed, more than at any time in the short history
of the euro, many analysts view the central bank as not only weak
but off balance in response to changes in the economic climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are behind the curve,'' said Thomas Mayer, a senior
economist with Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, who argues that the bank
is getting tougher just as the European economic growth shows signs
of getting weaker. ``In April 1999, they reduced interest rates
even though the economy already seemed to be taking off. We could
very well be in a similar situation right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed in large part by what it called the ``protracted
depreciation'' of the euro, the European Central Bank raised its
baseline interest rate by a quarter point Thursday, to 4.5 percent.
In a brief statement, the bank said the euro's weakness threatened
to push up the cost of imported goods at a time when high oil
prices _ compounded by the fact that oil is priced in dollars _
were threatening to ripple through the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But if the move was supposed to build confidence in the euro, it
did not. Within minutes of the announcement, the euro slipped
slightly to roughly 89 cents against the dollar. It fell further
later in the day, settling at 88.78 cents _ the lowest it has been
quoted in New York trading.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the European Central Bank faces a devilish
problem. The euro has lost nearly one-quarter of its value against
the dollar since its introduction, and the biggest cause of that
decline has been the United States' magnetic draw on investment
money from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   If the weak euro does indeed fuel inflation, its credibility and
value in world markets will slip further. But if central bankers
slow down economic growth in an attempt to avoid inflation, the
euro could lose value as investors and corporations tilt even more
heavily away from Europe and toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``European corporations are voting with their pocketbooks,''
said Paul Mortimer-Lee, markets economist with BNP Paribas in
London. ``If you raise interest rates too far there is a danger you
will squeeze growth.'' And that, in turn, would hurt the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Though European inflation remains low, at an annual rate of 2.4
percent a year, it is now above the central bank's self-imposed
limit of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts argue that the central bank and its president, Wim
Duisenberg, are clamping down on the money supply at a time when
European economic growth already appears to be peaking. Though most
economists predict that the overall growth of countries in the euro
zone will expand by more than 3 percent this year and next, recent
surveys show that business confidence has declined in Germany,
France and Belgium in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The inflationary signals have been ambiguous as well. Stripping
out the impact of oil prices and other one-time increases, the
underlying rate of inflation is still very modest at 1.3 percent.
And although higher oil prices can ripple through the rest of the
economy, especially in wage demands from labor unions, the European
Central Bank's most recent assessment is that those effects have
not shown up in non-energy goods.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result, the move to raise interest rates has thus
far had the opposite effect on the euro that central bankers
wanted. In the two weeks since central bankers began sending out
clear hints of their intentions, the euro has weakened
significantly. Indeed, after staging a modest rebound in June, the
euro is now just a smidgeon above its all-time intraday low of
88.25 cents against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB has trapped itself, Mortimer-Lee of BNP Paribas said, by
setting an inflation target that is too rigid. The Bank of England
and the Swedish national bank, neither of which is part of the
euro-zone, have set targets of about 2 percent but allowed for
greater flexibility by letting the rate vary 1 percentage point
above or below the target. The European Central Bank, by contrast,
has set 2 percent as the upper limit and never really set a lower
limit.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, economists generally agree that the euro's woes
reflect the persistently faster growth of the United States in
comparison with Europe. ``There is a massive flow of money into the
United States, and that has become a major new influence in the
past two years,'' said Ian Gunner, a currency analyst in London at
the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States' investment allure ties back to its higher
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do companies want to take over other companies?'' Gunner
asked. ``It has to do with the general well-being of the economy.
The Euro-zone is one year into its recovery and the ECB is already
worried about inflation. That is just not very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the euro was introduced, Europe has experienced a combined
net outflow of both direct investment in companies and properties
and portfolio investments in stocks and bonds that total about 200
billion euros. Much of that reflects a sharp increase in
trans-Atlantic mergers, from Daimler and Chrysler to Credit Suisse
Group's $13 billion deal this week to acquire the investment
banking firm Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of analysts complain that the European Central Bank
has been inherently slow to recognize changing economic conditions.
Most economists believe the bank erred when it sharply reduced its
core interest rate from 3 to 2.5 percent in April 1999. At the
time, central bankers were afraid the Asian financial crisis and
the collapse of Russia would lead to a severe slowdown in western
Europe. The fears were correct, but by the time the rate was
decreased Europe was already exhibiting many signs of renewed
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The current problems are complicated by the widening divergence
of growth rates within the euro-zone. Germany, Europe's biggest
economy, lagged far behind the pack and grew by less than 2 percent
in 1999. But Ireland has been growing at well above 5 percent.
Irish consumer prices are surging at an annual rate of 6.2 percent,
while housing prices are climbing at about 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the ECB, the president is more of a moderator and
consensus builder than a strong leader,'' said Mayer of Goldman
Sachs. The process of building a consensus is more time-consuming
and difficult than at the U.S. Federal Reserve, he said, and that
may have made the European Central Bank slower in its response.

bands' music to subscribers as soon as its released. The service is
the latest incarnation of the online music business and - just as

   TIRE-DEALERS _ ATLANTA _Local tire dealers say things seem to be
slowing down but they're having trouble and paying more to get
tires, particularly Michelins. Many customers want their Firestones
off whether recalled or not. At least 5 percent of NHTSA complaints
(and maybe 28 percent) are Firestone tires of other sizes than
recalled ones, and NHTSA hasn't ruled out a wider recall. GA
attorney general is considering joining in on class-action suits

   DELTA _ ATLANTA _ Delta is finally getting the ``-air'' out of

delta-air.com for its web site, apparently because it was too slow
to grab the easier-to-remember delta.com url when the Internet was
in its infancy. Now its bought the delta.com rights (we're checking
how and from whom) and will announce the switch friday. Also, the
airline is setting up a separate e-business unit to coordinate

   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA _ The tire crisis for
Bridgestone/Firestone has become a crisis for other tire
manufacturers as well. As consumers look for alternatives as
replacement tires, other manufacturers find that this windfall of

Goodyear expects to ramp up production of the tires sizes in
question by as much as 50 percent. Other manufacturers are planning
similar increases in production. (Sharp, Atlanta

having to do it in front of millions of people watching your every

pressure to perform is also insanely intense. Many adult actors
can't even take the heat and often resort to drugs and alcohol to

into his hands. The Dorseys were one day into a five-day,

campus when a wave of doubt and homesickness struck the 18-year-old
quarterback. ``You know mom, I don't know if I've made the right

``I'm going to be a million miles from my friends, my family,
everyone and everything that I know. Did I do the right thing?''

ADVERTISING: MINK APPAREL PRODUCER TARGETS YOUNGER WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``ladies who lunch'' seem to have had their fill of fur
coats, so American Legend, the maker of the finest mink coat
available, is turning to their daughters to try to convince them
that mink is the ultimate luxury item and an absolute fashion must.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Legend is introducing a print campaign that drops
the stodgy studio glamour shots of a sophisticated model clad in a
full length mommy-looking mink coat in favor of showcasing a sexy
young model on the beach posing in versatile mink items including a
skimpy mink bikini.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to sell grandmom's fur coat any longer,''
said Edward Brennan, the chief executive of American Legend, which
is based in Seattle. ``When we decided to relaunch our new vision,
we said, `Now we want to position it from a fashion perspective,
keep it totally unexpected and young.'''
</P>
<P>
   After a considerable amount of consumer research, Brennan said,
it is clear that the positioning of the company's fur coats in
North America was ``not really effective in terms of bringing back
young potential consumers.'' Therefore, he added, ``our strategy
was all about bringing something to a fashion-forward girl that's
modern, exciting, fun and useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing on the traditional mink coat, the campaign
is focusing on nontraditional mink clothing and accessories with
casual chic attitudes, like cropped bolero jackets in various
colors, vests, knitted sweaters, fur-trimmed jeans, blankets,
headbands, bikinis, hats and purses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is not only to draw consumers' attention to the
high fashionability of mink, but also create awareness for Legend
the brand,'' Brennan said. ``It is important that consumers
recognize that mink is not a commodity. If they want the very best
quality, they need to look for the Legend label.''
</P>
<P>
   Legend is designed and sold by J. Mendel on Madison Avenue and
through his salon in Bergdorf Goodman. Legend will also be
available in September through the company's Web site at
www.legendmink.com.
</P>
<P>
   A decade or so ago, furs had fallen out of fashion as the
economy dipped and they became associated with spray-paint assaults
by animal-rights advocates. It was also all the rage for
celebrities to lend their faces to ads that stated that they'd
rather be naked than wear fur.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, however, the taboo has lifted
somewhat and fur has quietly crept back into the American fashion
world, first by showing up in the lines of many top designers on
collar trims and accessories. Now it has boldly asserted itself in
full-page fashion layouts.
</P>
<P>
   American Legend has had a history of memorable ads that also
featured celebrities, taking pro-fur stances, of course. In the
1960s, the company along with the adman Peter Rogers created the
long-running campaign ``What Becomes a Legend Most'' for one of its
other trademarks, Blackgama. Those ads featured stars like Lauren
Bacall, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland,
Rita Hayworth, Lena Horn, Barbra Streisand and many others swathed
in fur.
</P>
<P>
   The latest campaign, created by Laspata/DeCaro in New York with
billings estimated at $2 million, also features an ``it'' girl.
This time, though, she comes from the fashion world, not Hollywood.
The supermodel Frankie Rayder is featured posing on a beach in
Malibu, Calif., in a retro satire of 1960s surf movies like ``Beach
Blanket Bingo'' and ``How to Stuff a Wild Bikini.'' And who better
to join her for a cameo appearance? The king of those surf movies
himself, Frankie Avalon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked to showcase the brand in the most unexpected
light,'' said Charles DeCaro, creative director at Laspata/DeCaro.
``And what could be more unexpected than mink on the beach?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously with a `Beach Blanket Bingo' subtext to the
campaign, it was sort of a no-brainer to contact someone that was
part of that genre, and Frankie Avalon seemed the perfect
addition,'' DeCaro added. ``He was the remaining ingredient that
this whole equation needed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ad featuring the two Frankies, they are shown posing in a
bit of an awkward embrace. She looks secure and sultry in her
$5,500 mink- and-leather bikini and sarong. He is clad in all
white, yet not quite sure what to do with himself. As a wink to
both Avalon's film career as well as the famous ad campaign that
inspired the Legend brand, Avalon's white shirt says ``What Becomes
a Legend Most?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not want to set out to recreate the Legend campaigns of
the past,'' DeCaro said. ``They were phenomenal and iconic in their
genre.'' But for the new campaign, he continued, ``it was much more
important to capture the fashion pulse in a very sort of
tongue-in-check way.'' The subtle way that they reintroduced the
famous line on Avalon's T-shirt was ``definitely a segue to
possible future campaigns,'' DeCaro added.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen other ads feature Rayder wearing a variety of mink
items. One ad shows her wearing a white mink sweater over a daisy
bathing suit as she joins four tanned, clean-cut surfers in
carrying a surfboard. Another ad features her dancing on the beach
with the same models, this time wearing a creamy gold mink bolero
over a gold lame bikini top and pants. All the ads have the
tagline: ``J. Mendel for Legend. American Legend Mink.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted to show the diversity of the brand,'' DeCaro
said. The technology is so much more advanced than it was in the
past that mink can now be used in many different ways, including
being cut to look like corduroy or even resemble velvet, DeCaro
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more important to get that across and definitely reach
toward a younger, more hip consumer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign begins running in the September issues of magazines
including Elle, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, In Style, Nylon, Town &AMP;
Country, Vanity Fair and Wallpaper. This is the second effort from
Laspata/DeCaro since it was awarded the account in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to position Legend as the very best of the best, so
would the average girl be able to go in and buy a beautiful Legend
bikini?'' Brennan asked. ``I would say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, in fact would it interest her to go look at other
products that could be affordable and really could useful today
that she is not aware of at the moment?'' he continued.
``Absolutely yes. And that's the point.''

TITANS-BILLS REMATCH HIGHLIGHTS OPENING WEEK OF THE NFL SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK (SUNDAY, 8 P.M.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee at Buffalo
</P>
<P>
   This of course is a rematch of the ``Music City Miracle'' which
was Tennessee's last second kickoff runback in the playoffs last
year that won the wildcard playoff game against the Bills. Though
Buffalo plays well at home, the Titans won't stumble, mainly
because the Bills don't have the run defense to stop Eddie George,
who had 1,304 yards rushing last season. In the preseason it has
sometimes taken four defenders to bring him down.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction; Titans, 28-21
</P>
<P>
   Arizona at Giants
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals' quarterback Jake Plummer has 11 fourth-quarter
comebacks in 36 career starts. It is his sometimes-electrifying
play that has made him one of the best young throwing talents in
the game. Last year, however, Plummer, because of a bad thumb and
even worse decisions, tossed 24 interceptions. He's looking to
rebound immediately and should pick apart a weak Giants secondary.
The Giants hold on in a high scoring game behind the defensive play
of Michael Strahan and quarterback Kerry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 35-28
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore at Pittsburgh
</P>
<P>
   This game could not be more perfect for Baltimore's top defense.
Quarterback Kent Graham is a solid passer but his wide receivers
are young, which means the offense's chemistry might be off, making
them susceptible to the blitz, and the Ravens love to blitz. Middle
linebacker Ray Lewis, a murder trial fresh in his memory, wants to
take out the pain of what he feels was an unfair prosecution on
opponents. Quarterback Tony Banks will have a better game, and
better season, than many think.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 28-14
</P>
<P>
   Carolina at Washington
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins have more big-time players than an NBA all-star
game. The problem with possessing all that talent-and it is a
problem a lot of coaches would love to have-is getting it all to
mesh. There will be rough spots early in this game and early in the
season. The Panthers might actually jump out to a halftime lead.
But eventually all that talent will kick in, and what made the
Redskins so good last year, quarterback Brad Johnson, running back
Stephen Davis and wide receiver Michael Westbrook, will dominate a
weak Panthers' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins, 25-13
</P>
<P>
   Chicago at Minnesota
</P>
<P>
   Please, everyone, relax about the Vikings' quarterback
situation. Daunte Culpepper will be just fine. He does have the
Hall-of-Famer Cris Carter and brilliant Randy Moss to throw to.
There will be bumps for Culpepper, but few quarterbacks have failed
in Dennis Green's offensive system. Besides, to slow down
Minnesota, a team has to have a great running game, and Chicago's
Curtis Enis does not qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 28-17
</P>
<P>
   Detroit at New Orleans
</P>
<P>
   Running back James Stewart is the key. For Jacksonville last
season, before he signed with the Lions as a free agent, Stewart
had 13 rushing touchdowns. In preseason he has displayed the kind
of quickness and power Detroit had hoped for. He will stabilize
what has been a chaotic situation with quarterback Charlie Batch,
who is still recovering from a broken leg. Batch's status as
starter will be determined late in the week, and that delay always
throws off game plans. Still, the Lions survive.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 24-10
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis at Kansas City
</P>
<P>
   This game will let the Colts know early the challenge that lies
ahead. Knowing Indianapolis is a strong Super Bowl favorite, every
team will play its best against the Colts. The Chiefs finished the
preseason 0-4 but has won eight of their last 10 regular-season
games at home. Quarterback Peyton Manning wins this one in the
final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 20-17
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville at Cleveland
</P>
<P>
   Biggest mismatch of the weekend. The Browns have no chance,
especially because quarterback Tim Couch, the savior, is playing
poorly. Quarterback Mark Brunell should have a healthy set of
statistics after this one, even though Courtney Brown, the No. 1
overall pick, might get to him a time or two.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 28-6
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco at Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are fighting to avoid finishing last in the division,
while the Falcons are fighting to get back to the playoffs. San
Francisco is young and not very talented. Jeff Garcia is the first
49ers quarterback other than Joe Montana or Steve Young to start
Week 1 since 1980. If preseason is any indication, and it likely
is, Garcia will be good for throwing about two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 17-10
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay at New England
</P>
<P>
   There should not be much suspense in which team will win: The
Buccaneers will, of course. What will be interesting to watch is
how well the offense blends with wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson in
the fold. During one preseason game, the Buccaneers ran the same
play seven consecutive times _ a running play. Bland. But the team
will open things up against New England, and Johnson will be the
focal point. Will the team implode once Johnson begins demanding
the ball? That is Tampa Bay's biggest question as the team makes a
Super Bowl run.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers, 19-7
</P>
<P>
   Jets at Green Bay
</P>
<P>
   Favre did the right thing this week. He rested his tired
throwing elbow, though there is still a question of when the elbow
will fire up again. Most likely that won't happen against the Jets.
Actually, both the Packers and the Jets have problems at
quarterback. Vinny Testaverde seen little action in preseason,
which will surely affect his timing with the offense as well as his
endurance. Since Favre is at home, he wins the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 20-13
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia at Dallas
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Donovan McNabb finished the preseason with an 89.7
passer rating. The rest of the NFC East should be getting a little
nervous. The second-year quarterback is starting to get a good feel
for the game. Throw in talented runner Duce Staley, who accounted
for 41 percent of the team's offense last season, and Philadelphia
could end up steamrolling an aging Dallas team.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles, 21-6
</P>
<P>
   Seattle at Miami
</P>
<P>
   Probably the toughest game of the week to call because the teams
are so evenly matched. The edge probably goes to Miami since they
are at home and play well in season openers. Also, Seattle
quarterback Jon Kitna was disappointing in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 21-14
</P>
<P>
   San Diego at Oakland
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ryan Leaf gets the start for the Chargers and his
rebirth begins. Known more for being a crybaby than a professional
thrower, maybe Leaf can turn his career around. If that does
happen, it won't start against the Raiders, whose secondary is
pretty solid. Oakland sticks to its excellent ground game and wears
down the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 15-7
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Denver at St. Louis Rams
</P>
<P>
   There will be times this season when the Rams feel the crush of
being the defending Super Bowl champions. But not this game. On the
surface, this seems a close matchup but the Broncos don't have the
speed to keep up with St. Louis on that slick artificial surface.
Terrell Davis has bravely made the comeback from torn knee
ligaments but few players come back from those injuries quickly.
Denver will be forced to rely on quarterback Brian Griese, who is
extremely inconsistent. This might be a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 30-21.

&HT;     GROUP PREDICTS LOW VOTER TURNOUT IN NOVEMBER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a spirited race between Vice President Al
Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, voter turnout in the 2000
presidential election could be the lowest in modern American
history, according to a study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, director of the nonpartisan Committee for the Study
of the American Electorate, said low turnout in the primaries,
scant political coverage by the major television networks and an
increasingly disinterested public were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical problem with which the leaders and parties must
deal is mobilizing an electorate which is showing that the old-time
religion of civic duty and responsibility no longer hold sufficient
sway to propel many to the ballot box,'' said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential race, voter turnout dropped to 49
percent of the voting-age population, equaling the total in 1924 _
the lowest percentage for a presidential election in the modern
era.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Gans' organization predicts turnout will be lower
on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Gans said despite the interest sparked by Arizona Sen. John
McCain's renegade bid for the Republican presidential nomination,
voter turnout in the primaries was about one-third lower than the
average turnout two decades ago, falling to 17.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gans attributed this decline to the primary process in which
both parties' candidates are effectively chosen early by a handful
of large states, making most voter participation unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic nominee, and Bush, the Republican Party
candidate, had won enough support by early March to ensure their
nominations _ months before the party conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Gans advised the candidates to find a way to energize alienated
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fall-off in voting after the crucial decisions have been
made is unfortunate but understandable, but the long dormant time
between the end of the contested primaries and the fall campaign
may pose problems in re-mobilizing the electorate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gans said the major television networks should increase their
political coverage to help voters learn about the candidates and
their stances on issues. He noted that the two major conventions
this received the smallest amount of coverage ever from the
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks can say that with everything decided, there is
nothing to cover but what is to cover and critique is the image and
issues the parties are presenting by their judgement of what is
their best case,'' Gans said.

WILL ART   FILMS   SURVIVE   ONLY AS   RELICS? 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world buried under a blizzard of polls, rankings, financial
statistics and endless official data, we are increasingly pressured
to trust in the absolute authority of numbers. Paradoxically, in a
world where centuries-old religions tremble before the onslaught of
American pop culture, it is tempting to throw up one's hands and
clutch at the fantasy that individual lives can still be (in the
sudsy language of television) ``touched by an angel.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions between traditional faith, modern rationality and a
belief in magic are the crux of ``The Decalogue,'' the Polish
filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski's 10-part, 10-hour masterwork filmed
for Polish television in 1988. ``The Decalogue,'' which had its
first New York theatrical release this summer, was an art-house hit
at the Lincoln Plaza in Manhattan, where it earned $247,711 during
its eight-week run.
</P>
<P>
   That number is minuscule by the standards of Hollywood, which
had 12 summer releases that grossed over $100 million each. It was
enough to earn ``The Decalogue'' a repeat engagement at the
Screening Room in TriBeCa, where it will be shown, starting Friday,
in two-episode programs that change weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Does the popularity of ``The Decalogue'' mean that the so-called
art film is alive and well?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no, but with an emphasis on no. From the rosiest
perspective, the art film, whose ``golden age'' (the 1950s and
'60s) is currently being celebrated in a popular series at Film
Forum in the South Village, is far from moribund. Most critics
would agree that the cinemas of China, Iran, France, Denmark,
Taiwan and Spain, among other countries, are flourishing
artistically, if not producing many masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   This summer also saw the theatrical release of three films
worthy of comparison to the classics being screened at Film Forum.
Besides ``The Decalogue,'' there was the French director Bruno
Dumont's ``Humanite,'' which enjoyed an extended run at Film Forum,
and the Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami's ``Wind Will Carry
Us,'' which is still doing healthy business after several weeks at
the Lincoln Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   By far the grandest of the three, ``The Decalogue,'' whose 10
stories are set in and around the same Warsaw housing project,
offers an epic vision of the troubled human spirit at the end of
the 20th century. With its fatalistic mood and enigmatic, carefully
layered symbolism applied to a realistic setting, the cycle
suggests a broader, more balanced and cosmopolitan descendant of
Ingmar Bergman's anguished soundings of the soul in its dark night.
</P>
<P>
   Kieslowski, who died in 1996 (he was only 54), is arguably the
greatest inheritor of this tradition, which included not only
Bergman but also Michelangelo Antonioni, Robert Bresson, Carl
Dreyer and Luis Bunuel among its masters. Each of the 10 fables of
``The Decalogue'' is a contemporary variation on one of the Ten
Commandments. Far from preaching in the Hollywood biblical manner,
these tales gaze with a searching (and sometimes teasing)
concentration into the gaps between faith and reason, destiny and
chance, cause and effect, to discern elusive glimpses of a higher
moral order governing human fate. Because they're stories created
for a television series, they're also extremely entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humanite'' and ``The Wind Will Carry Us'' offer piercing but
narrower personal cinematic visions. Dumont's film enters the mind
of a policeman who may or not be responsible for the crime he is
investigating: the savage rape and murder of a young girl. Every
image and sound is charged with an undercurrent of prowling animal
menace. In stripping away a protective layer of psychic skin to
evoke the policeman's apprehension of the physical world, this
profoundly pessimistic but compassionate film finds the potential
for animal violence in all its characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wind Will Carry Us,'' in its sympathetic portrayal of a
hard-scrabble peasant existence in the arid Iranian countryside,
recalls the humanistic films of the great Indian director Satyajit
Ray. Its (sometimes frustratingly) elliptical story follows an
engineer from Tehran to a remote rural area of Iran for reasons
that are only hinted at and discovers a society in which people are
so rooted to the earth that there is no room for brooding
metaphysical speculation. Life simply goes on. These people, in
tune with nature's rhythms and accepting of its caprices, live in a
largely unconscious spiritual harmony with the world.
</P>
<P>
   While preaching a familiar live-in-the-moment message, the film
avoids sentimentality through its literary austerity and its sly,
glancing humor, and by mesmerizing us with the sheer beauty of the
landscape. Europe's Forbidden Loves
</P>
<P>
   A film that falls just below this level is the German director
Max Farberbock's ``Aimee and Jaguar.'' Set in wartime Berlin, this
true story of the lesbian relationship between Felice Schragenheim
(Maria Schrader), an assimilated German Jew risking her life to
work in the Jewish underground, and Lilly Wust (Juliane Koehler),
the wife of a German Army officer, is a wrenching, beautifully
acted romance with historical resonance.
</P>
<P>
   On a level below that is ``Solomon and Gaenor,'' a gritty,
well-acted variation on ``Romeo and Juliet'' set in an impoverished
Welsh mining village in 1917. The tragedy that results when a
deceitful Russian-Jewish immigrant from an Orthodox family
impregnates a young Protestant woman is touching, if predictable.
</P>
<P>
   If art films can still draw small audiences into theaters,
evaluated in hard dollars-and-cents terms, the genre is a withering
relic. With the rise of the multiplex, the number of art houses in
the United States has diminished by as much as two-thirds since the
early 1990s. American audiences increasingly have no patience with
subtitled films. As the globalization of popular culture
accelerates, homegrown cinema in other countries is being
overshadowed by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Even in France, which has Europe's most heavily subsidized film
industry, Hollywood films accounted for 91 percent of the country's
film revenues this summer. While American movies like ``M:I-2'' and
``Gladiator'' cleaned up at the box office, only 1 out of 20
French-made films was a solid hit. The increasing failure of so
many French films to engage the public has given rise to much
grumbling and is viewed as a looming cultural crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As for high-minded films from the United States, the pickings
this year have been slimmer than ever. The New York Film Festival,
which opens on Sept. 22, has few high-profile American films, since
Hollywood, for its own marketing reasons, would rather unveil its
prestigious fall releases two weeks earlier at the Toronto Film
Festival. Some believe that Hollywood's aversion to New York is
based on a fear that potential hits might suffer commercially if
showing them here first caused them to be perceived as too
highbrow.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper social and cultural currents are also working against the
art film as we've known it. The probing psychological realism and
erotic frankness that seemed revelatory and boundary-breaking to an
older generation are now taken for granted by younger audiences
inured to (and amused by) ``The Jerry Springer Show.'' Today
everyone knows the vocabularies of psychotherapy and of sex
according to Krafft-Ebing and Masters and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a sign of the times that two of the summer's biggest
art-house hits, Mike Hodges' ``Croupier'' and the revival of Jules
Dassin's ``Rififi,'' are smart, stylish genre films that don't
probe great metaphysical depths. ``Croupier'' is a cleverly plotted
caper film with a flashy central performance by Clive Owen, who
exudes some of the charisma of the young Michael Caine. The likable
``Rififi'' is more influential as a granddaddy of the caper film
than it is artistically substantial.
</P>
<P>
   In this climate the term ``art film'' itself seems increasingly
like a relic. When applied strictly to a business in which the word
``art'' is thrown around loosely, it doesn't really describe the
majority of smaller independent movies that have helped revitalize
American cinema in recent years and that make up the backbone of
the annual Sundance Film Festival. Even if many of them show more
integrity and personal vision than most Hollywood fare, hardly any
aspire to the lofty intellectual tradition of the greatest European
films from 1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   The word that might best describe the more ambitious American
independent films playing in New York right now is the same one
applied to 1990's rock music: alternative. ``Chuck and Buck'' and
``The Tao of Steve,'' two smart independent films that were first
seen at Sundance, both focus on the kind of geeky men that
mainstream Hollywood films reflexively ridicule. In ``Chuck and
Buck,'' a young man suffering from an acute case of arrested
development travels to Hollywood and stalks his best friend from
childhood with whom he played boyhood sexual games. (MORE)  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _The Reform Party, torn apart by the dubious
posturing of both Pat Buchanan and John Hagelin as its presidential
nominee and heir to its founder Ross Perot, is but a ghost of its
former self.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is not clear just what those Reform folks should be
called these days. The party is too chaotic to be described even as
an organization any more, a designation that implies some internal
order.
</P>
<P>
   It has imploded, demolished by the Buchanan battering ram like
some empty, decaying building of no use to anyone any more.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for the empty title of presidential nominee between
Buchanan, the conservative commentator, and Hagelin, the obscure
physicist from Iowa, is, unsurprisingly, less about political
influence than about money.
</P>
<P>
   Both contenders are demanding that the Federal Election
Commission turn over to them the $12.6 million in taxpayer funds
the old party earned by winning more than 5 percent of the vote
four years ago. But this is not same political group playing by
confusing but comprehensible rules that it once was. It is not even
one group, but two. These people do not meet any logical standard
to warrant recognition as a legitimate political party.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense says the FEC should refuse to pick between the two
men and tell their non-existent party to take a hike. The law need
not sanction the pretense that this farce deserves public financial
support.
</P>
<P>
   Surely creative FEC lawyers can find some way to throw the
matter into the courts, where it will languish until the election
is over. A federal judge in Virginia, in fact, may have suggested
the complications of just such a development this week by refusing
to intervene in the presidential power struggle. Buchanan allies
had sought an order barring the Hagelin faction from using the
Reform Party name.
</P>
<P>
   The judge hid behind the familiar excuse of a lack of federal
jurisdiction, which prompted Buchanan's lawyer to declare he would
shift to a state court.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin, like Buchanan, has threatened to take to court any FEC
ruling refusing him the money. And both candidates are waging legal
and political battles to get on state ballots for which they do not
automatically qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Neither can claim much public support or interest. Hagelin does
not even get a tiny bump in the polls, and Buchanan, who previously
twice sought the presidency, got only 1 percent in a recent USA
TODAY-CNN-Gallup Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's celebrity has dominated the Reform Party tragicomedy,
but it has not worked to his advantage. A lot of people know who he
is but don't like his hard-edged, intolerant right-wing views.
</P>
<P>
   He attempted to take over the Reform label by inventing new
rules and stacking the convention with buddies of no previous
Reform Party identification or sympathy with its causes.
</P>
<P>
   The original, outraged Reformers regrouped around Hagelin,
tossed a rival convention and declared themselves the real core of
the party, which they seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, this debacle is a product of Buchanan's irrational,
raw ambition and political unpopularity. He left the Republican
Party only after his flopping presidential candidacy reflected a
fatal GOP weariness with his fiery oratory. He treated the Reform
campaign as his personal vehicle to power and money, counting on
his celebrity to make voters forget that he had no vision and no
message.
</P>
<P>
   He recently had gall-bladder surgery, but that is not generally
considered a permanently dangerous condition that could stop his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's worst move may have been his desperate effort to
match the inclusive approach of the Democrats and Republicans by
picking a Los Angeles woman named Ezola Foster, who happens to be
African American, as his running mate. It was a shockingly
frivolous selection of a person with not a single qualification to
be president, let alone vice president. Based on that sample of his
political judgment, he doesn't deserve even the 1 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan chose Foster, a conservative activist and typing
teacher who is a former member of the far-right John Birch Society.
According to the Los Angeles Times, she collected workers'
compensation payments for nearly a year for a mental disorder she
now says she never had. She has never held an elected public
office.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Buchanan has never held an elected office either. His
basic qualification for the presidency is having a combative,
conservative, motor mouth. And taxpayers are supposed to reward
that with $12.6 million earned by a party that no longer exists in
any responsible form?
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin, of course, is no better. He's never held public office
either. We just don't know him as well.
</P>
<P>
   A political plague on both their heads, and on their party, and
on the FEC if it doesn't keep that $12.6 million out of their
greedy, undeserving hands.

(Editors: second E in Renee has an accent) 
By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
NEW YORK _ The last time we talked to Renee Zellweger, when she
starred with Meryl Streep in ``One True Thing,'' she had no new
films planned, no real home to call her own, a director boyfriend
(Josh Pate) and an adored 10-year-old dog named Dylan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In two years, Zellweger's world has turned considerably. She's
completed four pictures, the third of which, ``Nurse Betty,'' opens
Friday. The fourth, ``Bridget Jones' Diary,'' due next year, made
her a favorite target of the British press, which felt a Texas gal
should not play the much-sought title role from the English best
seller.
</P>
<P>
   She has also found a home _ a Hollywood Hills house the Los
Angeles Times reported as costing ``about'' $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   And her new boyfriend _ well, not so new anymore _ is superstar
comedian Jim Carrey. In March, Zellweger, whose public persona is
shy and quiet, was shown in Cosmopolitan sporting a tattoo _ a
temporary one _ with Carrey's name, on her backside.
</P>
<P>
   But not everything has changed, thank goodness. Dylan _ a
collie-golden retriever mix, now 12, is still the light of
Zellweger's life. With apologies to Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, in a suite at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue,
Zellweger was just back in the United States after seven months in
England filming ``Bridget Jones' Diary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited to be home,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Though she insists she is just beginning to work off the pounds
she gained to play Bridget _ a London career woman who thinks of
herself as overweight, though that may be all in her mind _
Zellweger looks much like she did when she played Tom Cruise's
romantic thrill in ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a little bit there, a little bit different,'' she
says of the pounds. It doesn't show, despite her snug sweater and
tight black slacks. ``I'm going for runs again now because I can. I
like to. I guess I'm just going back to Renee.''
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger wears no shoes, no earrings, no necklace, no rings,
not even the expensive friendship ring that Carrey is supposed to
have given her, during her interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? I always don't wear jewelry,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger, 31, a University of Texas graduate, had a good bit of
film and TV experience before going from obscurity to overnight
fame as the convincingly sweet, infinitely appealing single mother
in ``Jerry Maguire.'' Some reviews praised her for stealing the
film from Cruise. But movie history is littered with forgotten
leading ladies du jour of male superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger survived by avoiding more roles like Dorothy in
``Jerry Maguire.'' She surprised everyone, and offended some, by
playing a Hasidic Jewish wife going against husband and tradition
in ``A Price Above Rubies.'' She was Streep's ungrateful, rather
unpleasant daughter in ``One True Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year she was, briefly, the sweet girlfriend again, this
time in the forgettable ``The Bachelor.'' Then she showed a
different side in the rude, crude comedy ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene''
earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about an image change _ was she at all concerned with what
folks back in her hometown of Katy would think?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' she says. ``Of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not so much concerned about what people might think, but
uncomfortable. I'm a pretty private person when it comes to certain
subject matter. It's a real challenge for me to be open . . . to
animating certain scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm glad that I did it,'' she says softly, as she scoots
to the edge of the sofa and leans forward. ``I really wanted to try
something new, and it made me laugh when I read it. I thought, why
not? It would be growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The role, of course, also gave her a new love.
</P>
<P>
   Dating Carrey and getting the ``Bridget Jones'' role pushed
Zellweger's public profile higher than ever. She's still not crazy
about seeing her private life in the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of stuff is like, uck, yuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird. It's just weird. To have the bus driver know
things you haven't even disclosed to a close friend yet. Because
somebody wrote an expose about you. It's embarrassing. It's
invasive, sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just part of it, I suppose. Part of the adventure,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   She got more adventure than she wanted when word broke about her
casting in ``Bridget Jones' Diary.'' The British press, never a
favorite of celebrities, took lots of jabs. Like a story that
headlined her former work in a topless bar while a college student.
Zellweger, who worked in a lot of places in Austin, says she only
waitressed _ with her clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   Though she often turns down promotional opportunities on her
films _ and admits it may hurt the movies _ she insists she doesn't
make any extra effort to maintain privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do anything,'' she says. ``I just live. Every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Her celebrity doesn't affect her work, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One only has something to do with the other if you allow it
to,'' she says. ``I'm sure it affects other people's perception in
some way or another, but I don't concern myself with that, so it's
not part of my reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger's persona being quiet, and Carrey's being, well, Jim
Carrey, there was some surprise when they were first linked
romantically.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't surprise Greg Kinnear, who had already made ``Nurse
Betty'' with Zellweger before she made ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both pretty grounded people,'' Kinnear says. ``I've
met Jim a few times. He's a funny guy, and she's funny. She's such
a warm person.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Nurse Betty,'' the sweetness shows on screen more than at
any time since ``Jerry Maguire.'' But ``Nurse Betty'' is not
exactly the whimsical little romantic comedy that TV spots make it
out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger stars as Betty, a waitress who hides in her home while
two hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock) gruesomely kill her
low-life cheating husband (Aaron Eckhart of Erin Brockovich).
</P>
<P>
   The shock causes Betty to lose touch with reality. She believes
she is the nurse ex-girlfriend of a TV soap opera doctor (Kinnear).
She heads for California to find his hospital, unaware that the
doctor is an actor or that the killers are also trying to find her.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of director Neil LaBute, ``Nurse Betty'' has dark,
offbeat dimensions, and sometimes plays as much like a drama as a
comedy. LaBute did the terrifically ironic independent movie ``In
the Company of Men,'' in which two male office workers cruelly use
a naive, blind female co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of scenes in ``Nurse Betty'' may jolt viewers expecting
romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the wonderful things that Neil LaBute does in
his films,'' Zellweger says. ``He plays those contrasts, and it
really elicits a strong response from an audience member.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unpredictable. It's exciting as an actor to read a
script that deviates from what we've seen so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   When Zellweger saw ``In the Company of Men,'' she says, ``I was
livid that somebody would make a film about this _ that these
characters were as hateful as they were and so cruel.
</P>
<P>
   ``And halfway home I understood `That's what the point was.'
That he was telling a story with a lot of irony and honesty, and
the intention was to make you feel like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's comedy and pathos come when Betty finds the
doctor/actor she is seeking and fails to understand he is just
playing a part. She continues to regard him as a real doctor, which
causes some funny moments and, eventually, some uncomfortable ones.
</P>
<P>
   We worry what will happen when reality comes crashing down on
Betty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little like Jack (Nicholson) in `As Good As It Gets,'
'' says Kinnear, who also co-starred in that film. ``He had to pull
off an illness through the entire movie and make it interesting and
fresh. Renee has a similar task in `Nurse Betty.' To keep
surprising our expectations is an enormous feat she pulled off.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``Bridget Jones' Diary'' is completed, Zellweger is
without a new film on the horizon. And that, she says, makes her
very happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited. I'm going to work on my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Will there be a trip to visit family and friends in Texas?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yeah,'' she says, sassily, the ``duh'' in her tone.
``I'd be there right now if I didn't need to be here.''

Undated: sexual games.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood would probably never make a movie like ``Chuck and
Buck,'' because it would be considered too threatening to a young
male audience. But if by any chance it did, the story would surely
end in a murder. ``Chuck and Buck,'' while not literally
believable, is more tender-hearted. Reminiscent in some ways of
Todd Solondz's subversive family satire ``Happiness,'' it is really
a fable of how we all carry our childhood within us, whether or not
we admit it. Mike White's portrayal of the creepy, pathetic,
lollipop-addicted Buck is the stunt performance of the year,
comparable in virtuosity to that of Hilary Swank as a transgender
murder victim in ``Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tao of Steve'' is a witty, lighthearted portrait of an
extremely overweight, improbably successful womanizer (Donal Logue)
whose technique of seduction involves putting a distorted Buddhism
into action. A Hollywood version of the same idea would probably
star a Chris Farley type and be an extended, offensive fat joke.
</P>
<P>
   One alternative niche that American independent cinema is doing
a good job filling is the market for camp. ``Psycho Beach Party''
translates to the screen Charles Busch's uproarious drag theatrical
spoof of the ``Gidget'' and ``Beach Party'' films (and the seething
subtexts under their squeaky-clean surfaces). Margaret Cho's
concert film, ``I'm the One That I Want,'' is a hilarious,
autobiographical cri de coeur from this Korean-American comedian
that deals pungently with her devastating experience of being
racially stereotyped on network television.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is John Waters' witty but not howlingly funny
comedy, ``Cecil B. DeMented,'' in which a cult of cinematic
terrorists kidnap a Hollywood star (Melanie Griffith) and force her
to appear in their cinema verite guerrilla attacks on movie
theaters. Waters' movie inadvertently exemplifies the plight of the
art films that it pretends to champion so ardently. But its
terrorists' movie aesthetics are so stringent that, as the critic
Anthony Lane astutely pointed out, the enemy isn't only Hollywood
and philistinism but the movie audience itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil B. DeMented'' unwittingly points toward the basic shift
in popular culture at the turn of the millennium, as the vision of
humanity evoked by movies, music and television evolves from one
rooted in psychology to one more anchored in biotechnology.  &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   On fronts ranging from sports medicine to psychotherapy to
fashion, popular art increasingly views people as perfectible
machines who can be improved through drugs, diet, exercise and
surgery. Most of the soul's ailments, this view presupposes, are
physical imbalances that can be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As millions avail themselves of everything from Prozac to
plastic surgery, this mechanized notion of the human body has begun
to take hold. It seems bound to accelerate. Cloning, genetic
engineering and the unraveling of the human genome tantalize us
with the prospect of extended life and beyond that, perhaps even
immortality, through some hybrid of human and computer.  &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Already digital technology can infinitely replicate sounds and
images without any degradation of quality, and the Internet has
made us figuratively omniscient. With all these humanly engineered
intimations of infinity, who needs God when you can imagine being
God? Until immortality arrives, there's always the gratification of
turning yourself into a pumped-up action figure with 5 percent body
fat or a curvaceous pin-up with fake 42-inch breasts.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all its promise, the biotech version of human life, in which
all pleasure, even spiritual rapture, is quantifiable, is also
profoundly animalistic. Beneath its progressive agenda, it is pure
Darwinism. From reality television to professional wrestling to the
beat-driven boasts and retorts of hip-hop, to gross-out blockbuster
films, the messages of popular culture are becoming more brutally
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Many have already commented on the sexual crudeness embedded in
many of this summer's Hollywood blockbusters, in which one movie
after another paraded gross-out anal gags that left little to the
imagination. Conventional wisdom says that the appetite for crude
humor is merely a sign of the movie audience's youth, that
dirty-minded adolescents have always been dirty-minded adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   But the popularity of gross-out humor may be more than just a
result of a conjunction between adolescence and the lifting of
taboos. It's arguably another powerful sign of _ and perhaps an
anxious response to _ the mass cultural shift away from spiritual
and psychological ground to the purely physical. Goodbye, Freud,
Marx and Einstein! Hello, lab technician!  &QL;
</P>
<P>

<P>
   We don't need those old philosophers. We've been there and done
that. This is the brave new world.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But here, where life is an endless contest and the pressure to
compete nonstop, the climate is a bit chilly. Yet this is what the
majority seems to want. The most popular television shows
(``Survivor,'' ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'') have become
contests, and more and more Hollywood movies are obsessed with
winning, whether the reward is being crowned prom queen or victory
in an ancient Roman arena.  &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In such a pressurized climate, it's reassuring to be reminded
that for all our polish and technological know-how we are still
messy animals who leave behind a stench. We're all fools stumbling
in our own body waste. The more intense the pressure, the more
explosive the laughter.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   One of the great things about Kieslowski is that he sensed what
was coming. In its opening episode, inspired by the commandment
``Thou shalt have no other God before me,'' a professor's
brilliant, computer-wise young son is torn between the values of
his rationalist father, who doesn't believe in an afterlife, and
those of his devoutly Catholic aunt. When the boy decides he wants
to go skating, his father helps him calculate the thickness of the
ice on the lake to make sure it's safe. But these careful
calculations don't ensure the boy's safety, and he falls through
the ice and drowns.
</P>
<P>
   The story is embellished with surreal touches that suggest the
professor's hubris shattered by the hand of fate. In one touch,
both the father's and son's computers appear to have minds of their
own. After the boy dies, the father arrives home to find his
computer mysteriously turned on. It flashes an enigmatic message in
English: ``I am ready.'' &QL;

REALITY TRIP: INTERNATIONAL CREW TAKES BUS JOURNEY THROUGH THE
AMERICAS 
WITH PHOTO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DANIEL J. VARGAS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
It's a bit ``Road Rules'' and a smidgen ``Real World.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   And probably a pinch of ``Survivor'' mixed in, too.
</P>
<P>
   No cash is up for grabs, but there will be _ without a doubt _
some drama. That's expected when you cram six twentysomethings into
a double-decker bus for nine months as they travel from northern
Canada to the southern-most tip of South America _ Tierra del
Fuego.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be no running water or lights. No restrooms. No phone.
</P>
<P>
   Dengue and cholera might be on the menu. And there will be
camera crews recording their every move and lane change for a
13-part documentary series to air on television around the world.
</P>
<P>
   One of the adventurous young guns behind the wheel will be
Houstonian Paul Strobl, a 26-year-old world traveler who has the
whole retirement thing backward _ travel now and worry about
finding a desk job later in life.
</P>
<P>
   There is a big difference, though, separating this endeavor,
which is dubbed the ``Big Bus Ride'' and kicks off Sept. 16 in
Winnipeg, Canada, from those ``reality'' TV shows: It's a serious
effort to raise awareness and $300,000 for the international,
nonprofit group War Child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike those shows, we're chosen to work as a team,'' says
Strobl, the lone American on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   War Child is a 7-year-old organization that provides emergency
relief and rehabilitation programs for children both during and
after wars and military conflicts such as in Kosovo and East
Africa. It's still seeking another sponsor for the bus trip that
will hit 18 countries and come through Houston in late October or
early November.
</P>
<P>
   Strobl, who has a degree in anthropology with a minor in Spanish
from Southwest Texas State University, has traveled the globe the
last two years since trading his job at Motorola in Austin for a
life of backpacking and temporary jobs in New Zealand, Australia,
Japan, Hawaii, Canada and England.
</P>
<P>
   While strolling through London, he saw a newspaper ad for the
Big Bus Ride project. Strobl checked out War Child on the Internet
to make sure it was a legitimate group. Like most Americans, he
didn't know about the international organization.
</P>
<P>
   Strobl applied for a spot on the bus on the group's Web site
(www.warchild.org) by writing a short essay. He didn't think
anything would come of it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, War Child contacted him, asked for a resume and more
in-depth answers to the questions on the original application. He
made the first cut to 120 applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Next was a screen test. He made the cut again _ this time Strobl
was among an elite group of 24.
</P>
<P>
   Those finalists were taken to the countryside for a weekend of
team-building exercises. It was rainy and muddy. Some couldn't take
it and left. Strobl hunkered down and made the final six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love traveling. I'm kind of addicted to it,'' he says.
``It's for a good cause, and I get to go to all these countries _
granted they're not the most posh places. But it seems like it
could be fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I can make a difference,'' he continues. ``To
have a hands-on experience is something I look forward to. It's not
like sitting behind a desk at work, and you just give some money to
charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Strobl's father, Karl, wasn't surprised when his son called to
say he would be driving a bus along with five other people across
two continents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he was 8, his lifelong ambition was to travel around the
world,'' he says. ``Here's a kid who gets the best of both worlds:
He gets to travel, and it helps a charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Strobl, a certified public accountant, says his son is
getting a ``world-class education'' as he travels because he
studies the cultures and languages of each country or region he
visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``His problem is that he can't sit still,'' he says. ``He learns
something and says `What's the next challenge?' If he has the
opportunity to travel, more power to him.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dad isn't worried about his youngest son traversing the
Americas either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul does very well on his own,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But how about with five other foreigners packed like sardines on
a nine-month bus trip? Time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there will be conflicts,'' Strobl says. ``Nobody _
whether they're married, in a relationship, best friends, or even
siblings _ has to live together 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
That will wear on us. There will be difficult times that we will
have to endure. We may hate each other for a couple days, but
that's all part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Strobl's bus mates will be Catalina Benavides, a 21-year-old
Peruvian student; Sarah Coombes, a 23-year-old British model;
Catherine Aird, a 28-year-old British journalist; Ashley Goldstraw,
a 28-year-old Australian forester; and Stefan Pavlik, a 23-year-old
Austrian computer software representative.
</P>
<P>
   The six will engage in a little friendly competition to raise
the most money, hoping to total at least $300,000. They're still
working on fund-raising ideas, but Strobl is thinking of raffling
off a weeklong ride on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the money raised will go to War Child emergency
projects. The rest will be spent on South and Central American
projects such as land-mine clearance and help for street children
and training in El Salvador and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   During the trip, each of the six will get a $15-a-day allowance
in Canada and the United States to buy food and toiletries, do
laundry and cover any entertainment. South of the border, they'll
get $12. They cannot dip into their personal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Ellis, events coordinator with War Child in London, says
the organization chose Strobl from a pool of 2,000 applicants
because he speaks Spanish fluently and is a seasoned traveler. The
group wanted individuals who had a sense of humor and valuable
mechanical, first-aid and language skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``During our team-building weekend, he impressed the producers
by working hard at all group activities, and mixed in well with all
the other nationalities,'' she says. ``He is confident in front of
the camera, quite analytical and quite an extrovert in the right
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The American representative is learning how to drive a 1958
double-decker bus with no power steering and a double-clutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``A double-clutch means you hit it once to go into neutral and
then again for the next gear,'' Strobl explains. ``It hasn't been
too bad, but my biceps are getting a workout.''
</P>
<P>
   The pack of six will sleep upstairs on the bus _ only a few feet
from each other. Their clothes will be housed in a cabinet directly
beneath their beds, but there isn't much room there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be cozy,'' Strobl says.
</P>
<P>
   They will share a small gas stove with two burners and a
personal-size refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   There may be times when they go days without bathing, but that
doesn't bother Strobl. They'll bathe whenever and wherever they can
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so bad if you all smell,'' Strobl jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Although they will see such spectacular sights as the Grand
Canyon and the Andes mountains, they also must travel through
unstable areas such as El Salvador and Guatemala, where land mines
are a danger, and Colombia, where drug trafficking creates its own
peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be some hairy moments there,'' Strobl says.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the bad thoughts. He's focusing on being a good War
Child ambassador and polishing his fund-raising skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to grab the moment and enjoy it,'' the traveler
says.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true free spirit.

   UKRAINE: ECOLOGICAL DISASTER
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of villagers in south-central Ukraine complaining
of skin rashes and other symptoms of environmental poisoning,
President Leonid Kuchma, left, declared the region about 320 miles
south of Kiev an ecological disaster zone. Some officials said the
outbreak was caused by chemical spills from a Soviet-era missile
base, but others said high concentrations of nitrites in drinking
water and foodstuffs indicated high fertilizer concentrations may
have contaminated water supplies.

<P>
   NORWAY: RIGHTISTS GAIN
</P>
<P>
   The Progress Party, whose anti-immigration position has caused
it to be shunned by all other major parties, has moved into a
technical tie with the governing Labor Party for the first time in
a new poll. Of the 1,000 people questioned by the Din Mening/Norsk
Statistikk institute, 25 percent said they favored Progress among
the country's eight largest parties. Support for the Labor Party
slid to 22 percent from 29 percent in July, according to the
monthly poll, which had a margin of error of 2 to 3 percent.

   BRITAIN: SHORT OF COPS

   The government introduced an $11 million television and
newspaper ad campaign with the theme ``Could You ? Police,'' part
of an effort to step up recruitment of officers, now at 124,418 in
England and Wales, the lowest in a decade. With key crime rates
going up, the government has promised 9,000 new positions but has
had trouble attracting people to the profession, which it says has
been given a negative image by films and soap operas.

   The Lockerbie trial was adjourned for three weeks to let
American intelligence services search their archives for more
information about a key witness, Abdul Majid Giaka, who was on a
CIA payroll at the time of the bombing. He is expected to testify
that he saw the defendants place the bomb on a flight in Malta in
May 1998. Giaka was supposed to testify two weeks ago, but the
defense demanded complete transcripts of CIA interviews with him.

   ISRAEL: `FRIENDLY FIRE' INQUIRY
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary army investigation concluded that the three
Israeli soldiers who died in a botched raid on a West Bank home
were killed by ``friendly fire.'' The investigation found that
serious errors, especially the posting of undercover agents on
rooftops, led to the death and injury of Israeli soldiers and to
the escape of the raid's target, Abu Hanud. Abu Hanud, who is
wanted in Israel on terrorist charges, is in the custody of the
Palestinian authorities, who say they will prosecute him
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL, IRAQ: NUCLEAR ROW
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp exchange at the U.N. disarmament conference in
Geneva, Israel and Iraq accused each other of having weapons that
threaten the Middle East. Israel's delegate said Iraq ``devoted a
major part of its vast income'' from oil to develop weapons of mass
destruction, including nuclear weapons. Iraq's representative said
Israel ``possesses hundreds of nuclear bombs which threaten not
just our region but the entire world.'' Iraq is subject to Security
Council sanctions until it is rid of all weapons of mass
destruction.

REPORT SAYS MANY SPECIES COULD BECOME EXTINCT BECAUSE OF GLOBAL
WARMING

   LONDON _ Global warming could wipe out many species of plants
and animals by the end of the 21st century, the World Wide Fund for
Nature said in a report issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, known in the United States as the World Wildlife Fund,
paints a devastating picture of the ability of species from Arctic
polar bears and walruses, to New England sugar maple trees, to
survive unless they can migrate quickly and adapt to their new
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly at risk, the report says, are species that are rare
or live in mountainous or isolated places. Among those singled out
as vulnerable are the gelada baboon in Ethiopia; the monarch
butterfly, which spends winters in Mexico; the Australian mountain
pygmy possum; the northern spruce in New York state, and the
spoon-billed sandpiper, which breeds in the far northeastern
reaches of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, up to 70 percent of the natural habitat
could be lost, and 20 percent of the species rendered extinct, in
the Arctic and northernmost areas of places like Canada, Russia and
Scandinavia, where warming is predicted to be most rapid.
</P>
<P>
   Places farther to the south, including parts of Norway, Sweden,
Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Iceland and Kyrgyzstan, could lose more
than half of their natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the report says, more than a third of the
existing habitat in Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Colorado,
Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas could be
irrevocably altered by global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on the often used, but disputed, assumption
that by the year 2100 there will have been a doubling of the
emissions of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere from the level at
the start of the industrial revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rapid rates of global warming are likely to increase rates of
habitat loss and species extinction, most markedly in the higher
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere,'' the report says.
``Extensive areas of habitat may be lost to global warming and many
species may be unable to shift their ranges fast enough to keep
up.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jennifer L. Morgan, director of the World Wildlife
Fund Climate Change Campaign in Washington, some species would have
to migrate at a rate 10 times faster than after the last ice age in
order to survive into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Climate change is coming at us much faster than many habitats
are going to be able handle,'' Morgan said. ``The speed of change
caused by the change in climate is greater than most ecosystems are
going to be able to adapt to.''

   CAMPAIGN-RELIGION (Undated) _ When Sen. Joseph Lieberman urged a
greater role for religion in public life in campaign speeches this
week, he touched off a new round in the sharp but unsettled debate
over the role that personal beliefs should play in American
politics. Some critics of Lieberman's remarks, including the
Anti-Defamation League, cast the issue in terms of separation of
church and state, suggesting that the senator had infringed that
principle. But another way to look at what Lieberman said is to ask
whether American culture has changed enough of late so that his
remarks are more acceptable, socially and politically, than before.

Congress. The company, one of America's most familiar brand names,
is now seen as being one a death watch. On Thursday, Washington
regulators raised the number of deaths attributed to failures of
Firestone tires and Venezuela's consumer agency asked the state

IN ``NURSE BETTY,'' RENEE ZELLWEGER'S SWEET SIDE SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Resending to add release date: For release Sunday, Sept. 3 (Editors: second E in Renee has an accent) 
By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
NEW YORK _ The last time we talked to Renee Zellweger, when she
starred with Meryl Streep in ``One True Thing,'' she had no new
films planned, no real home to call her own, a director boyfriend
(Josh Pate) and an adored 10-year-old dog named Dylan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In two years, Zellweger's world has turned considerably. She's
completed four pictures, the third of which, ``Nurse Betty,'' opens
Friday. The fourth, ``Bridget Jones' Diary,'' due next year, made
her a favorite target of the British press, which felt a Texas gal
should not play the much-sought title role from the English best
seller.
</P>
<P>
   She has also found a home _ a Hollywood Hills house the Los
Angeles Times reported as costing ``about'' $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   And her new boyfriend _ well, not so new anymore _ is superstar
comedian Jim Carrey. In March, Zellweger, whose public persona is
shy and quiet, was shown in Cosmopolitan sporting a tattoo _ a
temporary one _ with Carrey's name, on her backside.
</P>
<P>
   But not everything has changed, thank goodness. Dylan _ a
collie-golden retriever mix, now 12, is still the light of
Zellweger's life. With apologies to Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, in a suite at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue,
Zellweger was just back in the United States after seven months in
England filming ``Bridget Jones' Diary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited to be home,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Though she insists she is just beginning to work off the pounds
she gained to play Bridget _ a London career woman who thinks of
herself as overweight, though that may be all in her mind _
Zellweger looks much like she did when she played Tom Cruise's
romantic thrill in ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a little bit there, a little bit different,'' she
says of the pounds. It doesn't show, despite her snug sweater and
tight black slacks. ``I'm going for runs again now because I can. I
like to. I guess I'm just going back to Renee.''
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger wears no shoes, no earrings, no necklace, no rings,
not even the expensive friendship ring that Carrey is supposed to
have given her, during her interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? I always don't wear jewelry,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger, 31, a University of Texas graduate, had a good bit of
film and TV experience before going from obscurity to overnight
fame as the convincingly sweet, infinitely appealing single mother
in ``Jerry Maguire.'' Some reviews praised her for stealing the
film from Cruise. But movie history is littered with forgotten
leading ladies du jour of male superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger survived by avoiding more roles like Dorothy in
``Jerry Maguire.'' She surprised everyone, and offended some, by
playing a Hasidic Jewish wife going against husband and tradition
in ``A Price Above Rubies.'' She was Streep's ungrateful, rather
unpleasant daughter in ``One True Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year she was, briefly, the sweet girlfriend again, this
time in the forgettable ``The Bachelor.'' Then she showed a
different side in the rude, crude comedy ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene''
earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about an image change _ was she at all concerned with what
folks back in her hometown of Katy would think?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' she says. ``Of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not so much concerned about what people might think, but
uncomfortable. I'm a pretty private person when it comes to certain
subject matter. It's a real challenge for me to be open . . . to
animating certain scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm glad that I did it,'' she says softly, as she scoots
to the edge of the sofa and leans forward. ``I really wanted to try
something new, and it made me laugh when I read it. I thought, why
not? It would be growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The role, of course, also gave her a new love.
</P>
<P>
   Dating Carrey and getting the ``Bridget Jones'' role pushed
Zellweger's public profile higher than ever. She's still not crazy
about seeing her private life in the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of stuff is like, uck, yuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird. It's just weird. To have the bus driver know
things you haven't even disclosed to a close friend yet. Because
somebody wrote an expose about you. It's embarrassing. It's
invasive, sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just part of it, I suppose. Part of the adventure,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   She got more adventure than she wanted when word broke about her
casting in ``Bridget Jones' Diary.'' The British press, never a
favorite of celebrities, took lots of jabs. Like a story that
headlined her former work in a topless bar while a college student.
Zellweger, who worked in a lot of places in Austin, says she only
waitressed _ with her clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   Though she often turns down promotional opportunities on her
films _ and admits it may hurt the movies _ she insists she doesn't
make any extra effort to maintain privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do anything,'' she says. ``I just live. Every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Her celebrity doesn't affect her work, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One only has something to do with the other if you allow it
to,'' she says. ``I'm sure it affects other people's perception in
some way or another, but I don't concern myself with that, so it's
not part of my reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger's persona being quiet, and Carrey's being, well, Jim
Carrey, there was some surprise when they were first linked
romantically.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't surprise Greg Kinnear, who had already made ``Nurse
Betty'' with Zellweger before she made ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both pretty grounded people,'' Kinnear says. ``I've
met Jim a few times. He's a funny guy, and she's funny. She's such
a warm person.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Nurse Betty,'' the sweetness shows on screen more than at
any time since ``Jerry Maguire.'' But ``Nurse Betty'' is not
exactly the whimsical little romantic comedy that TV spots make it
out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger stars as Betty, a waitress who hides in her home while
two hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock) gruesomely kill her
low-life cheating husband (Aaron Eckhart of Erin Brockovich).
</P>
<P>
   The shock causes Betty to lose touch with reality. She believes
she is the nurse ex-girlfriend of a TV soap opera doctor (Kinnear).
She heads for California to find his hospital, unaware that the
doctor is an actor or that the killers are also trying to find her.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of director Neil LaBute, ``Nurse Betty'' has dark,
offbeat dimensions, and sometimes plays as much like a drama as a
comedy. LaBute did the terrifically ironic independent movie ``In
the Company of Men,'' in which two male office workers cruelly use
a naive, blind female co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of scenes in ``Nurse Betty'' may jolt viewers expecting
romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the wonderful things that Neil LaBute does in
his films,'' Zellweger says. ``He plays those contrasts, and it
really elicits a strong response from an audience member.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unpredictable. It's exciting as an actor to read a
script that deviates from what we've seen so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   When Zellweger saw ``In the Company of Men,'' she says, ``I was
livid that somebody would make a film about this _ that these
characters were as hateful as they were and so cruel.
</P>
<P>
   ``And halfway home I understood `That's what the point was.'
That he was telling a story with a lot of irony and honesty, and
the intention was to make you feel like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's comedy and pathos come when Betty finds the
doctor/actor she is seeking and fails to understand he is just
playing a part. She continues to regard him as a real doctor, which
causes some funny moments and, eventually, some uncomfortable ones.
</P>
<P>
   We worry what will happen when reality comes crashing down on
Betty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little like Jack (Nicholson) in `As Good As It Gets,'
'' says Kinnear, who also co-starred in that film. ``He had to pull
off an illness through the entire movie and make it interesting and
fresh. Renee has a similar task in `Nurse Betty.' To keep
surprising our expectations is an enormous feat she pulled off.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``Bridget Jones' Diary'' is completed, Zellweger is
without a new film on the horizon. And that, she says, makes her
very happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited. I'm going to work on my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Will there be a trip to visit family and friends in Texas?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yeah,'' she says, sassily, the ``duh'' in her tone.
``I'd be there right now if I didn't need to be here.''

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AUTUMN IN NEW YORK'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder. Directed by Joan Chen
(PG-13, 105 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In this embarrassing 1940s-style weepie, Gere is a superstar
Manhattan chef and ``older man,'' a la Cary Grant, and Ryder the
kooky, doe-eyed 22-year-old hat designer who reforms him. Oh yes,
she happens to be dying of a rare heart disease and has only a year
to live. It isn't the actors' fault that this oil-and-water mixture
of 1940s suds (Ryder's character grows more ethereally beautiful
the sicker she gets) and millennial sexual angst doesn't jell
(Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `BLESS THE CHILD'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger, Rufus Sewell and Jimmy Smits. Directed by
Chuck Russell (R, 115 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A runny supernatural soap opera _ the first thriller of the
``Touched by an Angel'' era _ that tries for the elegant calm of
``The Sixth Sense'' but fails. It is too often overcome by its
flamboyantly cheesy reflexes. Basinger is the protector aunt of a
child (the gifted Holliston Coleman) whose heavenly powers make her
the target of an evil cult leader (Sewell, chewing his English
accent as if it were sunflower seeds). He means to kill her before
Easter; you may feel the need to leave long before then. ``Bless
the Child'' seems derivative of so many other movies that you're
surprised it doesn't have to credit its sources the way hip-hop
artists do when they sample songs. With Smits as an FBI agent and
Ian Holm as a priest who does a laughable steal from ``The Usual
Suspects'' (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `BRING IT ON'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Bradford and Eliza Dushku.
Directed by Peyton Reed (PG-13, 110 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Even though it does feature young women bouncing around in
skimpy outfits, this cheerleader comedy directed with giddy,
sometimes sloppy pep-rally intensity by Reed from a brisk, slangy
script by Jessica Bendinger, is more than a low-minded appeal to
male lechery. Bound by the conventions of the sports movie and the
teen-age romantic comedy, ``Bring It On'' nonetheless has a fine
satirical edge, and at least glances at some serious issues of race
and sexuality. It's also a vehicle for the vibrant comic talents of
Dunst, ably supported by Bradford as her cute, nonconformist love
interest, and Dushku as his sister (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CELL'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Lopez, Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn.
Directed by Tarsem Singh (R, 110 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A serial killer named Stargher (D'Onofrio), who abducts women
and imprisons them in a Plexiglas cell that slowly fills with
water, has a seizure and goes into a coma. His latest victim is
trapped in his cell, and she has to be found before the automated
torture takes her life. An FBI agent (Vaughn) talks a child
psychologist (Lopez) into using an experimental technique to enter
the killer's subconscious. Singh's talents haven't quite jelled
into storytelling yet. He folds this tale over and over on itself,
working with a script that blends elements of ``The Silence of the
Lambs,'' ``Manhunter,'' ``The Matrix,'' ``Seven,'' ``Dreamscape''
and ``Spellbound'' with the stop-motion animation of the brothers
Quay (``Street of Crocodiles''), the moody photography of Matt
Mahurin, the paintings of Francis Bacon and so many other things
that there's no there there (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CREW'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya and Seymour
Cassel. Directed by Michael Dinner (PG-13, 88 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This sloppy, cliche-ridden comedy about four aging mobsters
blundering their way through a series of unlikely capers has
moments of wit, provided by Barry Fanaro's overplotted script and
Hedaya's priceless goofing. But the picture, with no clear idea of
what it wants to do, lurches between slapstick and sentimentality,
wasting the talents of Dreyfuss, Cassel and Lainie Kazan. Reynolds,
meanwhile, absurdly cast as a New Jersey mafioso, looks as bored
and grouchy as the audience will be after 88 minutes of this mess
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `HOLLOW MAN'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue. Directed by Paul
Verhoeven (R, 114 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Verhoeven's sluggish new special-effects thriller takes a
tantalizing premise _ the corrupting effects of invisibility _ and
drowns it in horror-movie hack work. Bacon plays an egomaniacal
scientist who injects himself with a serum that disrupts his
``quantum synchronization with the visible universe.'' You can
guess the rest. He ends up pursuing his colleagues (including his
ex-girlfriend, played by Shue) through a labyrinthine underground
laboratory, looking, thanks to computer-generated imagery, like a
plasticine anatomical model on a rampage (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and
Bernie Mac. Directed by Spike Lee (R, 117 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Filmed before a live audience on two nights in February in
Charlotte, N.C., the self-proclaimed Kings of Comedy swagger across
the stage, urban legends in resplendent outfits. Until a couple of
years ago the comedians' exposure was limited mostly to cable
television. Here their comedy gives audiences that have never seen
anything like it a hilarious window on a new world. They display
their chops when they talk about family, specifically
African-American family with roots in the South (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson. Directed by Peter Segal
(PG-13, 105 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In this sequel Murphy again displays enough agility to show that
he deserves to be taken seriously. Parts of the film, a variation
on the Jekyll and Hyde story, are tremendously funny. Every scene
in which Murphy, hidden away under millions of dollars' worth of
transformative makeup, plays all the members of the Klump family _
all of them together in some scenes _ will knock the blues right
out of you. But some of the cheap laughs to which the picture
stoops will give you the blues. This makes ``Nutty Professor II''
half a movie at best. The broad humor at times derails Murphy's
performances, but the film provides a vehicle for him to display
his reach (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `ORFEU'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Toni Garrido and Patricia Franca. Directed by Carlos
Diegues (not rated, 110 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian director's updating of _ and corrective to _
Marcel Camus' beloved 1959 film ``Black Orpheus'' _ suffers from
trying to do too much at once, to be both mythic and realistic, to
celebrate Rio's rich culture while exposing the brutality and
cynicism that dominate daily life in its slums. But in spite of
uneven acting and a chaotic script, ``Orfeu'' manages to keep its
contradictory energies from exploding all over the place, and in
the end its satisfactions outnumber its frustrations. This is
partly thanks to Caetano Veloso's eclectic score, though Alfonso
Beato's lovely cinematography and the violence and vitality of Rio
itelf don't hurt (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE REPLACEMENTS'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman. Directed by Howard
Deutch (PG-13, 105 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This negligible jock comedy, about a group of misfit macho
clowns who suit up for pro football during a players' strike just
wants to be loved: Is that so wrong? This rehashed and desperate
picture stars Reeves as the honorable, stoic fill-in quarterback.
(He glides through.) Hackman musters his requisite command as the
honorable, stoic fill-in coach in a wardrobe from the Tom Landry
Collection, mouthing dialogue from ``Hoosiers'' and old United
Airlines commercials. The unvaried ragtag scab players include a
pair of violent bodyguard brothers (Faison Love and Michael
Taliferro), a violent cop (Jon Favreau) and a violent felon on loan
to the league (Michael Jace). Brooke Langton is the cheerleader who
resolves not to date players and dates Reeves anyway. It's a
peculiarity from L.A., a union town: a film that celebrates
anti-union activity (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `SAVING GRACE'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson. Directed by Nigel
Cole (R, 93 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This innocuous piece of comic Anglophilia features the usual
cast of lovable British eccentrics plopped down in a picturesque
seaside spot, in this case a Cornish village. Blethyn is Grace, a
widow whose husband committed suicide, leaving her $450,000 in debt
and in danger of losing her lovely stone house. She and her
resourceful gardener (Ferguson, who also wrote the screenplay)
convert her greenhouse into a marijuana farm, and the resulting
high jinks resemble a twee hybrid of ``The Full Monty'' and the
lesser works of Cheech and Chong (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `SPACE COWBOYS'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and
James Garner. Directed by Eastwood (PG-13, 105 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The second half of Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant reworking
of the standard trouble-in-space movie, with Eastwood himself
leading a heroic team of astronauts that also includes Jones,
Sutherland and Garner. But the first half, which consists of the
comic, tough-old-guy interplay among these four sublime actors, is
a boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity. Sutherland
and Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay Harden,
playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again) the
villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their shot
at celestial glory (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `STEAL THIS MOVIE!'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vincent D'Onofrio and Janeane Garofalo, Directed by
Robert Greenwald (R, 108 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The likable but muddled screen biography of the yippie activist
Abbie Hoffman paints that left-wing merry prankster and inventor of
the ``politics of joy'' as a free-spirited innocent who became a
political martyr. D'Onofrio may not look much like Hoffman, but he
radiates the right antic, rabble-rousing energy. And Garofalo, as
his loyal wife, Anita, conveys a brooding critical intelligence.
But the movie, to its detriment, glosses over the highlights of
Hoffman's late-1960s activist career to concentrate on the sad
story of his persecution by the FBI and his years as a fugitive
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `WHAT LIES BENEATH'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford. Directed by Robert
Zemeckis (PG-13, 130 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Zemeckis' film takes its time in laying out the story of
high-strung Claire (Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria
regularly. Her daughter has just gone off to college and Claire is
still recovering from the trauma of a car accident. Then her house
starts showing signs of being haunted. Her husband, Norman (Ford),
is a driven research scientist with a secret. This thriller is as
implausibly chilling as any ``X-Files'' episode. By the last 10
minutes, your interest will have long vanished (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `X-MEN'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Famke
Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin. Directed by
Bryan Singer (PG-13, 105 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited arrival of Marvel Comics' do-gooder mutants is
mildly fun on a couple of levels: for one, the acting duel between
Stewart (as the mutant telepath Professor X, the X-Men's leader)
and Ian McKellen (as the mutant nemesis Magneto, who possesses the
power of supermagnetism). As these two austere hams trill their
vowels at each other, you get the feeling that you really are
watching members of another species in action. And Jackman scores
as the two-fisted, confrontational Wolverine, a mutant with
superstrength, an ability to heal all wounds and metal-alloy claws
that shoot out from his knuckles. He lives to fight, a boisterous
tragic hero with no complications. Otherwise, the movie is an
earnest affair that is clumsy when it should be light on its feet;
it takes itself even more seriously than the comic book does,
though its fans may be overjoyed by that devotion (Mitchell).

SPRINGING FROM MUSIC VIDEOS TO ROCK DOCUMENTARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time, channel
are for New York area. Check local listings.) 
 BY JULIE SALAMON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   ``I think music videos have really
ruined the art of music,'' says the filmmaker and provocateur
Michael Moore in a special four-part series on the Sundance
Channel's ``Shorts Stop: An Hour of Short Films.'' He is talking
about the crossover between video directors and movie directors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Before you would hear the song and then you would invent your
own image,'' Moore continues. ``The music video tells you this is
the only way to look at this song. When you hear this song you are
to think of men without shirts jumping in a field of daisies.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much describes my own feelings about music videos.
Yes, I know they're important, have altered a generation's visual
imagination and transformed the marketing of music _ and everything
else _ since they have influenced advertising, too. But important
and omnipresent doesn't mean good. McDonald's is everywhere, too.
With rare exceptions video imagery always seems too literal-minded
or tritely symbolic or simply vulgar. The prevailing artistic
wisdom seems to be: Marginal ideas take on weight if shot in slow
motion. If that doesn't work, go superfast.
</P>
<P>
   But I was willing to be convinced otherwise and the Sundance
Channel promised illumination. This month the cable channel is
presenting ``Sonic Cinema,'' films and programs intended to
highlight the way movies and rock 'n' roll overlap. The seven
feature documentaries about rock performers include ``Gimme
Shelter,'' the Maysles Brothers' brilliant concert film about the
Rolling Stones' free _ and ultimately tragic _ concert at Altamont
Speedway in December 1969 (it's also currently playing at the Film
Forum).
</P>
<P>
   The ``Shorts Stop'' segments, which begin this Sunday, aim to
show that music videos are related to the rock documentary, at
least in spirit. So these programs feature the work of independent
filmmakers _ including Moore, despite his antivideo stance _ who
have crossed over in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   The series host, Mark Anthony Thompson, talks loftily about
``the cross-pollination of music and cinema'' _ at least as lofty
as a man can be slouching on a couch and wearing sunglasses
(indoors) and orange flip-flops. But the series proves mainly that
interesting imagery distracts from good music and can't elevate
lousy music, and that annoying pictures can actually prove
deafening. You simply tune out.
</P>
<P>
   The best work in the series comes, not surprisingly, from Spike
Jonze, who sprang exuberantly from the video world into film, with
the inventive ``Being John Malkovich'' (and more recently into the
world of politics, with his biographical documentary of Al Gore for
the Democratic convention). His ``Oh So Quiet'' music video for the
Icelandic pop star Bjork, set in a Goodyear tire store, is an
extravagantly produced homage to Hollywood musicals of the 1930s.
Bjork gleefully high-kicks and prances in an orange dress, looking
happy to be in this bright, amusing little spectacle, where the
music and pictures actually seem to have something to do with one
another (even if they don't).
</P>
<P>
   Another film director, Hal Hartley, has created an amusing mock
concert for the English folk singer Beth Orton's ``Stolen Car.''
While singing, Orton slyly assumes ``meaningful'' poses in various
corners of a room, flops on a couch and pretends not to notice the
expressionless assistants sticking microphones in front of her
mouth. She pricks her finger with the thorn of a rose and a drop of
her blood lazily drifts through a glass of water. Hartley has
artfully staged the video in grays and reds, but I'd still rather
listen to Orton's lovely voice with my eyes closed.
</P>
<P>
   As for the pugnacious Moore, director (of ``Roger and Me'') and
television crusader (on ``The Awful Truth'' and ``TV Nation''), he
paired up with a band that could have been named just for him, Rage
Against the Machine. Moore has styled his video as just another of
his impromptu assaults _ this one on the New York Stock Exchange.
As Rage wails outside the exchange, the police arrive. Moore
confronts. The action is intercut with a parody of ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire'' No daisy fields, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the opening night program is video as usual. Harmony
Korine, directing ``Sunday'' by Sonic Youth, meets the expectations
set in 1997 by ``Gummo,'' his feature film debut, which Janet
Maslin in The New York Times pronounced ``the worst film of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Later episodes in the ``Sonic Cinema'' series contain some
arresting imagery of Patti Smith's edges, in a video filmed by
Melodie McDaniel, a talented fashion photographer. There is sweet
candor from Mike Mills, a graphic artist and entrepreneur who began
shooting videos only after he had designed record jackets. ``I can
treat it all like an integrated package,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The series also offers Richard Kern, described (accurately) by
the host, Thompson, ``as a downtown, fetishist photographer
filmmaker who deals with a lot of images of bondage and violence.''
By the end, I'd learned this: three minutes can be a very long
time.  &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In conversations with experts about mobility problems,
especially among the elderly, two themes almost always crop up. One
is that the choices are scant when it comes to devices that help
you get around: you can clomp along with a cane or a walker, or
take to a wheelchair, which limits exercise. Second, many people
who have trouble walking say they are most comfortable pushing a
grocery cart, because it lets them move along with balance and
stability.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is the social unease that many elderly
people experience when they use assisted-walking devices,
especially ones that make the user feel or look awkward and clumsy.
America, at least the one presented by a youth-obsessed Madison
Avenue, is the land of joggers and rock climbers with little time
or patience for anyone who is older and slower. That is in sharp
contrast to other parts of the world, including Europe, where aging
and its problems are not viewed as something to be hidden or
ashamed of.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Kahn, a co-author of ``Successful Aging'' (Delacorte
Press) and professor emeritus of public health and psychology at
the University of Michigan, says this nation's approach to mobility
problems is characteristically American.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go from walking to motorized devices like electric
wheelchairs and carts, skipping intervening possibilities,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the little-known rollator _ developed in Europe _ and its
proponents, like Nick Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   A rollator looks like a sawed-off grocery cart with fat rubber
wheels, bicycle handle bars and hand brakes. It helps people walk
easily under their own power, over floors, sidewalks and grass. It
even has a seat, in case the user needs to take a rest, and it
folds up for storage in a car or on a plane. Though rarely seen in
the United States, rollators are common in Canada and Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 39, a former lawyer, saw a picture of a rollator in
1989 and decided to start importing a line of models made by a
Swedish manufacturer, Ahlberg A.B. His Pittsburgh company,
NobleMotion, is the exclusive importer of the Ahlberg rollators,
which sell for $364 to $450; an extra $35 buys an odometer to keep
track of the miles walked. Medicare, he said, usually pays about
$100 toward the cost of a rollator for those who are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hilary Siebens, associate director of physical medicine and
rehabilitation at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, saw one
of Thompson's rollators seven years ago at a conference on strokes
and ordered one on the spot for her patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really allows for functional walking,'' Siebens said.
``Walkers are stop-and-start. With a rollator, patients can get an
immediate sense of freedom.'' Some people can use rollators to get
themselves moving again, and avoid spending up to $20,000 for two
to three weeks of rehabilitative therapy, she said. ``Also, people
are less resistant to a rollator,'' she said, ``because it is
easier to use than a cane or a walker.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite virtually universal positive comments about the
rollator, the last decade has been slow going for Thompson, who
only last year increased his salary to $26,500 from $24,000. An
investor backed out, and Thompson has had trouble spreading the
word about his product, which is among several rollators being sold
in what has been a very small market. But he has aggressively
pressed on, handing out leaflets and giving demonstrations at
grocery stores, malls and conferences. He has reached a point, he
said, where his business is secure, if not booming; he hopes to pay
himself $30,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wants to make money, Thompson also views his efforts
as a ``battle against sedentary habits.'' His company has a Web
site and a toll-free telephone number (www.wheels4walking.com, 800
234-9255).
</P>
<P>
   ``My customers are looking for products to help them,'' he said.
``If you enjoy walking with a grocery cart, here's a grocery cart
that goes on the sidewalk, with hand brakes and a seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who say they have been helped is Maxine Marx, 82, a
self-described ``adorable old lady'' and retired casting director
who is Chico Marx's daughter. She ordered one of Thompson's
rollators several years ago and now uses it to get around her
Manhattan apartment and to take occasional walks in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a godsend,'' she said. ``It saved my life. Otherwise I
would have to use one of those awful walkers. Whenever I see
someone hobbling in the park, I always show them my rollator.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the users are elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Welch, 55, is a project manager for a dot-com start-up in
Houston. Three years ago, he developed severe arthritis and was
unable to work. A year and a half later, he discovered the
rollator.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal when I was disabled for 18 months was to get vertical
and get engaged in work again,'' he said. ``The rollator has helped
me do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, people have a cultural hang-up about using
assisted-walking devices. So many just sit, or walk very, very
poorly. They would be in much better shape with a rollator.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn says many studies have shown that that walking and exercise
are crucial to the health and longevity of older people.
</P>
<P>
   The rollator, he said, ``keeps people on the move.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for those with strokes or Parkinson's disease,
because it helps with balance,'' he added. ``A motorized wheelchair
or cart can be a blessing if you have no other choice. But it's too
bad if you go to motorized transportation when you still have the
capacity to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn, who is 82, doesn't need any assistance for his daily walks
to and from his office or for his trips to a gym three times a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regular exercise is like religion,'' he said. ```You need it
every day.''

 &HT;    In dead heat, Bush campaign appears to be behind
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For George W. Bush _ whose chances of becoming
president vacillate between inevitable and inconceivable _ it's
campaign-trail deja vu, a political summer rerun.
</P>
<P>
   You may have caught this story line during it's earlier run
after surprising losses in the primaries: Bush is a malaprop-prone
guy who hasn't offered enough specifics, ducks debates and perhaps
should jettison the political team that took him this far.
</P>
<P>
   As in the primary season, months of front-running are being
interrupted by weeks of doubt. As Labor Day approaches, the
double-digit leads of polls from primary season until the
Democratic National Convention have evaporated into a statistical
dead heat with Democratic nominee Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Going into tomorrow's traditional _ and artificial _ start of
the fall campaign, the Bush campaign looks something like it did
after Arizona Sen. John McCain stomped him in New Hampshire and
beat him in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new reality is that Bush is on the defensive and Gore has
put him there,'' said University of Texas government professor
Bruce Buchanan, a presidential scholar and longtime Bush observer.
``I didn't think Gore could do it, but somehow he managed to stop
shooting himself in the foot and shake Bush up for the first time
since McCain did it in the New Hampshire and Michigan primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The aura of inevitability is gone,'' Buchanan said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Not if the Bush team can help it. Doubt may reign among
academia, the Sunday morning talkers and conventional wisdom, but
it has no place in the public pronouncements of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are slightly better off than we thought we'd be on Labor
Day. This is going to be a close election. We've said that all
along, `` said Karl Rove, Bush's top strategist. ``The neat thing
is we are fighting on (Gore's) territory rather than him fighting
on ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the confidence _ real or otherwise _ is the prospect of
victory in states that have not gone Republican in a presidential
election in a long time. For example, Herbert Hoover, in 1928, was
the last Republican to carry West Virginia. Polls indicate Bush has
a shot. Ditto for states like Missouri, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa
and others that haven't gone GOP in awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Rove does the math and has the answer: Bush needs to find about
44 more electoral votes to get over the 270 needed to get the White
House keys. There are lots of places to get those votes, Rove
believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be more than 270, close to 300,'' said Rove.
</P>
<P>
   When they gather to strategize on the second floor in the
downtown office building that houses the headquarters, Bush
advisers work toward reaching out to the two groups of undecided
voters they see making the difference on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   In house, the first group is called ``radical centrists'' or
``radical moderates.'' They are issue-driven, but the issues are
all over the board, some fiscal, some social, some international.
They are weakly aligned with parties.
</P>
<P>
   The other group of undecideds is less issue-driven, more
interested in the nature of the candidate. They want leadership,
credibility and trust.
</P>
<P>
   As issues are fleshed out, the first group of undecideds
diminishes and the second group becomes more important, according
to the Bush campaign theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Gore has a fundamental credibility problem with these
people,'' said Rove, reflecting an attitude highlighted in a
Republican National Committee ad airing in key states.
</P>
<P>
   The ad shows footage of Gore at the now-famous 1996 Buddhist
temple fund-raising event. A woman's voice, complaining about Gore
``reinventing himself'' says ``Who's he going to be today? The Al
Gore who raises campaign money at a Buddhist temple or the one who
now promises campaign finance reform?''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, who has promised an optimistic, uplifting campaign,
going after Gore is a necessary part of the equation. Asked last
week if he could win without negative ads, he said, ``It all
depends on the definition of negative ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan believes the Bush campaign's best, perhaps only, hope
is something approaching a personality contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Bush can win a policy argument. He can't
outpromise Gore on anything but tax cuts. His competitive
advantages are bipartisan leadership, likability and the prospect
of change,'' the professor said. ``The goal is to get public
attention focused on these things again, with policy more in the
background.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Bush adviser Tom Rath believes that's where
Bush wants the campaign to wind up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come out of the debates it's going to turn from an
issue-driven race to a character race, an ability-to-lead kind of
race. And that's the race they feel the most comfortable about,''
said Rath. ``They eventually believe this will turn into a national
job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the campaign is headed, Bush aides want everyone to
believe it is on a course charted long ago and resistant to wild
swings in poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we have a plan,'' said Rove. ``We are executing the
plan. We know we've got a lot of work to do and there are going to
be ups and downs. But I have confidence in the ultimate outcome
because our base is energized. They are going to be standing in
line when the polls open and the other side seems relatively
lukewarm.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, some see Rove's confidence as poker-faced
bluster from a man holding a lesser hand after the most recent
shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Bush camp says they always expected it,'' said
Buchanan. ``But I don't think anybody expected what we see now. For
Bush, a dead heat must feel like 10 points behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign seems off balance,'' he added. ``Bush seems less
confident on the stump. The malapropism rate has gone back up. The
Gore campaign is driving the policy debate. And they're letting the
argument about debate formats seem like Bush is afraid to debate
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   An out-of-state Bush adviser in close contact with the campaign
said he believes Rove's confidence is far more sincere than spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the one thing that disquieted them in the last week is the
slippage in Florida,'' the adviser said. ``They think they will get
Florida, but they will have to work harder to hold it than they
thought they would.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida, with 25 electorate votes and Jeb Bush, the candidate's
brother, as governor, is considered a key part of the Bush victory
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is does Bush have a positive and optimistic
agenda that will grab people's attention,'' said a top Bush aide.
``It's a work in progress and we are doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   That confidence is bolstered by internal polls showing that Bush
is selling well in key, swing states. In one of those states,
Bush's lead in the internal poll is in the low single digits among
registered voters. But the lead goes up to low double digits when
the poll is refined to reflect self-identified likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a pattern in other states we are looking at,'' said
a Bush aide familiar with the numbers. ``We have a nice lead
developing among likely voters. Every bit of evidence is we do
better among likely voters than we do among registered voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also takes Labor Day solace in the fact that
he also does better among Electoral College voters than among
popular voters. While the national polls show a tight race
nationwide, the state-by-state polls show Bush ahead in states with
248 of the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. Gore leads in
states with 168 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Bush faithful, it adds up to make-your-reservations
kind of confidence, tempered by the fact that no deposit is
required.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that with all your hard work...George W. Bush will win
in November!'' Marian Miller, president of the National Federation
of Republican Women said in a missive to members last week. ``That
means this January we will witness the inauguration of the first
Republican president in eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller touted inaugural packages offered by Washington hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be asked to reserve the room prior to the election
with the understanding that, if Governor Bush is not elected, you
can cancel your reservation with no penalty,'' Miller added.

<P>
   Oral water sprays used by dentists contain levels of some
bacteria that could kill vulnerable patients, government
researchers have discovered.
</P>
<P>
   They found that levels of opportunistic pathogens exceeded
English drinking water safety limits in 52 out of 55 water samples
taken from 21 dental surgeries in the southwest of England.
</P>
<P>
   This means people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer
patients and those with HIV infection, are at risk, the researchers
warn. James Walker of the Center for Applied Microbiology and
Research at Porton Down and his team found several types of
opportunistic pathogens in many of the dental unit waterlines
tested, including species of Mycobacterium and Legionella _ both of
which can cause life-threatening pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   David Turner of the British Dental Association admitted:
``People with compromised immune systems should worry.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also isolated oral streptoccoci in 10 percent of
the samples. Since the bacteria is only found in the mouth, it is
most likely that it was sucked back into the tools and into the
waterlines during dental procedures. Robert Staat of the University
of Louisville's school of dentistry has also found oral
streptococci in dental unit waterlines. ``This is like sharing
spit,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, most of the bacteria breeding in these waterlines
occur naturally in the environment and pose little threat to most
people. Even so, healthy patients shouldn't be exposed to these
levels of bacteria when they are at a healthcare facility, argues
Hugh Pennington, a microbiologist at the University of Aberdeen.
``I wouldn't want to have these in my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's team found levels of bacteria between five and 1200
times higher than the permitted 2500 microbes per teaspoon of
water. Some of the highest bacterial counts came from dental unit
waterlines that were either supplied with bottled water or were
recently sanitized. This casts doubt on the effectiveness of
recommendations by the British Dental Association and its U.S.
counterpart, the American Dental Association, that surgeries should
use bottled water and disinfectants to reduce the risk of bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA said that similar studies carried out in several U.S.
cities revealed bacterial counts that surpass its own safety
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists in both the United States and Britain are advised to
use sterile water for immune-compromised patients and those
receiving surgery where the gumline is cut. But both the American
and British Dental Associations admit it's not clear how strictly
this advice is followed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the millions of people who visit a dentist each year,
contaminated dental water was blamed for only a handful of
infections. Although some patients died, the link to dental water
was never proved.

<P>
   It's been 60 years since writer Isaac Asimov dreamed up his laws
governing robot behavior. But the message still hasn't sunk in.
Researchers in Thailand have developed a robot security guard that
comes armed with a gun, and has no qualms about whom it shoots.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Roboguard,'' the gun-toting sentinel is designed as a
cheap alternative to a human guard. It can be ordered to fire at
will, or told to check first with a human via a secure Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   As they appeared in Asimov's science fiction writings in 1940,
the three laws of robotics were meant to prevent robots from
harming people. Roboguard appears to have the potential to defy all
three.
</P>
<P>
   The machine was built by Pitikhate Sooraksa of King Mongkut's
Institute of Technology in Ladkrabang, Bangkok. It consists of a
handgun and a small video camera mounted on a motorized holder that
can direct them automatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has two modes _ manual and automatic,'' says Sooraksa.
Using the weapon in manual mode, he can control the gun from a
computer anywhere in the world. A laser pointer on top of the gun
marks its current target.
</P>
<P>
   For automatic operation, Roboguard is fitted with infrared
sensors that allow it to track people as they move. Sooraksa has
password-protected the ``fire'' command for when the robot is
operated over the Internet. ``We think the decision to fire should
always be a human decision,'' he says. ``Otherwise it could kill
people.''
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't reassure Kevin Warwick, a cyberneticist at Reading
University who has long warned of the dangers of robots gaining too
much power over human beings. ``Things can always go wrong,'' he
says. You can never allow for all eventualities. ``We need to think
about introducing laws like Asimov's, but even then robots will
find ways to get around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers were equally concerned about Roboguard. ``I
find this quite horrific,'' says Chris Czarnecki of the Center for
Computational Intelligence at De Montfort University in Leicester.
``What about time delays across the Internet when it's busy? What
you'll be seeing and what the gun's pointing at will be two
different things. You could end up shooting anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Czarnecki also suspects the robot's tracking system might be
error-prone. ``If the tracking's infrared, what happens when the
sun comes out? It's a big source of infrared radiation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Roboguard is tooled up with nothing more powerful
than an air gun. To test its accuracy, Sooraksa pinned balloons to
the walls and took potshots at them from a computer. ``It's very
similar to a real gun,'' he says. It could easily be upgraded to a
more powerful weapon such as a machine gun, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Sooraksa says Roboguard might be of interest to private
companies, but sees the armed forces as a more likely buyer. ``We'd
like to show it to the military,'' he says. ``It should be in good
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The current, static version of Roboguard could be just the
start. Sooraksa hopes to develop his prototype further. ``You could
make it mobile; it could be designed as a walking system,'' he
says. ``We have the technology.''

   Safer, cheaper and more effective snake antivenom may soon be
made using DNA technology. The development could help overcome an
imminent shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a crisis in antivenom production worldwide,
particularly in Africa. The traditional manufacturers are closing
down for economic reasons,'' says David Warrell of Oxford
University.
</P>
<P>
   Antivenom is still made by a century-old method. Animals, mainly
horses, are injected with increasing levels of venom. The
antibodies they produce are then extracted and purified. But such
antiserum has serious shortcomings. Many of the antibodies it
contains are useless because they target harmless components of the
venom, and it can also cause nasty side effects such as
anaphylactic shock or serum sickness.
</P>
<P>
   These problems can be overcome by injecting animals with DNA
rather than the venom itself, say Rob Harrison and his colleagues
at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in England. ``Our
effort is focused on generating antibodies specific to the toxic
venom components,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   To show this approach works, Harrison's team took the gene for
jararhagin, a deadly enzyme in the venom of the Brazilian pit viper
(Bothrops jararaca) that causes hemorrhaging. They shot microscopic
gold beads coated with this gene into the skin of mice. The mice
responded by generating antibodies to the enzyme that their cells
made from the gene. Although these antibodies targeted only a
single venom component, they neutralized over 70 percent of the
hemorrhagic activity of the whole venom, says Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   The group is now starting to develop antivenom for the Echis
genus of snakes, or carpet vipers. ``This snake is responsible for
more deaths than any other snake in the world,'' says Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to inject venom genes into genetically modified mice
whose immune systems produce human-type antibodies. The
antibody-producing B cells will then be extracted and fused with
immortal cells, providing a potentially unlimited supply of
antivenom without any further use of animals. Since the antivenom
will consist of human antibodies, says Harrison, it shouldn't have
the harmful side effects of conventional antiserum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a rational way to make antivenom,'' says David
Weiner, of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. ``It's
very exciting.''

   Do red-headed Belgians take their holidays on the Red Sea?
</P>
<P>
   The Web is pretty good at letting people surf through text,
pictures, movies and sounds. But if you're interested in
manipulating good, hard data, it can be a bit of a let-down. Now
new standards promise to allow people to go ``data mining,''
searching and comparing data from several sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it simple to publish data so other people can
do meaningful things with it,'' says Robert Grossman, director of
the Laboratory for Advanced Computing at the University of Illinois
in Chicago. Grossman led a group that last week released the first
version of the Dataspace Transfer Protocol (DSTP).
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to give people access to stores of data held on
different servers across the Net so that they can pull out the data
they want from each one and analyze it.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you suspected that sunspot activity might be related to
global warming. Searching the Web you might find a database of
sunspot information and another one of global warming information.
But the chances are that the two databases will be in different
formats, and the data you want will be buried under a mountain of
material you don't need.
</P>
<P>
   Using the new protocol, you could transfer just the data you
want from the databases, align it by date, and call up a graph of
sunspot activity against temperature.
</P>
<P>
   DSTP only works if data is presented in a new format called
Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML), just as the Web works
using a method called Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to move
documents written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
</P>
<P>
   The new standards tell people who want to make their data
available how to format and label their columns and rows. Once the
database is properly formatted and labelled, a user can search and
manipulate it with the DSTP.
</P>
<P>
   The new, open standards are being developed and published by a
coalition of universities and businesses, including IBM, Oracle and
NCR. They hope that, like HTTP and HTML, they will be adopted
voluntarily by a critical mass of computer users.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's what people for a long time have been looking
for,'' says Claudia Gardner of IBM's Intelligent Miner for Data
programme. Open standards will help their applications become more
popular, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman admits DSTP could encourage people to make dubious
correlations, such as plotting the incidence of heart attacks
against the position of the stars. ``What's to keep stupid people
from doing stupid things? Nothing,'' he says. ``But this is to help
smart people do smart things.''

 &HT;    Erks dream fuels growth at Georgia Southern
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATESBORO, Ga. _ Two practice fields sit adjacent to each other
near a creek that has become a part of Georgia Southern's football
lore.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 o'clock most late-summer afternoons, Statesboro's
best-known and most-celebrated resident parks near the field where
the Eagles' defensive team practices and sits on the tailgate of
his white jeep.
</P>
<P>
   After a second hip-replacement surgery about a month ago, Erk
Russell has had to take a break from the four or five rounds of
golf he used to play each week. Russell is 74 now and needs a
walking cane to get around, but, in these parts, Russell remains
the most powerful force around.
</P>
<P>
   With Russell's winning football program as the catalyst, the
university and its surrounding community has gone through
eye-popping growth. ``I came here in January of '81, and Erk came
in July of that year,'' said Bucky Wagner, the former Georgia
Southern athletics director. Wagner had pursued Russell
relentlessly until he finally agreed to take the job as football
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were only about 6,000 students here then,'' Wagner said.
``But after we won the first (1-AA) national title in '85, we
started to add about 1,000 students a year until we hit 14,000 and
tapered off.''
</P>
<P>
   When Russell put his first team on the field at the local high
school in 1982, Statesboro's population was 12,423, and Bulloch
County's was 35,783. As Erk sat watching his son Rusty coordinate
the Eagles defense in preparation for Saturday's game against
Georgia, Statesboro was up to 21,958 and the county 51,562.
</P>
<P>
   The increase and Russell's presence are not coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it kind of goes to show you that the university is the
center of things, and, when it grows, it affects the community and
industry the same way,'' said Russell, who retired as a coach after
leading the Eagles to their third I-AA national title in 1989.
``Football gave us marketing. Ain't no way we could've had money to
buy what it brought in publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Wagner, now an associate professor of sports
management at the university, an estimated $125 million has been
spent on capital improvement at the state-supported school since
the football team won consecutive national titles in 1985 and 1986.
That number does not include the cost of 18,000-seat Paulson
Stadium, which was built in 1984 with private funds. Financing is
in place for a $24 million nursing-physics facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like we've added another campus,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, an assistant on Vince Dooley's staff for 17 years at
Georgia, left Athens seven months after the Bulldogs won the 1980
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like, as far I was concerned, I had one of the best
coaching jobs in the country,'' he said. ``But there was something
different and exciting (about starting a football program at
Georgia Southern), especially about coming to a place where you're
starting over. Both of my boys were out of school, so it was just
my bride and I, and I really felt like I didn't have that much to
lose. So why not give it a shot?''
</P>
<P>
   That shot made an impact unequaled in the annals of 1-AA sports.
It ignited a winning tradition that now includes five national
championships. The Eagles won their latest one last season under
Paul Johnson, a member of Russell's staff in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive-line coach John Pate also was a member of Russell's
staff. Pate recalled what made it special then.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great learning experience,'' said Pate, who left the
school in 1989 but returned as a member of Johnson's staff in 1997.
``Not only did we get a chance to learn X's and O's from the
master, but he mentored us and put us in a position to go out and
coach them. . . . With the old man here back then, it was like
being in Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner still lists luring Russell to Statesboro as his greatest
accomplishment. On Saturday, Russell will be among the horde of
spectators in Sanford Stadium. He missed the first game played
between Georgia and Georgia Southern in 1992 because of his first
hip-replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Based largely on what he has observed from his tailgating spot
near Beautiful Eagle Creek, Russell is not too optimistic about
Georgia Southern's chances Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you look out there and you say, 'How many of these
people did the University of Georgia offer a scholarship' ''
Russell said. ``You probably don't come up with a large number
there. Secondly, how many of these guys could make Georgia's first
or second team on offense or defense? You don't come with a very
large number.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they've got 85 scholarships and we've got 63. When you
play four quarters, depth is sometimes a determining factor. You
keep talking realistically, it shapes up as no contest. But we
ain't gonna play on paper. We're going play out there on turf.''

HOW DEBIT CARDS CAN BURN HOLES IN STUDENTS' POCKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By NANCY LLOYD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To avoid sending their children off to college with a financial
time bomb _ a credit card _ in their pockets, many parents have
begun telling them to carry a debit card instead. But though its
pitfalls are not as well known, this substitute can be just as
dangerous to a student's finances and credit rating.
</P>
<P>
   Personal cash flow has always been tricky ground for college
students, who tend to plunge into their first experiences of living
on their own with little money and less skill at managing it. And
parents have long sought ways to help keep their young scholars
from being caught short without accelerating them down the road to
profligacy and debt trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Sending students off to campus with a credit card ``for
emergency use only'' _ a gamble on their self-discipline _ has
become widespread. Three out of five undergraduates now carry at
least one card, according to a 1999 survey by Nellie Mae, the
student-loan agency.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, most issuers have made students a prime
marketing target for both credit and debit cards, especially as the
remainder of the adult population has become saturated. Banks are
happy to open card accounts for college students, even though they
generally have little or no income or credit history, because
industry research shows that young people tend to be intensely
loyal to the first card they get.
</P>
<P>
   But along with widespread card use come horror stories of
students charging expensive dinners, unneeded clothing and exotic
vacations and crushing themselves with debt. The survey found an
average balance on undergraduates' credit cards of $1,843.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the debit card. Students who have seen older siblings or
classmates get into money trouble are eagerly signing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my friends bounced four checks in a row because he
didn't balance his checkbook and he got charged a lot of money,''
said Patrick Earley, 18, a freshman at Wake Technical Community
College in Raleigh, N.C. Earley got a debit card in June, linked to
his checking account at the State Employees' Credit Union in
Raleigh. ``I don't have to worry about bouncing checks because I
can easily check my balance,'' he said, ``and I won't be tempted to
spend more money than I have in the bank,'' because the ATM will
deny it.
</P>
<P>
   That is true at his bank, but not at many others, where ATM
requests to overdraw an account may be allowed to go through. Then,
``consumers are hit with the same fee that they would be charged
for writing a bad check,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, the consumer
program director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, based
in Washington. The overdraft fee, typically around $20, is often
less than the dual fees, to the bank and the merchant, that the
consumer would pay if a paper check were returned instead. But many
consumers are not aware that a card transaction can also overdraw
an account.
</P>
<P>
   Exacerbating the danger is the ``overdraft protection'' feature
_ a line of credit _ offered to many debit card holders. Liana
Prieto, 20, a senior at Georgetown University, said that when she
opened a Citibank checking account last year, she received a $2,000
overdraft line, along with an ATM card that, while not a full-blown
debit card, could be used like one at some stores. ``I come from a
family where you don't buy things that you can't pay for,'' she
said, ``but other college students might find that $2,000 overdraft
line just as tempting as a credit card with a $2,000 credit
limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Manning, a visiting professor of sociology at Georgetown,
called such overdraft lines deceptive and potentially dangerous.
``Everyone thinks that debit cards are a no-lose situation,'' he
said. ``But banks are very shrewd. These kids are getting the
spending power of a credit card'' without violating their parents'
no-credit-card rules.
</P>
<P>
   Prieto's mother, Mercy Prieto, who owns an employment agency in
Manhattan, was aghast that students are routinely offered overdraft
lines that effectively turn ATM and debit cards into credit cards
if accounts run dry. ``Banks are helping them get into financial
trouble,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earley's mother, Annemarie, was also critical of such lines.
``It's misleading to financially unsophisticated teens,'' said
Earley, a director of retail banking research at the Gartner Group
in Stamford, Conn. Like other parents, she said, ``I'm trying to
teach my son to pay as he goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Pulley, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers
Association, denied that banks tried to mislead students by
offering them overdraft lines linked to debit cards. ``It's the
responsibility of a parent and child _ no, at 18 they're an adult _
to find the services that are right for them,'' she said. ``If you
buy a car, you're not going to buy it without test-driving and
reading up on it. Banking is the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Though an overdraft line of credit can help avoid returned-check
fees, it can nonetheless be a very expensive service, even more so
than many credit cards. Depending on the bank, debit card holders
who use overdraft lines may be paying much more than interest on
the overdraft: They may be charged an annual or monthly fee for
having such lines, even if they are never used, or they may face an
``activation'' or transfer fee of $3 to $10 for each use.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some banks allow use of overdraft lines only in $100
increments; overdrawing an account at such a bank by just $10 means
borrowing and paying interest on $100 from the line of credit; a
$101 overdraft turns into a $200 loan and so on.
</P>
<P>
   And many banks will not automatically pay off overdraft loans
out of subsequent deposits unless the account holder takes some
special action like filling out an extra form with the deposit.
Interest charges, meanwhile, can accrue long after enough money is
in the account to repay the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Pulley of the bankers association said that understanding how a
bank handles overdrafts is the consumer's responsibility, and that
overdraft fees are ``100 percent avoidable'' as long as the account
holder knows the rules and balances the checkbook. ``Whether you
are 18 or 85, you need to know how it works and what the fees
are,'' she said, adding that consumers who do not want an overdraft
line can simply decline it.
</P>
<P>
   Most debit cards are designed to look like credit cards, down to
the Visa or MasterCard logo, and they are accepted by nearly all
the same merchants. But debit cards typically offer students and
other consumers much less protection against fraud or disputed
charges than credit cards do.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Andrick, now 35, got her first credit card while attending
Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va., in the 1980s, and she knows
first hand how easy it is to rack up charges in college. ``I came
from an upper-middle-class family and did not understand what kind
of trouble I could get into,'' she recalled. ``My twin sister,
Sera, and I would go out to dinner with friends who had no money,
and charge dinner for eight on one of our cards. We figured, `Who
cares? It's just credit.'''
</P>
<P>
   When she graduated, she found herself without enough money to
move to a new city, get an apartment and still make even minimal
payments on her cards. ``I called my parents in tears,'' she
recalled. ``They agreed to pay off my debt, and I would pay them
back on a slower schedule than the credit card company had
demanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Would she have been better off with a debit card? She doesn't
think so. ``It's the same thing as a credit card and gives you the
same feeling of freedom: `If I don't have the cash, I'll just use
the overdraft.' The potential problems for naive college students
are the same, and the problems can fester years after you
graduate.''

ADDING UP THE DRAWBACKS OF A CREDIT CARD THAT ISN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DEBIT-CARDS-STUDENTS) 
(For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By NANCY LLOYD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They look like credit cards, are accepted in almost as many
places, and are now carried by tens of millions of consumers. But
debit cards can turn out to be much more expensive to use for any
consumer, not just a financial novice like a student. Here are some
of debit cards' little-known drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   _Higher prices for merchandise. When you pay with a debit card,
some merchants add a fee similar to an ATM surcharge _ a fact that
may not be posted in the store. Such surcharges are almost never
imposed on credit card purchases.
</P>
<P>
   _Holds on your checking account. &UR;  &LR; When you present a debit card
to initiate a purchase whose amount is not known at the outset _
like checking in at a hotel, renting a car or even filling the gas
tank _ the merchant typically places a hold on your account for an
amount much greater than you are likely to wind up spending. Such
holds may take days to be cleared, and checks may bounce as a
result, even though the money to cover them is in the account _ and
you may be assessed returned-check charges that can be difficult to
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   _No proof of creditworthiness. Car rental companies may let you
make a reservation and pay the bill with a debit card but still
insist that you produce a credit card with adequate available
credit as security before they release a car to you.
</P>
<P>
   _Less leverage in disputes with merchants. If you use a credit
card to order merchandise that never arrives or is defective,
federal law offers strong protections, letting you refuse to pay
until the dispute is settled. Not so with debit cards, which
transfer your money to the merchant almost immediately, as if you
had paid in cash.
</P>
<P>
   _Less protection against theft. Federal law limits a consumer's
maximum liability for others' fraudulent use of a credit card or
card number to $50, provided that the bank is notified of the
card's loss or theft within 60 days. But for a debit card, under
federal law, consumers must report the theft or loss within two
business days to limit the loss to $50. After that, the potential
loss rises to $500, and after 60 days there is no cap _ every penny
in the account and any linked credit line are at risk. Some banks
promise to extend to 60 days the reporting period for the $50 cap,
but the promise has no force of law and can be withdrawn without
notice.
</P>
<P>
   _Salt-in-the-wound fees and problems. &UR;  &LR; Even if you report a
debit-card theft in time to be eligible, the $50 loss limit applies
only to money removed from your account by the thief's actions. You
can still be assessed with fees if the theft drives your balance
below your account's no-fee minimum or causes checks that you have
written to bounce, and those bounced checks can damage your credit
standing.

MILLENNIUM REPORTS ADVANCE IN CARDIO TREATMENT DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. has discovered a potential new
target for treating cardiovascular disease, advancing its effort
with partner Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. to develop drugs for the treatment of
congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Although research is at an early stage, the Cambridge, Mass.
biotechnology company described the discovery Thursday as
significant because the potential target is the first known to be
related to angiotensin-converting enzyme, or ACE, a catalyst in
hypertension and congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The newly identified gene, angiotensin-converting enzyme-related
carboxypeptidase, or ACE2, is similar in structure to ACE.
Millennium scientists believe they likely evolved from the same
parent gene and serve similar functions in the body.
</P>
<P>
   ACE, found throughout the body, produces a substance known as
angiotensin II that narrows blood vessels, forcing the heart to
work harder to pump blood through the smaller channels. The class
of drugs known as ACE inhibitors blocks the production of
angiotensin II, lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ACE, however, ACE2 is found only in the heart, kidneys,
and testes. It produces an angiotensin peptide whose function is
not yet known. And Millennium scientists said it does not respond
to the ACE inhibitor drugs currently on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it is only found in the heart and kidneys, it provides
an opportunity to develop more specific therapies with potentially
fewer side effects,'' said Dr. Roger Breitbart, senior director of
cardiovascular biology at Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street embraced the news. After the findings were reported
in Circulation Research, a publication of the American Heart
Association, the company's stock shot up $13.13 to close at $143.13
in heavy trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. More than 2.8 million
shares traded hands, a million more than the daily average.
</P>
<P>
   Even as investment analysts warned that the discovery might
never lead to a drug, they hailed it as more evidence of
Millennium's strong position in the genomics area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only one example of many that Millennium can point to
where they're succeeding at finding new drug targets,'' said
Carolyn Pratt, biotechnology analyst in Needham &AMP; Co.'s Boston
office. ``They just keep doing this over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Millennium scientists found ACE2 while sifting through 19,000
gene sequences found in biopsies of human hearts suffering from
heart failure. The gene caught the scientists' attention, Breitbart
said, because of its similarities to ACE. After more study, they
realized it was a good potential target for new drugs because of
its differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it responded to the ACE inhibitors, we wouldn't pursue this
project,'' Breitbart said. ``It's exciting because it gives us
another potential way to treat cardiovascular disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardiovascular disease is one of the largest drug markets in the
United States. Almost 60 million Americans suffer from one or more
types of cardiovascular disease according to the American Heart
Association. Of those, about 4.6 million suffer from congestive
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium and Eli Lilly partnered in 1995 to isolate genes that
cause artherosclerosis, a type of heart disease in which the
arteries are blocked by fatty deposits, but later changed the focus
to congestive heart failure. Now that Millennium has identified
ACE2 as a potential target, Eli Lilly will play a bigger role in
the research efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have to figure out exactly what role ACE2 plays in
congestive heart failure and then turn that knowledge into an
effective drug. Even if all goes well, it would be years before a
product is available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting new target,'' said Robert W. Grupp, a
spokesman for Eli Lilly. ``Now, the collaborative research to
develop a drug begins in earnest.''

   Last month, just in time for Labor Day, I did something I
haven't done since working my way through college as a doorman. I
joined a union.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, it's a union of writers _ even though, in my
experience, every writers' organization is either an oxymoron or a
shambles. But whether writers have a union, or whether that union
includes me, isn't the point. What matters far more is the unusual
nature of the group I joined, the National Writers Union; it could
offer an interesting model for other unions hoping for redemption
from the long twilight of irrelevance to which they have helped to
consign themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In some very important ways, the National Writers Union is the
union of the future, and the apparatchiks who run more
old-fashioned unions had better take notice. The United Auto
Workers did just that eight years ago, when it took in the writers'
union as one of its locals. The UAW, though usually identified with
the traditional assembly line, has been in the forefront of
organizing nontraditional workers, many of them more familiar with
Socrates than socket wrenches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a growing field,'' said Phil Wheeler, director of the
UAW's northeast region. Of the writers' union, he said, ``We felt
we could learn from them, and we could be very helpful to them.''
</P>
<P>
   (I must say I feel pretty macho belonging to what is now Local
1981 of the UAW, and I look forward to a nice jacket or at least a
logo-bedecked baseball cap.)
</P>
<P>
   Since affiliating with the UAW, the writers' union has grown to
6,300 members from roughly 2,500, according to its president,
Jonathan Tasini. Admittedly, those are still small numbers in a big
country.
</P>
<P>
   But the union may be on to something. It represents
private-sector knowledge workers, precisely the kind of people whom
traditional unions have had little success in trying to organize.
And the writer-members are largely self-employed, which means that
the union does its work without benefit of the National Labor
Relations Board. Just about all these workers use computers, and
many have electronic-rights issues. They usually have to buy their
own health insurance. And a big proportion of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they're the work force of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   That is what makes the union so interesting. The first Labor Day
of the 21st century, after all, finds American unions in general
representing fewer than 10 percent of all private-sector workers
and struggling to keep up with the changing nature of work and the
work force. Against so gloomy a backdrop, the writers' union, at
least, understands the problem _ and is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has also foresworn the basic tactic of many
other unions, which try to force higher pay and benefits for their
members by turning the work force into a cartel, the way unions of
screen writers and other workers (industrial and otherwise) have
done. Tasini acknowledged that his union lacked the power to do
that, and anyhow, he'd prefer to have a union that people actually
want to join, instead of one seen merely as an overbearing gobbler
of dues.
</P>
<P>
   The union's battle to gain electronic reprint rights for its
members has attracted the most attention. Personally, I doubt that
most writers will see big money from electronic rights anytime
soon. But someday we might, and meanwhile even nickels and dimes
from the millions of Internet users out there can start adding up
to worthwhile amounts.
</P>
<P>
   To make it easier for publishers to comply, the union has set up
a Publication Rights Clearinghouse, which will administer a
licensing and royalty program akin to the ones run by Ascap and BMI
in the music industry. One online publisher, Steven Brill's new
Contentville.com, has already signed a license agreement giving
writers (through the clearinghouse) 30 percent of the fee it
receives when an article is downloaded, or about 90 cents of a
typical charge of $3 an article.
</P>
<P>
   The union also maintains a database of job openings, offers
group rates on medical insurance and is the only place I can think
of where individual writers can find affordable, comprehensive
libel insurance.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the National Writers Union is some kind
of latter-day workers' paradise. The jobs in its database do not
look very appealing, and there is an odor of political correctness
about the organization's Web site _ a report from the inevitable
diversity committee is signed ``In Solidarity.'' Moreover, it makes
me uncomfortable professionally to belong to an organization that
lobbies members of Congress for help, as it has in its e-rights
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, publishers try to influence policy in their favor,
so why should an organization of writers disarm unilaterally? And I
belong to other groups with which I don't always agree, from the
Democratic Party to the American Automobile Association. Heck, I'm
a member of Sam's Club.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. I wonder if they give any kind of union discount.

   Do red-headed Belgians take their holidays on the Red Sea?
</P>
<P>
   The Web is pretty good at letting people surf through text,
pictures, movies and sounds. But if you're interested in
manipulating good, hard data, it can be a bit of a let-down. Now
new standards promise to allow people to go ``data mining,''
searching and comparing data from several sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it simple to publish data so other people can
do meaningful things with it,'' says Robert Grossman, director of
the Laboratory for Advanced Computing at the University of Illinois
in Chicago. Grossman led a group that last week released the first
version of the Dataspace Transfer Protocol (DSTP).
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to give people access to stores of data held on
different servers across the Net so that they can pull out the data
they want from each one and analyze it.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you suspected that sunspot activity might be related to
global warming. Searching the Web you might find a database of
sunspot information and another one of global warming information.
But the chances are that the two databases will be in different
formats, and the data you want will be buried under a mountain of
material you don't need.
</P>
<P>
   Using the new protocol, you could transfer just the data you
want from the databases, align it by date, and call up a graph of
sunspot activity against temperature.
</P>
<P>
   DSTP only works if data is presented in a new format called
Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML), just as the Web works
using a method called Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to move
documents written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
</P>
<P>
   The new standards tell people who want to make their data
available how to format and label their columns and rows. Once the
database is properly formatted and labelled, a user can search and
manipulate it with the DSTP.
</P>
<P>
   The new, open standards are being developed and published by a
coalition of universities and businesses, including IBM, Oracle and
NCR. They hope that, like HTTP and HTML, they will be adopted
voluntarily by a critical mass of computer users.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's what people for a long time have been looking
for,'' says Claudia Gardner of IBM's Intelligent Miner for Data
programme. Open standards will help their applications become more
popular, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman admits DSTP could encourage people to make dubious
correlations, such as plotting the incidence of heart attacks
against the position of the stars. ``What's to keep stupid people
from doing stupid things? Nothing,'' he says. ``But this is to help
smart people do smart things.''

<P>
   RYUGASAKI, Japan _ They were the child princes and princesses of
Japan's most notorious religious sect, Aum Shinrikyo, which
released deadly sarin gas into the Tokyo subway in 1995. Their
pictures were prominently displayed next to their father's portrait
above cult shrines, where thousands of Aum disciples hailed them as
heirs apparent to the spiritual throne. They were considered child
gods.
</P>
<P>
   Then their father, Shoko Asahara, founder of Aum, was jailed for
masterminding the subway attack, which killed 12 people and injured
5,000, and the children's utopia crumbled along with the doomsday
cult.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Asahara's six children, four young women and two boys
from 6 to 22, are social pariahs. Although they have distanced
themselves from the cult, which now calls itself Aleph, the
children conceal their identities for fear of reprisals. They are
constantly relocating, because everywhere they move neighbors
conduct extensive protests.
</P>
<P>
   Most public schools will not let them attend class.
</P>
<P>
   Although they had no role in the subway attack, the children,
some of whom are still too young to understand what occurred, are
being held accountable for the worst terrorist assault in modern
Japanese history.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview, four children talked about growing up in
Aum Shinrikyo and the virtually impossible task that they face in
moving beyond the cult's infamy in a country where the sins of
fathers are often forever visited upon children.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say that our family is evil because of what happened
five years ago, but these little children hardly know anything
about it,'' Asahara's 19-year-old daughter said, referring to her
brothers, 6 and 7, and her sister, 11. ``To go to school is a very
precious thing. It's a part of life to make friends and become
educated. What justice will be accomplished by denying them this
basic right.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ryugasaki, where the family recently moved, just
northeast of Tokyo, refused to let the children register for
school, citing residents' concerns. Masayuki Ono of the city's
educational affairs division said that there was ``great anxiety
among residents'' and that the parent-teacher association of the
local elementary school had collected 1,355 signatures opposing the
children's admission.
</P>
<P>
   The children said that since the subway attack they had grown
accustomed to being despised and rejected. In the last five years,
they have moved at least six times, often on short notice and in
the wake of large and sometimes violent protests outside their
doors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the constant upheaval and emotional stress that the
children have endured, they appeared happy, outgoing and well
adjusted. But the adults in charge of them said the children had
been deeply traumatized but were quite skillful in masking their
pain, especially in front of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from one another, the one constant in their lives has been
their current guardian, a 39-year-old former cult member who has
cared for the children for the last decade. She is a licensed
teacher and provides them with home schooling. Two other women also
attend to the children's needs. The cult said it provided financial
support for the children for humanitarian reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been very difficult for them, because everything and
everyone they believed in was suddenly overturned overnight,'' the
guardian said. ``The worst part is the internal struggle that is
going on inside them. It's far worst than the opposition they face
from the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The children have few if any friends and spend most of their
time indoors. Once a month, they are allowed to visit their mother,
who is on trial for conspiring with her husband and a cult follower
in the murder of a dissident Aum member in 1994. Their father, who
is also standing trial, does not receive visitors. The oldest
sister, 22, is estranged from the others, and the third daughter,
17, lives separately but visits them frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they would like most to do in the world, the youngest
children scream with glee, ``Go to school!''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things that are necessary for me to learn at
school, and I think it would be fun to make some new friends,''
said the 11-year-old. She added that she fully understood the
barriers that prevented her from attending school. But when pressed
to explain them, she simply smiled and looked down.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Asahara's youngest son, who most closely
resembles his father, was allowed to attend an elementary school
temporarily in Otawara in Tochigi Prefecture despite opposition
from residents. ``There were many good teachers there, and we
caught a crawfish on a field trip,'' the boy said. ``The principal
gave me a snail, and I still have.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 19-year-old daughter expressed deep fear that her
classmates would learn that she is one of Asahara's children.
Although she usually enrolls in college correspondence courses, she
attended classes at a university for the first time this summer.
``When I meet people who are kind to me,'' she said, ``I get really
scared, because I always feel that the person may suddenly change
if they find out who I really am. I don't get too close to anyone.
I try to be nice but I don't go beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   The cult's legacy is highly likely to haunt the children for the
rest of their lives. Major Japanese companies typically investigate
the family backgrounds of prospective employees to make sure that
there are no skeletons in their closets that would later embarrass
them. Quite often, Japanese families hire private investigators to
research the backgrounds of their future in-laws.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Experts on cult groups said keeping the Asahara children
isolated from the rest of Japanese society was far worst than
integrating them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, the Asahara children are being raised by their
servants,'' said Shoko Egawa, an investigative journalist who is
considered an authority on Aum. ``They are being brought up as
special children. But I wonder if this is good. If they go to
public school, they will be treated the same as other children. If
they make friends, they will have contacts with those who don't
have Aum values.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they have disassociated from Aum, the children said
they had fond memories of growing up in the cult. ``They were like
my older brothers and sisters, and that's what we used to call
them,'' the second oldest daughter said. ``We were like one big
extended family, and I sometimes miss that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the children are careful, perhaps by design, to note that
although they were reared in the cult, they do not subscribe to
their father's teachings. They officially left the cult this year
when the group changed its name to Aleph and said for the first
time that Asahara had probably been involved in the subway attack
and that he would no longer be its leader.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the children say they love their parents. The 19-year-old
daughter said she remembered her father as an extremely gentle man
who despite his many commitments nursed her through a terrible
illness and was always available to help her with school work.
</P>
<P>
   That depiction contrasts sharply with the image that most
Japanese have of Asahara as the pink-robed head of the cult whose
colony at the base of Mount Fuji included tiny torture rooms and
laboratories that made poison gas. As leader of Aum, which once had
10,000 members, he is accused of ordering the attack in which
members planted sarin in crowded subway cars in morning rush hour
on March 20, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent summer afternoon, as Asahara's young sons raced
their red and blue bicycles, including one with training wheels,
through a park here, they seemed as innocent and rambunctious as
other Japanese boys their age. Keeping a close watch, the boys'
polite older sisters seemed equally harmless, as they cheered for
their younger brothers in a family outing that a passer-by, who
apparently did not know they were the Asahara clan, described as
``ever so lovely.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few blocks from the park, there was nothing lovely about
the hostile banners that neighbors had posted outside the
children's new house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Don't Want Aum Here,'' the signs said. ``Aum Go Away.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys seemed oblivious to them.

FIVE QUESTIONS: ELIZABETH WARREN ON THE RISE IN MIDDLE-CLASS
BANKRUPTCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A decade ago, in a widely praised analysis of bankruptcy
filings, three scholars destroyed the myth that most of those
seeking refuge from creditors were blue-collar workers. People in
every occupation go bankrupt in rough proportion to their numbers,
they found.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in ``The Fragile Middle Class'' (Yale University Press,
2000), the same three writers _ Elizabeth Warren, Teresa Sullivan
and Jay Lawrence Westbrook _ have refined their research and shown
that behind most bankruptcy filings lies misfortune, not profligate
living.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, a Harvard Law School professor, says the findings
suggest that the recent slight decline in bankruptcy filings
nationwide is misleading. The next next time the business cycle
hits bottom, she said, many people who are now solidly employed may
find themselves out of work with bankruptcy as their only recourse.
Following are excerpts from a recent conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did your latest analysis reveal about the finances of
middle-class Americans?
</P>
<P>
   A. The number of middle-class families declaring complete
financial failure exploded from 313,000 in 1980 to 1,281,000 in
1999. And they were much deeper in debt. In 1981, these people owed
nonmortgage debts equal to nine months of income, compared to more
than 22 months in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Don't people file for bankruptcy because they misused credit,
lived beyond their means?
</P>
<P>
   A. In the same way that dead bodies help pathologists understand
illness in a living population, the people in bankruptcy help us
learn about the economic risks facing families generally. Many
people in bankruptcy were solid bill payers until something knocked
their legs out from under them. For two-thirds of these people, it
was loss of a job, for 40 percent it was a serious medical problem
and for 20 percent it was the economic fallout of divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Some were loaded up with debt already, but many others were
swamped trying to survive joblessness, illness or divorce _ risks
which all middle-class Americans face. The bankrupt debtors are the
ones who didn't survive economically.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You and your colleagues write that in the last two decades,
government policies have shifted risks from capital to labor. What
does that mean for families?
</P>
<P>
   A. The American economy has benefited from agile companies that
can quickly shed or add workers, often on a contract basis without
fringe benefits such as health insurance. But this agility for
companies brought vulnerability for workers, through interrupted
employment and medical bills not covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The question we face as a society is how much of the economic
risk of job loss and medical problems should be borne individually
by each family and how much should be spread among everyone. The
portion of families who are failing economically in this new
environment has increased by fourfold over the past two decades,
and we need to recognize that there is no free lunch, that the new
policies that made companies agile also impose costs.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You write that it makes sound economic sense to have a
two-income family. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. Two incomes represent the only strategy most people have to
spread the risk of unemployment or catastrophic medical bills. Our
data show that if either spouse is unemployed, the chance that the
family will be in bankruptcy skyrockets by about 320 percent.
Following divorce, the chances of filing bankruptcy triple, and
that risk falls again, statistically, only when a divorced woman
remarries. The bankruptcy data show that a two-earner family is not
a matter of choice, but of economic survival.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So is there a way out of this through individual action or
changes in government policy?
</P>
<P>
   A. Bankruptcy is a solution invoked one at a time by families
who have fallen through the social safety net. The next time the
economy contracts we will see the disastrous effect of allowing 125
percent debt-consolidation mortgages and allowing lenders to charge
rates of interest that were illegal just 20 years ago. Bankruptcies
will explode and we will all pay the price for this folly.
</P>
<P>
   Better unemployment insurance would help, and so would
bankruptcy rules that let families survive and rebuild. If we are
reluctant to close some of the holes in the social safety net for
families, then we might be better off leaving the bankruptcy system
alone.
</P>
<P>
   As it is now, bankruptcy is the classic American free-market
deal _ debtors and creditors can do whatever they like, with
bankruptcy as the ``reset'' button if things go badly. Everyone
takes chances on that result.

 &HT;    Cheney talks up Bush schools policy
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Maybe Dick Cheney didn't see the ``Dandy
Diners'' bulletin board with 18 names and construction paper
fishes.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he didn't notice the book ``Life of a Sun Flower.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tiny cafeteria of Highlands Elementary School, the
Republican candidate for vice president looked out at his fourth
and fifth grade audience, congratulated them on going from a ``D''
school to an ``A'' school and then talked about school construction
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   After noting that America needs to ``create enough facilities to
be able to assimilate and accommodate all the people in school
these days,'' the former defense secretary explained the idea that
he and Texas Gov. George Bush are promoting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under current law, states are allowed to issue a certain
number of tax exempt bonds for private contractors to build public
facilities such as airports and low income housing. However public
school construction is not today allowed to use these special
bonds. We want to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   If the kids wanted to change speakers, they didn't let on. The
students and faculty were thrilled to have all the attention that
comes with having a national candidate drop by. Secret Service,
television cameras and time off from school.
</P>
<P>
   Three Highland students got special recognition. Fourth-grader
Jackie Soto and fifth-graders Jasmine Alexander and Jordan Fisher
got rewarded for being good students by getting a chance to meet
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   He congratulated them on their good work, and they each shyly
smiled as news cameras took their pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has the best kids in the world so why shouldn't we
have the very best schools in the world?'' Cheney said
</P>
<P>
   Education is considered a key issue this year. Both Bush and
Cheney were spending the day visiting schools. Cheney began his day
at a Fort Lauderdale school after a day of controversy there about
his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Broward County School Board objected to
allowing Cheney to use Croissant Park Elementary School for a
campaign stop. School Superintendent Frank Till refused to stop the
visit saying to do so at the last minute would be an embarrassment
to Broward schools.
</P>
<P>
   While Cheney was in Florida. Gov. Jeb Bush was in California
campaigning for his older brother. The topic there _ education.

   FBI charges Michael Pitelis in Parametric extortion case
</P>
<P>
   By BridgeNews
</P>
<P>
   Boston--Aug. 31--The Federal Bureau of Investigation said
Thursday that computer consultant Michael Pitelis has been indicted
for attempting to extort more than $1.5 million from computer
software company, Parametric Technology Corp.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Pitelis faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine for each count.
</P>
<P>
   Pitelis, who was arrested last week, allegedly obtained
Parametric Technology Corp.'s secret proprietary information and
threatened to publish it on the Internet if the company did not pay
him. On Aug. 11, Pitelis demanded $400,000 plus $40,000 per month,
before raising it to $1 million and extending to $1.5 million on
Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric Technology received an email Aug. 3, requesting
payment in exchange for not publishing confidential master ``keys''
to its Pro/Engineer software package on the Internet. The keys
allow for the illegal use of Pro/Engineer without paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   While Pitelis was making these threats via e-mail, Special
Agents of the FBI traced the e-mails and arrested Pitelis from
Florida. Waltham, Mass.-based Parametric Technology is a
manufacturer of mechanical computer-aided design and engineering
software.

RESEARCHERS CRITICIZE PROSTATE SCREENING TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Dole, Arnold Palmer and Harry Belafonte have all gone on
television to urge all men over 50 to get tested for prostate
cancer. But the widespread screening advocated by the American
Urologic Association and the American Cancer Society may lead to
more harm than good, two British researchers argue in a paper in
the current Lancet Oncology.
</P>
<P>
   Until a study proves that screening leads to a drop in prostate
cancer deaths, ``the ethics of subjecting symptom-free men to
screening tests is questionable,'' wrote David Neal, a professor at
the School of Surgical Sciences at the University of Newcastle upon
Tyne, and Jenny Donovan, a researcher at the University of
Bristol's Department of Social Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is the latest salvo in a debate that pits urologists and
radiation oncologists against some family physicians and
preventive-medicine experts, who say the screening catches too many
dormant cancers that would never have become lethal, leading to
unnecessary treatment with side effects that damage quality of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making an awful lot of men impotent and incontinent,''
said Dennis Fryback, a member of the U.S. Preventive Services
Council, which in 1997 came out against widespread screening.
</P>
<P>
   How Bob Dole fared is a private matter, he added, but what was
his next ad campaign? Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates on the other side are equally passionate. Dr. Robert
Smith, an epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society, said
physicans could ``wait forever for the perfect gold-standard
data.'' But he called that a conservative approach that ignores
signs that screening may be saving lives. For example, he said,
there has been an 11 percent drop in mortality among black men
since 1993 and a 16 percent drop among white men since 1991. And in
one Austrian county where screening was introduced, mortality rates
fell 42 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ideological passion abounds: Advertising campaigns have argued
that embarrassment and secrecy were killing men, and celebrities
from New York Yankees coach Joe Torre and New York mayor Rudy
Giuliani to Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf have been praised for putting a
public face on the disease.
</P>
<P>
   And critics like Fryback, a professor of preventive medicine at
the University of Wisconsin, see prostate screening as another sign
that doctors and drug companies push treatments without regard for
the extra worry and side effects they bring.
</P>
<P>
   But what the debate really reflects is a philosophical dilemma
about how to manage risk, on both an individual and societal level,
said Dr. Michael Barry, who researches prostate disease at
Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, which is debating coverage of the
screening under the national health plan, physicians tend to be
more conservative, Barry said, waiting for a study like the one
that showed mammography for women over 50 reduces their chance of
dying of breast cancer by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, he said, the consensus leans toward
screening. The American Cancer Society and the American Urologic
Association both advocate offering screening to men over 50, and to
men over 40 who are African-American or have a close relative
diagnosed with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Men have a 15 percent chance of being diagnosed with prostate
cancer in their lifetime, but only a 3 percent chance of being
killed by it, meaning that many cancers, if left undetected, would
not be lethal, Barry said. At the same time, the most common
treatments _ radiation and surgery _ leave more than 50 percent of
patients suffering from sexual dysfunction and 3 percent to 15
percent with incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that produces seminal
fluid, which transports sperm. It is surrounded by nerves that
control urinary and sexual function. Screening consists of a rectal
exam and an inexpensive blood test that detects prostate specific
antigen, a protein produced in greater quantities by an enlarged or
cancerous prostate. If PSA levels are elevated, a biopsy follows.
</P>
<P>
   Once a cancer is found, said experts on both sides, it is
psychologically difficult for a patient to choose not to have
radiation treatment or surgery -- especially since it is currently
hard to predict which cancers will progress and which will not.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society estimates that 32,000 men will die
of prostate cancer this year, and that 180,000 new cases will be
diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of prostate cancer spiked after screening was
introduced around 1989, and has now fallen below its 1992 peak. In
their paper, Neal and Donovan argue that while drops in mortality
could have been caused by screening that caught cancers at a
treatable stage, they also could simply reflect that more
non-aggressive cancers were caught.
</P>
<P>
   Smith of the American Cancer Society said he is confident that a
cancer-screening trial now being run by the National Cancer
Institute will validate screening. But in the meantime, he said, it
is important that men receive complete information about the risks
of treatment so they can make informed decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a work in progress,'' he said.

RECALLING GRAY LIFE UNDER SOCIALISM IN POLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Foreign Journal) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ The tables are set with thick, badly painted
china, government standard, with silverware of some cheap,
scratched metal alloy. A fan of thin, shiny and somehow unabsorbent
napkins pokes out of a thick glass; the salt shaker is a jam jar
with holes punched in the lid and rice mixed in, to stop clumping.
There are other jars, with a few dusty plastic flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The menu on the wall has more than 50 choices, but only a few
dishes, like macaroni with butter or with sour cream, pirogi and a
tomato, macaroni and meat soup, have prices listed next to them,
meaning that they are available.
</P>
<P>
   The sour-sweet smell of onions fried in bad oil fills the air.
</P>
<P>
   And today's Poles, amused and nostalgic, file through this
re-creation of a socialist cafe, part of an exhibition called,
``Gray in Color: 1956-1970.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the heyday of Wladyslaw Gomulka, the Communist Party
boss who tried to create a socialism in Poland under Soviet eyes
that broke with Stalinism and followed a ``Polish road.'' It was a
period of intellectual and artistic energy that ended with enormous
disillusion, including a bout of anti-Semitism in 1968 and Polish
participation in the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. In December
1970, workers' strikes in Gdansk and Szczecin left 45 dead and
1,100 injured, and Edward Gierek soon replaced Gomulka, who died in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   These events underpin this exhibition in Warsaw's Galeria
Zacheta, which tries to show the life of the period, particularly
its early optimism, without too much overt irony. Photographs show
proud mothers and soldiers, a knife grinder plying his trade, a
model posing against a lumpy old Czech Skoda car, a couple
embracing on the street near a large poster of Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why it surprises me that people look normal and
even happy,'' said Dorota Dobrowolska, a student going through the
gallery. ``People do the best with what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   An older woman, Justyna, did not want to give her surname. ``It
makes me nostalgic, of course,'' she said. ``We were young, and the
war wasn't so long before.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition shows the tension between socialist Poland and
European Poland, how the regime tried to keep a connection with the
culture of the West.
</P>
<P>
   There are displays of shop windows with the fashions of the
times, with efforts to copy the designers of the West. There are
the proud windows of Polish exports: Canned Krakus hams and Wodka
Wyborowa _ as usual, packaged with a care, neatness and design no
one bothered with for the domestic market. Ordinary Poles got by
with cheap vodka in reusable bottles with peeling labels, and few
at home ever saw a Krakus ham. But there are also photos of the
party elite, alike in their dark suits and white shirts, digging in
to lavish buffets.
</P>
<P>
   There is a plastic shopping bag with handles _ what the Russians
call an avoska, or ``perhaps bag'' _ that people carried just in
case a store had something worth lining up to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition re-creates one of the ``International Press and
Book Clubs'' the regime opened _ 18 of them across the country,
four in Warsaw _ to allow Poles to read some of the world's press,
magazines and books (carefully selected, of course, and
concentrating on the products of foreign Communist parties, like
L'Unita and L'Humanite). Or they could look at picture magazines or
listen to some of the world's music, always a safer proposition.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sample of the student clubs the regime initiated in
the 1950s, ``to channel cultural expression and help propaganda,''
as the gallery's notes suggest. A small black-and-white television
drones on with a speech by Gomulka at a Communist Party Congress. A
number of these student clubs were turned into jazz places and
theaters, more subversive than the party intended, and some were
closed down in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   There is a re-creation of a small arts cinema, its walls covered
with fabric and photographs of stars and directors, including
Sophia Loren, Gary Cooper, Jean Gabin, Orson Welles and Alfred
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition concentrates on some of the art of the time,
which was graphically bold and somewhat daring, at least in its
personal expression. But some of the art feels very dated, which
has more to do with the passage of time than ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the art is devoted to the politically correct program of
the time, to ``stop the arms race,'' and promote ``detente and
peaceful coexistence,'' as one poster says. Another shows a bomb
with an ``N,'' for nuclear; the heading reads: ``N (EQ) Nie,'' or
no.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking exhibitions shows the initial optimism
of the huge tower blocks that the regime built, as in Moscow, to
house the workers of the postwar, socialist Poland. There are
mock-ups of typical rooms _ the living room with its modular wall
of shelves and cabinets for storage and display, the lace curtains
and blocky sofas; the utilitarian bathroom, with its plastic
plumbing and a long water pipe that could swing between tub and
sink, so only one set of pipes needed to be installed; the tiny
bedroom, with its wall shelves and record player, a few jazz albums
strewn across the floor.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground floor of the gallery, as a counterpoint to the
failed dreams of socialism upstairs, is another exhibition
satirizing the modern consumer society of advanced capitalism. It
is called ``Buy or Die supermarket'' and is an homage to ``homo
shopens'' by the artist Pawel Borowski.
</P>
<P>
   Products include ``whole lamb stuffed with ideology'' and a
``lollipop flower stuffed with hope,'' its ingredients including
``light in a tunnel, a better future, coloring and confabulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The market also offers brainwashing powder (``free your mind
from dirt _ breakthrough formula is the choice for life!'') and
Lady Macbeth soap and shower gel (``it cleans even the most nagging
stains'').
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket's fast-food offering is a ``Happy Meal,''
consisting of ``a name brand bottle of warm vodka, an excellent
piece of fat sausage'' and a little vinyl piglet, intended ``to
make your life more complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the store, the American dollar features as both a
lure and a poison, a symbol for greed, globalization and smugness.
</P>
<P>
   On the same theme, in the luxury department (Last Supper
Edition) is a tiny jar marked ``Good caviar.'' The label says:
``Helps everybody! It contains the annual budget of the United
States for charitable activities.''

INSTEAD OF CELEBRATION, FIRESTONE'S CENTENNIAL TURNS INTO A DEATH
WATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TIRE-LABOR, FORD-VENEZUELA) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Rarely has a leading global company faced
such an extraordinary confluence of problems _ its flagship product
blamed for scores of deaths, its biggest customer undermining its
every defense, its stock price plunging along with consumer
confidence, its top executive summoned before an angry Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This is not how Firestone planned to celebrate its 100th
birthday this summer. The centennial, some marketing experts say,
has turned into a death watch for one of America's most familiar
brand names.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Thursday, regulators added 26 deaths to the 62
previously attributed to failures of Firestone tires in the United
States. In Venezuela, one of 18 countries where Firestone tires
have been recalled, the government's consumer agency asked the
state prosecutor to bring criminal charges against Firestone. It
also called for prosecuting the Ford Motor Co., saying the design
of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles that were equipped with
Firestone tires contributed to dozens of deaths in accidents there.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Ford officials insisted that the carmaker would
stand by Firestone as a supplier. But Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief
executive, refused during a news conference in Dearborn, Mich., to
reiterate that stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an extremely difficult and disappointing period
in our relationship, and we'll take this a day at a time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and its Japanese
parent, the Bridgestone Corp., insist the Firestone brand will
survive. John Lampe, the American subsidiary's executive vice
president, said here this morning that to restore customers'
confidence, the company would soon appoint an independent
investigator to look into the company's products and practices.
</P>
<P>
   But as Lampe spoke in an interview at an airport hotel, angry
union workers prepared to demonstrate in front of his company's
American headquarters here. Close to 8,000 workers could go on
strike Saturday morning at nine Firestone plants in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing experts are gloomy about Firestone's prospects.
Tylenol survived a poisoning scare a decade ago. Ford survived the
problem of Pintos that caught fire during collisions two decades
ago. And Firestone itself survived a much larger, if less deadly,
recall of its Firestone 500 car tires in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But now, under the unblinking glare of 24-hour news channels and
the Internet, Firestone _ pilloried again as insufficiently
concerned about safety _ is especially vulnerable, because consumer
loyalty to tire brands is weak, said Jack Trout, the president of a
market research company that bears his name in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their chance of survival is certainly in question,''
Trout said. ``There might be irreparable damage to the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampe said ``business was normal'' for tires not subject to the
recall, but also noted that the recall was taking up mechanics'
time and filling service bays, which would affect sales. The costs
of the recall and expectations that sales would tumble knocked 45
percent off Bridgestone's stock price in Tokyo trading during
August.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone has slowly gained market share over the last three
years at the expense of its two global rivals _ Goodyear and
Michelin _ by heavily marketing the success of Firestone tires on
the racetrack. Now its rivals are getting their revenge. Goodyear,
still the market leader in the United States, has just stepped up
its advertising, particularly of tires for sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have responded, we believe appropriately and effectively,
to the market opportunities out there,'' said Chuck Sinclair, a
Goodyear spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Tire dealers and customers in the Sun Belt states, where most
accidents involving the recalled tires _ 15-inch ATX, ATX II and
Wilderness models _ have occurred, said Thursday that consumer
confidence in the Firestone brand had been shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get a different brand of tires,'' said Allison
Leodler, a University of Texas student leaving a Firestone Service
Center in Austin, explaining she had been waiting two weeks for
replacement tires for her 1998 Explorer. ``It's been horrible,''
she said. ``I canceled a trip to Houston to see my parents a few
days ago because I'm scared to drive on the highway.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Understanding the tumult in the United States poses a special
challenge for Bridgestone in Japan, which has no Americans on its
board, even though half the company's sales are in the United
States. Here in Nashville, five of the 10 corporate officers of
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. are Japanese. They handle all
communications with Japan, said Lampe _ who, like most of the
American executives, does not speak Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Though analysts have viewed the tire maker's response to the
recall as tin-eared and defensive _ especially in comparison with
that of Ford, which often has released information as quickly as it
obtains it from Firestone _ Lampe said that he did not believe that
the company's foreign ownership had interfered at all with its
handling of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the timing of the recall could not be worse for
Firestone's management. Since the early 1990s, the American
operations have been led by two Japanese executives in close
partnership. Kenji Shibata, the president, oversaw sales and
marketing issues, while Masatoshi Ono, the chief executive, is an
engineer who has handled manufacturing and technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Shibata, who speaks fluent English and sometimes served as
an interpreter for fellow Japanese executives, retired in July.
Lampe described the retirement as unrelated to the recall, which
began on Aug. 9, although federal regulators opened an
investigation in early May.
</P>
<P>
   Shibata's retirement has left the many issues facing the company
in the hands of Ono, who conducts meetings in English but is
sometimes uncertain whether he understands all the nuances when
asked questions in English, said Trevor Hoskins, a retired senior
vice president of Bridgestone/Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   Ono, who declined repeated requests this week for an interview,
is scheduled to testify before the House Commerce Committee next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Nasser, who earlier in the week turned down an invitation
to testify, said Thursday he had changed his mind, though
congressional aides said he pointedly refused to appear on the same
panel as Ono.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone has a reputation in Japan for an unyielding
management style, especially compared to the more compromising
approach of other Japanese multinationals. A former executive
quipped to a Japanese newspaper that the first Japanese word that
the company's American employees learned was ``dam,'' or no. In
Japan, an employee committed harakiri in the office of
Bridgestone's president last year, to highlight the cause of
workers asked to leave the company. The man died the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But Lampe said that Firestone under Japanese ownership has moved
much faster this summer than it did in 1978, when it was still an
American company. Then, Firestone fought regulators for a year and
a half to prevent a recall and the release of documents which, when
finally handed over, showed that the company had known of problems
with Firestone 500 tires for several years and covered them up.

 &HT;    Kaplan `surprised' at ouster from CNN
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Shortly after he found out Tuesday he would not be
leading CNN anymore, Rick Kaplan called Jennifer Maguire, CNN vice
president of programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fired,'' Kaplan told her.
</P>
<P>
   It's a word both CNN and Kaplan have studiously avoided in
describing the reorganization of CNN's upper management Wednesday,
which forced out Kaplan, the controversial president of CNN-U.S.
for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Kaplan's secretary was still answering his phone
``Rick Kaplan's office.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't anymore. Kaplan had cleared out his Emmy Awards,
knickknacks and personal papers late Wednesday night, and he was at
home in Alpharetta, unlikely to set foot in the CNN Center again,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me stupid,'' said Kaplan, ``but I was totally
surprised.'' His employees and critics have called him many things
during his three years at CNN, and his 18 years at ABC News before
that _ sharp, obsessive, smart, hair-trigger, demanding _ but
rarely stupid.
</P>
<P>
   His fate became clear, he said, as he sat in Terence McGuirk's
office Tuesday and listened to the chairman of Turner Broadcasting
System outline the new plans for CNN. ``I realized I wasn't listed.
And he said, `I don't know if you would be a happy part of this
structure,''' Kaplan recounted in a telephone interview from his
home at Country Club of the South Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I wasn't paying attention much to what they were
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   The shuffle that pushed Kaplan out also dilutes the role of CNN
News Group Chief Executive Tom Johnson and gives more power to
executives from TBS, of which the news group is a unit. Namely, TBS
President Steve Heyer gets more business oversight while TBS
veteran Phil Kent moves to CNN News Group as president. Neither has
been available for interviews. The changes come as parent Time
Warner prepares for a merger with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said he accepts the decision to restructure, which many
CNN staffers think also is tied to the network's ratings drop this
year of about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not angry. If I don't fit in, I don't fit in. I'm a big
boy, and I've been in the business a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan wrote a statement for the press Tuesday afternoon and
called Jon Scanlon, an old public relations friend in New York. ``I
told him I've got a statement; I don't know how to send it out. I
don't know how to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday, Kaplan has a regular 12:15 p.m. meeting with
his staff, with U.S. bureaus hooked in on speakerphone. Even though
the story of Kaplan's firing had whipped through the newsroom
Tuesday night and been in the next morning's Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, he made the formal announcement. He told them
that ``you don't have to have been at CNN for 20 years to love
it,'' praised the new management team, and ended by saying, ``CNN
is a great network and it's going to stay a great network.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People looked at me like 'Why aren't you angry?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I love CNN. I love these people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The firing came during a tumultuous season for Kaplan. He was
planning convention coverage and getting regular reminders of CNN's
ratings woes when he was told his daughter Robin, 25, was badly
injured in an auto accident this summer in California. Kaplan took
some time off to be with her; now she's with him in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very rough eight months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Kaplan said, he plans to relax, play golf on
his home course and visit friends in Chicago (his hometown), Los
Angeles and London.
</P>
<P>
   His business plans are uncertain. He has 1 1/2 years to go on
his contract and would not say what settlement CNN would make, only
that he doesn't anticipate financial problems. He did not have a
``no-compete'' clause, so he's free to work wherever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to stay in television news. Maybe I'll do consulting,
maybe teaching, maybe I'll write.'' He isn't likely to return to a
TV executive position soon, because those would be in New York or
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sell my house,'' he said. ``I love Atlanta and
I expect to stay in Atlanta.''

ANALYSIS: HAS AMERICA CHANGED ENOUGH TO ALLOW MORE RELIGION IN
POLITICS? 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sen. Joseph Lieberman urged a greater role for religion in
public life in campaign speeches this week, he touched off a new
round in the sharp but unsettled debate over the role that personal
beliefs should play in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of Lieberman's remarks, including the
Anti-Defamation League, cast the issue in terms of separation of
church and state, suggesting that the senator had infringed that
principle.
</P>
<P>
   But another way to look at what Lieberman, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee, said is to ask whether American culture has
changed enough of late so that his remarks are more acceptable,
socially and politically, than they would have been earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Those who say such a change has taken place can cite various
reasons _ public unease over the political scandals of the late
1990s, for example, or the longer-term emergence of religious
conservatives as a political force or a less tangible but pervasive
interest in the personal over the political.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Christian Coalition has added to our dialogue on
politics and religion,'' said former Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
referring both to the conservative organization of that name and
also to the broader political movement of religious conservatives.
``Now, some of that is not good, but some of that is good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon, who now directs the Public Policy Institute at Southern
Illinois University, said he thought Lieberman had made his remarks
``with great care.'' But he also said that some of the religious
language used in the presidential campaign had left him
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overall impression,'' Simon said, ``is, the deeply
religious people don't talk about it as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the first Jew on an American national ticket, said in
a speech last Sunday that Americans needed to ``renew the
dedication of our nation and ourselves to God and God's purpose.''
And while he said the Constitution ``wisely separates church from
state,'' he added that there must be a place for faith in the
nation's public life.
</P>
<P>
   In reacting to his remarks, some harkened back to the example
set by John F. Kennedy, who sought to reassure voters in 1960 that
his Roman Catholicism would not dictate his policies as president.
Religious belief, Kennedy's words implied, is private.
</P>
<P>
   But four decades have elapsed since then, a long stretch in the
cultural life of a still-young nation. In the United States, as
Lieberman noted on Monday, polls show that religious belief remains
unusually widespread, certainly when compared with Europe. Surveys
report that 19 out of 20 Americans say they believe in God.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the American marketplace _ both a guide to and an
influence upon the broader culture _ recognizes no separation of
the sacred and the profane, such that books by the Dalai Lama,
Tibet's spiritual leader, can soar onto the best-seller lists, and
CBS can broadcast a reverent mini-series on Jesus during its spring
sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   There is some statistical evidence, too, that public attitudes
about religion and politics have shifted since the 1960s, blurring
whatever boundary might have existed between the two.
</P>
<P>
   A new book, ``The Diminishing Divide: Religion's Changing Role
in American Politics'' (Brookings Institution, 2000), reports that
whereas a narrow majority of Americans in 1968 wanted churches to
stay out of politics, that opposition had eroded by 1996, when a
narrow majority said churches should freely express their views.
</P>
<P>
   One of the book's four authors, John Green, a professor of
political science at the University of Akron, said that ``a greater
demand'' existed for religious talk in political life and that
there was also ``a greater supply of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public is more interested in values these days,
particularly questions of morality, than they have been in the
recent past,'' said Green, who directs the Ray C. Bliss Institute
of Applied Politics at his university.
</P>
<P>
   Green said several factors were at work, among them diminishing
worry over economic and international threats and a growing concern
over the turmoil of political scandals, high school shootings and
hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders ``have sensed this disquiet, and want to
respond to it,'' Green said, either by speaking of religious faith
or talking more about broad values, as Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee, does in speaking of the need for
``prosperity with a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   One person critical of Lieberman this week, Barry Lynn,
executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church
and State, agreed in part with some of Green's assessment, saying
Americans had been shaken by the personal scandals involving
political leaders, notably President Clinton and the former House
speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a general sense that our political leaders have failed us
because they lacked moral grounding,'' Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, candidates ``feel compelled not just to
say, here's my moral vision, but here's the religion that underlies
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn called that ``unhealthy'' for a diverse society and a
threat to provoke a sort of spiritual one-upmanship among
candidates, each feeling so compelled to cite Scripture that the
race for office becomes like ``a final exam in Bible studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet others suggest that the high profile that religion is
receiving in the current presidential campaign reflects a subtler,
longer-term trend, a growing interest among Americans in hearing
the personal narratives, not simply the technical ideas, of their
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to hear your story,'' said Dr. Richard J. Mouw,
president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif. ``I
think today the question is, What kind of person is this, what kind
of leader will he be?''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Mouw said, ``having that person speak out of the
depths of his own human experience, that kind of comes to be a
value thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mouw, who found Lieberman's statements pleasing, said that
American society was more open to public expressions of religious
identity than it was 30 years ago, when he received his doctorate
in philosophy from the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a philosopher, you had to hide your religious
convictions,'' he said, contrasting that with the present
situation, in which Christian philosophers have their own
association, which publishes a journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more acceptable in the academic world than it was in
1970 to identify your religious convictions and speak openly about
them,'' Mouw said.

   EMULEX (Los Angeles) _ A former employee of Emulex Corp. was
arrested and accused of sending a bogus press release that had
investors dumping the company's stock. Authorities say the
23-year-old college student made $250,000 short-selling, but now
risks 15 years in prison if convicted on securities fraud charges.

   WARSAW, Poland _ The tables are set with thick, badly painted
china, government standard, with silverware of some cheap,
scratched metal alloy. A fan of thin, shiny and somehow unabsorbent
napkins pokes out of a thick glass; the salt shaker is a jam jar
with holes punched in the lid and rice mixed in, to stop clumping.
There are other jars, with a few dusty plastic flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The menu on the wall has more than 50 choices, but only a few
dishes, like macaroni with butter or with sour cream, pirogi and a
tomato, macaroni and meat soup, have prices listed next to them,
meaning that they are available.
</P>
<P>
   The sour-sweet smell of onions fried in bad oil fills the air.
</P>
<P>
   And today's Poles, amused and nostalgic, file through this
re-creation of a socialist cafe, part of an exhibition called,
``Gray in Color: 1956-1970.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the heyday of Wladyslaw Gomulka, the Communist Party
boss who tried to create a socialism in Poland under Soviet eyes
that broke with Stalinism and followed a ``Polish road.'' It was a
period of intellectual and artistic energy that ended with enormous
disillusion, including a bout of anti-Semitism in 1968 and Polish
participation in the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. In December
1970, workers' strikes in Gdansk and Szczecin left 45 dead and
1,100 injured, and Edward Gierek soon replaced Gomulka, who died in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   These events underpin this exhibition in Warsaw's Galeria
Zacheta, which tries to show the life of the period, particularly
its early optimism, without too much overt irony. Photographs show
proud mothers and soldiers, a knife grinder plying his trade, a
model posing against a lumpy old Czech Skoda car, a couple
embracing on the street near a large poster of Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why it surprises me that people look normal and
even happy,'' said Dorota Dobrowolska, a student going through the
gallery. ``People do the best with what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   An older woman, Justyna, did not want to give her surname. ``It
makes me nostalgic, of course,'' she said. ``We were young, and the
war wasn't so long before.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition shows the tension between socialist Poland and
European Poland, how the regime tried to keep a connection with the
culture of the West.
</P>
<P>
   There are displays of shop windows with the fashions of the
times, with efforts to copy the designers of the West. There are
the proud windows of Polish exports: Canned Krakus hams and Wodka
Wyborowa _ as usual, packaged with a care, neatness and design no
one bothered with for the domestic market. Ordinary Poles got by
with cheap vodka in reusable bottles with peeling labels, and few
at home ever saw a Krakus ham. But there are also photos of the
party elite, alike in their dark suits and white shirts, digging in
to lavish buffets.
</P>
<P>
   There is a plastic shopping bag with handles _ what the Russians
call an avoska, or ``perhaps bag'' _ that people carried just in
case a store had something worth lining up to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition re-creates one of the ``International Press and
Book Clubs'' the regime opened _ 18 of them across the country,
four in Warsaw _ to allow Poles to read some of the world's press,
magazines and books (carefully selected, of course, and
concentrating on the products of foreign Communist parties, like
L'Unita and L'Humanite). Or they could look at picture magazines or
listen to some of the world's music, always a safer proposition.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sample of the student clubs the regime initiated in
the 1950s, ``to channel cultural expression and help propaganda,''
as the gallery's notes suggest. A small black-and-white television
drones on with a speech by Gomulka at a Communist Party Congress. A
number of these student clubs were turned into jazz places and
theaters, more subversive than the party intended, and some were
closed down in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   There is a re-creation of a small arts cinema, its walls covered
with fabric and photographs of stars and directors, including
Sophia Loren, Gary Cooper, Jean Gabin, Orson Welles and Alfred
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition concentrates on some of the art of the time,
which was graphically bold and somewhat daring, at least in its
personal expression. But some of the art feels very dated, which
has more to do with the passage of time than ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the art is devoted to the politically correct program of
the time, to ``stop the arms race,'' and promote ``detente and
peaceful coexistence,'' as one poster says. Another shows a bomb
with an ``N,'' for nuclear; the heading reads: ``N (EQ) Nie,'' or
no.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking exhibitions shows the initial optimism
of the huge tower blocks that the regime built, as in Moscow, to
house the workers of the postwar, socialist Poland. There are
mock-ups of typical rooms _ the living room with its modular wall
of shelves and cabinets for storage and display, the lace curtains
and blocky sofas; the utilitarian bathroom, with its plastic
plumbing and a long water pipe that could swing between tub and
sink, so only one set of pipes needed to be installed; the tiny
bedroom, with its wall shelves and record player, a few jazz albums
strewn across the floor.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground floor of the gallery, as a counterpoint to the
failed dreams of socialism upstairs, is another exhibition
satirizing the modern consumer society of advanced capitalism. It
is called ``Buy or Die supermarket'' and is an homage to ``homo
shopens'' by the artist Pawel Borowski.
</P>
<P>
   Products include ``whole lamb stuffed with ideology'' and a
``lollipop flower stuffed with hope,'' its ingredients including
``light in a tunnel, a better future, coloring and confabulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The market also offers brainwashing powder (``free your mind
from dirt _ breakthrough formula is the choice for life!'') and
Lady Macbeth soap and shower gel (``it cleans even the most nagging
stains'').
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket's fast-food offering is a ``Happy Meal,''
consisting of ``a name brand bottle of warm vodka, an excellent
piece of fat sausage'' and a little vinyl piglet, intended ``to
make your life more complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the store, the American dollar features as both a
lure and a poison, a symbol for greed, globalization and smugness.
</P>
<P>
   On the same theme, in the luxury department (Last Supper
Edition) is a tiny jar marked ``Good caviar.'' The label says:
``Helps everybody! It contains the annual budget of the United
States for charitable activities.''

COMMISSION SAYS POSTAL WORKERS NOT MORE PRONE TO VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: no byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is far less on-the-job homicide in the Postal
Service than at the workplaces of other employers, and the term
``going postal'' is unjustified and unfair, according to a
commission formed to study aggressive behavior at the post office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going postal is a myth, a bad rap,'' said Joseph Califano ,
the head of the commission and the secretary of health, education
and welfare in the Carter administration. ``Postal workers are no
more likely to physically assault, sexually harass or verbally
abuse their co-workers than employees in the national work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Califano, who is the president of the National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, said the
commission found that postal employees were one-third as likely to
be a victim of homicide at their jobs as other workers.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``going postal'' became common after a series of
violent incidents involving Postal Service employees, most notably
when a letter carrier shot and killed 14 co-workers and wounded six
other postal employees at a post office in Edmond, Okla. in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The commission did conclude, however, that there were an
inordinate number of grievances and equal-employment complaints
filed by postal workers and that these complaints can take years to
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The postmaster general, William Henderson, established the
commission in 1998 as part of an effort to make employee relations
his ``No. 1 priority.'' Henderson said Thursday that he supported
the major findings of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are underway with union representatives, Henderson
added, to modernize the grievance system and to reduce friction
between management and other employees.
</P>
<P>
   Tension between labor and management is high, the study
concluded, because of a backlog of more than 100,000 grievances. In
addition, a dual compensation system, in which managers but not
labor are rewarded by performance, adds to a certain level of
resentment among employees.
</P>
<P>
   Among postal workers, 37 percent said they were confident of the
fairness and honesty of their managers while in the overall
national work force, 60 percent said they had such confidence, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   The commission issued a 249-page report Thursday, a result of
two years of study costing nearly $4 million. Califano said the
reputation for violence and hostile working conditions caused
``unnecessary apprehension and fear'' for the 900,000 postal
employees who help deliver roughly 3 billion pieces of mail a week.
</P>
<P>
   Postal workers, the study found, are more likely than others in
the work force to believe that they will be victims of violence by
a co-worker; 17 percent of postal employees feel this way, compared
with 3 percent outside the post office.
</P>
<P>
   The study surveyed 12,000 postal workers and 3,000 employees in
other jobs around the country. More than 300 interviews were
conducted with postal managers and union representatives.
</P>
<P>
   One concern perhaps unique to the post office: Fear of dogs. Ten
percent of postal employees listed this as the thing they fear most
on the job.

RETAILERS OPTIMISTIC FOR HOLIDAYS, DESPITE SLOWING IN AUGUST
SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After watching business slow for six months, the nation's
merchants reported only slight gains Thursday in sales of
back-to-school merchandise, news that did not bode well for the
rest of the year and the coming holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales for August in stores open at least a year, a
crucial industry measurement, rose just 3 percent, according to the
Goldman Sachs retail composite index. The numbers were hardly
disastrous, but they were lower than analysts had expected and the
weakest August results in three years.
</P>
<P>
   After experiencing nearly two years of banner growth, retail
sales have been slowing since early this year. But consumer
enthusiasm for back-to-school shopping is watched particularly
closely because it is seen as the first window to the all-important
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually what happens in August is a very significant harbinger
of the rest of the year,'' said Richard Baum, an analyst at Credit
Suisse First Boston. ``Retailers learn in the third quarter what
works. But if you don't have a lot working for you, it is hard to
plan for the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   There was clearly plenty of bad news from the sales numbers
Thursday. The biggest stunner came Wednesday night from the
normally efficient Gap Inc., which announced that its same-store
sales would be down 14 percent in August. And Wall Street analysts
began lowering their earnings forecasts for major players as they
missed sale growth estimates. For example, Jeffrey Feiner, an
analyst with Lehman Brothers, lowered his third-quarter earnings
estimates for Dillard's, May Department Stores, J.C. Penney, and
even the previously invincible Target.
</P>
<P>
   But as disappointing as sales at those chains were, there were
still some bright spots. The merchants that did best were mostly
those that sell goods besides clothing. Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., for
example, had a sales increase of 5.6 percent, largely on the
strength of its home appliance and gardening businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In fiercely competitive environments, the strong continued to
grow stronger. Wal-Mart Stores and Costco both continued to rack up
gains at juggernaut paces in August. On the apparel side, Kohl's
posted a 9.1 percent gain and and sales at the luxury retailer
Neiman Marcus increased 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The economic picture was mixed enough that economists, analysts
and retailers were split about how dire the forecast would be for
the months ahead. The economy is certainly losing some of its heat
after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times since
June 1999. Higher gas and oil prices have also taken a toll. And
after frenzied spending last year, consumers may be taking a
breather, as Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, predicted they would
in July.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, however, is low, wages are relatively high and
consumer confidence in the future remains near all-time highs,
according to the University of Michigan survey of consumers.
Moreover, the Commerce Department reported this week that consumer
spending on everything from automobiles to restaurants surged in
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one looks at the financial health of the consumer, income
growth and employment trends,'' said Feiner of Lehman Brothers,
``one comes to the conclusion they still have the wherewithal. So
the $64,000 question is, `Are we going to see a rebound of sales?'
You don't have enough evidence to bet either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, an economist with Deutsche Bank Securities,
said: ``Christmas may turn out to be better than everyone thinks.
We've got record optimism. When people are that confident about the
future, they are likely to continue to spend.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchants are certainly showing a surprising reserve of
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing is that a lot of the fall goods are
selling,'' said Michael Gould, the chief executive of
Bloomingdale's, which is owned by Federated Department Stores.
``There are a lot of people walking through our stores, and we are
not pulling back on inventories.'' Sales at Federated increased
only 1.1 percent for the month.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Weiss, president and chief executive of The Limited's
Express division, said he thought the key to survival in the coming
holiday season would be to offer what Express thinks are key
fashion items early on. For August, Express had a stellar 15
percent growth in sales, based on stretch, dirty denim and leather
jeans for back-to-school.

RELIGIOUS LEADERS AT INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE VOW TO SEEK WORLD
PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As an international conference of religious leaders
ended here Thursday, many participants, representing a wide array
of the world's faiths, pledged to work for world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Their commitment came in a statement titled ``Commitment to
Global Peace,'' which was the main document to emerge from their
four-day gathering, the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious
and Spiritual Leaders, an event unusual for its religious diversity
and for its having convened at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The document, which briefly acknowledges that war and violence
``are sometimes perpetuated in the name of religion,'' pledges its
signers to work with the United Nations and ``all men and women of
good will'' toward peace. It asks its signers to work for freedom
of religion, toward narrowing the wealth gap between rich and poor,
and on behalf of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   But how any of this will be carried out, or indeed, how a
continued dialogue will be conducted among the Christian, Jewish,
Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and other leaders who gathered here, remain
open questions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hundreds of religious leaders who attended the
conference, whose sessions have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel since Wednesday, said they felt drawn by the event's
association with the United Nations and by its theme of peace.
Although not an official U.N. event, and largely funded through
foundations' donations, the conference was held in collaboration
with the office of the U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the evidence is, they voted with the hearts in coming
here,'' said Dr. Lawrence E. Sullivan, director of the Center for
the Study of World Religions at Harvard University, in an interview
on Wednesday afternoon. But to engage in an ongoing discussion with
other religious groups and to work with international agencies on
social issues, he said, the leaders here would have to ``commit
senior staff in their organizations'' to those duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the religious people want to bring a new voice, they really
have to go to school on the issues,'' said Sullivan, who has served
on an advisory board for this event. ``Some of them have, most have
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, one of the speakers at the gathering, Rabbi
Jonathan Sacks, chief rabbi of Britain, said there would be value
for many participants simply in having met and become acquainted
with people of other faiths. ``Peace is built through networks of
relationships,'' he said, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   And some here said that the meeting, simply in bringing together
such a diverse group, could ultimately have a wider spiritual
effect. Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj, an Indian meditation
teacher who heads an international organization called (in the
United States) the Science of Spirituality, said the conference was
useful in introducing people who would otherwise have been more
aware of their differences than what they might share in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sit and talk with them, we realize they are not much
different,'' he said. The conference, he said, had created ``a
beautiful environment. I think if we can take it back to our
communities, that sweetness will filter through.''

ANALYSIS: HAS AMERICA CHANGED ENOUGH TO ALLOW MORE RELIGION IN
POLITICS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sen. Joseph Lieberman urged a greater role for religion in
public life in campaign speeches this week, he touched off a new
round in the sharp but unsettled debate over the role that personal
beliefs should play in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of Lieberman's remarks, including the
Anti-Defamation League, cast the issue in terms of separation of
church and state, suggesting that the senator had infringed that
principle.
</P>
<P>
   But another way to look at what Lieberman, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee, said is to ask whether American culture has
changed enough of late so that his remarks are more acceptable,
socially and politically, than they would have been earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Those who say such a change has taken place can cite various
reasons _ public unease over the political scandals of the late
1990s, for example, or the longer-term emergence of religious
conservatives as a political force or a less tangible but pervasive
interest in the personal over the political.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Christian Coalition has added to our dialogue on
politics and religion,'' said former Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
referring both to the conservative organization of that name and
also to the broader political movement of religious conservatives.
``Now, some of that is not good, but some of that is good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon, who now directs the Public Policy Institute at Southern
Illinois University, said he thought Lieberman had made his remarks
``with great care.'' But he also said that some of the religious
language used in the presidential campaign had left him
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overall impression,'' Simon said, ``is, the deeply
religious people don't talk about it as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the first Jew on an American national ticket, said in
a speech last Sunday that Americans needed to ``renew the
dedication of our nation and ourselves to God and God's purpose.''
And while he said the Constitution ``wisely separates church from
state,'' he added that there must be a place for faith in the
nation's public life.
</P>
<P>
   In reacting to his remarks, some harkened back to the example
set by John F. Kennedy, who sought to reassure voters in 1960 that
his Roman Catholicism would not dictate his policies as president.
Religious belief, Kennedy's words implied, is private.
</P>
<P>
   But four decades have elapsed since then, a long stretch in the
cultural life of a still-young nation. In the United States, as
Lieberman noted on Monday, polls show that religious belief remains
unusually widespread, certainly when compared with Europe. Surveys
report that 19 out of 20 Americans say they believe in God.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the American marketplace _ both a guide to and an
influence upon the broader culture _ recognizes no separation of
the sacred and the profane, such that books by the Dalai Lama,
Tibet's spiritual leader, can soar onto the best-seller lists, and
CBS can broadcast a reverent mini-series on Jesus during its spring
sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   There is some statistical evidence, too, that public attitudes
about religion and politics have shifted since the 1960s, blurring
whatever boundary might have existed between the two.
</P>
<P>
   A new book, ``The Diminishing Divide: Religion's Changing Role
in American Politics'' (Brookings Institution, 2000), reports that
whereas a narrow majority of Americans in 1968 wanted churches to
stay out of politics, that opposition had eroded by 1996, when a
narrow majority said churches should freely express their views.
</P>
<P>
   One of the book's four authors, John Green, a professor of
political science at the University of Akron, said that ``a greater
demand'' existed for religious talk in political life and that
there was also ``a greater supply of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public is more interested in values these days,
particularly questions of morality, than they have been in the
recent past,'' said Green, who directs the Ray C. Bliss Institute
of Applied Politics at his university.
</P>
<P>
   Green said several factors were at work, among them diminishing
worry over economic and international threats and a growing concern
over the turmoil of political scandals, high school shootings and
hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders ``have sensed this disquiet, and want to
respond to it,'' Green said, either by speaking of religious faith
or talking more about broad values, as Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee, does in speaking of the need for
``prosperity with a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   One person critical of Lieberman this week, Barry Lynn,
executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church
and State, agreed in part with some of Green's assessment, saying
Americans had been shaken by the personal scandals involving
political leaders, notably President Clinton and the former House
speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a general sense that our political leaders have failed us
because they lacked moral grounding,'' Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, candidates ``feel compelled not just to
say, here's my moral vision, but here's the religion that underlies
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn called that ``unhealthy'' for a diverse society and a
threat to provoke a sort of spiritual one-upmanship among
candidates, each feeling so compelled to cite Scripture that the
race for office becomes like ``a final exam in Bible studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet others suggest that the high profile that religion is
receiving in the current presidential campaign reflects a subtler,
longer-term trend, a growing interest among Americans in hearing
the personal narratives, not simply the technical ideas, of their
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to hear your story,'' said Dr. Richard J. Mouw,
president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif. ``I
think today the question is, What kind of person is this, what kind
of leader will he be?''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Mouw said, ``having that person speak out of the
depths of his own human experience, that kind of comes to be a
value thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mouw, who found Lieberman's statements pleasing, said that
American society was more open to public expressions of religious
identity than it was 30 years ago, when he received his doctorate
in philosophy from the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a philosopher, you had to hide your religious
convictions,'' he said, contrasting that with the present
situation, in which Christian philosophers have their own
association, which publishes a journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more acceptable in the academic world than it was in
1970 to identify your religious convictions and speak openly about
them,'' Mouw said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people may have noticed, we've just passed the two-year
anniversary of the 1998 Russian default crisis. Maybe not an event
worth celebrating, but it is worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   With everything Russia has endured in the last few months, it is
tempting to think the country is again in crisis. The tragic loss
of the nuclear submarine Kursk exposed Russia's deteriorating
military and, in a larger sense, the country's weak infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the war in Chechnya may have slowed, but has
certainly not ended. Even the recent fire in the Ostankino TV
tower, the second tallest free-standing structure in the world,
seems to point to a country tottering on the brink of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it is worth remembering that Russia actually is
improving, albeit at a snail's pace. The country may not exactly be
a poster child of economic reform, but it is slowly moving down the
path toward a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election in March, Russian President Vladimir Putin
has pressed through a number of reforms that will help push the
country down the free-market path. He has reorganized Russia's
chaotic federal structure, a legacy of the Yeltsin years, and
tackled the country's confusing taxation system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the Yeltsin reign has been positive,'' says David
Aserkoff, Russian analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston, based in
London. ``Now we have a president who is active and is willing and
able to deal with the problems that face Russia,'' he says.
Aserkoff sees improvement in a number of small areas, such as
regulatory issues, that may not make headlines but will lead to an
improving economic environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin has done more of the right things than the wrong
things,'' says Eswar Menon, manager of the Loomis Sayles Emerging
Market Fund. That may sound like faint praise, but Menon thinks
highly enough of Russia's recent performance that its securities
now constitute a sizeable 8 percent of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Russia's economic health is as strong now as it has
been in quite a while. The country posted 8.4 percent GDP growth in
the first quarter of this year and should post growth of around 5
percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Russia's markets have been on a tear for the past
year. The benchmark Moscow Times Index is up 264 percent since it
began a rally last September. While the markets were lackluster for
the first half of 2000, the rally seems to have returned, with the
index up 50 percent since late June.
</P>
<P>
   That has translated into impressive gains for one of the
pure-Russia plays available to U.S. investors. The open-end
Lexington Troika Dialog Russia Fund is up 98 percent over the past
12 months and has risen 31 percent this year. It carries an expense
ratio of 3.09 percent and requires an initial investment of $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, the closed-end Templeton Russia Fund (TRF on the NYSE)
is up 27.78 percent over the past year, but is down 14 percent this
year and trades at a 14.42 percent premium to net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, the market rally is connected to one thing
and one thing only: the price of oil. Whether one thinks Russia is
on the path toward a market economy and democracy, or that Putin
represents a slip back into authoritarianism, the strength of
Russia's economy and the rise in its stock markets are quite simply
rooted in the rise of oil prices the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Russia's default in 1998, oil sold for around $12
a barrel. Now it is going for around $30. That may cause a lot of
griping among SUV drivers in the U.S., but it has been a blessing
for Russia, since oil is still the country's largest export.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Russia, then, is to seize the opportunity that
the revenue from high oil prices provides to put in place the
framework for a market system. If the country can't do that, it
risks a repeat of the crisis of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, more and more analysts are predicting that oil
prices are not going to go down over the next few months. That
gives the country more time to get its act together _ and is good
news for the Russian market in the near term.

 &HT;    Delta carves out e-unit, buys delta.com address
 &HT;    By Nancy Fonti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines is finally getting the ``-air'' out of
its dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based carrier has bought the domain name delta.com
from Delta Financial Corp., a Woodbury, N.Y., speciality consumer
finance company. The airline wouldn't say how much it paid, but the
name was purchased July 20, according to Network Solutions, the
national registry of Internet domain names.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has long used the unwieldy delta-air.com address for its
Web site because delta.com was taken when the Internet was in its
infancy.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has already advertised its new address during at
least one Atlanta Braves game and will officially announce it
today. Online customers with delta-air.com bookmarks will be
automatically redirected to delta.com, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an effort to promote the Delta brand, the airline
began pursuing delta.com a few months ago because it is easier to
remember and quicker to type, said Vince Caminiti, senior vice
president of e-business. Online bookings at all Web sites accounts
for about 10 percent of Delta's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber-squatting and competition among companies with similar
names has prevented some airlines and other businesses from getting
their first-choice addresses. United Airlines, for instance, only
secured united.com and unitedairlines.com in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Delta also on Thursday said it formed a new unit to handle its
electronic-commerce businesses, which include, among other things,
partnerships with and equity investments in Internet companies,
Internet marketing strategies and new products offered through the
airline's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti will head the unit, dubbed e-Delta, which Delta hopes
will generate $150 million in ``annual benefits'' by 2002 through
cost savings and partnerships. Delta reported profit of $1 billion
for the fiscal year ending June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our single point of focus and accountability for our
e-initiatives,'' Caminiti said. ``This will define our overall
e-business strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta isn't the first airline to dedicate a unit to its
e-commerce dealings. United created an e-commerce unit in January.

STOCK TRADE CLEARING HOUSES FORMULATE PLAN TO SUPPORT
LONDON-FRANKFURT MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a move intended to shore up support for the planned
merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges, the clearing
houses for the two markets introduced a plan Thursday that would
cut settlement costs by 90 percent for certain trades.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers have expressed concern about the potential for
escalating costs should the London and Frankfurt exchanges combine
to form a pan-European bourse, which would be called iX. Winning
the support of brokers for the merger with Deutsche Boerse is
crucial for the London Stock Exchange in its attempts to ward off a
hostile bid from OM Gruppen AB, the Swedish company that runs the
Stockholm stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good workable blueprint,'' Brain Mairs, spokesman for
the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and
Stockbrokers, said of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   While Thursday's proposal went a long way toward addressing
shareholder concerns, questions about how the savings will be
achieved and who will benefit the most underscores the difficulty
that European stock exchanges are facing as they try folding
different technologies and regulations into one entity.
</P>
<P>
   A certain amount of overlap in terms of how trades are settled
have led some shareholders of the London Stock Exchange to call the
proposal a political Band-Aid, rather than the most economically
viable solution.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, since the plan laid out by the London settlement
firm, CrestCo, and its Frankfurt counterpart, Clearstream, is not
contingent upon the formation of iX, it remains unclear how
effective the measures will be in warding off the Swedish bid.
CrestCo has said that it will work with whichever partner London
Stock Exchange shareholders choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can go ahead without iX,'' Don Cruickshank, the chairman
of the London Stock Exchange, acknowledged Thursday at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which could be introduced by next summer, the
cost of domestic trades will remain constant, while the price of
cross-border trades could fall by as much as 90 percent.
Transaction costs for trading pan-European stocks are more than 10
times those for trading stocks in the United States, according to
an estimate by Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Only trades made through a central counterparty, a kind of
clearinghouse system intended to allow large institutional
investors to remain anonymous in trades, will be subject to the
savings. Since most retail brokers do not use such a system, it is
unclear how much they will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors accounted for the majority of
international trades last year on the London Stock Exchange, which
amounted to 2.4 trillion pounds, or $3.48 trillion, compared with
1.4 trillion pounds ($2.03 trillion) for domestic trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence this is good news,'' said Michael Clark, a director
of the British brokerage house Charles &AMP; Stanley &AMP; Co., which owns
100,000 shares of the London Stock Exchange. ``What bearing it has
on a decision regarding iX, I'm not sure.''

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a 30-year veteran of the U.S. military, I'm glad that
national security has become an issue in the presidential campaign.
But I'm disheartened that this debate so far has been far more
partisan than enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has said, ``Our military is the strongest and the best
in the entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech on Wednesday, Dick Cheney, the Republican vice
presidential nominee, said the Clinton administration had neglected
national defense and was ``running down'' the military.
</P>
<P>
   This echoes statements by George W. Bush that today's servicemen
and women battle ``back-to-back deployments, poor pay, shortages of
spare parts and equipment, and rapidly declining readiness.'' In
his speech at the Republican convention, Bush charged that two of
the Army's 10 divisions were not ready for a major war.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of interchange does not begin to address the important
defense challenges facing the nation. It exaggerates problems that
don't threaten our national security while ignoring problems that
do threaten it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's examine the issues.
</P>
<P>
   LACK OF MILITARY READINESS: Bush's charge that two army
divisions were unprepared for war sounds serious, but is not
particularly relevant. Every active duty force, every national
guard and reserve unit is currently judged ready for combat
according to a list of standards that are in many ways more
appropriate for Cold War missions and less appropriate for our
troops that served in Bosnia, Kosovo and Rwanda. Troops need to be
less like a tightly packed, hierarchical combat force, and more
like a sophisticated, flexible police force.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the list of standards fails to include equipment that
may be especially important in today's missions, like high
technology information systems, defenses against chemical and
biological weapons and adequate numbers of precision weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has spent too much money to assure
that our forces can, by and large, meet this outdated standard _
even troops who would not, in any circumstance, be used for months
into a conflict. Certainly, the fact that all units don't meet
every standard means far less than politicians may imply, and our
current level of readiness is certainly not a significant threat to
our national security.
</P>
<P>
   TOO MANY MISSIONS AROUND THE WORLD: True, our forces are
deployed too broadly, in dozens of places around the globe. And
some units are overextended. But the grand mass of the American
military is not deployed. The percentage of troops overseas is
small. With management, both people and money could be moved from
other parts of the services into overextended units.
</P>
<P>
   LOW MORALE AND POOR RECRUITMENT: We need to do more for our
troops, including increasing their pay. And it is difficult to
recruit and retain people, especially in a hot economy. But over
the last decade, the military has been able to maintain its
fighting force, and in the coming year, the services are expected
to meet their recruiting goals. Moreover, today's morale, while low
and needing attention, is not the kind of issue that is likely to
bring down our national security. The situation today is NOT the
post-Vietnam military that many decry.
</P>
<P>
   So what issue should our presidential candidates be concerned
with? The military's ability to meet challenges five to 15 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, to avoid charges of military
unreadiness, made sure that today, every division is combat-ready.
But that effort required billions of dollars and precluded buying
enough equipment _ ships, tanks, tents _ for the future. The
military procurement budget has been cut by about 60 percent since
the end of the Cold War (the overall budget is down by only 35
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the results can be seen today. The average age of
vehicles is much older than in the past. Indeed, some Marine and
Army helicopters are older than the pilots who fly them. Because it
takes many years to replace equipment, in 10 to 15 years, there
could be 30 percent fewer airplanes, ships, tanks and trucks. The
ones that do exist will be older _ and harder to keep running _
than the ones today.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the military has been unable to invest in America's
information technology. For instance, it has not been able to buy
enough battlefield sensors and communications, which would allow
commanders to have information about an entire battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Both the White House and the Republican Congress are responsible
for this situation. Our presidential candidates should address it.
And the next administration and Congress should fix it.

CANDIDATES CONTINUE SPARRING OVER HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Rounding out a coast-to-coast duel over health care
and education, Vice President Al Gore pledged Thursday to expand
patients' rights and Texas Governor George Bush promised to bring
greater local control of education.
</P>
<P>
   The issues were largely overshadowed by news of a Republican
attack ad, and by anticipation of the Labor Day holiday, which is
widely considered a benchmark date in the campaign. Still, both
candidates stuck to their designated roles, allowing surrogates to
dish out the harshest attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, completing a week of health-care events with a day devoted
to a ``Patient's Bill of Rights,'' accepted the endorsement of the
American Nurses Association here, and promised to fight for a plan
now stalled in the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an emergency in America all right, and it's the lack
of a strong, enforceable patients' bill of rights,'' Gore said.
Promising to give doctors power to make all medical decisions _
rather than leaving them up to cost-conscious health maintenance
organizations _ Gore said the insurance employee has no ``right to
play God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also unveiled an ad about health care,
deriding health insurance managers as ``some bean-counter behind a
computer terminal'' who should not be able to deny patients certain
treatment because it costs the HMO too much.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Gore plan, patients who belong to both state-regulated
and federally regulated HMOs would have the right to sue the
company if the HMO made a harmful decision. The Democratic proposal
would also guarantee patients access to emergency room protections,
clinical trials, and and an independent review of their claims if
they are rejected by HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also said he supports a patient's bill of rights, and
signed one into law in Texas three years ago. But the Gore campaign
said Bush supports a weak Republican version of the bill, which
would not allow patients who are covered by state-regulated HMOs to
sue the companies. That would leave 135 million Americans without
the right to bring suit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said the Gore campaign had
mischaracterized the Texas governor's position, insisting Bush
would support a plan that covers everyone equally.
</P>
<P>
   A patients' bill of rights _ different versions of which passed
both houses of US Congress this year _ has become a key issue in
dozens of local races, where Democrats are using health care to
demonstrate their differences from Republicans. Some officials hope
to address the issue when Congress reconvenes next week, but a
reconciliation appears unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   During his health-care push this week, Gore also outlined his
plan to include prescription drug coverage in Medicare, his
proposal to shore up the Medicare system, and a plan to expand the
Children's Health Insurance Program.
</P>
<P>
   During the midday appearance, Gore delivered an unusual blend of
salty and erudite remarks, at one point urging the mostly urban
crowd to ``reject the appeal of ironic detachment.'' That followed
on the heels of an equally un-populist remark by his press
secretary, Chris Lehane, who called the Republican attack ad
``callow'' and compared it to Jay Gatsby, the empty protagonist of
the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway across the country, Texas Governor George W. Bush
visited his 100th school this campaign, telling a raucous crowd he
will make education his top priority as president and seek to
improve it with more local control, greater accountability, and
fresh emphasis on reading and character building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education isn't a partisan issue; it's an issue that requires
strong leadership,'' the Republican presidential contender told a
cheering, chanting, sign-waving crowd of 3,000 in a high school
gymnasium in suburban Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, as American students have headed back to
school, Bush has highlighted and built upon the education agenda he
outlined shortly after launching his candidacy in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the proposals total about $15 billion in spending over
five years, far less than the $115 billion, 10-year plan outlined
by Bush's Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan calls for the hiring of more teachers, tax
incentives to raise teachers' salaries and a battery of repairs to
fix crumbling schools. The centerpiece of the Gore education
platform is a measure to ensure children full access to pre-school.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats criticized Bush's plan as well as the 100th-school
event, noting the count includes the governor's Feb. 2 visit to Bob
Jones University, a South Carolina Christian school that Bush was
later embarrassed to learn banned interracial dating. The school
has since changed the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself conceded the event had a contrived air, saying when
asked to explain the significance of the 100th visit, ``It's a nice
round number.''
</P>
<P>
   Education has long been considered a Democratic issue,
especially after Republicans threatened to close down the federal
Department of Education, but Bush sought in his remarks to make
Republican inroads. In part, he did so by highlighting the poor,
minority schools he visited from Central High School in Little
Rock, Ark., to the Passages School in Canton, Ohio, to schools in
Phoenix and Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the school was a public school or not, inner city or
suburban, new or old, all good schools have something in common:
first, people around the school _ teachers, superintendents, and
principals _ who believe that every child can learn,'' Bush said.
``My education plan trust local folks, empowers teachers, works
with schools to meet basic education, to build upon the character
of students and focus on making sure that not one single child gets
left behind.''

&HT;     NEW LEGAL HASSLES FOR RAIDERS RECEIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANK BLACKMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ Andre Rison has a new legal problem.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Kansas City Star reported that the Raiders wide
receiver owes more than $34,000 in child support for his 2-year-old
son.
</P>
<P>
   Rison arrived here facing a trial on the alleged theft of a
$1,000 tape recorder. Then it was announced he had been indicted
for allegedly writing $158,000 in bad checks to a jewelry store.
</P>
<P>
   Marilynn Knipp, a director with the Missouri Department of
Social Services, said the state would file in California to garnish
Rison's wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be resolved,'' Rison said. ``My attorney is handling
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rison was asked what he would say in his defense when people say
he is a bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Raider,'' Rison said, laughing. ``I don't worry about
what people say about me. I go out and do my job. The team's been
looking at me, not only as a teammate, but a friend, also.''
</P>
<P>
   Rison believes he's been portrayed unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very unfair,'' he said. ``I'm a beautiful father, and I live a
beautiful life. I'm not saying I've been a saint, and I'm not
saying I'm perfect, and I'm not saying I'm wrong. But I am a
Raider.''
</P>
<P>
   Rison was cut by the Chiefs before signing with Oakland last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his legal problems, Rison will get an opportunity to
take his shots on the field on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to distract the team,'' coach Jon
Gruden said. ``I worry more about it distracting Andre Rison. We
will continue to support him and gather our information and react
accordingly. For the time being, we support him, and hopefully we
can get these things resolved so that he can just concentrate on
playing football. That's why he's here.''

PREGNANT SECT MEMBER ORDERED TO JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATTLEBORO, Mass. _ Refusing to ``bow down to a false god,'' a
pregnant member of a fundamentalist sect _ who this week spurned a
court-ordered medical exam and is suspected of neglect in the death
of her last baby _ was ordered Thursday to a prison hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The decision may be the first time a healthy pregnant woman has
been forced into custody to protect an unborn child. Rebecca
Corneau is likely to remain in custody until giving birth,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers escorted Corneau through a phalanx of
photographers to an unmarked Ford Taurus after a closed hearing in
which prosecutors and a court-appointed lawyer for the fetus
demanded a judge reverse his earlier decision allowing her to
remain free.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Juvenile Court Judge Kenneth P. Nasif ruled Corneau
could remain at her home here if she agreed to daily visits by a
court-appointed nurse. Corneau, however, vowed not to allow the
examinations.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the 32-year-old mother kept her courtroom promise
and refused to talk about her medical condition when the nurse
visited, calling medicine a false god.
</P>
<P>
   Miffed after Corneau violated the judge's order, Bristol County
District Attorney Paul F. Walsh returned to court to force her
hand. Speaking after the closed hearing, Walsh said he was relieved
the judge changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a good day in court,'' he said. ``I think we finally
have some assurances that medical professionals will be able to
assist a healthy baby boy or girl be born within the next two or
three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's order requires Corneau to submit to a physical exam.
Prosecutors believe she's at least 8 months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   If she has several more months before giving birth, Walsh said,
it's possible Corneau could be released from the Neil J. Houston
House in Roxbury, in Boston, a 12-year-old medical facility that
caters to pregnant women in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry we had to go this length, but I don't think there's
any choice,'' said Bethany Collins, the court-appointed nurse of
the Attleboro Public Health Department who was rebuffed after
visiting the home Corneau shares with several members of the sect.
</P>
<P>
   Corneau _ who has chosen not to hire an attorney, also on
religious grounds _ has consistently refused to allow health
officials enter her home. The small fundamentalist Christian sect,
which authorities say consists of only 13 members, shuns science
and medicine as a form of blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday neither she nor other members of the sect would answer
repeated questions from the press after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Eight adult members have been jailed for contempt after refusing
to cooperate in an investigation into the deaths of two infants,
including Corneau's infant son, Jeremiah.
</P>
<P>
   The children may have died from neglect _ including one from
starvation _ and were buried in a state park in Maine, authorities
said. Three searches have so far come up empty.
</P>
<P>
   Though sect members insist Jeremiah was stillborn, prosecutors
say their diaries suggest the baby died after his lungs were not
properly aspirated, a routine procedure in hospital births. Samuel
Robidoux, a 10-month-old boy who died, apparently starved to death
after he stopped nursing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two dead babies,'' Walsh said earlier this week,
outlining why he took action against Corneau. ``I don't want
another dead baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Judge Nasif declared Corneau an unfit mother,
taking away her three children and removing eight other children
from the sect, the youngest of whom is only 2 months old. Officials
from the state Department of Social Services are expected to take
custody of Corneau's baby just after its birth.
</P>
<P>
   Corneau's case appears to be resolved, but the stage is set for
another showdown in several months: The mother of the 2-month-old,
Trinette Daneau, appears to be midway through another pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, however, would not speculate about the next case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Corneau, Jeremiah's 32-year-old father, and Jacques
Robidoux are among eight sect members behind bars for refusing to
talk before a grand jury investing the infants' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The eight could face charges ranging from improper disposal of a
body to murder. No charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining what prosecutors said was an unprecedented court
order, Walsh repeated he has no political agenda: ``This as a case
not a cause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A life was at stake,'' he said, ``and maybe in some small way,
we helped to save a life this morning.''

 &HT;    3 accused of defrauding Mohawk
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Police in North Georgia have arrested three employees
of Mohawk Industries on charges of defrauding the carpet maker, and
more arrests are coming.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have uncovered fraud at Mohawk's offices in
Calhoun and Dalton involving at least $80,000 in embezzled funds,
and employees may have stolen equipment and goods as well, Calhoun
police said. The arrested Mohawk employees were involved in a
scheme to create false invoices and steal checks that were issued
by the company, police said. The FBI and the Internal Revenue
Service have joined the case, said Capt. Randy Gallman of the
Calhoun Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more arrests and charges coming. The individuals
arrested are lower-level supervisors (and a secretary), but this
will go higher in the company as we progress,'' Gallman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we're waiting on the FBI and the IRS before we
make more arrests,'' he said. ``We've subpoenaed bank records and
other documents. We may uncover other areas of fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Regina Roberson, 42, of Dalton was arrested Friday by the
Whitfield County sheriff's office and charged with one count of
forgery on a check for $7,725. Investigators said Roberson, who was
a secretary at Mohawk's Calhoun office, forged 11 other checks,
ranging in value from $4,000 to $7,000, since June 1999. Evidence
on those charges will be presented to a grand jury, said Whitfield
Sheriff Scott Chitwood.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun police arrested David W. Biggs Sr., 46, of Calhoun, and
Terry R. Wheeler, 33, of Silver Creek. Police said the men were
supervisors of equipment maintenance and were charged with theft by
deception. Biggs was also charged with being a party to a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all operated together on a certain level, but there were
separate and independent incidents, too,'' Gallman said.
</P>
<P>
   Police began investigating the employees in July after an
internal auditor discovered the fake invoices, Gallman said.
</P>
<P>
   A Mohawk spokesman declined to comment Thursday.

&HT;     BAY MEADOWS TRACK GETTING OFF TO A FAST START 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MATEO, Calif. _ The Bay Meadows racetrack won't wait long
for a marquee attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The track will open a 57-day meeting on Friday night, and on
Monday will check in with the $125,000-guaranteed California Turf
Championship, which will head the Labor Day card.
</P>
<P>
   That is expected to attract a number of top handicap horses,
including Southern California heavyweights Native Desert and Full
Moon Madness.
</P>
<P>
   Native Desert has the top handicap weight of the contenders _
120 pounds _ while Full Moon Madness is at 118.
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Marshall-trained Full Moon Madness has won three
straight races, the last of those the Robert K. Kerlan Memorial
Handicap at Hollywood Park July 16.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a good thing for Marshall and his thoroughbred that
the California Turf Championship, a mile grass race for
3-year-olds-and-up bred in California, is being run at night. The
night of Full Moon Madness' victory in the Kerlan Handicap, there
was a full moon, just as there had been after his win in the Answer
Do Stakes on June 17.
</P>
<P>
   And the horse's win in the Bay Meadows Express Handicap in
January came on the afternoon following a total eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Whether lunar matters really figure into all this is open to
debate, but Full Moon Madness has become an extremely reliable
runner, with six wins in nine races this year following his return
from a couple of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unusually sound for a sprinter,'' Marshall said. ``They
are very hard to maintain. They tend to overrun their legs. I've
tried to pick and choose races carefully for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the moon, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The California Turf Championship will be the first of six graded
stakes at this Bay Meadows meet, including two $200,000 races, the
Grade III Breeders' Cup Sprint Sept. 16 and the Grade III Bay
Meadows Handicap Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first meet at the Peninsula oval under the
stewardship of Magna Entertainment Corporation and its chairman,
Frank Stronach, who already own Santa Anita and Golden Gate Fields.
Magna's purchase of Bay Meadows was just approved by the California
Horse Racing Board.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million deal gives Magna control of the Bay Meadows
Operating Company, but not the racetrack itself, from Paine Webber
Inc. Magna will continue to lease the track from Paine Webber for
racing through Dec. 31, 2002. Paine Webber plans to develop the
property after that, with racing operations moving elsewhere _
perhaps at a new track in Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   Opening night of the current meet, which will run through Nov.
12, will feature free grandstand admission.
</P>
<P>
   Post times (except Friday nights) will be 1:45 p.m. from
Saturday through Sept. 13; 1:15 p.m. from Sept. 14-Oct. 1 and 12:45
p.m. from Oct. 4-Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day's first post will be at 12:45.

</P>
<P>
   The proposed cut, totaling roughly $16 billion over three years,
is part of a wave of similar measures being enacted across Europe,
as governments react to increased tax revenue because of expanding
economies and declining unemployment. The cuts, while differing by
country, are intended to give a measure of stability to a tenuous
spurt of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and government planners hope the lower taxes will
help offset climbing interest rates. The French cuts came as the
European Central Bank in Frankfurt raised a key interest rate by a
quarter point to 4.5 percent, its fifth hike this year, in an
effort to cool inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts by the Socialist government of Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin come only weeks after Germany's Social Democrat-led
government announced even more radical tax changes to reduce annual
payments by individuals and corporations by as much as $24 billion
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The French proposals are not only more modest, but also differ
substantially from the Germans in how they apportion the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany pushed through
parliament pro-business measures to provide tax reductions to
corporate Germany and promote its reorganization by sweetening the
sale of industrial cross-shareholdings, a built-in obstacle to the
kind of industrial consolidation that is now engulfing Europe.
Though a Social Democrat, Schroeder has a strong pro-business
record. Indeed, the German Finance Ministry official responsible
for much of the tax change, Heribert Zitzelsberger, is a former
senior tax executive of the Bayer chemical group.
</P>
<P>
   The French measures, by contrast, favor big business less than
small and mid-sized companies, households and low-wage earners. The
cuts proposed by Economics Minister Laurent Fabius foresee a drop
in the top marginal personal income tax rate by 2003 to 52.5
percent, from 54 percent. But the burden for large corporations
will probably remain unchanged, since proposed corporate tax cuts
will be largely offset by levies imposed to help finance a
job-creation plan that reduced the work-week in France to 35 hours
from 40 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the government of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato has
said it will propose similar tax cuts in September. Given the
leftist component of Amato's coalition, economists believe that
they will more closely resemble those of France than Germany,
favoring small businesses _ the backbone of the Italian economy _
and households.
</P>
<P>
   Still, economists said the French measures should help the whole
economy, if indirectly, as tax relief to low-wage earners widens
the earnings gap between the lowest-paid employed and the
unemployed, raising the incentive for the jobless to seek work.
That in turn should relieve the labor market, moderating wage
increases. Moreover, fuel tax cuts and lowered social security
payments should provide relief to businesses and increase
employees' take-home pay.
</P>
<P>
   Cuts in fuel taxes became a pressing issue in recent days after
French fishermen, truckers and taxi drivers blocked ports and roads
and refused to work to protest the recent steep climb in diesel
fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Experts judged the net effect of the French changes positively.
In a note to clients, economists at Credit Suisse First Boston said
that while the ``focus seems clearly on households and particularly
on low-paid workers, with also a clear impact on small and medium
companies,'' large corporations also ``should benefit from the
general boost to domestic demand.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andre Agassi saved four match points against Arnaud
Clement Thursday night, then on the fifth match point, he stabbed
at Clement's serve with a forehand, sending the ball right into the
net. It was over faster than anyone could have imagined. A 6-3,
6-2, 6-4 upset. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my best victory,'' Clement said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a staggering victory. The U.S. Open is now without its
top two men's seeds this early in the tournament for the first
time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clement had made three tournament semifinals this summer, but
few could have foreseen the Frenchman's aggressive dismissal of
Agassi, the defending Open champion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to figure out how to get to him but I couldn't do
it,'' Agassi said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Agassi looked flat-footed at times as Clement cranked out 12
aces and whacked a total of 36 winners in the humidity-soaked
Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was beating me in a number of departments,'' Agassi said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport and fourth-seeded Mary Pierce
showed glimpses of vulnerability Thursday, but both delivered
powerful third sets to win their second-round matches.
Twelfth-seeded Anna Kournikova and seventh-seeded Conchita Martinez
won in straight sets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Jelena Dokic, whose father-coach was evicted from the
tournament after an outburst in the cafeteria on Wednesday, said
the incident was not a distraction in her 6-1, 6-4 victory Thursday
over Miriam Oremans.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you have to deal with, and deal with it I
did,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ninth-seeded Lleyton Hewitt, 11th-seeded Tim Henman and
fifth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov advanced on the men's side. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Hyung-Taik Lee beat 13th-ranked Franco Squillari, 7-6 (3),
7-5, 6-2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In her afternoon match against Kim Clijsters, Davenport never
felt in danger of losing but said she did feel tight after dropping
the first set. The 17-year-old Clijsters refused to be intimidated
by Davenport's deep groundstrokes and surprised her with an early
fusillade of winners. Clijsters parlayed her only service break of
the match to capture the first set, 6-4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Davenport pounced on Clijsters' second serve to break her
four times in the next two sets to win, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got up a break in the second set, I was able to attack
with a lot more confidence,'' Davenport said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Pierce's mistakes mounted Thursday, she tightened. She
slapped easy forehands into the net. She labored chasing after
balls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But faced with a third and deciding set a lot earlier in the
tournament than she expected, something clicked. Pierce relaxed,
and her shots began to hit their target. Pierce played a nearly
flawless final set to beat Magdalena Maleeva, 7-5, 2-6, 6-1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pierce lost to Maleeva three times in the mid-90s but that was
before Pierce's rise into the elite. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maleeva, once ranked fourth, can still be a dangerous player.
Pierce did not help matters any by fretting after mis-hits in a
clunky second set. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, the French Open champion, racked up 23 unforced errors
in the first two sets but limited her miscues to three in the
deciding set. Pierce capitalized on Maleeva's puffy second serve
throughout the match, winning 21 of 32 points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon men's match, Hewitt accused Julien Boutter of
gamesmanship after beating him, 7-6, 6-4, 6-4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Hewitt serving for the first set at 5-4, Boutter called an
injury time-out for his aching back. Boutter broke Hewitt's serve
after the timeout, but Hewitt eventually took the set in a
tiebreaker and had little trouble afterward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the match Boutter complained about his back despite
serving three straight aces at one point, Hewitt said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy has been a little bit known to do something like
that,'' Hewitt said. ``I wasn't surprised. I've spoken to a few
people before. They said he's pretty wild out there; he's going to
distract you as much as he can.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Henman, Great Britain's highest-ranked player, was the
beneficiary of 40 unforced errors by Fernando Gonzalez in their
encounter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to try and make out that I played a great
match,'' Henman said after winning, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Popp committed 73 unforced errors to hand Kafelnikov a
7-6 (3), 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory.

SPENDING ACCOUNTS NEED A CURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 3)  
 By   JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Whatever happened to medical
savings accounts?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Please pick your eyelids off the floor. This is actually an
important question. These accounts, which allow some income to be
put aside each year, untaxed, to pay for health care, were
presented just a few years ago as a panacea for the Big Health
Insurance Crisis. They have not exactly caught fire, and the
reasons say much.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the accounts in 1997, specifically to help
workers at small businesses with 50 or fewer employees _ companies
that often cannot afford other kinds of health benefits. The
accounts are paired with bare-bones catastrophic health insurance
with a high deductible, $1,500 to $2,250 for individuals or $3,000
to $4,500 for families.
</P>
<P>
   The savings account can be used to pay medical costs not covered
by the insurance, including those needed to satisfy the deductible.
The worker or the employer can put aside in the account each year,
exempt from income tax, up to 65 percent of the deductible amount
(for an individual worker) or 75 percent (for family coverage). If
the employer pays, the contribution is also exempt from employment
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse these accounts with the somewhat similar flexible
spending accounts that many big companies offer. Though both types
of accounts work by setting aside untaxed income to cover
unreimbursed health costs, the money in a flexible spending account
is lost if not used by the end of the year, and the accounts are
usually offered to workers with regular health benefits. With
medical savings accounts, money can accumulate from year to year,
but workers who have other kinds of health coverage are ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of medical savings accounts even extolled them as a
way to sidestep the problems of managed care, because people who
use them can go to doctors of their choosing whenever they want,
and still save money by paying part of the cost with untaxed
income.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot project approved by Congress is limited to the first
750,000 workers to sign up, but that ceiling has never been
approached. So far, only about 100,000 accounts have been
established. Many employers know little or nothing about the
program, and dozens of insurance companies, including Empire Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of New York, have stopped offering the
accounts because of lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Congress renews it, the law will expire on Dec. 31.
That's a shame, because with a bit of tweaking, the accounts could
be much more successful.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal performance of the medical savings account program
points up what can happen when the political system lays its hands
on health care. Medical savings accounts were first introduced as
part of broad health care legislation in 1996, with wide support
from Republican leaders. Many Democrats opposed the plan, and what
was left after negotiations was a program so restricted and
confusing that few people understood it and fewer could be bothered
to take part.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, eligibility was limited to the companies and
people least likely to experiment with them. ``Confining MSAs to
the small employment market was a terrible idea,'' said Greg
Scandlen, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy
Analysis. When it comes to benefits, these employers are ``not
innovators,'' he said, ``because they don't have time to think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, laws in some states keep small business owners from
offering MSAs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the law's inflexible requirements for
deductibles. Workers who already had basic insurance plans with
different deductibles, either higher or lower, could not take
advantage of the accounts. Scrapping an existing plan only to pay
more for one with a higher deductible was hardly an attractive
option.
</P>
<P>
   The law also permits contributions by employers or employees,
but not both _ a bizarre requirement when most benefit plans
involve sharing the cost between employers and workers. It takes no
account of regional differences in health care costs. Figuring out
how to make contributions is no cinch. ``It is confusing,
particularly for families,'' Scandlen said. ``If you can't explain
the concept in 15 seconds, then you are basically lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Because so many insurers have dropped these plans, almost no
effort is being made to evangelize small employers on the subject.
``To tell you the truth, I never reviewed with my accountant
whether they would be cheaper,'' said Brian Zimmet, who runs a
small law firm in Manhattan. ``No one ever tried to market it to
me. I offer an HMO _ it is not cheap, maybe $400 a month for each
employee, but in order to attract qualified employees I need to
have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who the plans are best suited for remains in debate. Critics
thought that only highly paid people would use the accounts, but
some studies show that this has not been the case. The rollover
feature would seem to be advantageous for the young and healthy,
who can salt away years of tax-free savings for use later in life.
But if a big, expensive illness strikes, 75 percent of $3,000
doesn't go far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, you are really unable to put enough money away to
cover a really serious health issue like cancer,'' said Maria
Berthoud, vice president for federal government affairs at the
Independent Insurance Agents of America.
</P>
<P>
   Berthoud and others say they believe that Congress will expand
medical savings accounts to cover a wider swath of workers, and
perhaps make other adjustments. ``I think that the prospects for
renewal are very good,'' said Berthoud, adding that if Congress
relaxes some of the restrictions, as she expects, participation
will rise sharply.
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, support will have to come from both
political parties. But Berthoud is optimistic that this time,
Congress will get it right. ``Medical savings accounts were a
classic example of good policy getting jettisoned by politics,''
she said.

AIDS, 10 are 10 or over. Many of them were once told they would
only live a few years. While the plight of 14 year old Stephanie

<P>
   TOLEDO, Ohio _ George W. Bush used his 100th campaign visit to a
school Thursday to give Democrat Al Gore a long-distance lecture on
prescription drugs for seniors and tax cuts for the middle class _
two issues that have come to dominate an increasingly heated
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also outlined his plans to increase federal spending for
public schools by $47 billion over the next 10 years. His stop at
Springfield High School just outside Toledo was part of the Texas
governor's effort to put a Republican imprint on education, an
issue that resonates with voters but that Democrats Gore and
President Clinton used to their advantage in the last two
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Ohio for a second straight day, seemed
lifted by the raucous applause and shouts in the packed school gym,
but his upbeat mood couldn't erase the cloud that followed him from
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On the early-morning flight to Toledo from Cincinnati, where
Bush spent Wednesday night, he attempted to put the best face on a
federal judge's ruling this week that Texas has failed to live up
to a 1996 agreement requiring the state to make major changes in
how it provides health care to poor children through the Medicaid
health insurance program. The state is appealing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked as hard as we can to to sign up little children
to the Children's Health Insurance Program as well as to Medicaid.
I asked the federal government for waivers that would make it
easier to sign up people,'' Bush said. ``Those waivers were denied.
. . . We are doing everything within our power to take care of
disadvantaged children in the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the timing of the ruling in the midst of the
presidential campaign, Bush said the judge, William Wayne Justice,
is a ``well-known activist liberal judge.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip was Bush's first to Ohio since Gore rebounded in the
polls and the Texas governor appeared to be trying to regain the
initiative by defining leadership and the issues on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention of the court case in the school gym where
Bush tackled head-on two issues Gore has tried to use against him _
Bush's proposed $1.3 billion across the board tax cut and the
governor's lack of a plan to provide prescription drugs for
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said that his tax-cut plan, when would provide targeted
tax credits in areas such as child care, college tuition and health
care, would help working families more, while the wealthy would
benefit the most from Bush's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, said Clinton and Gore promised both prescription
drugs under Medicare and middle class tax cuts in their 1992
campaign _ and delivered on neither.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had their chance. They have not led and I will,'' he
said. ``It's time to put somebody in office who's going to do what
he says he's going to do on the campaign trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to unveil his prescription drug proposal next
week. He has voiced support for a bipartisan congressional proposal
that would provide seniors with a subsidy to purchase prescription
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has called for adding prescription drugs as a benefit under
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In Toledo Thursday, Bush also showcased a local family _ Tim and
Tami Shelton and their two sons, Jonathan and Brian _ who he said
would benefit from his tax-cut plan. The couple, with a combined
income of $65,000, paid $5,990 in taxes last year. Their tax bill
would be reduced by $2,160 under his plan, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in Cincinnati, Bush had showcased a Cincinnati-area
couple who would benefit from his tax plan. Also in Cincinnati,
Bush attended three fund-raisers with a combined take that could
reach $4 million for the Republican Party, party sources said.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's school appearance, Bush was accompanied by Ohio
Gov. Bob Taft and drew applause for his education plans from the
more than 3,000 students and adults in attendance. The plans
include everything from providing more money to teach reading to
promoting school safety and character education. Bush emphasized
that he favors local control of schools but also would hold states
accountable for improving student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Normajean Rerucha, 62, who just retired as head of the business
computer department at the high school, liked what she heard. ``I
thought it was terrific. . . . Very impressive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Toledo police officer Edward Liwo, 59, also gave a
glowing review.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good speech,'' Liwo said. ``I like his moral
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's efforts to cast himself as the leader that he said Gore
hasn't been rang hollow to David Leland, Ohio Democratic chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about a lack of leadership,'' Leland said. ``. . . A
federal judge (in Texas) said that George W. Bush violated the law
and denied health care to 1 million poor children in the state of
Texas. You can talk about compassionate conservatism. You can't
warm a cold house with warm thoughts.''

LOOK WHO'S   SMILING IN   A SIDEWAYS   MARKET YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 3)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Brokers, according to a Wall
Street truism, prosper when the market goes up and when it goes
down. But this year, the market has gone nowhere _ no major average
has moved as much as 4 percent from its Dec. 31 level _ and the
brokers have done better than ever.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Certainly the firms' stocks have _ many of the big ones are up
30 to 85 percent this year _ and they rose further on Tuesday when
Credit Suisse First Boston agreed to pay $90 a share for Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, which was changing hands less than a year ago
for $36.50 a share. That followed a blockbuster deal, announced in
mid-July, under which PaineWebber, the fourth-biggest American
brokerage firm, will be acquired by the banking group UBS.
</P>
<P>
   Many people on Wall Street say brokerage-firm shares, despite
rich prices and a history of sharp cyclical swings, have more room
to fly. A big reason, analysts say, is that they are taking
business from banks in a freer regulatory landscape for which the
banks themselves lobbied vigorously for decades. ``What you're
seeing is a paradigm shift from banks to brokers,'' said Meredith
Whitney, senior financial services analyst at First Union
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Henry McVey of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter put it, the
brokers are ``winning the land grab.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are brokerage firms making more inroads into
traditional banking territory than the banks are making into the
securities business, but they are also seen by analysts as
``cleaner'' financial plays. There are no bad loans to write off,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of brokerage firms are also benefiting from favorable
demographics. Only about half the baby-boom generation has reached
the prime stock-owning years.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is greatly expanded opportunity in Europe, where a
unified market and the euro are spurring mergers. According to Guy
Moszkowski of Salomon Smith Barney, a looming crisis in European
governmental pension systems means that employers are investing
more in securities. Individual Europeans, moreover, are only now
migrating in large numbers to equities from bonds and bank
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the seasonal lift that brokerage firms' stocks
often receive in anticipation of their strongest periods of the
year, the fourth and first calendar quarters. The list of stock
underwritings this fall, initial and secondary alike, is building
rapidly, although seasonal and cyclical swings have become hard to
disentangle, Moszkowski cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Eisman, financial services analyst at CIBC World
Markets, said the fundamentals ``are still really good; much better
than for the banks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're recommending them all,'' Eisman added, despite
historically high price-to-earnings multiples that include at least
some premium for the possibility that a suitor will make a buyout
bid.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts express little concern that decimalization, trading in
cents instead of fractions of a dollar, will do much damage to the
firms. The gap between bid and asked prices will no doubt narrow,
shrinking trading profits, but they say this will probably be
offset by expanded volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over all, it's neutral to positive'' for the industry, said
Lauren A. Smith, who analyzes brokerage firms for Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Still, prices are steep. J.P. Morgan, Lehman Brothers and Chase
Manhattan were reported to have expressed interest in Donaldson,
Lufkin before it went to Credit Suisse for three times book value.
Traditionally, Smith said, ``you buy brokers at book and sell them
at two times book,'' a rule of thumb that may soon be forgotten
given where some industry kingpins are trading. Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter is at 6.8 times book value, and Charles Schwab at 13.6
times.
</P>
<P>
   With Donaldson, Lufkin spoken for, in effect swapping one
European parent _ AXA _ for another, the spotlight has been aimed
more intensely at Lehman Brothers, up 67 percent this year, and
Bear Stearns, up 54 percent; both have relatively modest
price-to-earnings ratios of about 12.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Lehman, which is now expected to earn $12 a share
in 2000, compared with $7.70 when the year began, is enjoying
strong business and is equipped to compete on its own with Goldman
Sachs and the other giants if it chooses. Eisman rates it a
``strong buy,'' and Moszkowski said it could rise an additional 20
percent, along with Goldman and Merrill Lynch, over the next 6 to
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns, very strong in securities processing and trading
but weak in asset management and stock underwriting, has said it
will consider selling at $120 a share, or four times book value, a
rich price indeed. Some suggest that its fiercely competitive,
independent culture would pose severe integration challenges for an
acquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Mosckowski considers the fast-growing Charles Schwab, trading at
a lofty 56 times earnings, ``pretty fully valued,'' and Morgan
Stanley, at 21 times earnings, ``fairly valued.'' As for leading
regional firms, he said valuations for Legg Mason of Baltimore and
A.G. Edwards of St. Louis ``are not particularly outrageous,''
despite sharp run-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clearly dealing with outsize returns, but right now
there's little to rock the boat,'' said McVey, noting that the
Federal Reserve has now had two policy meetings without further
raising interest rates. But he warned of a potential double jolt if
the investment climate changed and if profits, which face
tough-to-beat comparisons with the first half of 2000, came up
short next year. ``There's always the risk'' with this group, he
said, ``of earnings and multiple compression at the same time.''

NEW MONEY SLOW TO FIND ITS WAY TO FIDELITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes net inflows text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fidelity Investments may be having a banner earnings
year, but it's no thanks to its mutual fund business.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston investment giant is being outrun by a host of smaller
rivals this year in attracting new money from fund customers, a new
report shows. Fidelity has fallen to 10th place in the industry,
well outside of its usual top-three slot, and far below the likes
of Janus, Putnam Investments, and Vanguard Group.
</P>
<P>
   Janus, with its popular, aggressive stock funds, had reeled in
$36.50 billion of assets from investors through July _ 78 percent
more than last year at this point. Meanwhile, Fidelity had
attracted just $4.02 billion, according to a report by Financial
Research Corp. of Boston. That's a 77 percent plunge from the $17.7
billion of new money customers sent to Fidelity a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're even below Invesco _ that's embarrassing,'' observed
Jim Lowell, editor of Fidelity Investor, an independent newsletter
in Needham.
</P>
<P>
   He sees the asset bleed as a result of poor marketing, not poor
investment results. ``The irony is, they're having poor sales, but
they're having great performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity said its vast menu of funds skews its ranking in the
asset-gathering lineup. Spokeswoman Anne Crowley said investors
poured nearly $32 billion into the firm's growth funds and sector
funds through July 31. But they pulled billions out of bond funds
and other categories that Janus and some rivals don't offer,
offsetting the gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see both sides of the ledger all the time,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that the people who pulled money out of
Fidelity bond funds didn't move their money into Fidelity stock
funds. They took their money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That's baffling to Lowell. He believes investors chasing Janus's
white-hot record of last year could become disappointed. Of 49
Fidelity funds in the growth or growth-and-income categories, he
said, 38 are beating the benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index in
2000. ``Some by a whisker,'' he said. ``Some by leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The FRC numbers show Fidelity having a dismal July, with more
than $2.9 billion leaving the firm, half of that from asset
allocation funds, which hold a mixture of stocks, bonds, and cash.
Fidelity disputes that figure, saying it shed only $200 million in
the month.
</P>
<P>
   FRC's numbers are generally considered reliable in the industry.
Steve Cummings, an analyst with the research firm, said FRC
traditionally has maintained a margin of error smaller than 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   July was a slow month for much of the industry. As investors
worried about a rocky stock market, they slowed the pace of their
stock-fund investments by 21 percent from June, to $17.58 billion.
They invested slightly more in safer money markets and municipal
bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps telling that Fidelity's best-selling fund in July
was not a household name, but one of its broker-sold offerings,
Advisor Equity Growth. This year, Fidelity's top selling funds are
its Growth Co. fund _ the second biggest seller in the industry _
with $7.56 billion of net flows. The only fund that's taken in more
money is Janus Worldwide, with $8.05 billion of new assets this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity will have to post a phenomenal second half of the year
to get back to the top of the pack in attracting assets and to
maintain its market share. According to FRC, Fidelity commands a
dominant 30 percent share of the direct-sold (that is, brokerless)
fund business. Its share of the total fund market was 12.75 percent
at the end of June, down from 12.77 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Growing mutual fund assets is getting harder as the business
matures, analysts say. In 1999, Fidelity's retail mutual fund
assets grew 20 percent to $351.1 billion, according to the
company's annual report. Other business lines, from 401(k)
retirment plans and brokerage to venture capital, are growing
faster.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity manages more than $400 billion in corporate and public
retirement plans, vs. about $355 billion in mutual funds. The
retirement business grew at a 31 percent rate in 1999. Brokerage
assets for individuals and institutions grew at a 49 percent rate,
to $614.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, that diversity is precisely what Fidelity wants.
Several years ago, it set out to grow its other lines of business,
so the overall company's success wouldn't hinge solely on the funds
and the rise and fall of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes on, the fund business may turn out to be their
loss leader,'' Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, that hardly seems to matter. At the end of June,
Fidelity said it had earned a stunning $1.2 billion for the first
six months of the year, more than double last year's first-have
earnings. Revenue was $5.8 billion, up 41 percent, largely on
online trading fees, as investors bought and sold heavily until the
Nasdaq Stock Market's dive in April.
</P>
<P>
   FRC isn't writing off Fidelity's fund efforts. The research firm
recently named Fidelity one of the five firms to watch in the
coming decade. Cummings, the analyst, maintained, ``The are the
company to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SLOWING THE FLOW &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through the first seven months of the year, Fidelity Investments
has taken in less than a quarter of the new money it took in last
year.

TITANS-BILLS REMATCH HIGHLIGHTS OPENING WEEK OF NFL SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to insert `1 p.m. games' subhead prior to Giants-Arizona
matchup) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK (SUNDAY, 8 P.M.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee at Buffalo
</P>
<P>
   This of course is a rematch of the ``Music City Miracle'' which
was Tennessee's last second kickoff runback in the playoffs last
year that won the wildcard playoff game against the Bills. Though
Buffalo plays well at home, the Titans won't stumble, mainly
because the Bills don't have the run defense to stop Eddie George,
who had 1,304 yards rushing last season. In the preseason it has
sometimes taken four defenders to bring him down.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction; Titans, 28-21
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona at Giants
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals' quarterback Jake Plummer has 11 fourth-quarter
comebacks in 36 career starts. It is his sometimes-electrifying
play that has made him one of the best young throwing talents in
the game. Last year, however, Plummer, because of a bad thumb and
even worse decisions, tossed 24 interceptions. He's looking to
rebound immediately and should pick apart a weak Giants secondary.
The Giants hold on in a high scoring game behind the defensive play
of Michael Strahan and quarterback Kerry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 35-28
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore at Pittsburgh
</P>
<P>
   This game could not be more perfect for Baltimore's top defense.
Quarterback Kent Graham is a solid passer but his wide receivers
are young, which means the offense's chemistry might be off, making
them susceptible to the blitz, and the Ravens love to blitz. Middle
linebacker Ray Lewis, a murder trial fresh in his memory, wants to
take out the pain of what he feels was an unfair prosecution on
opponents. Quarterback Tony Banks will have a better game, and
better season, than many think.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 28-14
</P>
<P>
   Carolina at Washington
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins have more big-time players than an NBA all-star
game. The problem with possessing all that talent-and it is a
problem a lot of coaches would love to have-is getting it all to
mesh. There will be rough spots early in this game and early in the
season. The Panthers might actually jump out to a halftime lead.
But eventually all that talent will kick in, and what made the
Redskins so good last year, quarterback Brad Johnson, running back
Stephen Davis and wide receiver Michael Westbrook, will dominate a
weak Panthers' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins, 25-13
</P>
<P>
   Chicago at Minnesota
</P>
<P>
   Please, everyone, relax about the Vikings' quarterback
situation. Daunte Culpepper will be just fine. He does have the
Hall-of-Famer Cris Carter and brilliant Randy Moss to throw to.
There will be bumps for Culpepper, but few quarterbacks have failed
in Dennis Green's offensive system. Besides, to slow down
Minnesota, a team has to have a great running game, and Chicago's
Curtis Enis does not qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 28-17
</P>
<P>
   Detroit at New Orleans
</P>
<P>
   Running back James Stewart is the key. For Jacksonville last
season, before he signed with the Lions as a free agent, Stewart
had 13 rushing touchdowns. In preseason he has displayed the kind
of quickness and power Detroit had hoped for. He will stabilize
what has been a chaotic situation with quarterback Charlie Batch,
who is still recovering from a broken leg. Batch's status as
starter will be determined late in the week, and that delay always
throws off game plans. Still, the Lions survive.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 24-10
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis at Kansas City
</P>
<P>
   This game will let the Colts know early the challenge that lies
ahead. Knowing Indianapolis is a strong Super Bowl favorite, every
team will play its best against the Colts. The Chiefs finished the
preseason 0-4 but has won eight of their last 10 regular-season
games at home. Quarterback Peyton Manning wins this one in the
final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 20-17
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville at Cleveland
</P>
<P>
   Biggest mismatch of the weekend. The Browns have no chance,
especially because quarterback Tim Couch, the savior, is playing
poorly. Quarterback Mark Brunell should have a healthy set of
statistics after this one, even though Courtney Brown, the No. 1
overall pick, might get to him a time or two.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 28-6
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco at Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are fighting to avoid finishing last in the division,
while the Falcons are fighting to get back to the playoffs. San
Francisco is young and not very talented. Jeff Garcia is the first
49ers quarterback other than Joe Montana or Steve Young to start
Week 1 since 1980. If preseason is any indication, and it likely
is, Garcia will be good for throwing about two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 17-10
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay at New England
</P>
<P>
   There should not be much suspense in which team will win: The
Buccaneers will, of course. What will be interesting to watch is
how well the offense blends with wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson in
the fold. During one preseason game, the Buccaneers ran the same
play seven consecutive times _ a running play. Bland. But the team
will open things up against New England, and Johnson will be the
focal point. Will the team implode once Johnson begins demanding
the ball? That is Tampa Bay's biggest question as the team makes a
Super Bowl run.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers, 19-7
</P>
<P>
   Jets at Green Bay
</P>
<P>
   Favre did the right thing this week. He rested his tired
throwing elbow, though there is still a question of when the elbow
will fire up again. Most likely that won't happen against the Jets.
Actually, both the Packers and the Jets have problems at
quarterback. Vinny Testaverde seen little action in preseason,
which will surely affect his timing with the offense as well as his
endurance. Since Favre is at home, he wins the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 20-13
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia at Dallas
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Donovan McNabb finished the preseason with an 89.7
passer rating. The rest of the NFC East should be getting a little
nervous. The second-year quarterback is starting to get a good feel
for the game. Throw in talented runner Duce Staley, who accounted
for 41 percent of the team's offense last season, and Philadelphia
could end up steamrolling an aging Dallas team.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles, 21-6
</P>
<P>
   Seattle at Miami
</P>
<P>
   Probably the toughest game of the week to call because the teams
are so evenly matched. The edge probably goes to Miami since they
are at home and play well in season openers. Also, Seattle
quarterback Jon Kitna was disappointing in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 21-14
</P>
<P>
   San Diego at Oakland
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ryan Leaf gets the start for the Chargers and his
rebirth begins. Known more for being a crybaby than a professional
thrower, maybe Leaf can turn his career around. If that does
happen, it won't start against the Raiders, whose secondary is
pretty solid. Oakland sticks to its excellent ground game and wears
down the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 15-7
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Denver at St. Louis Rams
</P>
<P>
   There will be times this season when the Rams feel the crush of
being the defending Super Bowl champions. But not this game. On the
surface, this seems a close matchup but the Broncos don't have the
speed to keep up with St. Louis on that slick artificial surface.
Terrell Davis has bravely made the comeback from torn knee
ligaments but few players come back from those injuries quickly.
Denver will be forced to rely on quarterback Brian Griese, who is
extremely inconsistent. This might be a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 30-21.

WOMEN'S RIGHTS ADVOCATES DISTURBED BY JDUGE'S RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With Sect-Arrest)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, the decision seems clear: a woman whose strict
religious sect forbids modern medicine _ but whose previous child
could have been saved by a routine medical procedure _ is ordered
to serve out the remainder of her current pregnancy in a locked,
state-run medical facility.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's decision by Judge Kenneth P. Nasif in the case of
Attleboro, Mass. sect member Rebecca Corneau sent a shock wave
through the women's rights community, and raised a profound
question: How much control should the government have over the
health decisions of a mentally competent person?
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we draw the line here?'' asked Andi Mullin, president
of Massachusetts chapter of National Organization for Women. ``Are
we going to start incarcerating women who drink during pregnancy,
who smoke during pregnancy or don't wear their seat belts in a
car?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jetta Bernier, executive director for Massachusetts Citizens
for the Children said given Corneau's disturbing history, the judge
made the best decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limiting her rights for a period of a few weeks seems far less
disturbing then denying her child's basic right to be born in a
safe and protective setting,'' said Bernier.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Judge Kenneth P. Nasif ruled that Corneau _ one of
13 members of the ultra-conservative Christian sect suspected of
burying the bodies of two infants in a Maine park last fall _ was
an unfit mother who must surrender her unborn baby to the state
after birth.
</P>
<P>
   While the fundamentalists file no birth records and shun modern
medicine, prosecutors now say they have evidence the infant,
Jeremiah Corneau, lived for several minutes, and his death could
have been prevented. They also believe Samuel Robideaux, a
10-month-old baby, died when he stopped nursing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week the judge seemed willing to give Rebecca
Corneau the benefit of the doubt, allowing her to remain free if
she allowed a court-appointed nurse into her home for daily
checkups on her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Corneau refused, insisting that the conventional medical system
is ``under the direction of a pagan God.'' Thursday, the top
prosecutor in Bristol County, Mass., mindful of the two earlier
deaths, urged the judge to put Corneau in state custody. The judge
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The case involving Corneau is unusual because the government
rarely involves itself in the decision of a mentally-competent
pregnant woman, said Madlyn Freundlich, policy director for the
Children Rights, a national advocacy organization in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In those rare cases, she said, the court usually struck down the
state's decision. But Freundlich said the state's job in this case
is to focus on the baby's health, not the legal rights of the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult area when you are trying to respect the
rights of the woman and the rights of the child. That becomes even
more complicated when you don't have the little person in front of
you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But legal and child welfare experts say the case could have
broad implications on all people, regardless of their gender, by
removing an individual's power to choose based on his or her
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is outrageous,'' said Sarah Wunch, staff
attorney for the ACLU in Massachusetts. ``The implications are very
serious. And I believe there is no basis for it. I think the judge
is the outlaw in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Paltrow, director of the New York-based National Advocates
for Pregnant Women, said that when the state gets involved in
childbirth issues ``they often get it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that a court once ordered a pregnant woman in
Washington, D.C. to have a Casearian birth over her objections,
believing they could save an endangered fetus. The fetus died,
Paltrow said, and the operation contributed to the woman's death.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling in Corneau's case `` sets a dangerous precedent to
both women and their future children,'' Paltrow said. ``It risks
frightening women from establishing good relationships with health
care providers, out of fear they will be forced to undergo unwanted
medical procedures and examinations.''

DVDs' UNRIVALED _ AND TEMPORARY? _ TECHNOLOGY 
(For use on or after Sat., AUG. 2, 2000 by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
These are good times for DVD, which the Consumer Electronics
Association merrily bills as the most rapidly embraced new
entertainment format in history. At the recent DVD Entertainment
Conference here in Los Angeles, many of the speakers showed even
more reasons for glee.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8.5 million DVD players have been shipped (half a
million in July alone), according to the CEA. More than 7,400 DVD
movies have been released, not counting probably as many more adult
film titles.
</P>
<P>
   And the pace of acceptance should only accelerate in coming
months, particularly with the arrival of several new gaming
consoles, led by Sony's PlayStation 2 debut on Oct. 26, that all
use DVD drives. Those machines, which also include Microsoft's X
Box and Nintendo's GameCube ((BEGIN ITAL)nee(END ITAL) Dolphin),
all will play DVD movies, compact discs of music and high-end games
created specifically for each machine.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the long-awaited arrival of DVD Audio, a format
that takes advantage of DVD's wonderful home-theater sound
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this is quite here yet. The biggest obstacle:
the Powers That Be still haven't settled DVD Audio's last niggling
format details, though that hasn't stopped some companies and
artists from creating discs and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``DVD Audio has been long in coming,'' acknowledged Paul Bishow,
the format's launch director for Universal Music Group. ``It's
proving to be the longest pregnancy in history. But we think it's
the next (big) music format, with features that are better than CD
quality. It begins to change the listening experience in a way that
never has before.''
</P>
<P>
   DVD Audio records more information, more frequently, than is
done for CDs, allowing for a richer, truer sound distinguishable
even to a stone-eared audio hack such as myself.
</P>
<P>
   For you technical types, that means where CDs record 16 bits of
sound information more than 44 thousand times per second, DVD Audio
records 24 bits of information 96,000 times per second (and for
really high-end recordings, up to 192,000 times per second).
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change though, isn't about cycles and bits. It's
about channels, 5.1 of them instead of stereo's two, just like DVD
Video uses for home-theater systems. That's front-right, -left and
-center speakers, rear- left and -right speakers, and a ``.1''
subwoofer for bass sounds, creating a surround-sound effect that
can make you literally feel engulfed by a performance, with the
band playing all around you.
</P>
<P>
   Done right, it's a remarkable experience. But that's the rub.
Someone has to go back in and redo all those wonderful albums
you've been listening to all these years.
</P>
<P>
   You can't take a stereo recording designed for left and right
speakers and split it 5.1 ways. You have to remix the original
master tapes so that, say, the saxophone is heard out of the
left-front speaker, the guitar in the two rear speakers, and the
bass and drums rumbling from the subwoofer.
</P>
<P>
   And to redo classic albums for reissue in the 5.1 format means
finding all those old master tapes of the original recording (often
a daunting challenge) and virtually reconstructing the music for
the new audio architecture.
</P>
<P>
   There are other obstacles, too. The few hundred music titles
available that are using the existing DVD sound specifications can
be played on most existing DVD players. But there's no guarantee
future DVD Audio recordings will play on those devices (though it's
likely most discmakers will ensure they can).
</P>
<P>
   DVD Audio is also fending off a competing audio format, Super
Audio CD, though it faces the challenges of any new entertainment
technology without DVD Audio's built-in advantage as kissing cousin
to an existing format.
</P>
<P>
   Bishow and others wouldn't predict when the DVD Audio format
will be finalized. When it happens, you should start seeing not
only combination players that will accommodate DVD Video and Audio,
CDs and more, but also specialized players, particularly for car
audio's multiple-speaker systems.
</P>
<P>
   DVD Audio discs also will come with lots of add-on features,
just as DVD Video often does, including lyrics, photo galleries,
biographies and more.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the format's video abilities to be exploited when
companies get past classic rock reissues targeting wealthy baby
boomers, Bishow said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe once dance and hip-hop musicians get involved and
start using the visual elements, I think they're going to surprise
us all.''
</P>

TEXAS' DEVASTATING DROUGHT IS ONE OF WORST IN MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCKHART, Texas _ At the weekly livestock auction on the
outskirts of town, there's something in the air even heavier than
the dust and stench: fear of the devastation that this summer's
drought is bringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hurting all right, and it may get to be a lot worse
before it gets any better,'' said M.M. Pogue, a cattle rancher from
Lytton Springs near this Central Texas stopping point on the
Chisholm Trail 20 miles southeast of Austin. Pogue, who can tick
off the memorable droughts of his 84 years as easily as some might
list their children's names, said this summer's drought could be
one of the worst. ``A lot of people are going to be knocked right
out of the cattle business by this one.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer's record stretch of 62 days without rain in North
Texas, after four years in which some areas of the state have had
almost no appreciable rain, has left thousands of acres of crops
wasted, dried up lakes and helped spark 650 fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the midst of an unmitigated disaster,'' said Allen
Spelce, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Agriculture, ``and
it has been accumulating in magnitude over the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   It is little better in much of the South and West. The Great
Plains and the Southeast have been baking in 100-degree
temperatures this week, fires are destroying tinder-dry forests in
most Western States and Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and north
Florida continue to suffer their own droughts, despite intermittent
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Proensa, director of the National Weather Service's
Southern regional office in Fort Worth, said there is little hope
of immediate relief.
</P>
<P>
   More than 89 people have died from the heat nationwide, Proensa
said, including 52 in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seeing record temperatures and record series of consecutive
high temperatures in many places,'' he said, citing Wednesday's all
time high temperature in Little Rock, Ark., of 111 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas is bearing the brunt of the drought, he said. In the
Dallas-Fort Worth area, the temperature was 100 or higher in 39 of
the last 60 days, Proensa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that will help us now is a hurricane, and
there's no sign of one of those in the forecast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas and adjacent states, 177 counties have been declared
disaster areas for crop losses so far by the federal Department of
Agriculture, and state officials predict those losses, currently
calculated at $595 million for Texas alone, will soar past $1
billion by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Droughts from 1996 to this year have cost Texas farmers and
ranchers over $5 billion dollars, said Allen Spelce, a spokesman
for the Texas Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas on Thursday blew past a 66-year-old record by
posting 62 consecutive days without rain, eclipsing even the
notorious drought years of 1950 and the ``Dust Bowl drought'' of
1934.
</P>
<P>
   And, as lake levels continue to drop, at least three electric
plants in West Texas warned customers that they may be forced to
shut down because there will not be enough water to cool the
plants' electricity generating equipment unless the area gets rain
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an uncommon event and a very real danger,'' said Jim
Calloway, a senior engineer with the Texas Public Utilities
Commission. ``There's a definite possibility that we'll have to
shut those plants down if we don't get rain by November.''
</P>
<P>
   Power to those served by the plants, he said, could be provided
from other sources in Texas, but at a potentially higher cost.
</P>
<P>
   In parched Central Texas, reduced water levels in the
underground Edwards Aquifer have cut flows to Comal Springs, the
state's largest spring, to the point that endangered species of
fish are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   At the popular Jacob's Well spring midway between Austin and San
Antonio, which has never been known to go dry, water flow has been
cut from a normal 75 gallons per second to less than seven gallons
per second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The canary in the coal mine is on its back, kicking its legs
up in the air,'' said David Baker, who lives near Jacob's Well.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In hard hit northern and central Georgia, the drought is
ravaging the state's thirsty cities and farms.
</P>
<P>
   David Stooksbury, the state climatologist, estimates that it
will take two winters of normal rainfall to replenish aquifers,
rivers, creeks, ponds, and reservoirs and to saturate the soil
depths needed to nurture crops and lawns.
</P>
<P>
   At least 721 wells ran dry in southwest Georgia this summer.
Last year only a few were reported dry in the same region, said Mel
Jones, a district environmentalist for the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide survey found approximately 23 cities, primarily in
northern Georgia, face critical water shortages, according to
Harold Reheis, director of the Georgia Environmental Protection
Division. Many have only a 30-day or less water supply.
</P>
<P>
   In Carrollton, approximately 50 miles southwest of Atlanta,
Lewis Mason, water plant superintendent, said, ``We estimate we've
got around 60 to 65 days of water left. We're obviously on a total
ban _ no outside watering or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Crop losses in both Texas and Georgia have been staggering.
</P>
<P>
   By midsummer the drought had already damaged approximately 39
percent or an estimated $738 million in the Georgia's corn, cotton,
peanuts, soybeans, tobacco, pecans and forage crops, said Charles
McPeake of the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service.
Losses to cotton farmers were estimated at $230 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, cotton, grain, and wheat losses alone already top $425
million from the current drought, according to officials there.
</P>
<P>
   But with pasture lands scorched to their roots, and with stock
tanks reduced to mere mud puddles, it is the cattlemen who seem to
be suffering the most.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Carrillo, at the Lockhart auction with his father to sell
20 cows, said he just could not afford to feed them through the
winter. ``Our hay crop never really made this year, and all our
fields are burnt to a crisp. We've got to sell now or go broke
later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got water but no feed, you can haul feed,'' said
Mike Alonzo, a cattle raiser found stacking newly bought hay at his
ranch near here. ``If you've got feed but no water, you can haul
water. But if you don't have feed or water, the way it is with this
here drought, you're in big trouble,'' he said.

NO CONNECTION SEEN BETWEEN REDUCED LOGGING AND RAMPANT FOREST
FIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Mont.)   By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There appears to be no link between reduced logging on national
forests over the last decade and the wildfires now raging through
much of the West, a report by a bipartisan research group for
Congress has found.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, heavy logging from earlier years may have
contributed more to the conditions that have made Western forests
ripe for big fires, because more flammable small trees and heavy
brush are often left in the forest after the larger stands of
timber have been taken out, said the report, by the Congressional
Research Service, which does policy analysis for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, leading Republicans in the West, as well as
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, have said that logging reductions
under the Clinton administration have been a contributing cause of
fires that have burned more than 6 million acres this year. Logging
in national forests has been reduced by more than 75 percent since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Oregon earlier this month, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, said Clinton
administration policies that restrict logging ``made the forests
more dangerous to fire,'' although he did not blame the fires on
the president.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the years with the most fires over the last two
decades were those in which logging was at record high levels, the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timber harvesting removes the relatively large diameter wood
that can be converted into wood products, but leaves behind the
small material, especially twigs and needles,'' wrote Ross W.
Gorte, author of the report. ``The concentration of these `fine
fuels' on the forest floor increases the rate of spread of
wildfires.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was done at the request of Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,
but it was conducted by the agency that conducts policy analysis
for all of Congress. Some Western Republicans who have linked
Clinton forest policies to the fires say the report is not
conclusive enough to determine future policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It presents a mixed picture,'' said Gov. Marc Racicot, R-Mont.
``This year is the lowest ever for timber harvesting and it could
be the worst fire year in decade.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Next week, the Clinton administration plans to release its
recommendations on how to manage more than 40 million acres which
are considered to be at extreme risk of major wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the congressional report
would not help the argument of either side of a growing political
debate over the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fires are being used by both the timber industry and
environmentalists,'' said Babbitt. ``One side says increase
logging, the other side says no logging, even thinning. Neither
position is the accurate way to address forest health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the commercial logging program on national forests
will not play a significant role in the plan presented next week.
The plan will try to restore forest health through controlled burns
and some thinning, and attempt to get people who live in
high-fire-risk forested areas to clear the hazards near their
homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report looked at logging and fires for each of
the last twenty years. The two highest years for logging _ 1987 and
1988 _ were two of the highest years for acres burned on national
forest lands. The report does not address this year, when logging
has been at a historic low, and the fires are at near-record highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assertion has been that we're getting more acres burned as
we have reduced the timber harvesting levels,'' said Gorte, author
of the report, in an interview. ``In fact, for the most part, we
were getting fewer acres burned.''
</P>
<P>
   The fires have been at the heart of a clamorous political debate
in the West. On Tuesday, on the day that Vice President Al Gore,
the Democratic presidential nominee, made a campaign stop in
Oregon, a number of groups which favor higher logging took out
full-page ads in the state that blamed the fires on the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say no to Al Gore's big burn,'' was the headline in a
full-page ad which ran Tuesday in the Oregonian, the biggest paper
in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., has been highly critical of Clinton's
timber policies, saying forest neglect and mismanagement have
contributed to the fires. Thursday, after the congressional report
was released, Smith continued to criticize the administration,
though he softened his tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at things on a short term basis, we could concede
some of the points made in this report,'' said Joe Sheffo, a
spokesman for Smith. ``But the fact is we have a cumulative
problem. And the Clinton administration has known about it for
years.''

USE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS IS DOWN AMONG YOUNG, SURVEY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The use of illegal drugs by children ages 12 to 17
dropped sharply from 1997 to 1999, the federal government said
Thursday. And while drug use among people 18 to 25 went up, it was
still far below what it was two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The heartening trend among those 12 to 17 is the most important
finding of the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, said Donna
Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, and Barry
McCaffrey, director of the White House office on drug control
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Both officials said nationwide educational and preventive
efforts are working, especially among the young. ``Most of our
young people are obviously getting the message that drugs are not
the stuff of dreams, but the stuff of nightmares,'' Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said, ``Watch this population. It's cheaper to deal
with them now than when they enter the criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found a 21 percent drop from 1997 to 1999 among those
12 to 17 who said they had used an illegal drug in the month before
they were surveyed. Nine percent of those 12 to 17 reported using
an illicit drug in 1999 compared with 11.4 percent who admitted
drug use in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The use of marijuana in that age group showed a steeper decline
than overall drug use, declining by 26 percent. While 9.4 percent
of the young people surveyed in 1997 said they had used marijuana
in the preceding month, only 7 percent of those surveyed last year
said they had. Since marijuana remains the most popular illicit
drug among youths, the officials found its decline in popularity
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey results among people 18 to 25 _ who are among
those most likely to commit crimes _ showed a worsening problem, at
least recently. Use of illicit drugs rose 28 percent in two years;
that is, 14.7 percent in this age group reported using an illicit
drug in 1997, while 18.8 percent said they had done so in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued with the survey findings predicted that those
in the 18-to-25 group, ``which includes many of those who formed
their attitudes about drug use and began to use in the early
1990s,'' will continue to use drugs at a relatively high rate as
they age.
</P>
<P>
   A far higher percentage of people who were in the 18-to-25 group
two decades ago were drug users, government data released Thursday
showed. About 38 percent in that age cohort used illicit drugs in
1979, after which the percentage declined steadily to just under 15
percent in the mid-1990s before climbing again.
</P>
<P>
   The change among the 12-to-17 group has been less dramatic.
About 16 percent in that age group reported using illegal drugs in
1979. The percentage declined until 1992, when it began a see-saw
pattern.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the total population 12 and older, the rate of illicit drug
use has remained flat for several years. The government estimated
that 14.8 million Americans, or 6.7 percent of those 12 and older,
had used drugs in the month before they were surveyed. In 1979, the
percentage was roughly twice as high.
</P>
<P>
   The annual survey released Thursday was done by the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, headed by Dr.
Nelba Chavez, in Shalala's agency.
</P>
<P>
   Previous surveys relied on a sample of about 18,000 people who
were questioned in person or through paper forms. The latest survey
used both the old methodology and a new, computer-based
questionnaire that expanded the sample size to almost 70,000
people. In this way, Shalaha and McCaffrey said, they can reliably
gauge the latest trends while establishing a more comprehensive
base of information for future studies. (Detailed findings from the
study are available on the Internet at www.samhsa.gov.).
</P>
<P>
   The government noted that the latest study did not cover
military people on active duty, people in prisons or drug-treatment
centers or homeless people who were not in shelters when the survey
was being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska had the highest rate of illicit drug use (10.7 percent of
those 12 and older) and Virginia the lowest (4.7). The rate of drug
use among American Indians and native Alaskans was 10.6 percent.
For blacks, it was 7.7 percent, and for whites, 6.6 percent.
Asian-Americans had the lowest drug-use rate, 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Thursday is a cornucopia of information, and
not just on illegal drugs. It estimates that 6,400 people tried
marijuana for the first time in 1998. That year, an estimated 1.6
million people _ half younger than 18 _ took up cigarette smoking.
And 4.9 million tried cigars for the first time in 1998, up from
1.5 million new cigar smokers in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go,'' Shalala said, ``miles to go in our
journey to a drug free America.''

COMMENTARY: LABORERS ANONYMOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The service economy has created some strange and wonderful forms
of employment. A friend of mine once went to a party in Los Angeles
where the host had covered one room with fuzzy shag carpet _ floor,
walls and ceiling _ and hired a man whose sole job was to fluff up
the nap whenever it got matted. ``Survivor'' drove home the lesson
that farmers and truck drivers are no match for people with titles
like ``corporate trainer'' or ``whitewater rafter.'' At the
Democratic convention, thanks to the presence of Christie Brinkley
in the New York delegation, we were alerted for the first time to
the existence of a career path known as ``model/activist.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, America chose its presidents pretty exclusively
from the national pool of lawyers and generals. But lately the
candidates' backgrounds have gotten more varied. This year, of the
Democrats and Republicans on the national tickets, only Joe
Lieberman is a lawyer, and only Al Gore was ever a full-time
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   It's never been clear how much voters care if a president's
experience with the world of work in any way resembles their own.
Do weary parents juggling two careers and child-rearing resent
hearing about George W. Bush's afternoon naps? Would middle-aged
professionals who are too humiliated to admit they don't know the
difference between a money market and a mutual fund feel an
affinity for Al Gore, who keeps his savings in a passbook account?
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, are rich men, while
Gore and Lieberman are not. Economically speaking, Gore may
actually be downwardly mobile. He says he doesn't buy stock because
it might look like a conflict of interest, and Fortune magazine,
analyzing what passes for the Gore portfolio, once suggested the
vice president ``could be a financial dolt.''
</P>
<P>
   So which team better understands the working stiff? The
Democratic candidates are less wealthy, but on the other hand,
they're both career politicians who have held elective office
practically since puberty.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman did have a two-year hiatus after he lost a House race
in 1980, during which he worked as a lawyer and represented at
least one client in the liquor industry who had issues before the
Connecticut state legislature. The senator's staff says this
doesn't mean he used to be a lobbyist, but the experience probably
gave Lieberman a certain sympathy for the trials of a
carpet-fluffer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was about as successful at drilling oil wells as Gore
is in investing, struck it rich when he persuaded a group of
wealthy associates to help him buy the Texas Rangers and then
persuaded the town of Arlington to build said team a new stadium.
Bush's own $600,000 investment thus became $14.9 million when the
franchise was sold. The work he performed as the managing general
partner included encouraging team spirit, and reportedly involved a
lot of autograph-signing. This may not have given him much in
common with the nation's stevedores, but Brinkley and the other
model/activists of the world undoubtedly know what he's been
through.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney spent most of his career in government, but the arrival
of the Clinton administration left him cooling his heels at a
conservative think tank. Happily, in 1995 he went salmon fishing
with Thomas Cruikshank, chairman of the Halliburton Co., a huge
energy services business, who liked Cheney so much he recommended
him as his successor, at a salary of more than $1 million a year
and oodles of stock options. During his tenure there, the future
vice-presidential candidate's big coup was a merger with the
company's chief rival, Dresser Industries, whose chief executive
Cheney won over during a quail hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's ability to fish and shoot his way to serious money
should be an inspiration to all careerists who worry that an
inability to play golf is standing between them and success. Sure,
there were some failures at Halliburton, including the time his
company was banned from bidding on road construction contracts by
the state of North Carolina. But they might provide a much-needed
humanizing touch. We've all had our little career setbacks. Getting
tossed out of North Carolina might not be one of them, but the
concept is there.

 &HT;    Clinton vetoes GOP estate tax bill calling it fiscally
irresponsible &HT;    By PATTY REINERT
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton vetoed a Republican-backed bill
Thursday that would have repealed the federal estate tax, saying it
was fiscally irresponsible and unfair to the 98 percent of
Americans who would be left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is wrong,'' Clinton said during a ceremony in the
East Room of the White House. ``It shows the sense of priorities
that I believe got us in trouble in the first place in the 1980s,
and that if we go back to those priorities, will get us in trouble
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans immediately vowed to override the veto, scheduling a
vote for next Thursday. But Democratic leaders said they are
confident they can block the override, even though 65 of their
colleagues sided with Republicans to push the bill through the
House earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would get rid of estate, gift and generation-skipping
transfer taxes by 2010 and use $105 billion from the projected
budget surplus to make up the difference. It would cost an
additional $750 billion for the second decade of tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned that cost would prevent the federal government
from paying down the debt and investing in education, health care,
the environment and other priorities. He also said the bill failed
the ``fairness test'' because it would provide tax relief to only 2
percent of the most wealthy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the benefit would go to just 3,000 families,
who would receive an average $7 million tax break each, while poor
and middle-income families would receive no additional tax break.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issue has resonated strongly with voters in this
election year as Republicans insist their plan is aimed at giving
tax relief to farmers and small business owners, some of whom
struggle to pay the taxes and keep afloat when their parents die. A
Montana rancher on a red tractor drove to the White House last week
to deliver the bill to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the president vetoed it after inviting a South
Dakota family farmer and a wealthy self-made businessman from New
York to speak in favor of the veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over half the benefit of that bill that came down here on a
tractor goes to 3,000 people,'' Clinton said, ``and I'll bet you
not a single one of them ever drove a tractor. I'll bet you if I
had a tractor-driving contest with any of those 3,000 people, I
would win.''
</P>
<P>
   The current tax code already exempts the first $670,000 for most
estates and $1.3 million for family-owned farms, ranches and small
businesses. By 2006, most families will be able to pass on their
estates worth up to $1 million tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democratic bills pending before Congress would increase the
exemption for family farms and closely-held businesses to $2
million and allow any portion of that exemption not used when the
first spouse dies to be added to the estate of the surviving
spouse. That way, families could inherit up to $4 million tax-free.
The Democratic plans would provide immediate relief, while the
Republican plan would be phased in over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., praised Clinton's
veto of the Republican bill, which he called a `windfall for the
wealthy'' and ``reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugarland, promised to push forward to
override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, even death can't protect you from the Clinton-Gore
administration's insatiable desire for higher taxes,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands, also criticized Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president today said he wants some sort of estate tax
relief, but in the eight years he's been in office, he has never
worked to provide meaningful, fair estate tax relief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This choice is clear,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Houston. ``Al
Gore and the Democrats will continue the death tax, and Governor
Bush and the Republicans will end it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush threw his support
behind repealing the estate tax during his acceptance speech at the
Republican National Convention, earning a huge round of applause
from delegates, one in five of whom were millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail in Toledo, Ohio, Thursday, Bush criticized
Clinton's opposition to repealing the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plans only help the wealthy, they (Democrats) claim. It's
class warfare,'' Bush said, insisting he wanted to reduce taxes for
middle and low-income ``hard-working Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who has surveyed voters on
the issue for several years, said most Americans know they won't be
affected by estate taxes but they oppose them anyway because ``it
sounds like a stupid tax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense,'' he said. ``Why tax somebody for dying?''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said his polls suggest 70 percent of voters favor
eliminating the tax.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue does not just appeal to Republicans. A poll of
independent voters taken by Zogby International suggests they would
overwhelmingly support a candidate who favors repealing the tax
over one that supports a high tax rate on large estates.
</P>
<P>
   The poor tend to be most opposed to repealing the tax, Luntz
said. ``Everybody else hopes to be sufficiently successful ... that
they will have to pay the tax, which they don't want to pay,'' he
said.

<P>
   Reeling from a crisis over defective tires,
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. faces the possibility of a strike
Saturday by 8,000 workers at nine American factories _ a move that
could set back the company's efforts to replace 6.5 million
recalled tires.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the United Steelworkers of America, which
represents the Bridgestone workers, said they have scheduled a
strike for a minute after midnight, barring a settlement, because
of the failure to reach a new contract after months of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Ramick, a steelworkers' spokesman, said the union and the
company were engaged in intensive, nearly round-the-clock talks. He
declined to predict the likelihood of a settlement before the
strike deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's going to be a nail biter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike threat is the latest crisis for
Bridgestone/Firestone, which faces congressional investigations and
a raft of lawsuits over tires that federal regulators say might
have been involved in 88 deaths and 250 injuries. Two weeks ago,
the company recalled more than 6 million 15-inch tires _ mostly
used on sport utility vehicles and pick-up trucks _ after federal
officials disclosed complaints that the tread can separate from the
rest of the tire, a phenomenon blamed for dozens of rollover
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   John Lampe, Bridgestone/Firestone's executive vice president,
was somewhat upbeat about the progress made in talks with labor and
the prospects of avoiding a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they're going well, we're optimistic we can come to
an agreement,'' he said in an interview Thursday morning in
Nashville, Tenn., where the company is based.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor experts suggested that the union has threatened a
walkout now because it believes it might be able to wrest the most
out of Bridgestone.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said a strike this week would have a minimal
effect on production and on working down the backlog of recalled
tires needing replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the company was airlifting in tires produced at its
factories in Japan, Christine Karbowiak, Bridgestone/Firestone's
vice president for public affairs, said, ``We're working very hard
to identify and secure tires from as many different sources as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said that they were not trying to squeeze
Bridgestone when it was down. Rather, they said workers at the nine
plants, where they have been working under temporary extensions
since their contracts expired, have grown frustrated about not
having reached a new agreement after months of negotiations. One
contract that covered union employees at six plants expired in
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that it's high time,'' Ramick said. ``Negotiations
have been going on a long time, and the company has been stalling
for a long time in the talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the two sides were focusing on numerous
issues, including pensions, wages, seniority rights, grievance and
arbitration procedures, and the company's policy over absences. Pay
for the unionized workers ranges from $9 an hour for new workers to
$19 an hour for experienced workers who receive various production
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is certainly vulnerable right now,'' said David
Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive
Transportation at University of Michigan. ``At the same time, the
labor force has an agenda to put forward, and they don't want to be
left out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cole suggested that it would be unwise for the union to
squeeze the company too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the best of conditions, they're going to lose market
share,'' he said. ``The real concern is they could end up in a
position where they can't support the labor force.''
</P>

   The union is threatening strikes at six factories covered by a
master contract that expired April 23. They are in Akron, Ohio;
Decatur, Ill.; Des Moines, Iowa; Noblesville, Ind.; Oklahoma City,
and Russellville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The strike would involve three other factories _ in Bloomington,
Ill., LaVergne, Tenn., and Warren County, Tenn. _ that are covered
by separate contracts that have also expired.
</P>
<P>
   A factory in Wilson, N.C., is not threatened with a walkout
because it is not covered by a union contract. The Wilson plant is
one of those producing replacement tires for sport-utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our top priority, along with serving customers, is achieving
fair and reasonable agreements here,'' said Sharp, the
Bridgestone/Firestone spokesman. ``A strike will benefit no one.
We're working very hard to avoid any sort of disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Many steelworkers are still bitter toward Bridgestone over its
extensive use of replacement workers during a 27-month period from
1994 to 1996. During that strike, Bridgestone, a Japanese company,
notified workers it would permanently replace 2,300 of the 4,200
strikers.
</P>
<P>
   That dispute began with a 10-month strike in July 1994. The
union agreed to end the strike in May 1995, but because of the
company's use of replacement workers, all the union members were
still not taken back to work by November 1996, when a new contract
was reached.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials said many of the defective tires were made in the
Decatur plant when it was using replacement workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there's bitterness about that strike, and I've seen
T-shirts that say, `Never forget.' '' said Larry Odum, the
steelworkers' regional coordinator for the Southeast. ``Anytime
some people are out of work for two-and-a-half years there's going
to be some bitterness. But there are also a lot people willing to
work with the company and help it through the situation now.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 strike was begun by the United Rubber Workers, but that
union, its funds depleted by the strike, merged with the
steelworkers' union in 1995.

 &HT;    Bear kills breeder's alpaca
 &HT;    By Michael C. Bender
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ A $10,000 alpaca was found half-eaten
just outside of Grand Junction Thursday morning, the victim of a
young bear's exquisite midnight snack.
</P>
<P>
   The bear attacked and devoured Mac, one of Kathy McKinley's
alpacas, then leaped the corral fence and headed across the street
into a corn field. The Division of Wildlife set a bear trap in the
corral later in the afternoon, hoping the bear would return to
finish its treat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford to have a bear eat all my animals,'' McKinley
said. McKinley and her husband, Steve, own Mesa Llamas and Alpacas.
They own 17 llamas and alpacas worth a total of more than $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   An alpaca looks like a smaller version of its cousin, the llama,
and is bred for its expensive fur.
</P>
<P>
   A late spring freeze and dry conditions this summer have bears
coming down from the mountains in a search for food.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Division of Wildlife has relocated 22 bears from
the Grand Valley this year and 10 others have been killed by
private property owners. The department receives about 12 phone
calls a day reporting bears in the city, said Steve Yamashita, area
wildlife supervisor for the DOW.
</P>
<P>
   This bear, however, was the first to kill livestock or cause
serious damage in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley did not hear anything during the night, but her
neighbor, Don Hauer, did.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was five or six seconds of fairly intense noises but
they always fight like that,'' Hauer said. ``It stopped after a few
seconds and I thought, 'That's the end of that.'''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley found the carcass about 7 a.m. and called the Mesa
County Sheriff's Department. She was referred to the DOW.
</P>
<P>
   The DOW ``said they wouldn't come because I didn't see the
bear,'' McKinley said.
</P>
<P>
   What McKinley did see was one of her favorite alpacas, minus
nearly the entire right side of its body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken him to parades and to birthday parties, it's
really sad,'' McKinley said. ``Even the fur and the bones are
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   A coyote also could have killed Mac, but McKinley was convinced
the killer was a bear because of a large scat pile, about 50 feet
away from the carcass, surrounded by bear prints.
</P>
<P>
   Hauer, a manager in U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis' Grand Junction
office, said he called Russell George, the DOW's incoming new
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a bear that's come this close and with all the
reported sightings, you would think the Division of Wildlife would
be out here quick,'' Hauer said. ``She's got insurance on these
animals. Common courtesy would be for the sheriff's department to
at least come take a look.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is no immediate threat of a visible bear, the DOW will
not rush to the scene, Yamashita said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a two-strike policy here,'' Yamashita said. ``If we
have to relocate a bear we tag it and if it's found again we
euthanize it. If at all possible we try not to give it its first
strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamashita and Joe Gumber, district supervisor for the
department, arrived at McKinley's house about 11:30 a.m. They
determined it was indeed a bear that killed the animal. If trapped,
they will tag it and relocate it near Silt.
</P>
<P>
   The bear was probably in the area because neighbors are leaving
food out to feed all the bears coming into town, said Linda O'Neal,
a neighbor and friend of McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the bears are so cute and adorable,'' O'Neal said.
``It's stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamashita agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fed bear is a dead bear,'' Yamashita said. ``The law
prohibits feeding wild animals. It encourages this bad behavior.''

 &HT;    JonBenet mystery `addictive' to Net surfers
 &HT;    By Maurice Tamman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even when the JonBenet Ramsey case largely disappeared
from television and newspapers, the story continued bubbling
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's addictive once you start exploring all the twists and
turns,'' said Susan Bennett. ``It's what I do all day, everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina-native created a Web site a couple of years
ago to document developments in the case and explain why she
believes John and Patsy Ramsey did not kill their daughter in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She has traveled all over the country to meet witnesses and has
posted lengthy challenges to published accounts of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's people like me that keep it alive online,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Boulder police interviewed the Ramseys at their
Atlanta-area lawyer's office this week, visitors flocked to her Web
site and posted dozens of messages interpreting what happened.
Bennett, who uses the name Jameson online, said she welcomes
anyone's opinion but the site does have a slant.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet's name appears in thousands of Web pages, including
this sampling from the week's events:

&HT;     CONGRESS RETURNS WITH A FOCUS ON VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Sept. 3)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress returns to Capitol Hill Tuesday for a
fast-paced final month of work in which members will jockey to
showcase an agenda designed primarily to win votes in November.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative goals are taking a back seat to political strategies
as polls are showing a tight presidential race between Texas Gov.
George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing the election, Democrats will push popular legislation to
boost the minimum wage and grant patients a bill of rights against
managed care providers.
</P>
<P>
   With the same focus, Republicans will try to override President
Clinton's veto of the so-called marriage penalty tax as well as his
veto last Thursday of a plan to phase out the federal estate tax.
They will also push a measure to expand Individual Retirement
Accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some members of both parties will fight behind closed
doors to stymie legislation, hoping to keep certain issues alive
for the campaign. For instance, measures to make prescription drugs
more affordable for seniors are not expected to advance simply
because the two parties' plans are too far apart and not enough
time remains to resolve the differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be much sound and fury but very little actual
lawmaking because each side has an incentive to posture rather than
legislate,'' predicts Jack Pitney, a political scientist at
Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, says David Rohde, a political scientist at
Michigan State University, ``nobody wants to be seen as an
obstructionist, and each side wants the other side to be seen as
obstructionist.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue are already
tense. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott fired off a letter last
week charging that President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
``are engineering `a train wreck' to affect the political
environment'' by vetoing spending bills. So far, only two of the 13
measures that fund the federal government have been signed into
law.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert shot back, saying Congress is
``well behind in its work,'' and that ``it's time to stop making
excuses and get a budget together.''
</P>
<P>
   That will probably happen _ with plenty of last-minute
compromises _ since no one wants another government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are still stung by the bruising House losses they
suffered after getting blamed for two partial federal government
shutdowns in late 1995 and early 1996 that resulted from budget
stalemates between them and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avoid a repeat, Republicans in 1996 and 1998 made
major concessions to Clinton to complete the federal budget. Later
many GOP strategists blamed those concessions for additional
Republican losses in the House in 1998. Now Republicans have a
seven-vote majority there and a five-vote majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats remember all too well the legislative gridlock, plus
Clinton's failed health care overhaul, that swept congressional
Republicans to power in 1994. Voters blamed both sides for the
stalemate but punished Democrats at the polls that year.
</P>
<P>
   As the targeted adjournment date of Oct. 6 nears, horse-trading
between Republican leaders and the White House will go into high
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything depends with how vulnerable the Republicans feel
and what they make by way of concessions without alienating their
conservative base,'' says Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the final month of the 106th Congress, President Clinton
will seek to burnish his legacy and drum up support for Gore and
for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The following legislation will take center stage as Congress
returns:
</P>
<P>
   _ CHINA TRADE. The Senate will soon consider the landmark,
House-passed bill that would grant China permanent trading
privileges with the United States, which most other countries
enjoy, without an annual review. Since the measure, opposed by
organized labor, is a top priority for Clinton and Lott and is
backed by Gore and Bush, it will likely pass. But the outcome is
unclear on a controversial companion measure by Sens. Fred
Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., which would prod
the White House to impose sanctions if China fails to stop giving
weapons of mass destruction to rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   _ MINIMUM WAGE. House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., with
Lott's approval, offered a deal to Clinton last week. He said
Congress would agree to the president's plan to raise the minimum
wage by $1 over two years in exchange for a GOP proposal to provide
$76 billion in tax breaks over 10 years for small businesses. While
the House approved the minimum wage boost over two years, the
Senate has insisted on implementing it over three years. A
compromise version has stalled for months, but now, with Clinton
indicating he could accept the tax measure, passage looks likely.
</P>
<P>
   _ RETIREMENT SAVINGS. Lott has pledged to push legislation that
would expand contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts from
$2,000 to $5,000 over three years. The measure passed the House
with 401 votes in July, but the Treasury Department opposes it and
has said it will recommend a veto. Outlook: possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ MARRIAGE PENALTY. House Republican leaders will try to
override Clinton's Aug. 5 veto of the so-called marriage penalty
tax, a quirk in the tax code that causes some couples to owe more
income taxes if they marry than if they live together but remain
single. An override is doubtful but has a slim chance.
</P>
<P>
   _ ESTATE TAX. Hastert will try to override President Clinton's
Aug. 31 veto of a bill that would phase out the estate tax over 10
years. The speaker says it forces family farms and businesses to
break up. But in 1998, only 47,500 estates, 2 percent of the total,
paid the tax, and most of the revenue came from estates worth more
than $5 million. Republicans have been vulnerable to charges they
are catering to the wealthy, and their override attempt is likely
to fall short of the two-thirds majority needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., will
look for chances to attach to spending bills a measure that would
pay for emergency care, allow patients to see certain specialists
without prior health plan approval and let them sue a health plan
in state courts. Democrats claim they have 50 votes, which with
Gore's tie-breaker would allow them to pass the measure. But they
couldn't muster 60 votes to quash a GOP filibuster, and since the
Republicans are not likely to give Gore such a plum, the measure
will probably die.

GOP FIRES FIRST IN TV AD WARS, QUESTIONING GORE'S CREDIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The presidential campaign erupted into
fireworks Thursday, even before its traditional Labor Day kick-off,
after the Republicans distributed a TV ad questioning Al Gore's
credibility by showing him at a Buddhist temple and suggesting he
invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Al Gore reinventing himself,'' a woman says in the
Republican National Committee ad that was sent to television
stations Thursday and will air as early as Friday night in 17
states.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign cast the piece as ``tongue-in-cheek,'' yet it
dovetailed with the Texas governor's recent focus on Gore's
credibility. Bush has claimed that Gore's pledges to provide
prescription drugs and middle-class tax cuts echo promises he and
President Clinton made in the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why he has to say it eight years later?'' Bush asked
a crowd at the Butler Traditional High School here during a speech
that mainly focused on his education agenda. ``Because they
couldn't deliver on the promise eight years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The current Democratic ticket said the TV commercial showed Bush
had decided to break his vow against negative campaigning to stop
his recent slip in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore standing silently in the background, his running mate,
Connecticut Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, told a crowd of 2,500 in
Seattle about the Republican ad, eliciting a loud ``boo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I'm sorry to say that Governor Bush's promise to change
the tone of American politics has run into the reality of a
troubled Bush-Cheney campaign,'' Lieberman said. ``These new attack
ads break his promise not to launch personal attacks in this
campaign and they drag us back to the worst politics of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman continued: ``It seems to me today that Governor Bush
has sadly changed his tune about changing the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Two political analysts questioned the timing of the ad, but said
it was within the bounds of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument for Bush is still significantly an argument for
change and an argument for character and an argument for trust,''
said Washington political analyst Stuart Rothenberg. ``My own view,
for what it's worth, is if you can't talk about an opponent's
character, you're carving out an awfully large area of what you're
electing. Presumably, the person you vote to such a high office has
the character you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of
Virginia, agreed, saying: ``Bush's argument is that Gore is a
hypocrite, you can't believe what he says because what he does is
different, and it's time for a change. If Americans don't accept
that, he's going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Sabato and Rothenberg said the ad's timing may be telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm surprised they don't wait to see what happens with
the (poll) numbers, unless they feel like the race is slipping away
or that the coverage is going so against them,'' Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato thought that was exactly what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the Democratic convention, the Bush campaign has been in
a trough that hasn't fully showed up in the polls. They desperately
need to get off the defensive and on to the offensive, and
everybody would agree this is on the offensive,'' the professor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new ad is being sponsored by Victory 2000, a wing of the RNC
that, like the committee itself, is now under the control of the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The spot is titled ``Really'' and focuses on what Republicans
view as Gore's chief weakness: his credibility, especially in the
aftermath of President Clinton's lies about his affair with Monica
S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial begins by showing a TV set in a kitchen as it
plays a tape of Gore at the 1996 Buddhist temple fund-raiser while
the vice president pledges to make campaign finance reform his No.
1 political priority.
</P>
<P>
   A woman's voice says: ``There's Al Gore reinventing himself on
television again. Like I'm not going to notice. Who's he going to
be today? The Al Gore who raises campaign money at a Buddhist
temple or the one who now promises campaign finance reform?
Really.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial then shows a clip of Gore on CNN in 1999 saying,
``I took the initiative in creating the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman responds: ``Al Gore claiming credit for things he
didn't even do.'' When the clip ends, the woman says, ``Yeah, and I
invented the remote control. Another round of this and I'll sell my
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush personally reviewed and approved the ad. His spokeswoman,
Karen Hughes, denied it was an attack ad, saying both she and her
13-year-old son laughed when they first saw the spot Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tongue-in-cheek, good-natured way of making a very
important point: There is a gaping credibility gap between what
Vice President Gore does and what Vice President Gore says,''
Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the ad was justified given a $30-million ad blitz by
the Democratic National Party during the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have held our fire, but the RNC now feels it's time to tell
America to consider the source,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ad appeared to reflect a new sense of urgency
within the Bush campaign. The Buddhist temple and Internet footage
are considered some of the most potent in the GOP arsenal, and
Bush's campaign has had them stockpiled for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   The April 29, 1996, fund-raiser at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple
near Los Angeles has been one of Gore's biggest embarrassments. The
event was controversial because it may have violated the temple's
tax-exempt status, and because members of the temple were illegally
reimbursed for contributions to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to seek an
independent counsel related to Gore's fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself has often joked that his biggest mistake in this
campaign was his March 1999 comment on CNN: ``During my service in
the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the
Internet.'' Gore has since said he meant only that he took the lead
in laying down the policy that helped develop the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC's decision to air the Gore ad prompted the Democrats to
change their advertising strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee had plans to unveil an ad or
ads attacking Bush's record in Texas, specifically his record on
health care, but the committee decided to hold them. The Gore
campaign received fodder this week with the news that a federal
judge had ordered Texas to fix problems in providing Medicaid
services to some 1.5 million children.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Democratic official said of the RNC commercial: ``We
think this will backfire.'' Instead, the Gore campaign decided to
focus on claiming that Bush had broken his pledge to shun negative
campaigning.

 &HT;    CARE mounts relief for Eritrea
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CARE, the Atlanta-based international relief and
development agency, announced Thursday that it is launching an
emergency relief program in Eritrea, where more than a quarter of
the population has been displaced by drought or by war.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that has not always welcomed International aid
agencies, CARE will help local institutions in managing food
distribution, providing seeds for planting, removing land mines and
educating people about them, and providing health care for women
and children who have been driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea has a strong tradition of self-reliance, and in the
mid-1990s the country asked a number of international agencies to
leave the country. But a brutal border war earlier this year saw
Ethiopian troops penetrate deep into Eritrean territory, sending
thousands of civilians fleeing. And a drought that has parched the
Horn of Africa has left many Eritreans unable to plant crops or
find food.
</P>
<P>
   Late in July, the deputy commissioner of the Eritrean Relief and
Refugee Commission, Teclemichael Woldegiorgis, met in Washington
D.C. with representatives of a number of non-governmental
organizations. He spoke about deteriorating conditions facing the
country's 1.1 million internally displaced people _ more than
one-fourth of the country's 4.1 million inhabitants _ and asked the
aid agencies how they thought they could help.
</P>
<P>
   In response, CARE sent a team of four people to Eritrea to work
with government ministries to assess the needs and figure out what
niche CARE might fill, said Susan Farnsworth, the CARE official who
led the team.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, CARE has worked with donors _ primarily the Italian
government and the U.S. Agency for International Development _ to
secure funding for what is projected to be a one-year emergency
intervention, Farnsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern part of the country, the CARE team visited
refugee camps, which, Farnsworth said, were populated primarily by
woman, children and old men _ the younger men having gone either to
the front or to the city to look for work, since the crops cannot
be planted this year. In the southern Debub zone, or province, the
Alba refugee camp has 24,000 people living in it, and more are
arriving daily, she said.
</P>
<P>
   CARE will help there with hygiene, malaria treatment and trying
to provide antiseptic tools and sheeting for births, as well as
education for traditional birth attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Displaced people who try to return home sometimes find their
houses damaged, the area's social services devastated, and the land
too strewn with mines to be inhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   CARE plans to move quickly. In the south, the planting season
has been missed. But in the north, the rains are just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an opportunity this week and next to get seeds in the
ground,'' Farnsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   CARE's plan, Farnsworth said, has been developed with officials
from Eritrea's relief agency, health ministry and agriculture
ministry participating every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eritrea has this very strong principle of self-reliance,'' she
said. ``I think that's something to really be respected.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Generation gap emerging in U.S. drug use, survey finds
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By MICHAEL HEDGES
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   A generation gap has emerged in U.S. drug use, with teen-agers
turning away from marijuana and cocaine even as more of their
college-age brothers and sisters are using illicit drugs, a
national survey indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the number of 12- to 17-year-olds using illegal
drugs has fallen from 11.4 percent to 9 percent, according the
National Household Survey, an annual snapshot of the nation's drug
use, released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said, ``More
of our young people are obviously getting the message that drugs
are not the stuff of dreams, they are the stuff of nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   But that same message has not resonated with 18- to
25-year-olds, whose drug use is increasing. The survey found that
about 19 percent in that age group used drugs in 1999, rising from
just under 15 percent in 1997. That is an increase of 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said that disparity was caused by the aging of a group
of teen-agers that had used drugs in their early years more than
those older or younger than themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also suggests to us that we have to target 18- to
25-year-olds,'' Shalala said, referring to education programs and a
$200 million advertising campaign commissioned by the federal
government which has been pitched mostly at teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big issue for colleges and universities to really
put the pressure on to target those groups at the same time,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found Americans of all ages using drugs at about the
same rate as in the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 14.8 million Americans used an illegal drug at
least once in the past month, the survey found. That number is
little changed from last year. But it is significantly lower than
the peak of illegal drug use in the United States, 1979, when 25
million people were considered current drug users.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released one day after President Clinton's visit
to Colombia to support that nation's war on cocaine barons who have
been operating with, and under the protection of, leftist
guerrillas fighting the government.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has pledged $1.3 billion to Colombia next
year to fund helicopters and other equipment for fighting the
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey said the slackening of drug use
by U.S. teen-agers is not a reason to re-examine an expensive war
on drugs. The national anti-drug budget is $19.2 billion, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 5 million chronic addicts; they consume two-thirds
of all the illegal drugs in America. ... So we've still got a giant
drug problem in America,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey also noted that while U.S. drug consumption is stable,
it is increasing around the world. ``We're consuming, arguably, 2
or 3 percent of the world's heroin, and probably less than a
quarter of the world's cocaine. ... This is not an American
problem, it's a global problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who accompanied Clinton to
Colombia, also backed the $1.3 billion aid package to that nation
Thursday. ``If we attack a source of America's drugs with this aid,
we will have a better chance of keeping drugs out of our children's
reach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since its inception in 1971, the survey this
year included looks at drug, alcohol and tobacco use in the states.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was in the lowest one-fifth of states for drug use in the
past 30 days by all people older than 12. Roughly 5 percent of
Texans over 12 used illicit drugs in the month before the survey
was taken in 1999, significantly lower than the national average of
roughly 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The state also was in the lowest fifth for tobacco use, with a
rate of between 19 and 24 smokers out of 100 people. The national
average was about 26 per 100.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas was in the middle range for binge alcohol drinking,
defined as having five or more drinks at one time. Between 11 and
12 percent of Texans had had a binge drinking episode in the past
30 days at the time of the survey last year.
</P>
<P>
   In one subcategory Texas was worse than the national average:
illicit drug use other than marijuana by teen-agers. Between 6
percent and 8 percent of Texas youths aged 12-17 had used cocaine,
heroin, ecstasy, methamphetamines or other hard drugs. The national
average was around 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said it was important to focus on preventing the habit
of using injurious substances among the young. For college
students, a combination of drugs and alcohol can blunt efforts to
succeed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst problem college students face is a combination of
beer and pot. That's why they end up dropping out of school, don't
play sports, fail to learn, end up pregnant and vulnerable to
assault or commit criminal behavior. It's pot and beer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton applauded the survey results. ``These findings
prove that we are successfully reversing dangerous trends and
making important progress. However, none of us can afford to let
down our guard in the fight against drug, tobacco and alcohol abuse
_ especially when it comes to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, HHS released a separate report that monitors
emergency room visits by people injured by drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, there were 554,932 drug-related hospital emergency
department episodes in the United States. That number has remained
fairly constant for the past five years, HHS officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But among 12- to 17-year-olds, drug-related emergency department
visits dropped 11 percent from 1998 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a decade, more people using marijuana and
hashish visited emergency rooms than using heroin and
morphine-based drugs. Experts said that underscored the growing
potency of the marijuana being produced.
</P>
<P>
   One finding in the study appeared to question the long held
belief that cigarettes are a ``gateway'' to the use of illegal
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that the states with the highest rates of
teen-age smoking, including North Carolina, Kentucky, Indiana,
Oklahoma and West Virginia, all have very low or below average
rates of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the findings put into question a connection
between cigarette use and later drug use, Shalala said, ``I simply
would come to no conclusion there. And I have never made any
connection between the two.''

MARKETS CLIMB AS INFLATION FEARS EBB 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Responding to fresh signs that the Federal Reserve
may be able to avoid further interest rate increases, investors
pushed stock prices up briskly Thursday, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index approaching a record high.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported that factory orders declined 7.5 percent
in July, the biggest decline on record, and another report showed
that industry in the Chicago area contracted in August to the
lowest point since 1996. The nation's merchants also reported that
sales in August rose only 3 percent, below analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The data suggest that six interest rate increases by Fed policy
makers since June 1999 may be taking hold and slowing the economy,
which could ease the central bank's concern about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of brokerage firms and other financial companies were
standouts Thursday, continuing to benefit from this week's bid by
Credit Suisse for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. J.P. Morgan leaped
$15.38, to $167.25, accounting for most of a 112.09-point gain in
the Dow Jones industrial average that reversed Wednesday's decline.
The Dow closed up 1 percent, to 11,215.10. It is now down 2.5
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the better general performance was in the Nasdaq composite
index, which has made gains in 13 of the last 15 sessions. It
soared 102.54 points, or 2.5 percent, to 4,206.35.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is more pleased about what steady interest rates
mean for valuations than worried about what a slower economy will
do to earnings,'' said Byron R. Wien, chief U.S. strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 advanced 15.09 points, or 1 percent, to 1,517.68,
giving it a 3.3 percent gain for year. Of its components, 306 rose
while 167 fell and 27 were unchanged. It is now just 10 points shy
of its record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not excited by the performance of the Dow, but I am
excited by the S&AMP;P and Nasdaq creeping up'' out of established
trading ranges, said Michael Strauss, managing director of
Commonfund, which invests college endowments.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought the markets were encouraged by the
post-convention bounce in the polls by Al Gore, the Democratic
presidential nominee, because it suggested maintenance of the
political status quo in Washington assuming Republicans maintain
their majority in Congress. ``Divided government is better for
financial markets,'' Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Andrew Brooks of T. Rowe Price, were reluctant
to seek trends in a preholiday summer period. ``It's easy to push
stocks around this week because a lot of people are out,'' he said.
Some investors were no doubt engaged in month-end transactions,
while others remained on the sidelines awaiting Friday's report on
the August labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Volume did perk up, with 1.07 billion changing hands on the New
York Stock Exchange compared with 818.4 million on Wednesday.
Advancing issues there outnumbered declining ones by 1,727 to
1,156, while 137 stocks made new 52-week highs and 29 slumped to
new lows.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, which has lost about one-fifth of its value over the last
three weeks, was among the day's most prominent casualties. The
automaker, caught up in a huge tire recall and found by a court in
California to have knowingly installed faulty ignitions, dropped as
low as $23.81 before closing at $24.25, down $1.63.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stocks continued to sag, with Target skidding $2.88, to
$23.19, after warning of a profit shortfall in the third quarter.
J.C. Penney, which said it might trim its forecast, also slumped.
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel Communications, down $5.25, to $72, and Ford were
the most heavily traded Big Board issues, with 28.5 million shares
traded for Ford, the most for the company in a single day in at
least 20 years. Dell Computer, the subject of a major article in
The Wall Street Journal, climbed $3.69, to $43.63, on Nasdaq as
64.2 million of its shares changed hands, the most of any issue.

VOLKSWAGEN MEXICO IN ACCORD WITH UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (No byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Workers at Volkswagen Mexico negotiated a raise of
more than double the inflation rate, ending a two-week battle that
included a walkout at their factory in Puebla, the only one in the
world that produces trendy Beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders hailed the settlement. But some economists
expressed concern that the 21 percent increase could set off a wave
of excessive wage proposals by increasingly aggressive unions and
threaten efforts to control inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The company agreed to raise salaries 13 percent and give workers
a 5 percent productivity bonus plus a 3 percent increase in
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The union's general secretary, Jose Luis Rodriguez, said, ``We
think that salaries should not be based on inflation, but the
performance of the workers and the results of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the workers are the highest paid in the industry, they
had earned an average $2.30 an hour. VW workers in Germany earn an
average $27 an hour, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   The accord is increasing concern that the raise might become a
benchmark for other unions, with increases that far exceed the
inflation rate. ``It is most likely that other labor unions are
going to try to follow this example,'' the director of Grupo
Economistas y Asociados, Mauricio Gonzalez Gomez, said. ``But it
might not be a healthy signal. We are running the risk of starting
off an inflationary spiral.''

ANTHONY CORALLO, MOB BOSS KNOWN AS `TONY DUCKS,' DIES IN PRISON AT
87 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)   By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anthony Corallo, the salty and stoical former boss of the
Lucchese crime family who went to jail for life after the
authorities overheard him chatting to his driver about the mob's
control of New York City's construction industry, died Aug. 23rd in
a federal prison hospital in Springfield, Mo. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Corallo, who was serving a 100-year sentence, was said to be the
oldest living gangster to have risen from one of the city's five
organized crime families. He was a sitting member of the Mafia
politburo, known as the commission, when he was arrested in 1985. A
year later, he was found guilty on federal racketeering charges at
what came to be known as the commission trial _ a 10-week
smorgasbord of gangland lore that resulted in the conviction of the
city's top crime leaders. It also paved the way for a new era of
crime leader, a more rough-and-tumble crew of underlings, like John
Gotti, who dressed in a flashy way and seemed to bask in the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Corallo, known to mobsters and federal agents alike as Tony
Ducks _ because of his knack for ducking subpoenas and convictions
_ was widely regarded as an old-time don, a crusty but gentle son
of La Cosa Nostra, who believed in honor, staked his reputation on
his word, adored his family and considered loose lips a treachery
worse than murder.
</P>
<P>
   It was in some ways curious, then, that investigators captured
hours of conversation between him and his driver, Salvatore
Avellino Jr., by planting a listening device inside the dashboard
of Avellino's black Jaguar as it sat in a parking lot of the
Huntington Town House, a Long Island catering hall, in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The taped conversations became one of the primary building
blocks of the federal case against Corallo and two other Mafia
bosses _ Anthony Salerno of the Genovese family, who was known as
Fat Tony, and Carmine Persico of the Colombo family, known as
Junior _ as well as five other gangland counselors and underbosses
during the commission trial.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more dramatic allegations against Corallo and some of
his co-defendants was the charge of conspiracy to murder Carmine
Galante, the head of the Bonanno family, and two associates in
1979. They were killed in a hail of gunfire as they ate lunch on
the patio of a Brooklyn restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The commission trial, which opened in U.S. District Court in New
York City on Sept. 9, 1986, and ended on Nov. 19, 1986, was a sort
of Waterloo for the New York mob. No previous trial had ever
focused directly on the highest levels of Mafia leadership, and
some investigators have said that the five families never truly
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Corallo was born in 1913 and raised in East Harlem,
N.Y., where he worked, at least for a while, as a tile-setter. He
rose in the ranks of a Lucchese family that was governed at the
time by Gaitano, or Tommy, Lucchese, whose illicit businesses from
gambling and loan-sharking to truck hijacking and labor
racketeering were centered in the Bronx. When Lucchese died of
cancer in 1967, Corallo was the early favorite to be his successor.
</P>
<P>
   But Corallo did not immediately get the job. He was in prison
for bribing James L. Marcus, then the New York City water
commissioner, in exchange for contracts to clean and repair parts
of the city's enormous water reservoir system. Carmine Tramunti was
installed as the Lucchese boss, but when Traumunti himself was
arrested a few years later, Corallo took over.
</P>
<P>
   Corallo's reign atop the Lucchese family was marked by an
interest in labor racketeering, particularly in the private
trash-hauling business and in million-dollar Manhattan construction
projects. According to federal wiretap transcripts, Avellino once
told his boss that they were being followed in the car, probably
because the authorities believed that Corallo controlled the
toxic-waste disposal industry. Corallo gave a simple response.
``They're right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Corallo continued the Lucchese family's
longstanding penchant for shying away from the limelight. In a time
when a mob boss' suit could light up a room, he was given to
wearing gray cardigan sweaters, one former investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chertoff, the lead prosecutor on the commission trial,
who later became the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said Corallo was
as stoical as they came. ``He was very impassive in court, unlike
some of the other defendants, who, at least, would kid around a
bit,'' he said. ``He sat there like one of these big stone idols.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ronald Goldstock, the former director of the New
York State organized crime task force who spent nearly a year
listening to the secret tapes from Avellino's car, Corallo never
really became acclimated to the flashier, more publicized world of
the mob that emerged in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time he ascended,'' Goldstock said, ``bosses tended to
be insulated, prison sentences were fairly minimal and people who
rose to his level were tested. They were trained and they were
proven. But by the time the '80s rolled around everything had
changed. The new people didn't grow out of the gangs of Little
Italy or Brooklyn. They were untested and untrained.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Corallo, who spoke on the condition that they not be
named, said he enjoyed pasta, opera and working in the garden
outside his home on Long Island. They said he cherished his privacy
and that his family was the dearest thing to him in the world.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son and a daughter, they said.

PENTAGON LIKELY TO POSTPONE NEXT MISSILE DEFENSE TEST UNTIL
JANUARY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon will probably postpone the next test
of a national missile defense system until January, administration
officials said Thursday. Any decision to deploy the anti-missile
shield now seems certain to pass out of President Clinton's hands
and to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had previously said Clinton would
decide this summer on deploying a $60 billion anti-missile system
that would be ready by 2005. To meet that schedule, the Pentagon
has been under heavy pressure for two years to conduct enough
flights to show Clinton and his advisers whether the system was
technologically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   But now officials are signaling that Clinton merely plans to
decide whether to move ahead with the program's initial
development. The change follows a string of events that include
test failures, opposition from Russia as well as European allies
and a legal dispute over how far the system could proceed before
violating an important arms control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   To keep that option of initial development open for Clinton, the
Pentagon has requested bids for initial construction of a radar
site in Alaska, setting Sept. 7 as the deadline for technical and
cost proposals from contractors. The first contracts would have to
awarded by December to permit building to begin next spring and to
have a working system in place by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The more politically volatile decision of whether to field the
system _ and break the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 _
would be left to the next administration, whether that of Al Gore
or George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of this political evolution, senior military officers,
including the program's executive officer, Maj. Gen. Willie Nance
of the Army, have argued that there is now no reason to rush more
tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Nance is not going to conduct a test unless he's fully
confident that everything is fully ready for the test,'' said Lt.
Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is awaiting a recommendation from Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen on the project, and the issue could come to a head
as early as next week. Among the issues that Cohen is weighing are
the costs of building the system, the building schedule and the
need for more tests.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Cohen delayed his recommendation, primarily because
of a dispute between the Pentagon and the State Department over how
far work on the limited missile shield could proceed before the
United States would be required to give notice that it was
withdrawing from the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has vigorously opposed changing the treaty to allow the
United States to field even a limited defense, fearing that it
would be prelude to a larger system that would undermine Moscow's
long-range nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen told the Senate Armed Services Committee in July that
administration lawyers had reached a consensus that building the
radar station on Shemya Island at the western edge of the Aleutians
could continue until 2002 before the United States would be in
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers at the State Department and National Security
Council oppose that interpretation, arguing that it is unilateral
and sure to anger the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats doubt that the decision from Cohen or the White
House would come next week, saying that the administration would
want to avoid a confrontation over missile defense during a United
Nations gathering of world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen suggested in August that the next test of the system could
slip from October or November, to December. But military officials
said today that date would probably fall into January.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon technical experts are still analyzing why a high-speed
interceptor that was supposed to destroy a dummy warhead on July 7
failed to separate from its booster rocket. Officials have
attributed the cause to an error in the rocket's ``databus'' that
transmits electrical signals to the warhead.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the test range at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall
Islands is closed for much of December, and associates say Nance is
inclined to give his staff a breather after their breakneck pace
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials insist that the testing program has enough
flexibility built in to absorb the delays. But the Defense
Department's top testing official, Phil Coyle, warned top Pentagon
officials in an August 11 report that the system could not reach
its 2005 goal because testing is behind schedule and will not
include realistic decoy targets for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A more aggressive testing program will be necessary to achieve
an effective capability by 2005 or for even several years
thereafter,'' Coyle said in an analysis that was first reported
this week by Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said Coyle ``is
supposed to be an independent voice, but that does not change our
goal. If directed to do so we're shooting for 2005.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials have warned that the United States could
face a threat from some countries, including North Korea, by that
date.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, some Pentagon officials are questioning the
schedule in light of test failures and delays in building a new
booster rocket for the missile interceptors. '
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always admitted that this was a high-risk program, and
part of being high risk is the deployment date,'' the Pentagon's
chief spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said in August. ``We will try our
best, we have been trying our best, and we may meet the deployment
date.''

NADER BRINGS HIS CAMPAIGN TO NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ralph Nader, running for president as the Green Party
nominee, railed against big business from the heart of corporate
America Thursday, crisscrossing Manhattan to condemn environmental
pollution, the exploitation of workers and the abuse of taxpayer
dollars through ``corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   He also dismissed his opponents, Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, as candidates whose similarities (favoring
businesses over workers, in Nader's view, and taking millions from
corporate donors) outweighed their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, the consumer advocate whose long-shot candidacy has
received comparatively little national media attention, began his
salvos from a prominent platform: a morning interview with Matt
Lauer on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are different in a few areas, but the rhetoric is more
different than the reality,'' Nader said of Bush and Gore on
``Today,'' as about 300 people milled about on a Rockefeller Center
sidewalk outside the studio. Some held signs demanding that the
major candidates open the presidential debates to Nader and the
Reform Party candidate, Pat Buchanan. Two men made the point by
wearing chicken suits to represent Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Today,'' Nader gave a separate interview on NBC's cable
cousin, MSNBC, then crossed the street to the headquarters of the
network's corporate parent, General Electric, where he criticized
the company for polluting the Hudson River. He also attacked Gore
and Bush for taking contributions from the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for General Electric to obey the law and pay for
its poisoning of the Hudson River and stop lying and deceiving the
public about the dangers,'' Nader said, referring to GE's legal
discharge of PCBs into the Hudson until 1977, when the chemicals
were banned by the federal government. He called for Bush and Gore
to give back the money their campaigns had received from GE.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Nader went to the Bowery, where he protested with
union workers at the New Silver Palace Restaurant, a 900-seat dim
sum parlor and banquet hall that once was the only unionized
restaurant in Chinatown. Former employees have waged a three-year
battle with the restaurant's management, which has been accused by
federal labor officials of antiunion hiring practices.
</P>
<P>
   Nader finished his campaign day on Wall Street, where he
criticized the city and state of New York for offering
multimillion-dollar tax breaks and other incentives to persuade
companies like the New York Stock Exchange to stay in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is this bastion of global capitalism on welfare,'' Nader
said, after taking a private tour of the Stock Exchange. ``Hundreds
of millions of taxpayer dollars in order to build them a new
building, at the same time hundreds of neighborhoods are suffering
from inadequate funding of their vital needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said that such ``corporate welfare'' was emblematic of the
problems of America's current two-party political system. Nader's
candidacy is widely seen less as an attempt to capture the White
House in November than an effort to influence the public debate.
</P>
<P>
   At various points since announcing his candidacy, it appeared
that Nader could garner a high enough percentage of the vote _
mostly from Gore _ in several key states, including California and
Michigan, to push Bush ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But recent polls have suggested that Nader's moment appears to
be fading, given Gore's surge in the polls after the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Field poll released last week showed that Nader
was supported by 4 percent of California voters, compared with 7
percent in a similar survey in June.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's swing through New York City Thursday followed a series
of fund-raisers and appearances on the East End of Long Island on
Wednesday. Earlier in the week, he and his running mate, Winona
LaDuke, staged a boisterous rally in Portland, Ore., that drew more
than 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   At his Manhattan appearances, Nader was trailed by small but
loyal bands of supporters: college and high school students,
environmentalists and those who said they were concerned about the
influence of large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how much of a threat he is to Bush and Gore,''
said David Joseph, 33, a master's student in French at Hunter
College, outside the NBC studios Thursday morning. ``I want to see
something new, something fresh in the debates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Welfare reform, for example, would not be discussed in the
same fashion if Nader were not in the debates,'' said Joseph, a
registered Democrat who said he would vote for Nader in November.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rogovin, 59, of River Vale, N.J., who moved off the steps
of a building for Nader's Wall Street news conference, said he
would probably not vote for Nader, but was happy to see him in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is man for the people,'' Rogovin said. ``I don't believe he
will get elected or get a chance to debate the two power brokers.
Think, he would act as devil's advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why, Rogovin said, he answered, ``By all means'' when
Nader asked if he could use the steps.

 &HT;    Chorus rising for broader tire recall
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tire dealer Andy Maughon said he initially doubted the
need for a recall on millions of Firestone tires but not any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to get worse. This is escalating,'' said the owner
of Bulldog Tire Co. in Snellville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way Bridgestone/Firestone and Ford Motor Co. see
it.
</P>
<P>
   They maintain they've identified the 6.5 million tires that
needed replacing in a voluntary recall announced Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Like other metro Atlanta dealers, Maughon said the pace of tire
replacements slowed this week. But he predicted that may reverse.
</P>
<P>
   He said he recently replaced 16-inch Firestone tires _ which are
not part of the recall _ on a Ford Explorer. He said he did so
because they showed separating tread similar to the recalled tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mouth flew open. You could see the steel belt actually
protruding out of the tire,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was skeptical. Now, yes, I think there's a
problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The recall covers certain 15-inch ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT
tires that were installed on Ford sport-utility vehicles and
pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The models are all P235/75 R15 Firestone ATX and ATX II tires
made since 1991 and P235/75R15 Wilderness AT tires manufactured
since 1996 at Firestone's Decatur, Ill., plant.
</P>
<P>
   The latter tires are identified by a code number starting with
``VD.'' The serial number is only visible on the tire sidewall from
underneath the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Those tires ``are considerably over-represented'' in incidents
of tread separations and blowouts involving the Ford vehicles, said
Bridgestone/Firestone spokesman Walt Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   He said other models and sizes did not show abnormal numbers of
failures, according to Firestone's and Ford's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind that tires are consumable products. All tires
fail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer safety advocates such as Public Citizen and
Safetyforum.com (www.safetyforum.com) say the problems may be due
to a wider design defect.
</P>
<P>
   They have called for Firestone to expand its recall to include
16-inch tires and all 15-inch Wilderness tires, not just those made
at the Decatur factory.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration,
Georgia and other states say they are investigating and haven't
ruled out ordering a wider recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are receiving calls on other tires,'' said NHTSA
spokeswoman Liz Neblett.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to do the investigation despite the fact that
Firestone has done the recall. We are investigating to ensure that
the scope of the recall is adequate and that it addresses all the
safety issues with all of the tires.''
</P>
<P>
   According to complaint data on the Firestone tires from NHTSA's
Web site (www.nhtsa.gov), tire sizes other than 15 inches account
for about 5 percent of the 739 complaints the agency received
through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilderness and ATX tires accounted for the large majority of the
complaints, but the tire size was not identified in almost 80
percent of the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   California, Texas and Florida had the largest number of
complaints.

 &HT;    U.S. agency orders UT Medical Branch to halt prisoner enrollment
in 195 research projects
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By LEIGH HOPPER
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under orders from the federal agency that oversees patient
safety, the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston has
halted prisoner enrollment in 195 research projects because of
alleged lapses in procedures that protect inmate patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interpretation was we were in compliance (with federal
regulations) and their interpretation questions whether we were in
compliance,'' said Wayne Patterson, director of UTMB's ethical
oversight committee on patient research. ``We look forward to
discussing that with them and we will make whatever revisions are
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   UTMB said the investigation was prompted after university
officials attended a conference at Brown University on ethical
guidelines for research involving prisoners. An attendee wrote to
the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) questioning
whether current clinical trials involving prisoners comply with
federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   All of the research projects, which are open to nonprisoners as
well, are continuing; only enrollment of prisoners has been
suspended, Patterson said. He said he knew of no inmates being
dropped from current studies. Twenty-five studies involving 99
prisoners with HIV infection were allowed to continue because the
studies were deemed to be in the best interest of the inmates'
health.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent July 10, the OHRP sharply criticized the
university on several fronts. UTMB provides health care to the
majority of Texas prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the university provided ``scant
evidence'' that it thoroughly reviews medical research involving
prisoners. The letter also stated that UTMB's effort to include a
suitable prisoner representative on the ethical oversight committee
was ``insufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials also pointed out an instance where an informed
consent form for an ovarian cancer project ``appeared to overstate
the ... benefit to the subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   UTMB has since responded to the allegations by letter and is
preparing for an on-site evaluation Sept. 12-14 conducted by the
OHRP, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the criticism, UTMB installed a member of the
Texas Inmate Families Association on its 35-member ethical
oversight committee, or institutional review board, last month.
Institutional review boards (IRBs) are based at research
institutions and are responsible for ensuring that people who agree
to participate in studies fully understand the nature of the
research and willingly consent to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations require that one member of the IRB ``be a
prisoner, or a prisoner representative with appropriate background
and experience.'' In the past, UTMB has used university doctors who
care for prisoners to fulfill that role.
</P>
<P>
   UTMB also forwarded additional documents in August to federal
authorities to illustrate the four-step process by which it reviews
new study proposals. Under UTMB's system, a study proposal is
assigned to a primary reviewer, who presents his or her findings to
a study group. The study group discusses it further and makes a
recommendation to a subcommittee. The subcommittee then reports to
the entire IRB which then votes on whether to approve the study.
</P>
<P>
   As for the criticism that UTMB overstated the benefits to
patients in an ovarian cancer study, the OHRP said that UTMB's
consent form states ``I understand that the potential benefit of my
participation in this study is the control of my disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said it would have been more appropriate to
say ``subjects are unlikely to benefit from this research.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Patterson said the second half of the sentence on
UTMB's consent form states ``but it is possible that my condition
my worsen despite treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difference of opinion,'' Patterson said. ``These are
not unusual questions for discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said UTMB hopes to resume research involving prisoners
after the site visit, and after study proposals have been
re-reviewed with the new prisoner representative.
</P>
<P>
   UTMB is not the only research institution under fire for its
studies involving prisoners. Federal investigators have uncovered
oversight lapses at the University of Miami, University of Florida
and Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was ordered to suspend new enrollment of inmates in one of
its projects and Florida and Yale were told to clean up their
patient-protection systems.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ralph Nader, running for president as the Green Party
nominee, railed against big business from the heart of corporate
America Thursday, crisscrossing Manhattan to condemn environmental
pollution, the exploitation of workers and the abuse of taxpayer
dollars through ``corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   He also dismissed his opponents, Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, as candidates whose similarities (favoring
businesses over workers, in Nader's view, and taking millions from
corporate donors) outweighed their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, the consumer advocate whose long-shot candidacy has
received comparatively little national media attention, began his
salvos from a prominent platform: a morning interview with Matt
Lauer on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are different in a few areas, but the rhetoric is more
different than the reality,'' Nader said of Bush and Gore on
``Today,'' as about 300 people milled about on a Rockefeller Center
sidewalk outside the studio. Some held signs demanding that the
major candidates open the presidential debates to Nader and the
Reform Party candidate, Pat Buchanan. Two men made the point by
wearing chicken suits to represent Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Today,'' Nader gave a separate interview on NBC's cable
cousin, MSNBC, then crossed the street to the headquarters of the
network's corporate parent, General Electric, where he criticized
the company for polluting the Hudson River. He also attacked Gore
and Bush for taking contributions from the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for General Electric to obey the law and pay for
its poisoning of the Hudson River and stop lying and deceiving the
public about the dangers,'' Nader said, referring to GE's legal
discharge of PCBs into the Hudson until 1977, when the chemicals
were banned by the federal government. He called for Bush and Gore
to give back the money their campaigns had received from GE.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Nader went to the Bowery, where he protested with
union workers at the New Silver Palace Restaurant, a 900-seat dim
sum parlor and banquet hall that once was the only unionized
restaurant in Chinatown. Former employees have waged a three-year
battle with the restaurant's management, which has been accused by
federal labor officials of antiunion hiring practices.
</P>
<P>
   Nader finished his campaign day on Wall Street, where he
criticized the city and state of New York for offering
multimillion-dollar tax breaks and other incentives to persuade
companies like the New York Stock Exchange to stay in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is this bastion of global capitalism on welfare,'' Nader
said, after taking a private tour of the Stock Exchange. ``Hundreds
of millions of taxpayer dollars in order to build them a new
building, at the same time hundreds of neighborhoods are suffering
from inadequate funding of their vital needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said that such ``corporate welfare'' was emblematic of the
problems of America's current two-party political system. Nader's
candidacy is widely seen less as an attempt to capture the White
House in November than an effort to influence the public debate.
</P>
<P>
   At various points since announcing his candidacy, it appeared

Michigan, to push Bush ahead.

</P>

LaDuke, staged a boisterous rally in Portland, Ore., that drew more

Nader asked if he could use the steps.

 &HT;    Across-the-board increases cap a big month for stocks
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stock market ended its best monthly performance of
the year with a broad-based rally on Thursday, prompted in part by
investment-favorable economic news.
</P>
<P>
   August was the first month in which all four major stock market
indexes were in plus territory. The Nasdaq composite gained 11.7
percent, the Russell 2000 small-stock index 7.4 percent, the Dow
Jones industrial average 6.6 percent and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The government's report on Thursday that factory orders plunged
a record 7.5 percent in July reinforced Wall Street's conviction
that the Federal Reserve will have no reason to raise interest
rates again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're past the Fed's rate-hike cycle, and ahead of us is a
healthy economy,'' said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist for
A.G. Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has boosted short-term interest rates six times over the
last 14 months to slow what it regards as inflationary economic
growth, and the strategy seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   While the economy expanded at a still-strong 5.3 percent annual
rate in the second quarter, much of the important economic news for
July and August reflected a definite slowing of activity in
manufacturing, home building and retailing, and a slip in consumer
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, inflation moved only slightly higher amid news
of stronger-than-expected productivity growth and stable wages.
</P>
<P>
   The government's important monthly job growth and unemployment
reports for August are due for release today. But their impact on
the market is likely to be subdued given the early departure of
many traders for the three-day Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With a month to go, the third quarter is shaping up as the best
three-month period of the year for the stock market, with a
favorable outlook for the fourth quarter as well.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to prospects that interest rates have peaked,
analysts base that outlook on upbeat third-quarter corporate profit
forecasts and the seasonal increase in year-end trading.
</P>
<P>
   And depending on how it goes, the presidential election in
November could give an added boost to stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The six months before an election are usually pretty good. But
since the market sputtered in June and July, that may lead to
increased momentum in the next two months,'' said Legacy South
strategist Phillip Larkins.
</P>
<P>
   Once the election is over, he added, the market will be in a
seasonally upbeat part of the year typically marked by tax-related
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and financial stocks paced the market in Thursday's
trading. The tech-loaded Nasdaq composite index rose 2.5 percent,
while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average and the broader
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 1 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens from this point on, analysts doubt that the
stock market will end the year anywhere close to the double-digit
gains that were routine in the last half of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   All the major stock indexes have rebounded from their spring
lows, but they are still just ahead for the year, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, for example, has rebounded 33 percent from its low
point in May but is just 3.4 percent above last year's close. The
Dow has rallied 14 percent from its earlier low and is still down
2.5 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, analysts who believe the stock market's worst
problems are over now look for the bull market to resume later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are correct by stating that the summer rally is not
over, then the stage will be set for an eventual upside
follow-through,'' technical analyst Ralph Acampora told Prudential
Securities clients on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rally will be an integral part of the presidential
election cycle, which suggests that the market makes new highs,''
he added. ``Thus any hesitation is a buying opportunity.''

U.S. TEAM WON'T DOMINATE SAILING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ American sailors don't harbor any misconceptions
regarding their place in the world and their chances of regaining
their country's past Olympic glory.
</P>
<P>
   They might disagree on the exact reason, but the consensus seems
to be that America's days of dominating the Olympic sailing
competition are over. In Atlanta, the U.S. won just two bronze
medals after winning medals in nine of 10 events in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects appear to be only slightly better for this summer
for two main reasons: organizing an Olympic campaign is becoming
too costly, and the rest of the world simply is catching up.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the sailing team's showing in 1996, I believe
calling it a poor showing is not necessarily accurate,'' said
Charlie McKee, who teams with his brother, Jonathan, in the 49er
class and won a bronze in the 470 class in the 1988 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailing has changed a great deal over the past decade,
especially in terms of many more countries having strong programs
with dedicated athletes. The net result is that no country is
likely to dominate and ever win as many medals as the U.S. team did
in the Olympics previous to 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. downward trend is undeniable, and the only question is
whether it is also irreversible. High-quality sailors remain in the
national program, but their numbers are decreasing.
</P>
<P>
   One of those top sailors, 44-year-old Mark Reynolds of San
Diego, teams with Magnus Liljedahl in the Star division and
represents perhaps America's only chance at a gold medal in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The pair won gold in the World Championships this year and are
top-ranked in the world but have spent a good part of the past few
years seeking monetary contributions to fund their Olympic effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 10 years,'' Reynolds said, ``the professional
sailing opportunities have grown, so many of the top U.S. sailors
are no longer sailing Olympic boats, or if they do, they are not
putting the time into them that they really need to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our top U.S. sailors can now get paid to sail non-Olympic
boats, where as they have to pay to sail Olympic boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds and Mike Gebhardt, who compete in the Mistral category,
will become the first Americans to sail in four Olympic Games, but
there is also a measure of redemption surrounding Reynolds' return
to the Olympic stage.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Reynolds and Hal Haenel tried to defend their
Star gold in Atlanta, but finished eighth. Shortly thereafter,
Reynolds connected with Liljedahl, a native of Sweden, and the two
have been on a roll recently, highlighted by the gold in the World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is certainly to win the gold medal, and we feel we
have a good chance to do that,'' Reynolds said. ``It still comes
down to sailing a good regatta. You have good ones and you have bad
ones. You can't win them all. I had a bad one four years ago, and
we've worked on our weak points and hope that if the opportunity
presents itself we will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very fortunate to get teamed with Magnus. Magnus is a
great helmsman himself and competed at a world level in the Finn
class, so he has a good understanding of the overall picture. He's
a very strong guy, which is important, but also more importantly,
he has a very strong desire to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The present success of U.S. sailing depends largely on Reynolds
and Liljedahl, but what about the future? Of the 18 sailors on the
U.S. team, 12 are at least 35 years old, including Reynolds (44)
and Liljedahl (46).
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have plenty of competitive sailing left,'' Reynolds
said, ``although we might have to work a bit harder at it now. We
are very interested in defending our World Championship next year.
Bill Buchan was 49 when he won his gold medal (in 1992), so I'm
already thinking about Athens.''

 &HT;    Federal judge sets ground rules for Georgia Power race bias suit
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal judge in the racial discrimination lawsuit
against Georgia Power Co. set ground rules Thursday for
communications with employees who are prospects to join a class
action.
</P>
<P>
   Under an order issued by U.S. District Judge Orinda D. Evans,
lawyers for the seven employees who brought the suit are free to
discuss the case with other employees who initiate contact with
them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Georgia Power management can discuss the case
with any employee who initiates contact to provide assistance with
the company's defense. The company can also discuss the case with
management employees who have not sued the company if their
responsibilities make them necessary for the company's case.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company was proscribed from contacting any
prospective class member for purposes of discouraging participation
in the case, the company retains the right to keep employees
informed about the status of the case.
</P>
<P>
   No limitations will be placed on either side's rights to speak
with the news media, so long as it does not use the press to
solicit participation or discourage participation in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines parallel those issued in a similar lawsuit filed
against Coca-Cola Co. in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed July 27 by three Georgia Power employees
alleges the utility and its parent, Southern Co., foster a
``pattern of discriminating against African-Americans'' who work
there and show ``reckless indifference'' to a racially hostile
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status to represent
2,100 African-American employees.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, four more employees of Georgia Power and other
Southern Co. subsidiaries have joined the lawsuit. In addition,
more than 300 African-American employees have contacted attorneys
for the employees who sued about the lawsuit, the attorneys say.
</P>
<P>
   Federal court rules in the Northern District of Georgia
generally prohibit both sides from communicating with prospective
class-action lawsuit members without court approval.

OUTSIDE CONFERENCE, PAC-10'S BEEN NOT SO ROSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the new national pastime - dump on the
Pacific- 10 Conference. Take your best shots now, because truth is,
they're fairly defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   Just how are you supposed to defend yourself after last year's
1-4 bowl record, which included losses to Wake Forest and Hawaii? A
postseason record that just happened to match the previous year's
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to rally the troops around a 20-18 nonconference record,
which included victories over Boise State, Idaho and Nevada. The
conference champ, Stanford, was pasted 69-17 by Texas and also was
knocked off by not-so-mighty San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   Conference spirit waned. If Pac-10 morale was any lower, it'd be
the Russian Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty apparent the whole conference didn't do very well
last year,'' said Cal coach Tom Holmoe. ``It was a down year. I
think you can't just say, 'Hey, don't worry about it. It's
something that will change.' It's won't automatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Things got off to an oh-so embarrassing start last year when
Arizona, ranked fourth going into the Kickoff Classic against Penn
State, was pummeled 41-7 on national TV. Think the East Coast was
sneering?
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough thing for us last year was, we didn't get off to a
very good start,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``What happened to
Arizona, everybody kind of looked at and made more out of than they
probably should have. Then, of course, the Rose Bowl game at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, at least Stanford gave Michigan a game. Losing in the Rose
Bowl, however, is nothing new for the Pac-10. It hasn't won one
since 1995. It's lost seven of the last eight.
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, there is reason for optimism. On Sunday, USC
went to the Kickoff Classic to play Penn State and returned the
favor of last year with a 29-5 thumping.
</P>
<P>
   Beano Cook, ESPN college football analyst, said last year was
simply a temporary condition, not a permanent conference
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets too excited if a conference has one great year,
and gets down if a conference has one bad year,'' Cook said.
``Before you do trends, you have to wait five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pac-10 had a bad year, that's all. The year before they
had pretty good year. UCLA was in the running to play for the
national title until they lost to Miami - a game they probably
would have won if played when originally scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said there are simply too many good athletes in California
for the Pac-10 to suddenly start looking like the Mid-American
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pac-10 coaches can't help noticing top California kids who
sign with out-of-state schools. Last year, highly regarded
California prospects D.J. Williams (Miami), Chris Rix (Florida
State), Travis Johnson (Florida State), Casey Clausen (Tennessee)
and Zac Wasserman (Penn State) all spurned the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the one thing that's important is that we have not
been able to keep the West Coast players on the West Coast,''
Hackett said. ``That's something that has been disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really starts with recruiting,'' Holmoe said. ``We're
losing too many kids from California and L.A. specifically - to
outside the West.''
</P>
<P>
   It's part chicken-and-the-egg material, though, because it's a
lot easier to recruit when you're winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the recruiting lists and see some good athletes from
the West Coast leaving to go to the Midwest, East or the South,
which always leads to a cry here,'' said assistant Pac-10
commissioner Jim Muldoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you really take a close took at it, you see it happen
the other way, too, where people are coming in here from Texas and
the South. I don't think you can say there's a talent drain. It's
become much more fluid nationally than it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but last year no school in the Pac-10 made most of the
national top-10 recruiting lists. The conference mostly treaded
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably somewhere in the middle of the pack, as far as the
nation is concerned,'' Hackett said. ``It's not on the bottom end
at all, but I don't know that we'd be in the elite area.''
</P>
<P>
   Muldoon said part of the reason for last season's failures can
be attributed to the schedule. Most of the top nonconference
opponents Ohio State, Texas, Michigan, Penn State, Notre Dame -
came on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year that reverses a little bit,'' he said. ``We have the
likes of Michigan and Ohio State and Texas coming here. So that
might help.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the answers about Pac-10 rebound could be coming in the
first month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find out early,'' Cook said. ``USC plays Penn State and
Colorado. UCLA plays Alabama and Michigan. Washington plays
Colorado. Arizona plays Ohio State. We find out early.''
</P>
<P>
   And another thing, coaches say: Two years ago, the Pac-10 was
awash in top quarterbacks Akili Smith, Cade McNown, Brock Huard,
and just a year removed from Ryan Leaf. Last year, babes led them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had good teams led by good quarterbacks, and the Pac-10's
always been a conference where the quarterbacks have a lot to do
with the success of the offense,'' Holmoe said. ``Last year was a
down year for quarterbacks. Todd Husak was a very good one, and
there's a few others that had decent years, but none at a national
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last season Stanford's Husak was the only Pac-10
quarterback to crack the top 25 in national passing efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Pac-10 supporters say, the conference looked worse than it
actually was last year because it has so many good teams. Or at
least, pretty good. All this equality doesn't sell nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a national perspective, from a ranking perspective,
you're much better off to have three or four dominant teams just
kick the hell out of the others,'' Muldoon said. ``Your strength is
perceived by your top teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmoe said some teams annually ranked in the Top 10 may benefit
from playing in a lopsided league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some of the schools in their conference are not very
good,'' he said. ``I know in our conference, the coaches feel that
they go into every game thinking it's a battle. I think the Pac-10
Conference might be more balanced than any conference in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow during this Pac-10 decline, some coaches have decided
the training table is an issue. In most conferences, players are
allowed to be fed a meal throughout the school year. In the Pac-10,
it is only during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think it's not even an issue, they're saying it's
an excuse,'' Holmoe said. ``But when we go into a home against a
school, they'll use it against us - so that is an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   This season the Pac-10 again has the look of a balanced
conference set to underwhelm voters. In the preseason Associated
Press poll, Washington (13th) and USC (15th) were the only
conference selections. Sports Illustrated, in a ranking of
conferences, listed the Pac-10 fifth, behind the ACC and ahead of
the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously lost a lot of games last year,'' Muldoon said.
``We are hopeful it is a one-year aberration and a cyclical type of
deal rather than a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Few, though, are predicting some kind of dramatic turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm not sure there's a corner being turned,''
Hackett said. ``I don't sense that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a little cause for concern,'' Holmoe said. ``I
feel we do need to look at it as more than just something that was
an illusion, something that was maybe cyclical.''
</P>
<P>
   No one questions, however, the way to turn things around: Make
like USC against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make up a lot of excuses,'' Holmoe said. ``We
just have to win games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand there are some issues that will help, but that's
not why we've struggled. We've just go to do it, and there's no one
else to blame but ourselves.''

BRUINS CONTINUE TO MAKE MOVES IN RIGHT DIRECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There is no Heisman campaign. There are few TV
cameras and only a handful of print reporters at Spaulding Field.
There is no talk of national championships; in fact, there's little
talk of rankings.
</P>
<P>
   And there is positively no buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be just two years since the UCLA football team was
captivating the Southland by rolling to 20 consecutive victories
with its high-scoring offense and its high-wire defense?
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were big box office back then.
</P>
<P>
   Actor James Caan attended practices, ESPN brought its ``Game
Day'' crew to the Rose Bowl for a UCLA game for the first time, and
lampposts around West L.A. were adorned with Cade McNown banners.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins sold 20,000 walk-up tickets for a game against
Washington - a development so unexpected it tied up pregame traffic
for hours - and in 1998 they shattered the school's
season-attendance record.
</P>
<P>
   After each home victory, UCLA coach Bob Toledo marveled at how
great it was to have a home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when the Bruins open the 2000 season Saturday at the Rose
Bowl against No. 3-ranked Alabama, there will be so many Crimson
Tide fans - perhaps as many as 25,000 - that it may be hard to tell
if the game is in Pasadena or Tuscaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year and a half, UCLA has been devastated by
injuries, endured the messy departure of defensive coordinator Nick
Aliotti and been scarred by the handicapped parking scandal. If
Florida or Nebraska have a down year, it's 7-4. But since the
Bruins strutted into the Orange Bowl to play Miami less than 20
months ago, they've won just four of 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has gone from burgeoning national power to a basketball
school.
</P>
<P>
   So, as Toledo fields the first team comprised entirely of his
recruits, the question facing his program is this: Can the Bruins
get their groove back?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's headed in the right direction,'' Toledo said,
pointing to recruiting classes that were rated 24th, 6th and 1st in
the nation the past three years by SuperPrep magazine. ``If you
look at our seniors, 11 seniors were on scholarship until I gave
some of the walk-ons scholarships (in fall camp). And if you look
at the depth chart, only five or six are going to play a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of good young people in the program who have
played and are going to play this year. We have the quarterback
established and, if we keep improving, I think we have a chance to
make a heck of a run this year and next year.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no questioning the talent. Tailback DeShaun Foster,
receivers Brian Poli-Dixon and Freddie Mitchell, tight end Mike
Seidman, linebacker Robert Thomas, defensive end Kenyon Coleman and
defensive tackle Ken Kocher have the skills that the NFL covets.
</P>
<P>
   But Coleman is the only senior among the group, the only one who
has played an entire season and the only one who has achieved so
much as all-Pac-10 second-team status.
</P>
<P>
   If that group is injury free, gives the Bruins veteran
leadership and plays to its ability, the Bruins could be much, much
better.
</P>
<P>
   But even quarterback Cory Paus, a sophomore whom the Bruins are
counting on heavily for leadership and steady play, isn't sure
where the program stands.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes it's probably not where it was two or three years
ago when the Bruins were a Skip Hicks fumble against Tennessee and
a couple of official's calls - Jermaine Lewis spotted short of the
goal line against Washington State and Brad Melsby's fumble against
Miami - from playing in back-to-back national championship games.
</P>
<P>
   But neither are they as bad as last season when they scored more
than seven points just once in the final five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where we are because we haven't played yet,''
Paus said. ``Last year was really bad. You're always going to have
injuries, but we had so many and we weren't that deep. I know we're
better than last year, but only time will tell how much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon kept a newspaper photo of himself - down on a knee
staring at the mad celebration by Miami players and fans - on his
bedroom wall last year as motivation. It's gone now and so, too, is
the hangover.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team's right on the bubble,'' he said, dismissing the
notion that underclass-laden Bruins are a year away from returning
to national prominence. ``We've got a lot of potential, all the
keys, all the tools. It's a matter of how much we want it and how
well we execute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is now. We said last year how we had a young team.
Now we've got everybody coming back. There's no excuses. We're not
a young team anymore. We're ready to come in and kick some butt.''

WHAT NOW FOR USC?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A few minutes after getting throttled by USC 29-5,
Penn State coach Joe Paterno quickly pulled out one of his favorite
cliches to describe his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not as good as you think you are when you win, and not
as bad as you think you are when you lose,'' the venerable coach
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe USC should be listening, too. The Trojans are sky-high
after routing the Nittany Lions, but it's still just one game, much
like last year's 62-7 victory over Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   USC proceeded to lose six of its next eight games following that
dominating performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Penn State victory was clearly an excellent launching pad to
the season, but more will be known when USC faces Colorado on
Saturday at the Coliseum. It's something coach Paul Hackett has
been stressing all summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't really have an idea of where we are until two or
three games into the season,'' Hackett said. ``It's going to take
that long.''
</P>
<P>
   With that said, let's analyze the Trojans' position-by-position
as they enjoy a bye week following the Kickoff Classic. &QL; 
Quarterback
</P>
<P>
   No one should get too anxious about Carson Palmer's sluggish
start. He's still the single most important player on the team, and
the unspoken leader. Everyone draws extra confidence when he's
playing, which is something that immediately disappeared when he
became injured last season.
</P>
<P>
   Once the rust goes away from sitting out last season, Palmer
should be fine. As usual, Mike Van Raaphorst is the backup and true
freshman Matt Cassel of Chatsworth High will be the No.3
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Cassel is headed for a redshirt season, but he will make every
road trip in case of emergency. &QL; 
Running backs
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest question mark on the team before the season,
but sophomore Sultan McCullough's MVP performance in the Kickoff
Classic (128 yards) seems to have allayed fears USC would not have
a reliable tailback.
</P>
<P>
   But the Trojans still have not seen junior Malaefou MacKenzie at
his best, limited to three carries because of an injured hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Petros Papadakis is back as the short-yardage specialist,
meaning true freshman Chris Howard will probably redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   A surprise this season could be sophomore Chad Pierson running
the ball out of the single-back formation. Junior Charlie Landrigan
is the blocking back and will occasionally catch a pass out of the
backfield. &QL; 
Wide receivers
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Kelly, the Pacific-10 Conference Freshman of the Year,
will be double-teamed all season. But he's still the offense's
jewel, a game-breaker who must see the ball at least 10 times a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Marcell Allmond has locked up the other starting job
and has the hands to become a dependable receiver. After that,
things become more muddled. Sophomore Steve Stevenson is just now
coming back from a hamstring injury, and senior Matt Nickels earned
a scholarship in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't surprise anyone, though, if true freshman Keary
Colbert becomes the No.3 receiver. &QL; 
Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   Besides running back, this is the other major concern, but
again, the Penn State game turned out to be nice opening effort.
They certainly committed fewer penalties in the opener than has
been normal for USC linemen the previous four years.
</P>
<P>
   Senior center Eric Denmon is the heart of the line, while
sophomore guard Zach Wilson might be the most talented. Junior
Faaesea Mailo has emerged as an impact player, stealing the right
tackle position.
</P>
<P>
   The key will be whether the inspirational high of the opener can
be sustained over the course of the season. And whether the false
starts and holding penalties will also remain memories. &QL; 
Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have six players who have started in their career.
Senior defensive tackle Ennis Davis is clogging up the middle and
demanding double coverage, while junior Ryan Nielsen was one of the
Trojans' most improved players last season.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, senior Matt Childers says little but plays hard
and is the most consistent of the ends. He's backed up by senior
Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed, who has been a part-time starter in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   The other end spot is even stronger, as senior Sultan
Abdul-Malik returns after a year at linebacker, and junior Lonnie
Ford is coming off his best season and will split time with Malik. &QL; 
Linebackers
</P>
<P>
   Senior Zeke Moreno might be the best player on the team, and
most dominating. He's also the Trojans' team leader. Senior Markus
Steele is also hoping to have a big season to propel him into the
NFL draft, but needs to stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The one mystery is junior Kori Dickerson, who is still learning
the position but is considered an upgrade over last season.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here could be if an injury occurs, and then the
talent and experience drops considerably. Otherwise, this group is
considered the heart of the defense's excellence. &QL; 
Defensive backs
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans can substitute so much here that it's difficult to
tell at times who is playing. Troy Polamalu and Ife Ohalete are the
starting safeties, but Frank Strong and DeShaun Hill could just as
easily be in the game, or even true freshman Matt Grootegoed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a depth problem that secondary coach Dennis Thurman loves
having. Cornerback is a similar story. Kris Richard and Darrell
Rideaux are the starters, but Chris Cash and Kevin Arbet play
nearly as much, and Cash will be battling Rideaux for a starting
spot all season. &QL; 
Coaching
</P>
<P>
   Hackett knows it's time to produce or else. The feeling is that
he needs nine victories and a major bowl bid, or USC could be
looking for another coach.
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett thinks he took care of any potential problems by
revamping his coaching staff, bringing in newcomers Kennedy Pola
(running backs), A.J. Christoff (linebackers) and Brian
Schottenheimer (tight ends) and placing highly respected Steve
Morton on the offensive line, which he coached for 10 years at
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After these moves, there won't be anyone else to blame if the
Trojans don't perform.!dlim!!tvspt2!Ego Check:!off! The Trojans are
bursting with confidence after Penn State, but better not be too
cocky heading into game with Buffaloes.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They're exactly where they always are in the Big
Sky Conference preseason football rankings: Nowhere near the top.
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with the Matadors of Cal State Northridge, who
are picked to finish sixth in the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   They intend to use the ranking as a rallying cry in their final
season in the conference. CSUN is moving to the Big West next
season - a nonfootball conference - leaving one final attempt to
make its mark on the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Sky (rankings) are nothing new to me,'' junior
linebacker Cos Abercrombie said. ``They always put our chips down.
Plus, we didn't have a great season last year. And especially with
the probation thing. But that makes us more hungry. I always like
the underdog. Being the underdog makes you want to prove everybody
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be better than getting the Big Sky ring now when
supposedly we can't?''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN can win the ring, all right. However, it can't accept the
postseason berth that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were placed on probation in June for NCAA
violations under former coach Ron Ponciano. CSUN has been
scrambling to recover ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a blow with that,'' running back Alan Taylor said.
``But as a team, we don't really think about it that much. We look
at the Big Sky championship. That's what we're after.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kearin, in his second season as head coach, has his team
believing anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope at the end of the year we're 11-0 and disappointed as
heck,'' Kearin said. ``I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN will be a huge underdog when it opens against Division I-A
Air Force on Saturday. And then there's defending Big Sky champion
Montana, not to mention Portland State, Northern Arizona and
Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kearin believes his team will contend in what he believes
will be a more balanced conference.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the return of quarterback Marcus Brady and a solid
receiving corps. Brady, a junior, threw for 3,326 yards and 24
touchdowns last year. His favorite target, Drew Amerson, is back.
Amerson led the team in receptions (74) and yards receiving (897).
Three more receivers, returnee Gil Rodriguez and transfers Jason
Stone and Ryan Felix, also are reason for optimism. Six starters
return on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by far the best conditioned team I've ever been on,''
Rodriguez said. ``The commitment is there. Coach Kearin has made
that commitment and we have something to look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three starters return on defense, which surrendered 431.1
yards per game. An early strength appears to be a linebacking corps
that includes Abercrombie, Pieter Keus and Lewis Blanton.
</P>
<P>
   The glaring weakness is depth, particularly on both the
offensive and defensive lines. Serious injuries would be
devastating. Many linemen already are nursing minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depth is more obvious every day,'' Kearin said. ``But that's
the normal wear and tear of camp.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN was 6-5 overall and finished fourth in the Big Sky at 5-3
last season. The Matadors were 4-4 on the field but earned a
forfeit victory over Northern Arizona, which used an ineligible
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that four teams could easily go undefeated,''
Kearin said. ``Montana, Portland State, I think Sacramento State
can do really well and I think we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it could be a long season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I'm not going to say we're going to win because
I don't know for sure,'' fullback Crayton Milton said. ``But we'll
go down in the alley with all our starters.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana is ranked second in the Sports Network's Division I-AA
preseason poll while Portland State is ranked 12th. CSUN received
votes and is 37th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're after the Big Sky this year,'' Abercrombie said. ``The
Big Sky hasn't been givin' us no love. They're lovin' Montana and
those teams that barely beat us. I think we can do big things. They
shouldn't count us out.''

FBI ARRESTS CALIFORNIA MAN, 23, FOR EMULEX STOCK FRAUD ON
INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark S. Jakob made a big bet in mid-August that Emulex shares
would decline, federal prosecutors say. Instead, Emulex soared,
leaving him with a paper loss of almost $100,000 in just a week.
</P>
<P>
   So Jakob, a 23-year-old former student at El Camino Community
College in Torrance, Calif., took matters into his own hands,
according to the government. On the evening of Aug. 24, he sent a
fake press release by e-mail to Internet Wire, a Los Angeles
service where he had previously worked, warning that Emulex's chief
executive had resigned and its earnings were overstated. The next
morning, just as financial markets opened, Internet Wire
distributed the damaging release to news organizations and Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, shareholders in Emulex were $2.5 billion poorer.
And Jakob would soon be $240,000 richer, said Alejandro N.
Mayorkas, U.S. attorney for the Central District of California,
which includes Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents arrested Jakob on Thursday morning at the home he
shares with his parents in a quiet neighborhood in El Segundo, a
suburb of Los Angeles. Prosecutors charged him with one count of
securities fraud and one count of wire fraud. If convicted, he
faces 15 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. The Securities and
Exchange Commission simultaneously filed a civil complaint against
Jakob, seeking to freeze his assets and recoup what it calls
illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   The hoax, which temporarily roiled financial markets, was
revealed within an hour of the first news report and Emulex stock
recovered the same day. Still, investors who panicked and sold
their shares or had sell orders automatically executed at preset
prices are unlikely to recover their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob did not have a lawyer at the time of his arrest and was
represented by a public defender at his initial court appearance
Thursday, according to a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office.
He was being held in custody in Los Angeles and could not be
reached for comment. A woman who answered the door and phone at his
parents' house declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob's arrest is the third time in 18 months that law
enforcement agencies have made a quick arrest in an Internet fraud
that targeted a big company's stock, illustrating yet again that
the promise of anonymity on the Internet is largely an illusion.
Because Web sites and servers that deliver e-mail carefully track
the location of every visitor and message they get, police and
prosecutors can track Internet users with relative ease unless the
users take enormous care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who would use the Internet to commit a crime should
understand one thing _ do not count on the anonymity of the
Internet to serve as a shield for your illegal conduct,'' Mayorkas
said. ``As technology advances, so do our investigative techniques
and our abilities to protect the public.''
</P>
<P>
   While the fake Emulex release was the most damaging, Lucent
Technologies and PairGain also saw their stocks manipulated by fake
releases. In both cases, prosecutors quickly found and charged the
alleged perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said they are continuing to
investigate the Emulex hoax and did not rule out the possibility of
more arrests.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jakob, who had worked for Internet Wire for about a year,
resigned on Aug. 18, and had been an employee in good standing,
according to the company. But on Aug. 17 and 18, prosecutors say,
Jakob sold 3,000 shares of Emulex short, betting that he would be
able to buy the stock later at a lower price and pocket the
difference as profit.
</P>
<P>
   Like a short sale, buying a put option is another way to profit
from a stock price decline, and many Emulex puts were bought just
before and just after the fake release was issued. Prosecutors did
not claim that Jakob bought put options, leaving open the question
of who did.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob's arrest comes after an intense six-day investigation that
began with the electronic trail left by the e-mail he sent Internet
Wire, Mayorkas said. Within a few hours, FBI agents had tracked the
e-mail to a computer library at El Camino Community College. The
fact that the e-mail appeared to have been written by someone
familiar with Internet Wire's procedures offered another clue, and
agents quickly made the connection between Jakob's employment at
Internet Wire and his enrollment at El Camino, where he was a
student until earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, investigators had tightened their focus on Jakob and
begun to examine records of his stock trading. They discovered his
short sales, which took place at prices ranging from $72 to $92 on
Aug. 17 and 18 through Datek Inc., the online brokerage firm. As
Emulex stock soared, Jakob's losses mounted, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   But after Internet Wire distributed the press release, which was
picked up by Bloomberg News and other news organizations, Emulex
stock fell from $113 to $45, and Jakob ``covered'' his short by
buying the 3,000 shares he had previously sold for a profit of
$55,000. Minutes later, with Emulex stock still reeling from his
fraud, he bought 3,500 more shares for just over $50 each, while he
was at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, prosecutors say. Late
Monday, after the fraud had been discovered and Emulex stock had
recovered, he sold those shares, pocketing an additional $186,000,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob had actively traded Emulex for five months before his
mid-August short sales, prosecutors said. ``This is an example of
the downside of day-trading,'' said Pamela Johnston, one of two
assistant U.S. attorneys who investigated the case. ``Someone can
get themselves in a position where they are financially strapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Roller, senior vice president of Emulex, said he was
pleased with the arrest and hoped Jakob would face substantial
penalties if convicted. ``When you look at this kind of crime, it's
electronic terrorism,'' Roller said. ``You've got to make an
example of this person.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wernick, a neighbor of the Jakob family, said Jakob had a
business refurbishing and selling used cars. In his personal
profile for his America Online account, prosecutors say, Jakob
lists Las Vegas, snowboarding, dancing and playing the stock market
among his hobbies, and lists ``let it ride'' as his personal quote.

CLINTON VETOES A BILL REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX
</HEADLINE>

 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday vetoed a
Republican-sponsored bill to repeal the federal estate tax and
stepped up the election-year sparring over tax cuts and how best to
spend the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks in the East Room of the White House, Clinton said the
bill ``fails the test of fairness and fiscal responsibility''
because it is costly and, according to administration figures,
benefits only the wealthiest 2 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The president accused Republicans of threatening to hamstring
the booming economy by devising a series of tax cuts that he said
would leave little money for Medicare, prescription drug benefits,
education and a host of other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly lobbed the same charge at
his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who supports repealing
the estate tax. And in vetoing the bill Thursday, Clinton adopted
the same sort of language heard from Gore on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this latest bill, this estate tax bill, is part
of a series of actions and commitments that, when you add it all up
would take us back to the bad old days of deficits, high interest
rates and having no money to invest in our common future,'' Clinton
said, echoing Gore's attacks on Bush's tax plans.
</P>
<P>
   The bill ``shows a sense of priorities that I believe got us in
trouble in the first place in the 1980s, and that if we go back to
those priorities, will get us in trouble again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Rep. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House,
immediately announced that the House would attempt to override the
veto as its first order of business when it returned next week.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort, which requires a two-thirds majority in both
houses of Congress, is expected to fail in the Senate and may fall
short in the House, as well. Neither Republicans nor Clinton ruled
out the possibility of a compromise Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death tax punishes families for being successful,'' said
Hastert of Illinois, using the Republicans' preferred term for the
estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It punishes farmers. It punishes small business owners. It
punishes those who have not planned ahead with an array of lawyers
and accountants to keep their money in their family,'' he said.
``Down the road, it will punish our young entrepreneurs, who are
just starting their own Internet or high-tech ventures.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has said he will also try to override Clinton's veto of
a bill to give married couples a tax break, one in a series of
bite-size tax cut proposals that Republicans have sent to the
president in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The bill to repeal the estate tax had drawn broad Democratic
support in Congress, especially in the House, where members
recognized its allure to voters. Thursday, Clinton was careful not
to dismiss the idea of curbing the estate tax and highlighted his
party's proposals, which the Democrats say will provide more modest
tax breaks for a greater number of people, but which Republicans
dismiss as having little impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not against wealth and we are not against
opportunity,'' said Clinton. ``If I were against creating
millionaires, I have been an abject failure in my years as
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The current tax applies to estates worth more than $675,000, or
$1.3 million for a family-owned farm or business, and by 2006 the
limit would rise to $1 million. The Republican plan would have
phased out the tax entirely over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 percent of the families of those who die pay the estate
tax, but Republicans argue that no one should have to pay the tax,
which has a 55 percent top rate.
</P>
<P>
   According to congressional and White House estimates, the bill
would cost $105 billion in the first 10 years, as the tax is phased
out, and then $750 billion in the decade after the tax is repealed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although recent public opinion surveys show that the bill has
proven popular among voters, Clinton's advisers say that is largely
because it has been misunderstood. ``Of the $750 billion the repeal
costs, one-half _ nearly $400 billion _ goes to the top one-tenth
of one percent of estates,'' said Gene Sperling, the president's
national economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has proposed a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years,
has endorsed the Republican estate tax repeal, incorporating it in
his own plan. Thursday, Mindy Tucker, Bush's press secretary,
accused Gore of ``showing weak leadership'' in ``standing by while
his administration vetoed a bill that would help so many hard
working Americans and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal is more in line with the Democratic
alternatives. Instead of phasing out the estate tax entirely, it
would exempt all estates worth less than $5 million, and the
results would be immediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the benefits under the Republican plan goes to the
extremely wealthy,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore campaign
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Since the national conventions, both Bush and Gore have jousted
over the scale and wisdom of tax cuts at a time when the country is
prospering economically.
</P>
<P>
   The two have used the debate to underscore the two parties'
traditional political philosophies, a theme House and Senate
lawmakers are also pitching on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the surplus _ money not spent on protecting
Social Security _ should be returned to the taxpayer and not spent
by the government. Democrats believe it should be steered toward
education, health care, Medicare and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You let the surplus sit there in this town and people will
spend it,'' Hastert said at a recent fund-raiser. ``The best thing
we can do is take that surplus off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside their campaign rhetoric, though, both sides have
inched toward the center, promising to pay down the debt and
protect Social Security. While Democrats are devising their own tax
cuts, Republicans are talking about spending more money on
education.
</P>
<P>
   Each party is also repackaging its ideas. House Republicans, for
example, devised a different approach to tax cuts this year, after
Clinton vetoed their mammoth tax-reduction bill last year. (``A
cannonball that was too heavy to fly,'' Clinton said Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   They divided the bill into smaller pieces and portrayed them as
common-sense tax breaks for married couples and grieving families
who do not want to break up the family farm to pay the tax man.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of breaking up the bills has proved relatively
fruitful, since it drew Democratic votes and appeared to please
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the approach clever today, but then excoriated
the end result, saying it would still cost too much and do little
for low- and middle-income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows there is a lot more hard work to be done, and
there are differences of opinion about what we ought to do and how
we ought to do it,'' Clinton said. ``That's why we're having
another election this year. And that's up to the American people to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``I believe that prosperity imposes its own
difficult choices, because there are so many temptations to do
things that seem easy that will have adverse consequences.''

PARENTS PUTTING CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE STRAINS NEW YORK CITY'S
SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo NYT22 is being sent to NYT photo clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Filled with a mixture of dread and relief one summer
morning two years ago, Yahya Abdul-Hakam, an unemployed father of
two, did what many fathers would find unthinkable: he turned his
eldest daughter, then 11 years old, over to the city's foster care
system.
</P>
<P>
   Today, reluctantly recalling that moment, he says he had no
choice. For several years, his daughter had been acting out at
school, throwing things, screaming in class. At home, her angry
outbursts resulted in fights with a younger sister, a cousin,
sometimes even with him. Abdul-Hakam even admitted her to a
psychiatric hospital once.
</P>
<P>
   The morning he took her to the offices of the city's
Administration for Children's Services, a tangle of emotions raced
through him. ``Fear, uneasiness, nervousness,'' he recounted. ``It
really came to a point where that was the only thing I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Extreme as his action may seem, Abdul-Hakam's sense of
frustration is shared by parents throughout the city. The range of
options available to the privileged _ military-style private
schools, private psychiatric treatment _ are not readily available
to poor parents like him.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, every day, dozens of them stream into a sixth-floor
courtroom in Manhattan Family Court designated for these so-called
voluntary placements citywide.
</P>
<P>
   There is the father who quickly wearied of caring for his
teen-age son after the boy's mother died. There is the father who
sent his daughter into foster care after a series of violent
outbursts. There is the mother who initially sought court-ordered
supervision for her misbehaving daughter, and when that did not
work, signed her over to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, M. Jay Segal, the court referee hearing that
case, turned to the girl's mother. ``Ma'am, you don't want to take
her home?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Without a glance at her daughter, the woman shook her head.
``She's going to run around,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, told she had no place to go other than back to her
group home, sat in court, sobbing uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   Citywide, just as involuntary admissions to foster care have
declined in recent years, so have the number of voluntary
placements. But the share of voluntarily placed youngsters among
all children admitted to foster care has inched up slightly. One in
10 children admitted to foster care in the 1999 fiscal year were
voluntarily placed, according to city figures. Children's lawyers
estimate that voluntary placements make up 10 to 20 percent of the
city's total foster care caseload.
</P>
<P>
   Although hard numbers are not available, lawyers and social
workers who work on these cases say adolescents, especially the
disobedient and the emotionally disturbed, make up a significant
and growing share of voluntary placements.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For some youngsters, a life in foster care can be a road to
further decline. For others, especially those who need
round-the-clock attention, being placed in care can be better than
being at home. Either way, it exposes the peculiar predicament of
overwhelmed parents who relinquish their children to an equally
overwhelmed government bureaucracy _ one that is hardly equipped to
care for, let alone rehabilitate, troubled teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Why would a parent voluntarily turn a child over to foster care?
Sometimes, a parent or guardian is ill, homeless or incarcerated.
Sometimes, child welfare officials offer voluntary placement as an
alternative to filing abuse or neglect charges against the parents.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a parent simply wants to be done with a difficult
child. Often, for parents under pressure, the child welfare system
is the only way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``For parents who don't have a support system or the economic
means to purchase a support system _ like after-school activities,
summer camps _ the stresses are exacerbated,'' said Karen Freedman,
executive director of Lawyers for Children, a nonprofit group that
provides lawyers and social services for children who are
voluntarily placed. ``A lot of what these parents are feeling is
fear for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   In Family Court, where despair competes daily with heartbreak,
voluntary placement cases are among the saddest and most
confounding. The adolescents are likely to end up in group homes
rather than with foster families. If they need psychiatric care,
the wait for a state-financed residential treatment center can
sometimes be many months. Often, the youngsters simply run away
from a group home, or wait until they become adults and leave the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, social workers and advocates for children
successfully persuade parents not to relinquish the children.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Hakam's daughter was relatively lucky in that she was
placed with foster parents, four families in two years. Abdul-Hakam
wants her back home, he says, but not now. He wants first to move
out of the one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment he shares with his wife
and younger daughter, though for now, that seems out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Hakam, 49, supports his family on public assistance, he
says, cleaning a beach in Queens three days a week for his welfare
check. Though his relationship with his daughter has improved in
the last two years, he remains out of touch with the ordinary
details of her life. He is not sure which school she will attend
this month. He is not sure of the mental health diagnosis that has
been made, nor of the name of the medications she has been taking _
something to calm her down is all he recalls. When and whether she
will return home remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who represent children like her say they tend to stay in
care longer than others. Marta, a 15-year-old who had been shuttled
among a series of caretakers before she landed in foster care last
year, is no exception. When her mother was arrested on drug
charges, Marta, who spoke on the condition that only her first name
be used, was sent to her grandmother in Puerto Rico. When she
started rebelling, she was returned to her father in New York.
Father and daughter were virtual strangers, she said. Marta's
grades slid. She did not finish the eighth grade. She ran the
streets with friends.
</P>
<P>
   That, she said, is when the beatings began. Her father beat her
for bad grades. He beat her for not cleaning her room. When she
reported it to her favorite teacher and the child welfare agency
was summoned, her father, who did not return calls requesting
comment, was offered the option of voluntarily placing Marta in
foster care. Marta did not object.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a foster home in Yonkers, group homes in
Brooklyn and Westchester, and finally, a residential treatment
center upstate, where she still lives, remarkably reflective about
her circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   If she was initially enraged at her father for placing her in
foster care, she now sounds almost sympathetic. She misses him, but
knows he is not ready to take her back. ``I know why he wanted me
here _ he wanted the best for me,'' she said. ``He wasn't doing it
for his best. He was doing it for my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 15, Marta would prefer to remain in foster care until her
18th birthday because, as she puts it, she would like to give her
father a break. He works, goes to school, cares for three
stepchildren. ``He got a lot of things to do,'' Marta said. ``I
really want to give him some time.''

   Fear, more than frustration, led Jose Vasquez to sign his
daughter over to foster care earlier this year. In fits of rage,
his daughter, Tania, would bang her fists on a school desk. She bit
classmates, and once even a police officer. She spoke of suicide.
Last December, he admitted her to a psychiatric hospital. Then,
petrified that the city would take her away after another outburst,
Vasquez said, he agreed to sign her over to foster care. He thought
it would be brief, he said, long enough for her to be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   What made that action all the more incongruous was Vasquez's
record as a father. Five years ago, after neglect charges were
filed against the mother of his two children, he fought for
custody, taking the children out of foster care. He shuttled them,
both mentally retarded, between school, doctor appointments and
Medicaid offices almost daily. He lost his job as a carpenter. He
held onto them even as they lived in a room in a seedy residential
hotel, which was all he could afford.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vasquez appeared in court in a desperate bid to get
his daughter back. Tania, now 13 and with a mood disorder and
borderline intelligence, has spent the last four months in the
Kings County Psychiatric Hospital. She has been on Depakote, an
anticonvulsant prescribed for epileptics and people with behavioral
disorders. On his recent visits, Vasquez said, Tania seemed calmer,
eager to come home. But his heart broke, he said, when he saw that
her hands were shaking uncontrollably. (Depakote is known to cause
tremors.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw her shaking like that, I started crying myself,''
he said, as his son, Jose Jr., born with fetal alcohol syndrome,
played quietly outside the courtroom. ``I thought she was going to
come out all right. I thought by this time, she'd be back home
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking Tania home will be no easy feat. Yet Vasquez is
determined to do so. In an effort to make her more comfortable, he
has asked his girlfriend and their 8-month-old baby to move out of
their Bronx apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But if Tania slips into violent outbursts again, how does he
know he will be able to handle her?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm her father,'' Vasquez said, unable to hold back
tears. ``I wouldn't like for her to be away forever. I would like
to try. She doesn't belong over there. She belongs over here.'' &QL;

VENEZUELAN AGENCY REQUESTS CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST FORD AND
BRIDGESTONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TIRE-RECALL, TIRE-LABOR) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Accusing Ford Motor Co. and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. with
conspiring to hide tire defects that caused dozens of deaths,
Venezuela's consumer protection agency Thursday asked that nation's
prosecutor to bring criminal charges against both companies.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies ``had concealed vital information from
Venezuelan consumers,'' said Samuel Ruh Rios, chairman of the
Venezuelan consumer agency. He said the companies were aware that
``a macabre combination of a soft suspension and an inadequate
tire,'' was to blame for at least 80 accidents in which 47 people
had died.
</P>
<P>
   The tires involved in Venezuela are similar to those being
recalled in the United States because they are suspected of tearing
apart at high speeds and contributing to roll over crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in
Washington Thursday increased by 26 the number of deaths that have
been linked to the recalled Firestone tires. That brings to 88 the
total number of deaths being investigated by the agency, along with
more than 250 injuries in 1,400 complaints the agency has received
concerning tire separations on Ford's popular sport utility
vehicle, Ford Explorer, among others, which has been equipped with
the suspect tires.
</P>
<P>
   In Dearborn, Jacques Nasser, the president of Ford, defended the
company's actions in Venezuela and denied any attempt to mislead
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accusation from the Venezuelan government that Ford
Venezuela lied is absolutely unfounded,'' he told reporters during
a conference call. He added, however, that Ford would cooperate
with any Venezuelan investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser insisted that the problem ``was a tire issue, not a
vehicle issue,'' and said that 1.5 million tires had already been
replaced, representing about 22 percent of the 6.5 million
Firestone tires being recalled. Bridgestone/Firestone officials,
speaking in a conference call , said they had not yet had time to
translate the report from Venezuela, but said they did not believe
they had done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe there was a conspiracy,'' said Christine
Karbowiak, a Firestone vice president. ``We are working closely
with Ford however to identify the cause or causes of the problems
that have been evident.''
</P>
<P>
   The stream of accusations and news reports have hurt both
companies on Wall Street. Shares of Ford dropped 7 percent, or
$1.75, to $24.25, closing at a 52-week low. In Japan, where
Bridgestone is based, shares of Bridgestone closed down 98 yen at
1380 yen.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan consumer authorities contended that after the first
reports there in 1998 of Firestone tire blowouts causing Ford's
Explorers to roll over, the two companies held a series of secret
meetings to determine what was wrong. Evidence led them to suspect
the original equipment Wilderness model tires from Firestone were
failing, investigators said, and instead of initiating a costly
recall, Ford asked Firestone's parent company, Bridgestone, to
redesign the tire by adding a new, fifth ply.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone officials Thursday confirmed that they had discussed
redesigns with Ford Venezuela starting in January 1999, but said
such discussions were normal.
</P>
<P>
   After those meetings between Bridgestone and Ford, new tires
produced at Firestone's plant in the Venezuelan city of Valencia
were marked to indicate they contained five plys, but most
contained no more than four, investigators said. Firestone
acknowledged that all but a few of the tires had been mistakenly
stamped as having five plys, but that they always met Ford's
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford engineers who examined some of the Venezuelan tires
made at that time found that their treads separated at a rate 500
times greater than Firestone's ATX tires made in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan investigators also charged that Ford's doorjamb
decals recommended lower tire pressures than those set by
Firestone. And they said original shock absorbers were not strong
enough to handle a fully loaded Explorer, making them dangerous to
operate. Instead of recalling the vehicles and replacing the shock
absorbers, the investigators charged that Ford told dealers to
quietly change them without notifying regulators or consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan agency, the Institute for Consumer Protection and
Education, does not have the power to file criminal charges.
Therefore, the agency recommended that the Venezuelan federal
prosecutor do so. It also requested that Bridgestone/Firestone
recall all the defective tires and that Ford replace all suspect
shock absorbers on Explorers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For American lawyers representing victims of Explorer rollovers
and their families, the Venezuelan report may help build a case
that the manufacturers had deliberately withheld information about
the tire problem.
</P>
<P>
   For Venezuela, the action by the consumer agency, which was
created in 1995, Thursday's announcement marks the country's
attempt to carve out a more influential role in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the poorly funded and understaffed Venezuelan agency
has never undertaken a case like this before, and its investigation
may face challenges to its credibility. The evidence presented in
the agency's report includes examinations of Explorers parked in
public lots and American newspaper articles taken from the
Internet. Also, the consumer agency's chief investigator is an
agronimist, and the technical expert heading the tire inquiry is a
former Goodyear tire salesman and race car driver without
engineering qualifications.

 &HT;    Ramsey case shows no sign of end
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The police interviews were over and Patsy Ramsey was
answering the final question at an Atlanta news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Ramseys now fade away, she was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never fade away until we find who did this,'' she
said. ``So there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, the much-hyped interviews had ended in an odd,
yet somehow predictable way.
</P>
<P>
   Odd in that the attorneys exploded, released tapes to the media
and made outrageous challenges to one another. Predictable in that
nobody walked away in handcuffs, and nobody walked away cleared of
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   In this nearly four-year saga of the 1996 murder of JonBenet
Ramsey, the odd has become the predictable. And it's kept us on the
edge of our seats, tuned into America's No. 1 whodunit. Not
necessarily with news _ just something new.
</P>
<P>
   Now a weeklong onslaught of Ramsey news has the story again
dominating the media and the Internet, TV talk shows and dinner
table chats.
</P>
<P>
   Every time it seems like the final chapter, it turns out to be
just the next one.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Patsy Ramsey, speaking as though to the police,
told USA Today, ``If you think I did it, let's have a trial and get
it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Ramseys have provided police with boots they
say may have been worn by her killer. Boulder, Colo., police, for
their part, say the boots are being tested. But they stressed that
the boots belong to a man who had committed suicide, and that his
DNA already had been tested and did not match any evidence found at
the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, the attorneys are talking about releasing
transcripts from the grand jury proceeding on the case.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of television viewers, the Ramseys' attorney
released a 22-minute video segment from the police interrogation.
On it, prosecutor Mike Kane verbally attacks Ramsey attorney Lin
Wood for not letting Patsy Ramsey answer some questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sham,'' Kane says to Wood, as the prosecutor rises
as though threatening to walk out on the talks. ``This is a big
publicity stunt on your part.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the attorneys have promised to release the full tape of this
week's 10 hours of police interviews with the Ramseys in Atlanta,
which were the first interviews with them in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Hooked? Much of America is.
</P>
<P>
   But as the latest Ramsey drama reaches a fevered pitch, the
question remains why we're so stuck on this story.
</P>
<P>
   Even the O.J. Simpson story didn't hold people's attention so
intensely for so long, and that had an arrest and two trials. The
Ramsey story is somewhat of a national Rorschach test _ the ink
blot test where you see in it whatever you want. From soap opera
drama, to legalistic debate on the evidence, to cynicism on the
wealthy, to cries of the media's falling into the tabloid abyss,
there is something for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has all the elements _ the money, the exclusivity, the
little girl,'' said Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles clinical
psychologist who has discussed the media on ``CBS This Morning''
and ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't O.J. The Ramseys were not famous beforehand. They
were just an upwardly mobile family in Boulder, Colo., when their
6-year-old daughter, JonBenet, was found strangled and beaten the
day after Christmas 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in this tale of the golden-haired princess' death, the
bungled police probe, and the ravenous media, John and Patsy Ramsey
became celebrities. And that changed everything in terms of news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Joey Buttafuoco syndrome _ that somebody could become
famous just for being in the news so long,'' said Matthew Kerbel,
the author of the media book, ``If It Bleeds, It Leads.''
</P>
<P>
   News judgment can become slippery around celebrities. Stories
becomes not so much about events, as about the people involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Ramseys have to do is open their mouths,'' and the
cameras start rolling, Kerbel said. Their ascent into the pantheon
of pop culture figures was secured, he added, when they became the
butt of jokes by Jay Leno on late night television.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could be Tammy Faye Baker,'' Kerbel said.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is on the street. Patsy Ramsey, among the most
recognizable women in America, and her husband were walking down
Atlanta's Peachtree Street when a truck carrying construction
workers rode by. ``John! Patsy! John! Patsy!'' they called.
</P>
<P>
   Patsy smiled and waved, the wave of one acknowledging fame.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Ramseys' increasing public presence is
bringing people to their side, depends on whom you talk to.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, Patsy Ramsey's character has evolved from a
strange woman who thrust her daughter into bizarre tiny-tot beauty
pageants, to a tragic figure twice victimized _ by the loss of her
child and her tribulations in the public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But others can't shake their first impression of two parents who
avoided police early in this investigation while hiring a public
relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the story these days is being driven by the Ramseys,
who live in Atlanta. They have taken on any comers who challenge
their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem on a public relations offensive, trying to convey
that they're willing to cooperate and have nothing to hide,'' said
Kerwin Swint, an assistant professor of political science at
Kennesaw State University.
</P>
<P>
   The latest front-page grabber came Wednesday when the Ramsey's
attorney Wood and prosecutor Kane, continuing their battle from
days ago, sparred on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' After Wood
challenged Kane to explain why a grand jury did not indict his
clients, they discussed seeking the release of the grand jury
transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   That's not likely to happen, said Christopher Mueller, a law
professor at the University of Colorado. The release would require
the approval of a judge. The secrecy provision for grand jury
proceedings, he said, is aimed at protecting everyone interviewed
and discussed before the grand jury, especially those who might
have been investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Customarily, the transcripts would only be released to the
prosecutor or witnesses, and for their eyes only. Since the Ramseys
were not called as witnesses, they would have no right to even
request the transcripts _ unless they were charged with the crime,
said Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   For now, people keep talking. Place a dozen strangers at a table
and mention JonBenet, and they can all talk about the little girl
as if they knew her. They know the color of her hair and eyes, and
they can discuss in detail the facts of her death. They've heard
gossip about her mother and father, and they've complained about
the police not solving the crime.
</P>
<P>
   On a larger scale, that's what this story does for people across
America. In computer chat rooms, for instance, people's familiarity
with the case has them conversing as though they all live in the
same small town. And they're all worried about one little girl's
death.

FIRST PLACE NO PIECE OF CAKE FOR DRAKE
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USAC Sprint car driver Jay Drake caught and passed
series leader Tony Elliott in Attica, Ohio, on Aug. 25. Then he
lost his lead in Lawrenceburg, Ind., the following night.
</P>
<P>
   Drake, a graduate of Buena High in Ventura, won the race at
Attica Raceway Park to take the lead in the series standings. But
Elliott won the Danny Milburn Classic at Lawrenceburg Speedway and
now holds a 14-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably how it's going to be for the rest of the
races,'' Drake said. ``If I don't win, Tony probably will.''
</P>
<P>
   With four races to go in the Sprint car season, Drake knows he
has to win more than Elliott if he wants the points championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint cars return to action at Cedar Rapids, Iowa, tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Drake missed the Sprint cars' first trip to Cedar Rapids earlier
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I hadn't,'' Drake said. ``The points would be all
wrapped up by now.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to racing his Sprint car at Cedar Rapids, he will
also be racing a USAC Midget at Indiana on Saturday and at
Wisconsin on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Drake is also second in points on the Midget
circuit, he has all but surrendered his pursuit of series leader
Kasey Kuhn.
</P>
<P>
   Drake's Midget car owner, Ralph Potter, decided to quit running
the car last month and he missed a race because of it. Now Drake is
back on the Midget circuit in a car owned by Keith Kunz, who also
owns his Sprint car.
</P>
<P>
   But Drake says he's too far back to catch Kuhn.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday listens to advice from owner Earnhardt: NASCAR Busch
Series driver Ron Hornaday Jr., coming off a 15th-place finish in
the Food City 250 at Bristol Motor Speedway, is paying attention to
what his team owner, Dale Earnhardt, has to say about his next
race.
</P>
<P>
   The Busch Series drivers head to Darlington Raceway on Saturday
for the Duralube 200.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday's history at the South Carolina track has not been
good. In his first Busch Series race there, as a substitute for
Steve Park in 1998, he failed to qualify. Earlier this year at
Darlington, Hornaday, driving the Earnhardt-owned NAPA Auto Parts
Chevrolet, made the field, but fought to stay in the top 20 during
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who was racing in the NASCAR Winston Cup race at
Darlington the next day, came over the radio and told Hornaday to
change his line on the track. The advice led to an eighth-place
finish for Hornaday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have never thought that the line he wanted me to run
would work considering how the car felt, but it did,'' Hornaday
said. ``That's the great thing about having Dale as an owner. He
has so much track experience. He knows every bump on every track.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday, who has won two Busch Series races and has five
top-five finishes, is fifth in the series standings and second in
rookie points.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Series heads to Madera Speedway: Auggie Vidovich of
Lakeside has won the last two NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series
events and will look to extend his winning streak in the Food 4
Less MDA 100 at Madera Speedway on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   With two straight wins, Vidovich is 87 points out of first place
in the series standings. Matt Crafton of Tulare leads the series
with 1,910 points.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Woodside of Saugus is fourth in points; Greg Pursley of
Newhall is fifth; M.K. Kanke of Frazier Park is sixth and Frank
Maronski Jr. of Quartz Hill is eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Winston West races in Utah on Labor Day: The NASCAR Winston West
Series heads to Rocky Mountain Raceways on Monday for the Bank One
250.
</P>
<P>
   Series leader Brendan Gaughan of Las Vegas holds a 210-point
lead in the standings and is in search of his first championship.
The Bank One 250 is the ninth race of the 12-race Winston West
Series schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sedgwick of Acton, who finished second in the Aug. 19
Winston West Series race at Irwindale Speedway, is sixth in points.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio may be less well known than his opponent in the
New York Senate contest (not to mention the Republican who dropped
out), but in terms of fund-raising, he has already entered their
league. Lazio collected $10.7 million in just seven weeks this
summer, his aides said Thursday, leaving little doubt that he will
have the means to battle for the seat despite his late start.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has taken in a total of $19.2 million since jumping into
the Senate race in May, nearly as much as Hillary Rodham Clinton,
who has been raising money for more than a year and has collected
$21.9 million. She raised $3.3 million in the seven-week period
this summer: July 1 to Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's success with donors suggests that no matter who is on
the Republican line _ mayor, congressman, school board member _ the
checks will pour in because of hostility among some people across
the country to the Democratic candidate, Clinton. And Lazio, a
once-obscure congressman from Suffolk County, has readily harnessed
that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Rick Lazio,'' he wrote in an unusually short, one-page
fund-raising letter this summer. ``It won't take me six pages to
convince you to send me an urgently needed contribution for my
United States Senate campaign in New York. It will take only six
words: I'm running against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Sincerely, Rick
Lazio.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's financial edge so far, Lazio has more money on
hand, an important indicator. Lazio began the race with $3.5
million left over from his House campaigns, and then collected
$15.7 million. After expenditures, largely for television
advertisements and direct mailings, he has $10.2 million in the
bank. She has $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns released summaries of their finances Thursday,
but not lists of donors and expenditures. They are required to
submit those lists to the Federal Election Commission this month.
</P>
<P>
   Before exiting the race to focus on his treatment for prostate
cancer, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani repeatedly set fund-raising records
with a campaign that appealed to the distaste of conservatives and
others for Clinton. With the same strategy, Lazio is surpassing
even Giuliani's records.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three months of this year, for example, Giuliani
took in $7 million, less than Lazio's total for the recent seven
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is historic,'' said Bill Dal Col, Lazio's campaign manager,
a longtime political consultant who led Steve Forbes' presidential
campaigns. ``I have never seen numbers like this.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   These totals would have been unthinkable in previous races. In
the seven-week summer period in the 1998 Senate contest in New
York, the eventual winner, Charles E. Schumer, raised $627,000,
while the incumbent, Alfonse D'Amato, raised $1.7 million,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer spent $16.7 million on the entire race.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who raised $23.3 million for his aborted run, and
Clinton have both surpassed the record for fund raising by a
nonincumbent in a Senate race, the $21 million taken in by Oliver
North, a Republican, in his failed race in Virginia in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The record for spending will not be known until November: Jon
Corzine, a Wall Street multimillionaire, spent $35.5 million,
nearly all of it his own money, to win the Democratic Senate
primary in New Jersey. He is expected to spend more in the general
election against the Republican, Rep. Robert D. Franks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The New York contest is likely to be the most expensive Senate
race in the nation's history, and that is without taking into
account so-called soft money: large donations raised and spent by
party committees. Clinton has raised soft money, and while Lazio
has not, outside groups not connected to his campaign have bought
ads to help him.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Clinton, Giuliani took in more money from donors
outside the state than a typical Senate candidate, and Lazio is
expected to focus more on such contributors this month. He has
scheduled fund-raising visits next week to Alabama, Texas and
California. The Lazio campaign said it did not know what percentage
of its recent donations were from out-of-state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has raised about 60 percent of her individual donations
out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides, who long ago resigned themselves to the idea
that she is reviled by politically active (and check-writing)
conservatives, said they were not daunted by Lazio's tally. ``We
are not surprised that Congressman Lazio outraised us given his
ability to tap into a well-funded national network of conservative
donors,'' said Cathie Levine, a Clinton campaign spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides attribute some of their success to a sense of
urgency among Republicans around the country after Giuliani dropped
out. Many Republican contributors consider the New York Senate race
their second priority after the presidential one, because defeating
Hillary Clinton would end the reign of both Clintons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lazio holds several fund-raisers, often weaving them into his
schedule as he travels around the state. Campaigning one Monday in
mid-August in the Jamestown area, in the southwest corner of the
state, he held a breakfast fund-raiser, then toured a sprawling
furniture factory, and then held a luncheon fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has benefited from the groundwork laid by Giuliani's
campaign, especially its direct-mail operation, which compiled a
list of more than 200,000 donors nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, and there is no secret about this, there is a great
deal of resentment towards Mrs. Clinton,'' said Bruce J.
Teitelbaum, who led the Giuliani campaign. ``No matter who is going
to run, they are going to raise big money. That said, Rick Lazio
and his team are doing a superb job.''
</P>
<P>
   For some Democrats, the numbers released Thursday confirmed
their fears that Lazio would quickly catch up to Clinton in fund
raising and probably surpass her by November. That does not mean
that he will win, but it does make him less of an underdog, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could run a tree against her, and it wouldn't matter,''
said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant not involved
in the Senate race. ``The Republicans will do anything to stop
her.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Unwelcome surprises shaking Bush's confidence
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By CLAY ROBISON
 &HT;    and R.G. RATCLIFFE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks of sliding poll numbers and unwelcome surprises have
shaken the confidence of Gov. George W. Bush's presidential
campaign for the first time since his January loss in the New
Hampshire Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Aides and associates in Austin and on the road with Bush are
expressing concern privately that the road to the White House may
be rockier than they once expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a roller coaster ride,'' said one aide, who
expressed confidence that things will turn back around.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters Thursday that he plans to come out of the
Labor Day weekend focusing attention on Vice President Al Gore to
eliminate the bounce that Gore got from the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to continue to hear the failed leadership
theme,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep reminding the American people that it's one
thing to give flowery speeches and talk big about issues, but
they've had a chance to get something done on prescription drugs
and the Medicare program, for example, and they haven't
performed.''
</P>
<P>
   While national tracking polls show Bush with a narrow lead over
Gore, state polls are starting to indicate electoral college
trouble for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But informal conversations with staff suggest that some of the
more experienced political operatives view the rough patch as
simply a typical development in a close campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in the battleground state of Ohio, where Bush was
campaigning Thursday, showed Bush with a slight lead but in a
statistical tie with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, where Bush's brother Jeb is governor, was once
considered solid Bush country. But a new poll there shows Bush has
gone from leading by 8 percentage points to trailing by 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is striking fire in Florida with his promise to make
prescription drugs affordable for seniors. Bush plans to lay out
his own prescription drug plan next week, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   A loss in Florida would undermine Bush's electoral college
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision to focus more on Gore's record next week may be
a reflection of a Rasmussen Research tracking poll that found the
two candidates' favorable and unfavorable ratings are now almost
identical.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was viewed favorably by 46 percent of those surveyed and
unfavorably by 41 percent. Bush's rating was 49 percent favorable,
38 percent unfavorable. Up to this point in most polls, Bush's
unfavorable rating has been much lower than Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction by Bush and his aides has played out visibly in
Austin and on the road.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, Bush's campaign had announced plans to focus
attention on education for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, Bush was knocked off message by questions over
whether he would debate Gore in prime time and by renewed focus on
health care in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and his staff have been reacting nervously
and sometimes angrily.
</P>
<P>
   They were especially annoyed with state Attorney General John
Cornyn for not warning them about a federal judge's ruling that the
state's Medicaid system is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise ruling by U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice
seemed to give additional ammunition to Gore's charges that health
care in Texas has been inadequate during Bush's administration as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   As he has for much of the week, the governor played offense and
defense on the campaign trail in Ohio Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to question the motives of Justice for ruling during
the campaign that Texas has failed to adequately care for
low-income children in its Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   He said, though, that ``William Wayne Justice is a well-known
activist, liberal judge in the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 14 order, which caught Bush and his campaign staff by
surprise, is being used by Democrats to reinforce their attacks
against the Texas governor. Bush first learned of the order on
Wednesday from a news report.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, a 1968 appointee of President Johnson, has issued
several controversial and landmark decisions during his long
career, including an order 20 years ago for massive improvements in
the Texas prison system.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit over children's health care that prompted the
federal court ruling in Texas was filed in 1993, when Democrat Ann
Richards was still governor. In the latest development, Justice
held that Texas has not lived up to terms of a consent decree
entered in 1996 under Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Texas will appeal the latest ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working hard to sign up as many children as we can to
the children's health insurance program as well as to Medicaid,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Justice's ruling concerns an early diagnostic and
treatment program, which the judge determined wasn't being
adequately carried out by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said that Texas had improved its
record of screening children's health care needs under that program
since Bush has been governor. She said that Texas now screens 61
percent of the children eligible for the program, compared with a
54 percent national screening rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vice president wants to complain about this, then he
better go complain about America. We do a better job on this in
Texas than Al Gore does in America,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, Bush notched his campaign's 100th visit to a
school, this time the Springfield High School in Holland, near
Toledo, in northwest Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In his most pointed speech of the week, he told several thousand
students and adults packed into the school's gymnasium that the
Clinton-Gore administration failed to deliver on a 1992 campaign
promise to cut taxes for the middle class and failed to help senior
citizens obtain prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seven and a half years of empty rhetoric, I can
understand why the young become disillusioned (with politics),''
Bush said.

RIGHTS GROUPS HAS SUMMONS SERVED ON LI PENG IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (UPDATES with rewriting thruout; ADDS 400 words)  
(Eds: ``1789'' is cq in 6th graf from bottom) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five veterans of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy
movement are suing Li Peng, the chairman of China's National
People's Congress, in a federal court in New York for human rights
abuses stemming from his role in the military crackdown that killed
hundreds of civilians in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that such a legal action has been taken in
this country against a Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit was filed on Monday in federal district court in
Manhattan by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit
legal group that specializes in human rights cases. Among the five
plaintiffs are Wang Dan, a student leader of the Tiananmen
demonstrations, and Zhang Liming, whose sister was shot dead by
army troops who overran Tiananmen Square in the chaotic early
morning hours of June 4, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Li, who is in New York this week attending a conference of the
world's parliaments at the United Nations, was served with a court
summons Thursday morning at the Waldorf Towers in midtown
Manhattan. The summons was handed by a process server to an
employee of the U.S. State Department who was guarding Li.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Thursday, a State Department spokesman said: ``We
are not in a position to accept such a document on behalf of a
foreign official.'' However, earlier this week, Judge Richard Casey
ruled that a federal employee guarding Li could accept the summons,
given the difficulty of reaching Li.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit charges that Li, who was prime minister during the
Tiananmen massacre, was responsible for ``crimes against humanity,
including summary execution, arbitrary detention, torture and other
torts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to prove that he is accountable for the crime, and
that this kind of crime, the human rights violation, is beyond
China's borders,'' said Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human
Rights in China, a New York-based group that brought together the
plaintiffs with lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights
in anticipation of Li's visit to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Yuanyuan, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in
Washington, did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first such across-the-border lawsuit was brought by the
Center for Constitutional Rights in 1979, when an opposition leader
in Paraguay, whose son was killed by the authorities, sued the
chief of police in Asuncion, the capital city. Although the
plaintiffs were living in Paraguay, the defendant was residing in
Brooklyn at the time. In 1984, a federal court ruling awarded $10.4
million to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, dozens of these civil suits have been filed in the
United States. Several have resulted in favorable rulings for the
plaintiffs, including one in a federal court in Boston in 1994 that
found an Indonesian general responsible for a 1991 massacre in East
Timor, ordering him to pay $14 million. In 1996, a federal court in
Manhattan found a Hutu leader in Rwanda liable for $110 million in
damages stemming from the genocide in that country.
</P>
<P>
   In none of the cases has any money been collected. But if the
federal court in Manhattan found in favor of the plaintiffs in the
case against Li, it would be the first time that a representative
of the Chinese government had been found legally culpable in the
Tiananmen massacre. The government continues to insist that the
student-led demonstrations of 1989 constituted a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' that justified the military
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese perception of this will be that, once again, we
are attempting to interfere in what they view as a domestic
matter,'' said Bob Berring, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley who studies the Chinese legal system. ``But
for the human rights community, they have to seize on an
opportunity like this to put human rights issues on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal basis for the lawsuit comes from the Alien Tort Claims
Act, passed in 1789, and the Torture Victim Protection Act, passed
in 1992, said Jennie Green, the lead lawyer representing the
plaintiffs. The two statutes allow human rights victims to file for
claims in United States courts even if both the plaintiffs and the
defendants live in another country. The only requirement is that
the defendant be presented with a court summons while in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   For Li, that took place early Thursday morning, when a private
detective and a process server retained by Human Rights in China
walked up to a half-dozen plainclothes police officers standing
outside an entrance to the Waldorf Towers. After a tense wait, a
supervising officer called for one of the State Department guards.
</P>
<P>
   Li has 20 days to answer the summons. He is scheduled to leave
the United States on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Green said that Li does not qualify for diplomatic immunity
since he is not an appointed Chinese envoy to this country. A State
Department official said that the immunity question is not relevant
yet, but that lawyers will examine it if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Li was served, Zhang sat in the offices of Human
Rights in China and held up pictures of his slain sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that my family has been working toward, even
while I was back in China,'' said Zhang, who came to here in 1997
and works as a cook in San Diego. ``I hope to continue with the
legal procedure to further the interests of my family. But what
benefit will come out of that, I'm not sure.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Gore tells Seattle voters to reject cynicism and embrace his
plan
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JULIE MASON
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Closing out a week of campaigning on the Democratic
agenda for health care, Vice President Al Gore on Thursday urged
more than 2,000 supporters at a downtown rally to reject cynicism
and ``ironic detachment,'' and embrace his plan for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open your hearts and allow yourselves to really, sincerely
believe without reservation that we can do the right thing in
America, redeem the promise of our democracy and be the better for
it,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who for the past several days has seemed invigorated by a
surge in the polls and the burgeoning crowds turning out to greet
him, campaigned with running mate Joseph Lieberman in support of a
patient's bill of rights. They addressed the crowd in a downtown
plaza and picked up the endorsement of the American Nurses
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the Democratic running mates took a ferry
ride to Bainbridge Island to meet voters. Gore served coffee to
reporters, and Lieberman told one ferry commuter that the campaign
is still enjoying momentum from the party's national convention two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels real good,'' Lieberman said, ``it feels like we've
got some wind behind us.``
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the campaign rally downtown, Lieberman complained
about new Republican ads that began airing Thursday that tweak Gore
on his past fund-raising at a Buddhist temple and exaggerations
about his role in the development of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to say George Bush's promise to change the tone of
American politics has run into the reality of a troubled
Bush-Cheney campaign,'' Lieberman said. ``These attack ads break
his promise not to launch personal attacks in this campaign, and
they drag us back to the worst politics of the past.``
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee ad is airing in 17 states.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, spokeswoman for Texas Gov. Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, said the ad's message _ suggesting that Gore
is dishonest _ is no worse than Democratic ads that ``call the
governor a polluter or suggest he doesn't care about kids.``
</P>
<P>
   The escalating rhetoric comes as polls tighten and the close
race heats up for key states heavy with electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our opponents have been trying to tell the country that we are
worse off today than we were eight years ago, but I don't think
so,'' Gore said. ``We've got a lot of problems that need to be
addressed, but eight years ago there were many more.''
</P>
<P>
   In calling for passage of a patient's bill of rights, Gore and
Lieberman are pushing a plan they say would assure patients access
to specialists, emergency room care, an appeals process and more
responsive health maintenance organizations. Throughout the week,
the Democrats have been touting aspects of their health care
agenda, including plans for Medicare, prescription drug benefits
and children's health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is to detail his own health care agenda next week, has
said he supports a patient's bill of rights that would allow
patients to sue their HMOs, but he opposes any federal legislation
on the subject that would supersede state's laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his objective is to move power in the health care
equation from insurance companies and HMOs and back to the
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle rally coincided with the unveiling of a new campaign
ad recorded during Gore and Lieberman's recent four-day campaign
trip down the Mississippi River. The 30-second spot shows Gore at a
rally in Bellevue, Iowa, complaining about HMO ``bean counters''
who try to play God. &QL;

BIOTECH FIRM TO SELL LEFTOVER SURGICAL TISSUE FOR GENE STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Beginning next week some surgery patients at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center will be asked to allow leftover
tissue from their operations to be delivered to a Massachusetts
biotech company that will attempt to sell it to genetic researchers
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering agreement between the hospital and biotech
startup Ardais Corp., of Lexington, marks the latest effort to make
sense of the deluge of information coming from the Human Genome
Project, which traced much of the human genetic map but did not
tell scientists exactly what each gene does.
</P>
<P>
   Ardais hopes to eventually create a massive tissue catalog,
allowing researchers to place Internet orders for tissue samples
from patients with the specific diseases they are studying.
</P>
<P>
   Both the hospital and the tissue bank want to help scientists
match genes to particular diseases, then develop gene-based cures.
Hundreds of conditions, from cancer to schizophrenia are thought to
have genetic roots. However, genetic research is often plodding
because of the difficulty in obtaining tissue samples.
</P>
<P>
   Four area hospitals are in talks with Ardais to enter into
similar arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel owns a small part of Ardais, and said Thursday that
all profits from the arrangement would be put back into medical
research.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was approved by Beth Israel's internal ethics board, as
well as a host of outside medical ethicists. Duke University
Medical Center signed a similar deal this week with Ardais. Several
other out-of-state hospitals are in negotiations with the private
company, which is financed by a small group of venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue samples from the hospital will be sent to Ardais
accompanied by detailed records on patients' family medical
history, age, prescription drug use, and numerous other criteria
relevant to genetic research. But the samples will be anonymous,
containing an alpha-numeric code understood only by Ardais
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, we will protect the rights and
confidentiality of patients,'' said Eric Gordon, president and CEO
of Ardais.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said his company was aware of the ethical questions
involved, and spent weeks with outside ethicists working through
the issues. One of them, Rabbi Meir Sendor of the Young Israel of
Sharon synagogue, said he was impressed with the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly seem to conform with very high standards of
confidentiality and privacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Beth Israel patients asked to participate will
be cancer patients, said hospital officials, and some of the top
cancer researchers in the country also consulted with Ardais.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with their program,'' said Dr. Richard
Klausner, director of the National Cancer Institute, who met
briefly with company executives.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that Ardais must be ``clear and transparent and
absolutely committed to making sure that all the normal steps of
patient confidentiality are even higher than usual because of their
commercial motives.''
</P>
<P>
   Ardais was founded in 1999 with the sole purpose of creating a
tissue bank for genetics researchers. The company has 24 employees.
Gordon said he wants to sign up 20 hospitals by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next week, nurses paid for by Ardais will ask some
Beth Israel patients, before they are operated on, if they wish to
participate. Surgeons will be shielded from their decisions to
ensure their performance will not be affected. If a patient agrees,
the excess tissue _ which otherwise would have been thrown away _
will be transferred from the operating room to Ardais' freezers in
Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only arrangement that goes right into the OR to
collect the samples. I haven't heard of that before,'' said Boston
University medical ethicist George Annas.
</P>
<P>
   Annas said the program appeared sound but expressed concern with
a portion of the confidentiality agreement that patients will be
asked to sign, which says: ``The research that is done with your
tissue may not help you directly but it may very well help you or
others in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may benefit. Those are magic words to patients. You can't
say that. The only people that will benefit are the company and
researchers,'' Annas said.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel officials said the hospital's only motive is
furthering genetic research. All profits from the hospital's shares
in Ardais will be put back into the hospital's own scientific work,
said hospital officials.

 &HT;    Amiable Falcons tackle reaches milestone for consecutive starts
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. _ The time has come to ask, `What's up with
Bob?' Not that Falcons left tackle Bob Whitfield will give you a
straight answer.
</P>
<P>
   But when a 6-foot-5, 318-pound man is about to set a franchise
record by starting his 113th consecutive game _ every game since
the beginning of the 1993 season _ it's worth a special look.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who plays left guard next to Bob is named Bob, too. But
everybody calls him Hallen. He knows there can be only one Bob.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really gets me is how with his vision, with one good eye,
he's able to play left tackle so well,'' Hallen says. ``I think
when everybody thinks of a Bob, it's going to be Bob Whitfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina quarterback Steve Beuerlein had five surgeries in the
offseason. Bob, who has a cross-eyed stare, has had one in his 28
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on my dead eye,'' Bob says. ``I was born with a
underdeveloped right eye. The optic nerve never developed. I don't
have full control of it. That's why it will cross sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that a problem on the field?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Bob says. ``That's why the Creator gave you a neck _ so
you can turn your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob began turning heads when he was a starter at age 17 at
Stanford. The Falcons made him the eighth pick of the first round
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Atlanta's starting linemen missed at least one start
last season because of injury. Bob hasn't missed one since his
rookie year, and that was because he was a backup.
</P>
<P>
   And Bob doesn't even tape his ankles. So, how does a guy stay
upright so long?
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I give a lot to being lucky,'' Bob says. ``And I
tell people I can't pull a muscle because I'm mostly fat. You learn
certain reactions. You . . . can feel something start to go and you
pull out your ankles or elbows and stuff. And keep your feet
moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the time, Bob doesn't move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for the water cooler, look for Bob,'' kicker
Morten Andersen says. ``He'll have his leg up on it. And he's got
that jog down pat.''
</P>
<P>
   What's up, Bob, with the water-cooler pose, and that slow
``speed'' walk at practice?
</P>
<P>
   ``That started (in the mid-1990s) when my back started bothering
me,'' he says. ``I said, `I'm going to put my leg up and take the
pressure off my sciatic nerve.' But . . . now that . . . is so
comfortable. That's just my stance now.

DESPITE LOW PROFILE, HASTERT OUTDOES GINGRICH AT GOP FUND RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ To most people at the barbecue fund-raiser
here, Dennis Hastert, the most powerful Republican in the House,
looked like just another middle-aged, gray-haired car buff admiring
the antique black Cord parked on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is that?'' one Republican donor asked, nudging a
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessor as House speaker, Newt Gingrich, a
legendary fund-raiser for Republicans, Hastert does not make a
grand entrance: He does not travel with a large entourage. His
roly-poly face scarcely jogs the memory. He often flies coach, and
his ego does not snub a night at the Ramada. ``I'm not very
pretentious,'' Hastert says.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders say that Hastert, in his own quiet way,
is outdoing even Gingrich in raising record sums of money for the
party and for House candidates through personal appearances. It is
a feat few would have expected from a man who, while lauded by his
colleagues, lacks star wattage and a national following.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last election in 1998, Hastert has raised $40 million,
but this includes only the money he has collected by appearing at
fund-raisers. The next two months should increase that total
considerably, since the season directly before an election is the
busiest for contributors.
</P>
<P>
   It is a testament both to the power of the position of speaker
and his relentless schedule on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Direct comparisons to the amount of money Gingrich raised are
difficult to make, House Republicans say, mostly because members
add up their dollars in different ways. Gingrich raised a total of
$60 million to $75 million for the last election, a sum that takes
into account many donations he received through telemarketing and
direct mail, Republican leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia and other
Republican leaders are as likely to sign off on mail as Gingrich
was when he was speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key with Denny is he is indefatigable,'' said Davis, the
chairman of the House Republican campaign committee. ``He is not as
high-profile as Newt Gingrich, but he has raised more money than
Newt Gingrich ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gingrich, everybody knew who he was,'' he added. ``The
faithful would come out to see him in a blizzard. They don't do
that for Denny. Newt had that. But Denny overcomes that by working
slowly and methodically.''
</P>
<P>
   In an election year awash in money, critics of the campaign
finance system say it should come as no surprise that Hastert has
managed to raise $40 million so far. As anonymous as he is to the
public, his job is a powerful one. Had Gingrich still been speaker,
he would almost certainly have outstripped his own fund-raising
records, working to maintain the razor-thin Republican margin of
seven House seats, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats, led by Dick Gephardt, are breaking their own
records, raising more money than ever before. Gephardt, one of the
party's most prolific fund-raisers, has so far raised $41 million,
a figure that includes direct mail contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In total, the House Republican campaign committee has collected
$90 million and the Democratic committee has raised $60 million;
both Hastert and Gephardt raise money for their respective
committees, as well as for individual candidates and the party as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what's at stake,'' said Larry Makinson, executive
director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. ``If
you are the speaker of the House, like any politician, the sense of
preservation leads you to do almost anything to retain your job.
For Hastert, it's not winning his seat; it's keeping hold of the
speaker's chair, which means he has to keep Republicans in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   When he is not in Washington, Hastert approaches fund raising
with yeoman-like devotion, crisscrossing the country for Republican
candidates and the party and doing little else. He has visited 66
districts in 33 states, and so far has attended 104 fund-raisers
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Glendale barbecue was Hastert's third fund-raiser in the Los
Angeles area for Rep. James E. Rogan, R-Calif., a pit stop he
sandwiched between events in Kentucky, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Missouri, Arizona and Washington. It raised
$45,000 for Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's focus on fund raising on his off time is
single-minded, House Republicans and party officials say. Unlike
his more famous predecessor, they say, Hastert, who accepted the
job of speaker only after colleagues beseeched him, harbors no
presidential, senatorial or gubernatorial ambitions that colleagues
know of. He is not writing a book of any sort. He does not lecture
at universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a task that comes with the job,'' Hastert said,
sitting in an armchair inside the house of Tom and Eva Jeffers, the
hosts of the barbecue fund-raiser for Rogan. ``You just have to do
it. Newt was a great speaker and a great political thinker. I've
always had success just by going to work and getting things done.
Sometimes it's just plodding away to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   All the fund raising, he said, is one reason why he does not
make the television news show rounds on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do that and to do this at the same time,''
Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   His style is diametrically opposed to Gingrich's, but that was
one of the qualifications for the job during the tumult of 1998,
when House Republicans suffered stinging losses in the polls.
Gingrich's persona overshadowed the party, and while at first, this
served the party well, by 1998, it was seen as counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   There is no flash to Hastert; he does not advertise his power.
He arrives quietly at the Sunday barbecue in a black Suburban, with
two aides and two security agents assigned to guard him. A slightly
rumpled figure in brown blazer and khaki pants, Hastert poses for
photographs with the host committee members alongside the Jeffers'
house, then mingles with the crowd on the lawn, chitchatting
unself-consciously.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Hastert sticks to a meat-and-potatoes speech,
stripped clean of lofty phrases. He talks about what House
Republicans have done and will do before the election: ``common
sense'' tax cuts, as he calls them, a prescription drug benefit,
protecting Social Security. He pronounces pundits as ``pundints,''
a hated group among politicians. He is what he is _ a onetime
high-school wrestling coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt was a great speaker and had a great mind,'' Hastert said,
``He was off talking about new paradigms all the time and what the
21st century was going to be, and I think what I try to do, is put
in place good things for us.''
</P>
<P>
   All this work on the road has earned him the respect of House
members, especially those with safe seats who are under strict
orders to raise a total of $15 million for those candidates and
incumbents who face competitive races in November. Few members
actually enjoy fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just focuses on it like a laser beam,'' said Rep. Deborah
Pryce of Ohio, a Republican leader. And while Hastert's style may
not inspire awe, Pryce said, he connects with people on a level
that does not intimidate. ``He comes across folksy and real because
he is,'' she said. ``There are no airs about him.''

GOP COMMERCIAL REVISITS MOMENTS THAT HAVE EMBARRASSED GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BUSH, DEMS-REACT) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee is to begin running this
30-second commercial, titled ``Really,'' in 17 states starting
Friday. It features some of the most embarrassing aspects of Vice
President Al Gore's career, including his raising money at a
Buddhist temple and his claim to have created the Internet. It is
being shown in Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Cold Harbor Films
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The setting is a peach-colored kitchen, with a
small television atop a counter. On the television screen Vice
President Gore is seen speaking, though there is no sound, in the
White House briefing room on the day he said there was ``no
controlling legal authority'' over how he raised money in the 1996
campaign. The screen goes fuzzy and then shows Gore nodding to a
Buddhist monk, who is bowing at him. The screen shows monks in
saffron robes testifying under oath and then shows Gore, a near
smirk on his face, speaking at the Democratic National Convention.
It then shows him in a ``Larry King Live'' interview saying, ``I
took the initiative in creating the Internet.'' The camera returns
to the kitchen. Flashed on the screen is a Web site,
gorewillsayanything.com.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: A female narrator says: ``There's Al Gore,
reinventing himself on television again. Like I'm not going to
notice. Who's he going to be today? The Al Gore who raises campaign
money at a Buddhist temple? Or the one who promises campaign
finance reform? Really. Al Gore, claiming credit for things he
didn't even do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore: ``I took the initiative in creating the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman: ``Yeah, and I invented the remote control, too. Another
round of this, and I'll sell my television.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The commercial, a compendium of some of Gore's most
embarrassing public moments, uses Gore's own words and pictures of
him to suggest that he has no credibility. The statement that Gore
``raises campaign money at a Buddhist temple'' is technically not
correct because he did not actually ask for money at the temple,
but that point has been lost. The larger question is whether it is
fair to link these events and cast them as Gore's ``reinventing''
himself. Earlier this year, Gore publicly acknowledged that he was
``an imperfect messenger'' on the subject of fixing the campaign
finance system, a point the commercial ignores. He has also said
that he thinks his comment about the Internet was the biggest
mistake of his campaign, although at the time his aides defended
the claim and had various leaders in the high-tech field vouch for
Gore's involvement in legislation that helped pave the way for the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: Perhaps the most striking aspect of the commercial is
the sarcastic tone of the narrator. Analysts say sarcasm is a
dangerous weapon in commercials because if no actual humor is
evident, sarcasm can come across as petty and malicious and turn
off swing voters. The tone may also detract from the message, which
seeks to exploit Gore's vulnerability on the matter of credibility.
The timing of this commercial _ unusually early and coinciding with
the slide of Gov. George W. Bush in the polls _ suggests a certain
desperation by Republicans and an implicit assumption that negative
advertising works. Whether it will prove to be a breakthrough
commercial of some sort remains to be seen, but it is certainly
laying the groundwork for harsher attacks to come, from both sides.

BIOTECH FIRM TO SELL LEFTOVER SURGICAL TISSUE FOR GENE STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Beginning next week some surgery patients at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center will be asked to allow leftover
tissue from their operations to be delivered to a Massachusetts
biotech company that will attempt to sell it to genetic researchers
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering agreement between the hospital and biotech
startup Ardais Corp., of Lexington, marks the latest effort to make
sense of the deluge of information coming from the Human Genome
Project, which traced much of the human genetic map but did not
tell scientists exactly what each gene does.
</P>
<P>
   Ardais hopes to eventually create a massive tissue catalog,
allowing researchers to place Internet orders for tissue samples
from patients with the specific diseases they are studying.
</P>
<P>
   Both the hospital and the tissue bank want to help scientists
match genes to particular diseases, then develop gene-based cures.
Hundreds of conditions, from cancer to schizophrenia are thought to
have genetic roots. However, genetic research is often plodding
because of the difficulty in obtaining tissue samples.
</P>
<P>
   Four area hospitals are in talks with Ardais to enter into
similar arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel owns a small part of Ardais, and said Thursday that
all profits from the arrangement would be put back into medical
research.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was approved by Beth Israel's internal ethics board, as
well as a host of outside medical ethicists. Duke University
Medical Center signed a similar deal this week with Ardais. Several
other out-of-state hospitals are in negotiations with the private
company, which is financed by a small group of venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue samples from the hospital will be sent to Ardais
accompanied by detailed records on patients' family medical
history, age, prescription drug use, and numerous other criteria
relevant to genetic research. But the samples will be anonymous,
containing an alpha-numeric code understood only by Ardais
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, we will protect the rights and
confidentiality of patients,'' said Eric Gordon, president and CEO
of Ardais.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said his company was aware of the ethical questions
involved, and spent weeks with outside ethicists working through
the issues. One of them, Rabbi Meir Sendor of the Young Israel of
Sharon synagogue, said he was impressed with the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly seem to conform with very high standards of
confidentiality and privacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Beth Israel patients asked to participate will
be cancer patients, said hospital officials, and some of the top
cancer researchers in the country also consulted with Ardais.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with their program,'' said Dr. Richard
Klausner, director of the National Cancer Institute, who met
briefly with company executives.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that Ardais must be ``clear and transparent and
absolutely committed to making sure that all the normal steps of
patient confidentiality are even higher than usual because of their
commercial motives.''
</P>
<P>
   Ardais was founded in 1999 with the sole purpose of creating a
tissue bank for genetics researchers. The company has 24 employees.
Gordon said he wants to sign up 20 hospitals by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next week, nurses paid for by Ardais will ask some
Beth Israel patients, before they are operated on, if they wish to
participate. Surgeons will be shielded from their decisions to
ensure their performance will not be affected. If a patient agrees,
the excess tissue _ which otherwise would have been thrown away _
will be transferred from the operating room to Ardais' freezers in
Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only arrangement that goes right into the OR to
collect the samples. I haven't heard of that before,'' said Boston
University medical ethicist George Annas.
</P>
<P>
   Annas said the program appeared sound but expressed concern with
a portion of the confidentiality agreement that patients will be
asked to sign, which says: ``The research that is done with your
tissue may not help you directly but it may very well help you or
others in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may benefit. Those are magic words to patients. You can't
say that. The only people that will benefit are the company and
researchers,'' Annas said.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel officials said the hospital's only motive is
furthering genetic research. All profits from the hospital's shares
in Ardais will be put back into the hospital's own scientific work,
said hospital officials.

SPORTS COLUMN: AGASSI IS ABSENT IN SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are days when an adult goes to work and just
doesn't feel like being there. We all have them, the acceptance of
the mind's giving in to distraction and the body's surrender to
fatigue. The person in the cubicle next door does better, and you
realize you could not do a darn thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi bombed out of the U.S. Open Thursday and sounded
like he could not do a darned thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry you lost,'' someone told him after he fell in
straight sets to the Frenchman, Arnaud Clement, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The guy was just being courteous, given the magnitude of the
upset and the tumultuous state of Agassi's family life, the breast
cancer that has afflicted his mother, Elizabeth, and sister,
Tammee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be too sorry,'' said Agassi, quite politely.
</P>
<P>
   While we could only speculate that Agassi played with a heavy
heart, we watched him maneuver on leaden legs. The man who has
smoked the angriest forehands tennis was seen playing a shockingly
flat-footed match, which you can get away when you serve aces, like
Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   What went on him first, mind or body, only Agassi knew, but as
he said earlier in the week, ``I think the more toll you take on
your body, the more difficult it is for you to stay hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a distant and defensive Agassi, nothing resembling the
tiger who showed up in Harare, Zimbabwe, the first week in
February, riding a tidal wave of energy from Melbourne, where he
had claimed the Australian Open title. It was his third Grand Slam
title in four events. His 30th birthday only weeks away, Agassi had
achieved a modern tennis miracle, reinventing himself, better than
ever, at an age most peers were on the way out, if not already
gone.
</P>
<P>
   A few of us covering that Davis Cup event, John McEnroe's debut
as captain, watched Agassi practice that week _ shirtless, of
course _ at the Harare Sports Center, and everyone had the same
reaction to how ferociously Agassi was striking the ball. Even
McEnroe was amazed, and he was the guy who said, after being
confronted by the teen-aged hairball in 1986 at Stratton Mountain,
Vt., ``I've never seen anyone hit it that hard.'' Unfortunately for
Agassi, the last we saw of him after he won his second match in
Harare's heat and thin air, he was doubled over, vomiting into a
flowerpot. He went home under medical supervision, and that was the
breaking of his wave. ``That's not an opinion,'' he agreed. ``All
you have to do is look at the results. I had a couple of semis, and
that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Agassi's career, he has played to extremes, going way
beyond the proverbial bad stretch to the complete bottoming out.
``When I'm in it, I go hard,'' he said, before opining,
half-jokingly, that he's lasted this long because ``I take off
every other year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightweight critics have made a constant target of Agassi for
not meeting their expectations of what his career should be, for
not being Sampras. Yet Agassi always seemed to be a more complex
personality, with a taxing baseline style that made the early
retiree out of no less a champion than Bjorn Borg.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras compared Agassi's family situation to his playing
through the illness and passing of his coach, Tim Gullikson. Who
can say how these things affect people, on any given day? Thursday,
17-year-old Jelena Dokic easily won her match 24 hours after her
father was physically removed from the premises. Maybe Agassi's
family situation weighed him down. Maybe it contributed, less than
Clement, to a bad day at the office. Maybe it was just one of those
late afternoons when Agassi stepped into the energy-challenged
Arthur Ashe Stadium to feel the humid air and the blazing sun and
soon knew in his heart, mind and legs that the guy across the net
was going to do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he came in here with the expectation of being
able to impose his will on his opponents,'' said Perry Rogers,
Agassi's business manager and close friend. ``He hasn't had the
best summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically and emotionally, Rogers agreed. Agassi's commitment
for the Olympics remains firm, Rogers said, but then, so was his
promise to play the full year of Davis Cup, until the summer turned
cold and he backed out on McEnroe last month in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   He's 30, and when he doesn't feel like going to work, he is rich
enough to not have to. Agassi left the U.S. Open Thursday, trailed
by his entourage, including Steffi Graf, and he seemed to take with
him the aging athlete's blessing and his curse. The perspective on
how defeat should fit into his life. &QL;

FCC RULING PROVIDES BOOST FOR MAKERS OF WIRELESS NETWORK DEVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that may stimulate development of wireless products
for home use, the Federal Communications Commission announced
Thursday that it had eased restrictions on part of the radio
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The change affects the 2.4-gigahertz band, an area used by
companies that produce wireless local-area computer networks, or
LANs. Such networks enable people to transmit data from, for
example, a laptop computer to a desktop computer _ or to to a
printer _ without wires. They have been adopted by office
complexes, college campuses and, to a lesser extent, consumers at
home, and avoid the time, cost and construction of installing wires
that connect traditional networks.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents have argued that opening the spectrum will give rise
to consumer products that wirelessly transmit large amounts of
data, like streaming video and digital music. For example, it may
enable someone to send music from a desktop computer to a laptop,
or to use a cordless phone to pick up a call that has come in over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule change has given us everything we need to develop
these next-generation wireless devices,'' said Ben Manny, chairman
of the HomeRF Working Group, a coalition of technology companies
that asked the FCC two years ago to relax its restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the members of the HomeRF group are Compaq; Intel; Proxim,
a wireless LAN company in Sunnyvale, Calif.; and Siemens, which has
developed cordless phones that use the 2.4-gigahertz band.
</P>
<P>
   From a technical standpoint, the ruling gives new muscle to a
radio-signal technique called frequency hopping. For years,
proponents of frequency hopping _ who include members of the HomeRF
group _ have squared off with engineers who favor a different
technique, called direct sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless LAN products with direct-sequence systems offer data
speeds of up to 10 megabits per second, a rate equal to that on
most high-speed networks. But until Thursday, products using
frequency hopping could reach speeds of only 1.6 megabits per
second.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC rule change widens the spectrum for frequency hopping by
allowing signals to be sent across channels that each span 5
megahertz _ up from the 1 MHz a channel allowed previously. With
the added space, engineers say, HomeRF systems will be able to
offer data speeds equal to those of systems based on
direct-sequence technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It levels the playing field,'' Manny said.
</P>
<P>
   But some companies have already been developing wireless
products for consumers based on the direct-sequence technique,
which is so far associated with systems that cost more than
consumers are willing to pay. Apple Computer, for example, sells a
wireless system called AirPort for transferring data between home
computers.
</P>
<P>
   That several products are already in development has led Jeff
Abramowitz, president of the Wireless LAN Association, a trade
group, to caution that the change could lead to a plethora of
consumer products that run under different systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does create the potential for confusion in the
marketplace,'' said Abramowitz, who is also the vice president for
marketing for NoWires Needed, a product that uses the
direct-sequence system and is sold by Intersil, a company in
Irvine, Calif. ``But in the long term it will not affect what is
happening over all.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC ruling did not give the HomeRF advocates everything they
requested. They had asked permission to use 75 channels across the
2.4-gigahertz band. But several engineers protested that hopping
frequencies over 75 channels of 5 MHz in width would lead to
interference with other devices, because the channels would have to
overlap. The FCC limited the rule change to only 15 permissible
channels instead.

<P>
   At first blush, the current issue of The Journal of Finance
contains good news for the mutual fund industry, and from a most
unlikely source: an academic study.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to almost every other scholarly look at fund
performance, a new one _ by Russ Wermers, a finance professor at
the University of Maryland _ concludes that fund managers have
market-beating abilities in picking stocks. Specifically, Wermers
found that the average stock bought by a fund manager outperformed
the market by 1.5 percentage points a year over the 20 years ended
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But when that finding is weighed against another from the
professor's research, I can only conclude that the study is a
devastating indictment of fund-industry inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The average fund, the study found, delivered annual returns that
were eight-tenths of a percentage point below the market's over
that period. Taken together, the two facts mean that the average
mutual fund frittered away 2.3 percentage points of return
annually. Today, that would mean $92 billion a year, considering
that the industry now manages about $4 trillion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, most researchers believed that the average fund
produced mediocre performance because managers had subpar ability
to pick stocks. But to me, the professor's study shows that the
real culprit has been the fund industry's inability to translate
good stock-picking to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   For years, we were unable to identify this culprit, because no
one had been able to measure funds' pure, theoretical return _ how
much they would have made if they had no expenses or trading costs
and were always fully invested. The professor filled that gap by
constructing a database that contained not only the performance of
virtually every fund from 1975 through 1994, but also the stocks
that each owned.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wermers, the largest single source of fund
inefficiency was expenses _ investment managers' salaries and
administrative and marketing costs. Roughly 1.1 of the difference
of 2.3 percentage points was spent on such costs. Today, that is
about $44 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The second-largest source is the lower returns of funds'
nonstock holdings. The typical fund must hold a significant amount
of cash so that it can meet redemptions. Because returns on cash
lag behind those of the stock market over the long term, the
typical fund has weaker performance than if it had been fully
invested. Wermers estimated that these cash and other nonstock
holdings cut the average annual return by 0.7 percentage points _
about $28 billion or so in today's terms.
</P>
<P>
   The third reason for the gap is transaction costs. Wermers
defined this category broadly, to include not only commissions and
bid-asked spreads but also the poorer executions that result when a
fund tries to buy or sell a large position in a stock. Unlike the
average investor, a big fund can move a stock price significantly
when trying to buy or sell _ forcing it to buy at a higher price
and sell at a lower price, with correspondingly poorer performance.
Though commissions and spreads have diminished in recent years,
Wermers estimated that transaction costs of all kinds reduced
performance by 0.5 percentage points or so a year _ or $20 billion
today.
</P>
<P>
   Note that the study did not even consider front- or back-end
loads, or sales charges. The $92 billion price of the industry's
inefficiency is above and beyond the load factor.
</P>
<P>
   Devastating as the conclusions may be for the fund industry,
they contain a silver lining for the rest of us. In contrast to
previous studies that found that it was impossible to consistently
pick stocks that outperform the market, Wermers shows that not only
is it possible, but also that it is not particularly unusual. By
creating our own portfolios _ and assuming that we can pick stocks
as well as the average fund manager _ we stand a good chance of
saving the bulk of the 2.3 annual percentage points spent on fund
inefficiencies _ and a betting chance of actually outperforming the
market.

TOYOTA SOLARA: ADULT FUN IN THE SUN THAT YOU CAN DEPEND ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toyota is a very successful automaker and it got that way by
making its brand synonymous with dependability.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the Corolla, built in a joint-venture factory with
General Motors in California; the car's Toyota nameplate has made
it a far better seller than the virtually identical (and slightly
cheaper) Chevy Prizm built on the same production lines by the same
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many foreign automakers, Toyota has recognized that many
Americans really do like the kinds of cars that Detroit offers. It
set out to make them, and to make them better.
</P>
<P>
   Want a comfortable family sedan? Try the Camry, a quieter and
far more reliable version of Mom's old Fairlane. You want to
recapture the sense of arrival that Dad had when he got the big
raise and moved up from an Impala to a LeSabre?
</P>
<P>
   Try the Avalon, with its cloudlike ride and optional bench
seats. Want a hushed, soothing luxury car without the firm
suspension and serious road feel of the Mercedes E-Class? The Lexus
LS is waiting quietly for you.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Toyota is back with another marketing marvel: a
midsize convertible at a reasonable price. It won't knock the socks
off serious drivers. Indeed, it won't knock off anybody's socks,
but that's just the point. The Toyota Camry Solara convertible
captures the sense of effortless, tamely glamorous fun in the sun
that so many middle-aged, middle-class adults yearn for.
</P>
<P>
   The Solara convertible is, literally, a variation of the Solara
coupe. Each convertible begins as a semifinished coupe, just off
the production line at Toyota's factory in Cambridge, Ontario. Then
it is shipped to a nearby plant of the American Sunroof Co., a
parts supplier that makes more than a million convertible tops
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Once the well-designed power top is installed, complete with
glass rear window, and some metal is added to stiffen the frame,
the car goes back to Cambridge for painting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since any freshly minted Solara is, in effect, available for
factory conversion, ever-eager-to-please Toyota offers the
convertible in all three Solara trim levels. The base SE model
($25,550 for 2001, including delivery charge) comes with a
2.2-liter 4-cylinder engine borrowed from the Camry, with 16 valves
and a horsepower rating of 135. Standard are a 5-speed manual
transmission, air-conditioning, halogen headlights, a stereo system
with cassette and CD players, power windows, power locks and what
Toyota calls ``wood grain-style accents.''
</P>
<P>
   The SE V6 ($28,490) gets you, no surprise, the 3-liter V-6 from
the Camry, with 24 valves and 200 horsepower. It has antilock
brakes and a four-speed electronically controlled automatic
transmission, both options on the base car. The top-line SLE V6
($30,970) adds leather, a power driver's seat, 16-inch aluminum
wheels (instead of 15-inchers), a JBL sound system, remote locking
and (alas) a stubby spoiler on the rear deck.
</P>
<P>
   Side air bags are a $250 option, and traction control ($300) is
an option only on the SLE.
</P>
<P>
   The black-leather interior of the SLE V6 test car was handsome
and functional, if a little fussy and old-fashioned-looking
compared with the latest designs of several European manufacturers.
The front seats are nothing special, but the rear seating is a
marvel of ergonomic design. Access is easy and egress even easier,
thanks to a foot pedal that one can use to slide the front seat
forward. Two adults can sit back there in relative comfort, in
spite of the space commandeered for the power-roof machinery.
Still, the trunk is adequate for a couple of suitcases and a set of
Callaway clubs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About that convertible top: The American Sunroof Co. did its job
very well. Flip two levers, press a button and there is the sky.
Getting the top back up and locked in place is just as carefree.
With the roof up, visibility is, by the standards of convertibles,
excellent. Again measured in relative terms, the wind noise with
the top closed is subdued. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this is a car, not a cabana, and the driving experience
counts, too. The V-6 in the SLE has enough power, but is nothing to
brag about. I wouldn't have high hopes for the 4-cylinder version.
Toyota doesn't publish acceleration times, but the 8.2-second
figure that Car and Driver recorded for a 0-to-60 sprint in the
Solara coupe seemed about right.
</P>
<P>
   The handling, too, was adequate but not overwhelming. The Solara
convertible is no embarrassment at the speed limit on a curvy road,
but front-wheel drive, all-weather tires and a relatively soft
suspension make it quick to protest attempts at hard cornering. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My guess, though, is that these shortcomings will matter little
to potential buyers. The real competition to the SLE V6 is not the
lithe (and roughly $6,000 more expensive) BMW 325Ci convertible,
but the very American (and roughly $3,000 less expensive) Chrysler
Sebring JXi convertible. Nobody buys a Sebring for the way it
handles.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota certainly knows how to build serious cars for serious
drivers _ think of the Lexus GS 400. The Solara convertible shows
that the company also knows how to build a car for baby boomers who
just want to add a little sunshine to their long commutes and their
weekends in the country. &QL;

 &HT;    For Braves, Mets again in the way

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the race in the National League East goes down to
the wire, the six games the Braves and New York Mets play in
September will be doubly important.
</P>
<P>
   In case of a tie, the season series _ not a playoff game _ will
determine the NL East winner, as long as the other team is going to
be the NL wild card.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Braves have the edge. Atlanta leads the series 4-3
after splitting a four-game series in New York and winning two of
three at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams, with the best records in the National League,
play a three-game series in Atlanta on Sept. 18-20 and three games
in New York on Sept. 26-28.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves dominated the Mets the past two seasons, especially
at Turner Field. In winning the season series 9-3 each year, the
Braves were 6-0 at home in 1998 and 5-1 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Mets trailed Atlanta by just one game in the NL
East when they opened a three-game series at Turner Field on Sept.
21. But the Braves swept the series and clinched their eighth
consecutive division title the next weekend in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves play 15 of their 28 September games at home, while
the Mets have only 12 of their 29 at Shea Stadium. The Mets,
however, have easier opponents. New York plays a three-game series
at St. Louis beginning tonight, but then meets teams with losing
records, except for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the NL playoffs, one best-of-five series will start Oct. 3
and the other Oct. 4. At the moment, the NL East winner would open
at home against the division winner with the worst record _ St.
Louis. The wild card would start on the road against San Francisco.
The team with the home-field advantage gets Games 1 and 2 and, if
necessary, 5.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ After struggling for a week to seize the
offensive from Vice President Al Gore, aides to Gov. George W. Bush
said Thursday that they had approved a new and sharp attack
commercial that strikes directly at the Democratic nominee's
character and mocks his appearance at a Buddhist temple
fund-raising event four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot, paid for by the Republican National
Committee, will go on the air on Friday in 17 states, and comes
just a week after Bush personally blocked another commercial
sponsored by the party that also questioned Gore's truthfulness.
The move exposed rifts within the Republican camp over how to
attack Gore without violating Bush's vow to keep his campaign
positive.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said they had wholeheartedly approved the contents
and tone of the new spot, which they described as
``tongue-in-cheek.'' They said it was a response to critical
advertisements run by the Democrats against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial shows a television set on a kitchen counter with
Gore on the screen and an unseen woman complaining that the vice
president is ``reinventing himself on television again.'' At one
point the commercial shows an image of Gore at the Buddhist temple
event in 1996 and another segment shows him saying, ``I took the
initiative in creating the Internet.'' At that point, the narrator
says sarcastically, ``Yeah, and I invented the remote control.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the commercial sparked a series of accusations and
counteraccusations between the two campaigns over which one had
``gone negative'' first. Gore's camp wasted no time responding to
the commercial, which was widely shown on television news programs
and on the Internet during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also switched gears on his campaign day, scaling back plans
to focus on a patients' bill of rights in the belief that the
Republican advertisement would backfire and that the Democrats
should not create news that would distract public attention from
it.
</P>
<P>
   The new commercial is part of a broader, coordinated effort by
the Republicans to raise doubts about Gore's ethics and integrity,
which the Bush campaign clearly views as the vice president's
greatest vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   All this week, Bush has criticized Gore as being a weak leader
who broke promises made during the 1992 campaign to cut taxes and
expand prescription drug coverage. And Thursday, in a speech at a
high school in Holland, Ohio, Bush accused Gore of using ``empty
rhetoric'' that had disillusioned young people.
</P>
<P>
   But this more aggressive strategy also comes at the end of a
two-week period in which Gore, clearly enjoying a postconvention
bounce in the polls, has forced Bush to defend himself on issues
like tax cuts, prescription drug prices and when the candidates
would be debating. Since the Democratic National Convention last
month, Gore has pulled even with Bush in many national polls, and
he is even ahead in some swing states where he had previously
trailed.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Democrats asserted Thursday that Bush was
turning negative in an attempt to stanch weakening poll numbers and
reinvigorate a lackluster campaign. They also accused Bush of
hypocrisy, citing his pledge at the Republican National Convention
in early August ``to change the tone of Washington to one of
civility and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said Bush
had ``broken his own promise not to engage in personal, negative
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen this from Bush before, in the primaries,'' Hattaway
added. ``When his back was against the wall, he went negative on
John McCain. Now he's talked out of both sides of his mouth about
changing the tone of the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides have said they had every intention of endorsing
commercials that raised questions about Gore's ethics. But the
content of such advertisements has been a subject of debate among
Bush's top advisers and among Republican officials.
</P>
<P>
   While campaign officials said they viewed questions about the
vice president's credibility as an important part of their message,
they have also been mindful of their candidate's pledge to run an
uplifting, positive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on Thursday afternoon, as the Republican Party was
releasing the new commercial, Bush was telling a boisterous
audience at a high school here that ``politics doesn't have to be
ugly and mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in the Bush campaign and in the Republican Party
have said that the best way to deliver a tough advertisement
questioning Gore's ethics was to employ humor, so as to avoid
appearing mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good-natured way of making a very important point,''
Karen P. Hughes, Bush's director of communications, said of the new
Republican spot. ``That is: the gaping credibility gap between what
Vice President Gore says and what Vice President Gore does.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts were divided about whether the honey-thick
sarcasm of the advertisement would help soften its negative
message, or turn voters off. Ken Goldstein of the University of
Wisconsin, who specializes in analyzing political ads, argued that
a lighter touch could make a negative message more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ad gets at what Al Gore's weaknesses are, but it doesn't
do it in what I think some people would consider an unfair way,''
Goldstein said on Political Points, a joint Webcast of ABC News and
the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Carrick, a Democratic consultant, said the commercial
would undermine what has been one of Bush's prime selling points:
his genial personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's biggest asset is his sunny, hopeful presentation of
himself,'' Carrick said. ``Since the Democratic convention, the
Bush people have been trying to become the very mean-spirited
Republicans they have been trying to run away from.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spot, titled ``Really,'' a woman can be heard commenting
on various television images of Gore. Gore is then shown standing
alongside Buddhist monks in saffron robes at the Hsi Lai Temple
near Los Angeles in 1996. Gore contends he did not know the
luncheon was a fund-raiser. But two Democratic fund-raisers were
later found guilty for their roles in soliciting illegal campaign
contributions from people, including monks, who attended the event.
</P>
<P>
   The woman narrator then says, ``Who's he gonna be today? The Al
Gore who raises campaign money at a Buddhist temple? Or the one who
promises campaign finance reform?''
</P>
<P>
   The spot will start running on Friday in closely contested
states, including Ohio, Michigan, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Missouri
and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican commercial that Bush ordered canceled last week
featured excerpts from a six-year-old interview in which a
stammering Gore said President Clinton had never lied in his
political career.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, which was never broadcast, suggests that Gore
was refusing to acknowledge that Clinton had made deceptive remarks
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But the advertisement
was actually based on an NBC News interview in which Gore was
talking about his criticism of Oliver North, then a candidate for
Senate from Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later said he objected to the commercial because Gore's
comments had been taken out of context and ``had nothing to do with
the affairs of the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two weeks have been difficult for Bush. Last week, Bush
acknowledged that he needed to do a better job selling his proposed
across-the-board income tax cut _ and then struggled to provide a
coherent explanation of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Bush's aides had pledged he would stick to his
education agenda. But almost every day, other issues have intruded
to dilute his message.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush has been able to ratchet up his criticisms of Gore's
character. In two rousing speeches Thursday Bush laced time and
again into Gore's character and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seven and a half years of empty rhetoric, I can
understand why the young of America become disillusioned,'' he told
3,000 raucous students, parents and Republican partisans in a high
school gymnasium in Holland. ``It's time to put somebody in office
who will do in office exactly what he tells the American people he
intends to do. And that is what I'm going to do should I become the
president of the United States.''

 &HT;    GOP airs first TV ad attacking Gore's credibility
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new Republican ad begins airing today in 16
states that for the first time attacks Vice President Al Gore's
personal credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot features a woman in her kitchen with
snapshots of Gore flickering across her television screen.
``There's Al Gore reinventing himself on television again,'' the
woman says. ``Like I'm not going to notice. Who's he going to be
today?''
</P>
<P>
   The ad questions Gore's claim that he is committed to campaign
finance reform by raising his controversial visit to a Buddhist
temple in California to raise campaign funds in 1996, an event that
Gore says he did not know was a fund-raiser. The ad also digs at
Gore's claim that he ``took the initiative in creating the
Internet'' while in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee produced and is paying for the
ad, but it is running with the blessing of GOP presidential nominee
George W. Bush, said RNC spokesman Clifford May.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign immediately denounced the ad and accused the
Bush campaign of resorting to the very type of negative campaigning
that Bush vowed to avoid. The Gore campaign turned to running mate
Joe Lieberman to respond to the ad's claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than focusing on the serious issues before our country,
our opponents have hit the airwaves with paid political negative
personal attack ads,'' Lieberman said. ``These new attack ads break
(Bush's) promise not to launch personal attacks in this campaign.
And they drag us back to the worst politics of the past. It seems
to me today, that Governor Bush has sadly changed his tune about
changing the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   In a gambit that voters will be turned off by the ad's negative
tone, Democratic Party officials said they do not plan to respond
with an ad of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are going to reject this,'' said Jenny
Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. ``We
are not going to respond to this, because we don't think this is
what the American people want to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both the RNC and Bush defended the advertisement
as a legitimate way to raise questions about Gore's truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a really good-natured way to make a fundamental
point, which is that there is a difference between what Al Gore
says and what Al Gore does,'' said May. ``I don't think there is
anything personal about it. When you talk about campaign finance
reform, you are clearly talking about issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bush and Republicans had steered clear of such
pointed attacks on Gore's credibility while Bush was leading in the
polls. The decision to run the ad now, after Gore emerged from the
Democratic National Convention with a healthy bounce in the polls,
showed that Bush and the Republicans are worried about Gore's
surge, Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When George Bush's back is against the wall, he will do
anything to get elected,'' said Mark Fabiani, Gore's communications
director. ``In the primaries, he visited Bob Jones University and
saluted the Confederate flag. Now, Bush, in an act of desperation,
is breaking his own promise not to engage in personal, negative
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which May described as ``tongue in cheek,'' attempts to
poke fun at Gore with a healthy dose of sarcasm. In response to
Gore's claim about creating the Internet, the woman in the ad says,
``Yea, and I invented the remote control, too. Another round of
this and I'll sell my television.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his claim about creating the Internet, made on CNN in
March of last year, Gore has sought to explain himself by saying
that he promoted the funding from Congress that helped the Defense
Department develop the Internet into what it has become today. Gore
also has repeatedly made jokes about the comment in an effort to
defuse the issue as a potential point of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Republican sources said the ad would run for about one week in
16 battleground states, all of which have already seen a deluge of
advertising from both Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The states are: Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It looks like a dachshund following a Great Dane.
</P>
<P>
   The photo, which has become a staple for University of Texas
promotions, shows huge Leonard Davis leading diminutive Hodges
Mitchell through a hole during a football game last season. And
although it was an image of the past promoting the present season,
it also hinted to Davis' future after football.
</P>
<P>
   When the 6-foot-6-inch, 360-pound giant stops leading smaller
running backs, he hopes to guide smaller people. He's already
prepared for that by doing volunteer work with middle school
students as part of one of his UT classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids get intimidated by my size and then they are perfect
angels,'' Davis said. ``We talk about just life in general and how
if you work hard you can have good things in life. I tell them
nothing comes free or easy.''
</P>
<P>
   For Davis, talking to kids is almost as satisfying as making a
big block, like the one Ricky Williams cut behind on the run in
1998 and broke the NCAA career rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like doing it. You can see a difference being made in
someone's life,'' Davis said. ``I tutor them and monitor them and
you can see them open up. When we talk one-on-one they get
comfortable. If they have problems they can talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has always spawned plenty of conversation. When he first
walks into a classroom, students are first amazed, then curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like, `Whoa.' They're amazed and they ask, `How tall
are you? What do you weigh? What's your shoe size?' '' Davis said.
``Then they're amazed that I'm just a regular person.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive ends would be amazed, too. In most eyes, Davis is
definitely not a regular person.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. rates Davis the No. 2 senior
professional prospect, and Davis also was named Preseason
All-America by Playboy, The Sporting News and Street &AMP; Smith's. The
Sporting News listed him as the No. 3-rated Outland Trophy
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially impressive considering that Davis is still
somewhat of novice as offensive tackle. He played defense as a
freshman and was a backup as a sophomore. Last year, his first as a
starter, he was hampered by a sprained ankle _ a considerable
injury when you take into account that his ankle must support 360
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a tender ankle, Davis earned second team All-Big 12
recognition. This year he's healthy, more experienced and in better
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of Leonard's best playing is ahead of him,'' Texas
Coach Mack Brown said. ``He had by far his best spring this year.
Hopefully, we'll see the Leonard that I know is there. I know he'll
have a great pro career. I just hope he starts this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of lining up opposite Davis might spur the same
response from defensive ends that comes from kids who want Davis'
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little shy when they look at me,'' Davis says of the
students. ``They think I'm a monster. (Teammates) Shaun (Rogers)
and Casey (Hampton) always make fun of me. They say, `You big
monster, you're going to scare those little kids.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to be scared. Well, at least not the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting thing is the little kids are so cautious
when they approach him,'' Texas publicist John Bianco said. ``We
were about to leave a game at the Cotton Bowl and these tiny kids
are shaking because they want to get an autograph from Leonard. But
he puts that big hand on their head, and he's a gentle giant. They
walk away saying, `You're nice. Can you come to my party?' ''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Cory Redding practiced but without contact Thursday
night. Lee Jackson, Derrick Dockery, Courtnee Garcia and Ervis Hill
were held out, but are expected to be back in action when the
Longhorns resume practice on Monday. . . . Brown gave the team off
today, Saturday and Sunday and encouraged them to watch football
and relax. ``We encouraged them to get off their feet. We purposely
gave them the time off because it takes 24 to 48 hours to get their
legs back after two-a-days,'' Brown said.

NORDSTROM FAMILY TAKES BACK EXECUTIVE POSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After several years of anemic sales growth, the chairman and
chief executive and the chief financial officer of Nordstrom's Inc.
resigned, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the Nordstrom family, which controls roughly
one-third of the company's stock, have been named to top executive
positions. Blake Nordstrom, 39, will be president, while Bruce
Nordstrom, 66, will be chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released after the stock market closed Thursday,
Enrique Hernandez Jr., a new board member who analysts call the
catalyst for the change, said the board has been disappointed in
the company's performance for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now at the point where we believe the company would
benefit from a different style of leadership,'' he said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, there had been rumors of quarrels between the
Nordstrom family; John Whitacre, the outgoing chairman and chief
executive; and Michael Stein, the departing chief financial
officer. Whitacre, who took the helm of the company in 1997, was
the first nonfamily chief executive in the company's 100-year
history, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Whitacre's tenure did not produce dynamic sales
increases at the department store chain, which is based in Seattle,
many stock analysts were not happy to see the company return to
family management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed,'' said Michael Exstein, a retail analyst
with Credit Suisse First Boston. ``I think Nordstrom had a problem,
and John Whitacre and the team he had assembled had started a
process to bring the store toward the realities of retail today.
They took steps that were utterly necessary, like pooling
purchases, reducing costs, not resorting to selling on price.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitacre and his team were also widely credited by analysts with
bringing Nordstrom's notorious inventory overstocking problems
under control.
</P>
<P>
   Exstein raised concern that the family would not make the hard
decisions needed to right the stalled retailer. He pointed to
Dillard's, another company where the founding family has a similar
stake, which has been struggling in the current competitive retail
climate.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom's stock has been in decline for almost a year and a
half. Until the announcement last night, it had been trading at
about $17.50 a share, almost 50 percent below its 52-week high of
$34.50 a share. At the end of July, Nordstrom warned that earnings
would fall short of forecasts and the stock plunged. Nordstrom
stock closed Thursday at $17.25, down $1.13.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Lakner, a retail analyst with CIBC World Markets, was
more positive about the management changes: ``It was under Bruce
Nordstrom and his generation that Nordstrom saw its greatest years,
in the 1980s,'' she said. Still, Lakner is not recommending the
stock. ``Nordstrom is still a company in search of an identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom said it hired a national search firm before settling
on Blake Nordstrom to take the role of president. Nordstrom started
working for the company in 1974. He has worked as a stocker,
salesperson, buyer, merchandise manager and store manager. In 1995,
Blake Nordstrom and his five brothers and cousins were named
co-presidents of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In February 2000, the company eliminated the office of the
co-presidency after John Whitacre reorganized the company into five
units. He named Blake Nordstrom president of the Nordstrom Rack
Group.

IN AN UNRULY REAL ESTATE MARKET, TRY THIS BROKER'S GUIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHLEEN PENDER  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How much should a buyer expect to pay for a
house in San Francisco when there are multiple offers?
</P>
<P>
   If there are six to eight bids, the winning buyer is likely to
pay 20 to 30 percent above the asking price, according to a new
study by San Francisco real estate broker John M. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Lee says he conducted the survey because the old rules of thumb
no longer apply in the Bay Area, where many homes are deliberately
underpriced to create a feeding frenzy among buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a former chemical engineer with an MBA in real estate and
finance, surveyed San Francisco listing agents and asked for the
following information on homes and condos sold this year: address,
listing price, sales price and number of offers received.
</P>
<P>
   He got about 100 transactions and plotted the information on a
graph. Using ``regression analysis,'' which involves drawing a
curve that best fits the data points, he came up with some
interesting observations.
</P>
<P>
   First off, Lee found that it takes only six to eight offers to
drive prices 20 to 30 percent above the asking price. ``On a
$400,000 listing, we should get $100,000 over (asking price) with
just six to eight offers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of offers increases, so does the price, but only
to a point. After 20 to 25 bids, the sales price remains fairly
constant. ``It is difficult to obtain bids over 50 percent above
the asking price,'' Lee says.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Lee advised sellers to price homes at 5 percent
above market value, based on the sale of comparable homes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a home listed at market value or even 5 percent below is
likely to attract only one or two offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers are expecting to offer over the asking price, and thus
when they see something priced at market, they automatically think
that in order to get it, they will have to go higher, and thus will
be overpaying for it,'' Lee explains. This is a new phenomenon, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   To generate five to 10 offers _ which Lee considers optimal _ a
house needs to be priced 15 to 22 percent below fair market value,
based on comparables.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's study is not scientific, and the 100 transactions he
included represent only a fraction of the 3,000-plus homes and
condos sold in San Francisco this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, it could give buyers and sellers one more tool for
pricing a home in San Francisco or any Bay Area location where the
market remains overheated.
</P>
<P>
   Lee says buyers should ask the listing agent, ``How many offers
do you expect, and how many do you have in hand?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to the chart on Page B4, if five offers are
submitted, the house might sell for about 18 percent more than the
original asking price. ``It'll work sometimes. It's not 100 percent
accurate,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy could become moot if the real estate market, which
has already cooled a bit, goes into a deep freeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pricing is an art, not a science,'' Lee adds. And sometimes,
he says, it's not even an art _ ``It's an emotion.''
</P>

California Municipal Bond Shortage, reader Sharon G. asked this

GORE TAKES ON INSURANCE INDUSTRY, DEFENDS LIEBERMAN IN SEATTLE
VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore brought his call for a strong
patients' bill of rights to thousands of cheering supporters at a
downtown Seattle rally Thursday, and in a later interview defended
the right of public officials to discuss their religious beliefs
and to give a human response to ``the emotions of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has used a four-day swing with vice presidential nominee
Joe Lieberman to hit hard at the issue of health care. But the
Democrats' ticket is also facing questions about Lieberman's strong
profession of his religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore has been dealing with a very public expression of his
own feelings. Comics' barbs, usually directed at his stiffness,
have shifted to ``The Kiss,'' Gore's prolonged buss of wife Tipper
on the closing night of the Democratic Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked if I was sending a message: Yes, I was sending
a message to Tipper, and she received it,'' Gore said in the
interview, repeating a line he has been polishing since the
convention ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was overwhelmed with the emotions of the moment,'' he added.
``It was a moment for which Tipper and I worked for many years. I
wanted to share it with her. I just kissed her.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, aside from referring to the Northwest as ``God's
country,'' steered clear of spiritual talk at the rally at Westlake
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidential nominee, a devout Jew, has spoken freely
of his religious beliefs in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended him, indicating that personal values were a major
factor in his decision to put the Connecticut senator on the
Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a man of great faith,'' Gore said in the interview. `It
is a faith that motivated him to fight for civil rights in the
1960s, and in the 1990s to protect this country's environment. ...
He and I agree on the separation of church and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that ``expression of religious beliefs is protected in
the Constitution, even if you are in public life.'' In American
government, he added, the president must serve as more than just a
political leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our system of government, the president is both head of
state and head of government,'' he said. ``As head of state, the
president has duties that include presenting a vision of the
country's future.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington and other battleground states, Gore is doing a
dicey political walk.
</P>
<P>
   He is claiming credit for America's prosperity while separating
himself from the personal conduct of Bill Clinton, the president he
has loyally served for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman indirectly pointed out differences between Gore and
Clinton in a succession of carefully worded sentences at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Al and Tipper Gore have been married for 30 years,
and described the Gores' life as ``anchored in faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is not an award for past performance,'' Gore
declared as he took the microphone. He ticked off goals of a
Gore-Lieberman administration: ``Attack global warming. Reduce
pollution. Stop sprawl. ... Get guns out of the hands of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ticket, appearing on a workday, drew far fewer
people than the throng of 15,000 that greeted Bill Clinton on a hot
July Saturday in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton crowd was largely curious. The rally Thursday
consisted largely of party faithful, including many union
activists.
</P>
<P>
   At times, chants of ``Let Ralph Debate!'' could be heard from a
small group of Ralph Nader supporters, kept beyond the fences.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats sounded populist themes Thursday, with America's
insurance companies taking a pounding at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for a patients' bill of rights, Gore declared that
medical decisions should not be made by ``some bean counter sitting
behind a computer terminal who doesn't have a license to practice
medicine and a right to play God.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman told of meeting an elderly stroke victim in San Diego,
forced to use a walker because a managed care provider had refused
to pay for medicine that would have relieved his pain.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke, preceding Gore and Lieberman, made a mocking
reference to ``insurance company CEOs and numbers crunchers.''
American Nurses Assn. president Mary Foley, whose union endorsed
Gore Thursday, added: ``Treatment decisions should be made by
health professionals, not insurance bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has renounced the traditional partisan hit-man role of
a vice presidential nominee. Thursday, however, he showed that he
can go after a foe with words of admonishment.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party began airing a TV spot in 17 states that
questions Gore's credibility. It shows his 1996 fund-raising visit
to a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles, and Gore's statement that he
took the lead in inventing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Al Gore reinventing himself,'' says an announcer.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman argued that the ``politically negative personal attack
ads'' violate GOP nominee George W. Bush's promise not to launch
such TV assaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sad to say, George Bush has changed his tune about changing
the tone (of the campaign),'' Lieberman told the Westlake rally.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, Gore and Lieberman engaged in what has become a
election-eve ritual for many Washington state politicians _ shaking
hands at a ferry terminal, and riding with commuters to and from
Bainbridge Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is mass transit in Seattle,'' Gore joked of the commute
by boat.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president entered the coffee shop aboard the Wenatchee
and aksed: ``Is there any unhealthy breakfast food here?''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Siddons, who was traveling to Bainbridge, asked Gore what
he would do to restore salmon to the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salmon represent the linchpin of this whole region's
balance between the economy and the environment,'' Gore said. ``The
focus on the salmon works for everybody because when you do the
right thing, (you) keep the economy strong, and keep the
environment healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Siddons described himself as a likely Gore voter,
saying: ``His response was helful to me. At least he knows what's
going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the interview, Gore reiterated his pledge to hold a
regionwide ``salmon summit'' early in his administration to work
out a program to restore salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to bring all parties together,'' he said. ``I intend to
consult first before deciding where and when.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting would be patterned after the 1993 Northwest forestry
summit, at which Clinton and Gore spent a day hearing from all
sides on the future of the region's old-growth forests. It produced
a plan that reduced national forest logging by more than 80
percent, but allowed some cutting to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Gore added, he will hold town meetings around the
country on a variety of topics, as a device to stay in contact with
``the person on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president promised never to let the majesty of the
nation's highest office turn his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had the opportunity to see that job from a close-up
viewpoint,'' he said. ``I think I have some immunity from the
trappings of the office.''

can then be sold for meat. So far the farm is only breeding dogs,
not slaughtering them. But plans are in the works to build China's
first large-scale dog meat factory. (Julie Chao/Cox News Service)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Suppose a rich uncle gave you a new car, or regularly sent
checks to help with the monthly payments? Two California companies
are playing Daddy Warbucks, but their generosity has strings
attached: The cars serve as eye-catching mobile billboards for
corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Susan Jarboe, an account executive with an
employment agency, parades around San Francisco in a Volkswagen New
Beetle with silver-and-purple bull's-eyes on each side _ a come-on
for an Internet portal called MobileEngines.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of stares,'' she said. ``I get stopped at least 20
or 25 times a week.'' Passersby want to know about the ad that
covers nearly every square inch of her car.
</P>
<P>
   For being an auto-exhibitionist, Jarboe gets $350 a month from
FreeCar Media of Los Angeles. ``It seemed like a great way to make
my car payment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   FreeCar Media, which started operating in March, and Autowraps,
a San Francisco company that is two months older, are leading a
charge to wrap private cars with advertising, a trend that is
sweeping the West Coast and starting to move east. FreeCar gives
selected motorists two years' use of a new car. The owner is
responsible for insurance, maintenance, fuel and stares. Autowraps
pays participants $100 to $400 a month if they agree to have
advertising slathered on cars they already own.
</P>
<P>
   The chronically shy would not be comfortable in either program,
since the point is to grab attention. The cars are wrapped in
sheets of adhesive vinyl film that fit like pieces of a puzzle. The
film over the windows is perforated, and thus does not restrict the
driver's view.
</P>
<P>
   The process was developed by 3M, the St. Paul, Minn.-based
company responsible for Post-it Notes.
</P>
<P>
   The thin film usually comes in four-foot-long sections, with two
to four sections forming a large image. The film is designed to
withstand wind, snow, rain and speeds of up to 500 miles an hour.
FreeCar Media says it has given away 30 cars. It plans to have 300
on the streets this year and 2,000 by the end of 2001. The company
will not have trouble finding takers; more than 70,000 people have
applied for cars by registering at www.freecar.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are chosen because of the way they drive and the way
they live their life,'' said Lawrence Butler, one of FreeCar's
three founders. He says 4,000 people see a car driven in a big city
for at least an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Autowraps has 40,000 prospects registered at www.autowraps.com,
and 250 vehicles on the road. Advertisers pay the company $430 to
$2,000 a month per vehicle, depending on the size of the wrap and
the number of cars sponsored. Daniel Shifrin, president of
Autowraps, said the company expected to have 10,000 cars by the end
of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers pay FreeCar fees of about $1,250 a month. Citing
billboard costs in San Francisco of $70,000 to $90,000 a month,
Shifrin said he could deliver dozens of roving advertisements for
the same money.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Davey, a brand manager at Procter &AMP; Gamble, called
the wrapping ``an exciting new execution.'' The company has wrapped
five Chevy Blazers in conjunction with a new campaign for Head &AMP;
Shoulders shampoo. ``We wanted to be at teen venues specifically _
concerts, malls, skate parks,'' Davey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get stopped a lot _ at the gas station, going to the gym,''
said Cherie Rose, a senior service agent for Federal Express in
Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Autowraps covered her red Blazer in blue vinyl _
punctuated by green-and-white checkmarks _ to advertise
Lowestpremium.com, a search engine that compares insurance rates.
``Most people are just astonished by it,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   New Beetles and sport utilities are particularly popular with
advertisers. ``We're directing our clients toward larger vehicles
because they're more visible,'' said Chris A. Gaebler, another
founder of FreeCar Media. ``SUVs stand so high above the traffic.
But if it was a family-focused campaign, we'd wrap a minivan.''
</P>
<P>
   There are strict guidelines. Autowraps requires participants to
be at least 18, to prove ownership of the vehicle and to verify
that they have not had a moving violation within 12 months. A
felony or drunken-driving conviction disqualifies a driver forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want safe drivers,'' Shifrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies require participants to sign contracts pledging
to drive a certain distance, usually around 800 miles a month, and
to wash their vehicles at least every two weeks. Some contracts
require the drivers to park in visible spots.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles are also equipped with global positioning units
that tell the companies where they are being driven and how fast.
</P>
<P>
   Although new technology and a plethora of dot-com advertisers
are giving the car-wrapping business a high-tech sheen, putting ads
on cars is nothing new. VWs bearing cigarette logos used to puff
through New York City streets, and of course there are the Oscar
Mayer Wienermobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wave may have begun in 1993 when TDI Inc. of New
York, which sells transit ads worldwide, wrapped a San Francisco
bus. In conjunction with Supergraphics of Sunnyvale, Calif., it has
now wrapped more than 5,000 buses worldwide, including about 100
tour buses in New York.
</P>
<P>
   So, after developing a process to sell street exposure to
sponsors, are the companies' executives driving slogan-emblazoned
vehicles all the way to the bank? Shifrin, for one, says his own
car is ad-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a terrible commute pattern,'' he said. ``I work four
blocks from where I live, so I walk a lot.''

FAMILY MEMBERS BACK AT NORDSTROM HELM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHY MULADY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Responding to flat earnings and marketing strategies
that weren't producing a turnaround, Nordstrom Inc. restored
members of its founding family to top management Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive John Whitacre, the 24-year Nordstrom veteran who
has led the company since 1997, resigned as chairman and chief
executive. Blake Nordstrom took over as president of the company
founded by his great-grandfather almost 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Nordstrom, Blake's father, was named chairman of the board
of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stein, chief financial officer and a key member of
Whitacre's team, also is leaving the company in the shake-up of the
upscale Seattle retail chain's management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been disappointed with our results for some time; this
is a result of that dissatisfaction,'' said Enrique Hernandez Jr.,
the newly appointed lead independent director for Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Blake Nordstrom, 39, had been president of the Nordstrom Rack
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Nordstrom, 66, is the founder's grandson and was part of
the third-generation of leadership that took the company public in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Whitacre, 47, had been with the company since 1976, selling
shoes while attending the University of Washington. He joined the
company full time after college and worked his way up.
</P>
<P>
   While the change was more abrupt than the low-key management
changes that have typified the family-run company, it was no less
gracious to the departing leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Whitacre has been a dedicated and committed leader with
our company for his entire career,'' said Hernandez. ``He mentored
and coached literally thousands of employees and gave the company
110 percent of himself every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitacre was not present.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now at the point where we believe the company could
benefit from a different style of leadership,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nordstroms emphasized a new dedication to listening to their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all about the customer,'' said Blake Nordstrom. ``That
includes service and merchandise, and clearly we have been getting
messages that we can improve on that. What works best for us is
taking care of our customers, and listening to them one at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Company executives stressed their determination to continue the
company's expansion efforts and compete aggressively in the
national market. They also denied any plans to sell the company, as
some Nordstrom watchers have speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom was founded in Seattle almost 100 years ago as Wallin
and Nordstrom shoe store on Pike Street. Wallin sold his half of
the business to John W. Nordstrom in 1929. A year later, Nordstrom
sold the business to his three sons.
</P>
<P>
   The company is one of the country's leading fashion specialty
retailers, with 114 stores in 23 states.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Nordstrom reported a sharp decrease in
second-quarter earnings, hit by flat sales, heavy markdowns,
calendar variations and higher expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom tipped off the media and investors about a ``senior
management announcement'' Thursday morning. That sent the stock
down nearly 24 percent during regular trading. It closed at $14 a
share. After the announcement, it regained most of that loss,
selling in the $17.25 to $18 range in light trading on the
after-hours markets.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said the company had hired a national search firm and
the board had considered several external candidates before
deciding that Blake Nordstrom was the best choice.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts found it hard to believe that the company searched
very hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping for them to bring in a real aggressive outsider
that didn't have any of the history and a fresh approach,'' said
Michael Shea, with D.A. Davidson &AMP; Co., a Portland analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as much of a change. They talked about
customer service and about listening to customers, the same
platitudes we have heard before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had said they were making changes at the top and
bringing in an outsider from a five-star retailer I would be
applauding, but I am concerned that this is a stop-gap measure. The
Rack has done well, but running a corporation is a little different
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts, however, cheered the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a positive announcement, from the standpoint
that the whole culture of Nordstrom is to worship the customer and
give them the merchandise and service that the customer wants,''
said Jennifer Black. ``I think the decision to bring Bruce back was
an excellent decision. He was the key spokesman for years, and in
his heart, this man truly cares about the customer. Seattle is his
hometown and he is committed to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have known Blake for years, he understands the culture and
the new initiatives, I think he deserves to have the position. I
think the shareholders deserve it. When he spoke today it came from
his heart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholders and longtime customers were optimistic about
the Nordstroms taking back the reins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a good move,'' said Leonard Guss, a shareholder
who has been critical of recent changes by the company and the
Re-Invent Yourself campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been buying at Nordstrom for almost 40 years with one
family member or another. I thought they had lost their sense of
direction and were borrowing the latest buzz words.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he's held onto his stock through the downturn ``not
optimistically, but out of curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nordstrom seems to have lost some of its excitement. Macy's in
Union Square (San Francisco) is bursting with excitement. Nordstrom
is still a nice store, but it has lost some of its pizzazz.''
</P>
<P>
   The Re-Invent campaign, launched in February, and an emphasis on
more trendy styles, alienated many of Nordstrom's dedicated
customers. Some criticized the company for dumping them in favor of
younger customers.
</P>
<P>
   Blake Nordstrom is determined to revitalize the company and
polish its customer-first tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merchandise is the most important component of service, it
means having the right item at the right price at the right time,''
he said. ``The key is to learn from our mistakes, and not repeat
them.''

2 AFFIDAVITS ARE UNSEALED IN SECRETS CASE AT LOS ALAMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal court Thursday made public affidavits
filed by lawyers for the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee in
which two former intelligence officials said they were aware of
instances in which government employees were caught in serious
cases of espionage but were not prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has introduced the statements in its efforts to
prove that Lee, who has been indicted on charges that he illegally
downloaded a wealth of nuclear weapons secrets with the intent of
helping a foreign country, was unfairly singled out for prosecution
because of his race. Lee, 60, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born
in Taiwan and, although he is not accused of spying, he was
initially investigated on suspicions he had passed secrets to
China.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has previously released statements in which
government intelligence officials said that Lee had been unfairly
targeted because of concerns that because he was of Chinese descent
he might be inclined to commit espionage for China. The fact that
Lee was born in Taiwan, a strident enemy of the People's Republic
of China, had been ignored, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavits released Thursday go further, though, by
providing details of serious espionage cases in which admitted
spies apparently escaped criminal prosecution altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Vrooman, the former head of counterintelligence at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory, where Lee worked, provided one
affidavit. Vrooman, who has since retired from Los Alamos and who
was reprimanded for not pursuing Lee more vigorously, disclosed for
the first time an intelligence investigation code-named ``Buffalo
Slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   In this investigation, he wrote, sometime in the late 1980s a
person working at an energy department laboratory was caught after
having passed secrets to a foreign country. ``That individual was
granted full immunity in return for agreeing to a full debriefing
on the information that he passed,'' Vrooman said. That person, he
added, was not of Chinese origin.
</P>
<P>
   The second affidavit unsealed Thursday was by Charles E.
Washington, the former acting head of counterintelligence at the
Department of Energy. Washington, who still works at the department
as an international policy analyst, said that while he was head of
counterintelligence he read an administrative report on the
investigation of Lee and believed it ``was wholly lacking in any
support to identify Dr. Lee as a suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington said that he knew of a number of department employees
who were not prosecuted ``for committing offenses that are much
more serious than the `security infractions' alleged to have been
committed by Dr. Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am personally aware of a DOE employee who committed a most
egregious case of espionage that cost our nation billions of
dollars and drastically impacted our national defense,'' he said.
``That DOE employee was not prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   No further details were provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department aggressively pursues all such allegations,''
said Natalie Wymer, an energy department spokeswoman, but she would
not comment on the specific cases mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   These affidavits, unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in
Albuquerque, follow by several days an order by the federal judge
in Lee's case, James A. Parker, in which he gave the government two
weeks to hand over thousands of pages of classified internal
documents to determine if there is evidence that Lee was a victim
of selective prosecution. If the judge finds that he was, the
charges against him could be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In previous statements, Vrooman had disputed FBI assertions that
Lee had been singled out for investigation because he satisfied the
criteria of a spy they were searching for. Vrooman said again in
Thursday's affidavit that dozens of people who also fit the
descriptions, but who were not ethnically Chinese, were not
pursued, and that, even though he had investigated Lee for years,
he considered Lee ``naive,'' but not a spy.

YIELDING TO GOP ATTACK AD, DEMOCRATS PUT ON HOLD A PLAN FOR THEIR
OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see BUSH and BUSH-AD)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic National Committee abandoned plans
Thursday to release a commercial that seriously questions Gov.
George W. Bush's record in Texas, choosing to yield the spotlight
to a new Republican attack advertisement against Vice President Al
Gore in the hope that it will backfire.
</P>
<P>
   And after news reports about the Republican advertisement
appeared this morning, Gore himself immediately revised his plans
for the day, backing away from a speech about health care so that
the Republicans' message _ an assault on Gore's credibility _ would
come through loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Gore then deployed Sen. Joseph Lieberman, his vice presidential
running mate, to denounce the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sad to tell you that today, rather than focusing on
the serious issues before our country, our opponents have hit the
airwaves with paid political negative personal attack ads,''
Lieberman said at a rally in Seattle, with Gore standing behind
him. ``And that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said they believed that the Republican
commercial would backfire as being unfair, and they did all they
could to promote that impression. They also said that releasing
their own attack against Bush now would have undermined their own
credibility in trying to brand Bush as too negative, though they
acknowledged that they were saving that commercial for later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll track it over the weekend and see what happens,'' said
one Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic commercial was based on a recent federal court
ruling that Texas had failed to abide by the terms of a 1996
consent decree that it improve health care for poor children.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore followed Lieberman to the lectern, he delivered his
standard stump speech, with only a modest emphasis on the planned
topic of the day: a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to the other health-care speeches he delivered
this week, Gore pointedly chose not to criticize Bush's record. The
point, Gore aides said, was not to distract from news of the
Republican commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial uses pictures of Gore greeting monks at a
much-maligned fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in California
and at a separate event taking credit for creating the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, meanwhile, maintained that the commercial would
not backfire and said that their investment of millions of dollars
to broadcast it in 17 states was proof that they believed it was
valid and would be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the commercial was negative, Bill Pascoe, a
spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said: ``This is
not a personal attack. This deals specifically with Gore's
credibility on campaign finance, the issue that he says is his No.
1 priority, and that makes a discussion of his credibility fair
game.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``What's negative about merely showing video clips of
Al Gore saying things?''

   FRANCE PROPOSES TAX CUTS
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, totaling $16 billion over three years, is part of
a wave of similar measures being enacted across Europe as
governments react to increased tax revenue because of expanding
economies and declining unemployment. The cuts, while differing by
country, are intended to give a measure of stability to a tenuous
spurt of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ARREST MADE IN EMULEX STOCK CASE
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charged a 23-year-old former community college
student with defrauding Emulex investors by issuing a phony press
release that sent shares of the company, a data-storage equipment
maker, tumbling last Friday. If convicted, he faces 15 years in
prison and a $500,000 fine.

   2 TOP NORDSTROM EXECUTIVES RESIGN
</P>
<P>
   After several years of anemic sales growth at Nordstrom, John
Whitacre, the company's chairman and chief executive, and Michael
Stein, the chief financial officer, resigned. Two members of the
Nordstrom family, which controls roughly one-third of the company's
stock, have been named to key executive positions. Blake W.
Nordstrom, 39, will be president, while Bruce A. Nordstrom, 66,
will be chairman. Shares of Nordstrom fell $1.13, to $17.25.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON VETOES REPEAL OF ESTATE TAX
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill to repeal
the federal estate tax and stepped up the election-year debate over
tax cuts and how best to spend the budget surplus. He accused
Republicans of threatening to hamstring the economy by devising tax
cuts that he said would leave little money for Medicare, a
prescription drug benefit, education and a host of other programs.
</P>
<P>
   FCC EASES RADIO SPECTRUM LIMITS
</P>
<P>
   In a move that may stimulate development of wireless products
for the home, the Federal Communications Commission eased
restrictions on part of the radio spectrum. The change affects an
area used by companies that produce wireless local-area networks,
which enable people to transmit data from, say, a laptop computer
to a desktop computer without wires.

   PLAN TO CUT EUROPEAN TRADING COSTS
</P>

   In a move intended to shore up support for the planned merger of
the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges, the clearinghouses for
the two markets introduced a plan that would cut settlement costs
for certain trades.

   VOLKSWAGEN RAISES PAY IN MEXICO
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Volkswagen Mexico negotiated a raise of more than
double the inflation rate, ending a two-week battle that included a
walkout at the only factory in the world that produces the trendy
Beetles. The company agreed to raise salaries 13 percent and give
workers a 5 percent productivity bonus plus a 3 percent increase in
benefits. The union's general secretary, Jose Luis Rodriguez, said,
``We think that salaries should not be based on inflation, but the
performance of the workers and the results of the company.''

   FACTORY ORDERS FELL 7.5 PERCENT IN JULY
</P>
<P>
   Orders placed with manufacturers fell 7.5 percent in July, the
largest drop on record, government figures showed, and private
survey data indicated that manufacturing in the Chicago region
contracted in August.

   SMITHKLINE SELLS PRODUCT LINES
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to win regulatory approval for its merger with
Glaxo Wellcome PLC, SmithKline Beecham PLC said it would sell
product lines to Novartis AG and Roche Holding AG for almost $2.9
billion. Novartis will buy SmithKline's herpes treatments Famvir
and Vectavir/Denavir for $1.63 billion, while Roche will pay $1.23
billion for Kytril, an anti-nausea drug for cancer patients.
SmithKline, based in Britain, must sell some of its drugs to gain
approval for its merger with Glaxo Wellcome, also of Britain,
because Glaxo makes similar products. The sales are contingent on
the completion of the $75 billion merger.

   CREDIT SUISSE PROFIT UP
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss financial services group Credit Suisse said income in
the first half rose 36 percent, to 3.6 billion Swiss francs, or
$2.1 billion, buoyed by securities trading and asset management
fees. But shares in Credit Suisse, which agreed this week to
acquire Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, tumbled for the second
consecutive day, apparently reflecting investor concern over
mounting personnel costs, which were driven up 33 percent by
soaring bonuses, increasing operating expenses by 28 percent, to
11.7 billion Swiss francs. Income at the company's private banking
unit, which invests money for wealthy clients, rose 61 percent, to
1.4 billion Swiss francs. Income from fees and commissions rose 51
percent, to 7.5 billion francs. And income from securities trading
rose 49 percent, to 5.4 billion francs. Unlike its bigger Swiss
rival, UBS AG, which reported that its assets under management
declined 3 percent in the first half, Credit Suisse said its assets
changed little in the second quarter, and rose almost 5 percent in
the first three months.

   With a surge in business investment, Canada's economy continued
to grow at a strong annual pace, 4.7 percent, in the second
quarter, slightly below the 5.1 percent gross domestic product
advances of the two previous quarters. Spending on machinery and
equipment, mainly computers and related high-tech components, grew
by 19.5 percent annually. Exports advanced at an 8.5 percent yearly
rate, led also by high-tech sales, and imports were 10.2 percent
higher. Considering that much of Canada has endured a cool, wet
summer, consumer spending was stronger than expected, rising at a
3.6 percent annual rate.

   BRAZIL LIABLE IN LOSSES
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Supreme Federal Tribunal ruled that the government is
liable for about $21 billion in losses employees suffered to their
Guarantee Fund for Length of Service _ a type of individual
unemployment insurance fund _ during the late 1980s and early
1990s, when a series of unsuccessful economic plans threw the
Brazilian economy into chaos. About 600,000 workers are affected by
the court's decision to hold the government responsible for losses
under two of the five economic plans. The exact amount will be
decided later.

business conglomerate, in a move investors welcomed as a step
toward increased openness from management. The approval by the Fair
Trade Commission came just one day after a key executive in Hyundai
Group resigned, bolstering optimism that high-ranking employees
loyal to the founding family would no longer be able to funnel cash
from healthy units to prop up money-losing affiliates. The spinoff
of Hyundai Motor is expected to include its sister automaker, Kia

   CHINA LOOSENS INSURANCE RULES
</P>
<P>
   China is allowing foreign insurance companies to buy up to 25
percent of domestic insurers, opening a fast track for foreign
companies eager to get into the growing market. In the first of
what is expected to be several such deals, five foreign companies,
including Zurich Insurance Co., International Finance Corp. and
Meiji Life Insurance Co., based in Japan, have agreed to buy 24.9
percent of New China Life Insurance Co., according to Thursday's
China Daily. Foreign insurers have complained about waiting years
for licenses to operate in the country. Only a handful of foreign
licenses have been issued, most recently to Chubb Corp., which
filed its application seven years ago. The share sale will increase
New China's net assets to $193 million from about $76 million.  &QL;

<P>
   Amazon.com, the No. 1 Internet retailer, has revised its privacy
policy, and in doing so has provided a window into how much it uses
the customer data it collects to help it and other companies sell
more. In the new policy, Amazon disclosed that it has started
sending e-mail marketing messages on behalf of other companies. It
also added a long list of data it collects about users, including
financial information, Social Security numbers, product searches
and the telephone number from which a user calls Amazon's customer
service line. And for the first time, Amazon disclosed it can buy
information about customers from outside databases. And if the new
initiatives don't help stem Amazon's huge losses and the company is
put up for sale, the new policy says, anyone who buys Amazon will
get its customer data.

   CALIFORNIA BILL ON WEB SALES TAX

   The California State Assembly has passed a bill that would
require businesses with stores in California to collect state sales
tax on purchases made over the Internet. The bill, approved earlier
by the State Senate, passed by a vote of 42-31 and was sent to the
governor. It focuses on companies like Barnes &AMP; Noble, whose
affiliated Internet units do not charge or collect the state's 7.25
percent sales tax. While Gov. Gray Davis has not said whether he
will sign the bill, he has indicated that he opposed Internet
taxes. State officials estimate the measure could add $14 million
in tax revenues to the $22 billion the state already collects each
year.

the White House determined the transaction was not a risk to
national security. Concern had emerged that Japan could gain access
to delicate government information with the deal. NTT hopes to
broaden its corporate Internet services with the purchase of Verio,
which operates more World Wide Web sites than any other company.

PAUL YAGER, A MEDIATOR IN LABOR STRIKES, DIES AT 80 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Pa., Del.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Yager, a veteran federal labor mediator who helped resolve
several important labor strikes in the New York City region, died
Monday at a hospital in Edison, N.J. He was 80 and lived in
Metuchen, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, according to his daughter, Deborah
Yager.
</P>
<P>
   Yager was the director of the Northeastern Region of the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service, based in New York City, from
1973 until his retirement from the service in 1986. He held lesser
posts in the service from 1951 to 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He was active in 1984 in negotiations that led to a settlement
of a 68-day strike by unionized workers against 11 nursing homes in
New York City. In 1976, he was involved in negotiations that led to
the end of an 11-day strike at 57 hospitals and nursing homes in
New York City by nonmedical workers.
</P>
<P>
   The many other labor disputes he mediated included strikes
involving the Philadelphia Orchestra that were settled.
</P>
<P>
   Former colleagues recalled Thursday that Yager was skilled at
getting parties on opposite sides in a dispute to think that,
through a compromise, they might be able to achieve part of what
they were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   He also had an acute sense of timing, an ability to present an
idea to the opposing parties at a time when it would be accepted by
both sides. He had enough stamina to be on hand for as much as 40
hours of nonstop bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``His personality was a key factor in his success,'' said
Kenneth C. Kowalski, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service's director for the northeastern United States and the
Caribbean Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Hezekiah Brown, a former mediating colleague, recalled: ``He
taught me to observe every single thing about the parties, from the
time the individuals walk in the door until they sit at the table,
and to watch the body language and what they say. He said, `What
you have to do to be a good mediator is to listen to what's not
being said across the table.'''
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Yager received a bachelor's degree from New
York University and, after Navy service in World War II, a master's
degree in 1949 from Cornell's New York State School of Industrial
and Labor Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter Deborah, of Philadelphia, he is survived by
his wife, Naomi; another daughter, Marion Hamermesh of Wilmington,
Del.; a sister, Florence Levy of Jamesburg, N.J.; and two
grandchildren. &QL;

U.S. HEAVY FAVORITE FOR SOFTBALL GOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Over the past 10 years, the United States women's
softball team has lost just five games in international
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those losses have been against Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It's an obvious source of concern for the Americans as they
prepare for the 2000 Olympics in ... Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 Atlanta games, Australia spoiled U.S. pitcher Lisa
Fernandez's perfect game when Joanne Brown smashed a two-strike,
two- run homer to beat the Americans in the opening round. The
Americans regrouped to win the gold in Atlanta, but the memory of
that loss lingers. The fact they'll face Australia on its home soil
makes the loss even more significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I live with everyday,'' said Fernandez, who
sobbed after the `96 loss. ``After I'd given up the home run and we
win the gold medal and everything's fine, and you think it's over
and you're ready to move on. Then the postcard comes around
Thanksgiving, and it brings up a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the postcard. Four months after the Americans won the gold
medal in Atlanta, Fernandez got a postcard - postmarked from
Australia - with a picture of Brown waving a flag and riding the
shoulders of her teammates after hitting the home run to beat
Fernandez and the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was someone on the team or a fan,''
Fernandez said. ``But it was someone obviously trying to stick a
knife just a little bit deeper into an open wound. I felt
definitely as if it were a personal attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Fernandez and the U.S. will use the loss, the
postcard and the fact that they'll have to win the gold away from
the United States as motivation in Sydney. Obviously, Fernandez is
prepared. During a pre-Olympic tour she pitched five consecutive
perfect games, and in the fifth she struck out all 21 batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who are closing in on a 100-game winning streak,
were dominant during the tour, outscoring their opponents 364-3 in
the first 51 games.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Americans take anything for granted. Certainly they
are favorites to win the gold in Sydney, but as the Australians
proved in 1996, the U.S. is by no means unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-team tournament is more balanced than four years ago,
and each team has made significant improvements. In addition to the
U.S. and Australia, the rest of the field consists of Japan, China,
Canada, Cuba, Italy and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have, in their minds, the feeling that they are
improving,'' U.S. second baseman Dot Richardson said. ``As usual,
every country guns for us. That's the way we've always had it, and
the way we want it. We actually welcome the challenge. It's easy to
get to the top. The true challenge is staying there.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is a threat because it plays solid defense, and China lost
two one-run games to the U.S. before falling 3-1 in the gold-medal
game in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And of course there's the Australians, who have emerged as the
biggest threat to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the U.S. is favored to repeat. Fernandez is the
best player in the world, and shortstop Crystl Bustos (Canyon High)
is quickly catching up, using her potent bat and spectacular
strength to pound opposing pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable power,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   At catcher, UCLA standout Stacey Nuveman is a remarkable
defensive player and a solid hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for the U.S. might be playing in front of
8,000 Australian fanatics when the two countries square off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually looking forward to being in a hostile
environment,'' Fernandez said. ``To have fans booing you and you
throw the first pitch 80 mph. There's nothing better than hearing
the silence of the crowd. That's something that internally lights
out fire.''

   THE VOTERS MANY STAYED AT HOME
</P>
<P>
   The front-loading last spring of the presidential primaries
combined with the long-term trend of increased voter apathy to
drive down voter turnout to near historic lows. A new analysis by
the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a
nonpartisan group that tracks the American voter, shows that only
17.7 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in states where both
the Republican and Democratic parties held presidential primaries.
That was the second-lowest turnout in primaries in 40 years, and a
mere 0.8 percentage points above the 16.9 percent of voters who
took part in the 1996 primaries, when President Clinton had no
opponent. The meager turnout occurred despite the campaign of Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., whose appeal to independents and Democrats
produced record turnouts in primaries in 12 states through Super
Tuesday on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS A TEST FOR CHENEY
</P>
<P>
   Pop quizzes, more often than not, spell troubles for
politicians. So the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Dick
Cheney, looked vaguely concerned when he got one Thursday morning
as he walked into a classroom full of 6-year-olds in an elementary
school in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. His task, explained the teacher,
Rosalyn Robinson, was to guess which solution an egg would float
in: corn starch, food coloring or salt.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney chose salt, and as he dropped eggs into cups filled with
each solution, he was borne out. ``Just don't ask me to spell
potato,'' he said, referring to another quiz met with less success
by Dan Quayle, another Republican vice-presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   NATURAL LAW PARTY: 2 NOMINATIONS, 1 CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   John Hagelin, already the presidential nominee of a rump faction
of the Reform Party, was chosen Thursday to also be the nominee of
another small, independent political group, the Natural Law Party.
Hagelin, an Iowa physicist and founder of the Natural Law Party,
said in accepting the second nomination that he would run under
both party banners in the fall and that he intended to win. He was
named the nominee of the Reform Party faction last month when that
party split, with its hard-right members nominating Patrick J.
Buchanan. The Natural Law Party's nominating convention was held in
Alexandria, Va., with little notice, attended by 400 people. The
Natural Law Party, now eight years old, hews to the teachings of
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the transcendental meditation leader, and
promotes preventive health care, increased use of renewable energy
sources and peaceful remedies for international conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   GOP WITHDRAWS AD
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Republican National Committee announced that it
would not go through with plans to run a television advertisement
that challenged the veracity of Vice President Al Gore. It conceded
the advertisement could be considered misleading and notified
stations that had received advanced copies of it not to broadcast
it. But on Wednesday, it began running anyway in New Orleans after
a technician at the local CBS affiliate pushed the wrong button.
The advertisement included an excerpt from a 1994 television
interview in which Gore said he could not think of a single lie
told by President Clinton. It did not mention that the interview
took place before Clinton met Monica Lewinsky. Officials at New
Orleans station, WWL-TV, said the advertisement was pulled after
several viewers complained. But Gore campaign officials are not
complaining; several had said last week they hoped it would run, to
create a backlash against Gov. George W. Bush.

JOHN C.A. WATKINS, NEWSPAPER PUBLISHER, DIES AT 87 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, R.I., Ohio, Md., Idaho, Ore., Wash.)   By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John C.A. Watkins, the longest-serving publisher of The
Providence Journal, died Wednesday in Newport Hospital in Rhode
Island. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, a decorated World War II fighter pilot, was publisher
of The Journal for 25 years, from 1954 to 1979, and retired as
chairman of The Providence Journal Co. in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He led the paper's transformation from a 40,000-circulation
daily overshadowed by its afternoon rival, The Bulletin, to a
respected regional newspaper whose circulation peaked at more than
218,000.
</P>
<P>
   He also pushed the company to expand into other areas, acquiring
two radio stations and a cable television system. In addition to
shepherding the business side of The Providence Journal, he was
known for dispatching page proofs to editors with grammatical
errors or misused words circled in red, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, on Oct. 12, 1912, and
started in journalism in 1934 as a reporter at The Dayton Herald
and Journal in Ohio. A year later he moved to The Sun in Baltimore,
where his reporting assignments included riding aboard Pan American
Airways' Yankee Clipper on the first trans-Atlantic passenger
flight in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins inherited a love of aviation from his father, a military
pilot, and he left The Sun in June 1941 and joined the Army Air
Force. He served as the operations officer for the 325th Fighter
Squadron in the Mediterranean, flying 49 combat missions in P-40
and P-47 fighter planes and surviving at least one crash landing
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   After three of his five brothers were killed in the war, he was
ordered out of combat. His decorations included the Distinguished
Flying Cross and the Air Medal.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins left the military in 1945 as a lieutenant colonel and
joined The Providence Journal as assistant to the publisher. He was
named assistant publisher in 1950, then associate publisher in
1953. A year later, at age 41, he was named publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he was named Journal Co. president, a post he retained
until 1974. He then became chairman and chief executive. In 1983,
he left the chief executive job, and stepped down as chairman two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure as publisher, The Journal won a Pulitzer Prize
for investigative reporting in 1974 for a story detailing President
Nixon's small tax payments.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins married Helen Danforth in 1943 and the couple had four
children before divorcing in 1959. In 1960, he married June
Watkins, a former actress, who died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins is survived by two sons, Fanchon M. Burnham of
Washington and Stephen D. of San Francisco; a daughter, Jane P.
Watkins of Ketchum, Idaho; a stepdaughter, Izetta Smith of
Portland, Ore.; and five grandchildren.

CSUN FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- There are no visible signs. Nothing you can see.
Nothing you can feel. Still, you know they're there.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of NCAA sanctions imposed on the Cal State
Northridge football program in June linger, even though those
associated with the program say it's not something they talk about
much.
</P>
<P>
   And probation is just the beginning. Many more impending changes
are in store for CSUN, changes that leave people wondering what the
future holds for the Matadors football program.
</P>
<P>
   The team's home - North Campus Stadium - is scheduled to be
demolished after the season and CSUN is scheduled to play at Pierce
College for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   This season is CSUN's farewell tour in the Big Sky Conference.
The Matadors move to the Big West - a conference without football -
next year.
</P>
<P>
   An independent schedule in a foreign stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the same thing everybody else sees,'' linebacker Cos
Abercrombie said. ``They're taking the stadium away. We do wonder
what the program is going to be like down the line. But I know
there will be a season this year. I live for today.''
</P>
<P>
   And today, there is football. But what about next season? Or the
season after?
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has contracts for games with UC Davis, Sacramento State,
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Southwest Texas State for 2001.
Matadors coach Jeff Kearin is filling the rest of the schedule,
which will include a game against a Division I-A opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, CSUN has a contract with UC Davis though 2003, and
Sacramento State and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo probably will be
regulars on the schedule, too.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Dick Dull said he doesn't want people to read
anything into the fact CSUN has yet to fill its schedule for next
season. He said it's never booked this far in advance.
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't believe a stadium is the key to any program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take the ball as it lays,'' Dull said. ``That's
our situation. It's not a perfect world. What's more important is
not where they play but the people that direct this program. They
look at Jeff Kearin and say that overrides the 'Hey, maybe we don't
have a big, beautiful stadium.'
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always more important than facilities, from my
vantage point.''
</P>
<P>
   A new stadium has been discussed for years, but no decisions
have been made. Other facilities are taking precedence, according
to Dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't sat down and specifically come up witha game plan
(for a stadium),'' Dull said. ``There are other facilities I have
in the short-term that are more important than the football
stadium. The reason is we have a safety valve with Pierce College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more concerned about making changes to the baseball
stadium - it's really not adequate - and (changes) for softball and
the seating at The Matadome (CSUN's gym). Those are the priorities.
It doesn't mean we've given up on the football stadium, but we have
another set of priorities that I'm going to address.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN plans to add seats to the gym (which has a capacity of
1,600) to keep in line with other Big West schools. Dull hopes to
have another 850 seats or so in place (on the upper level of one
side) by the time the basketball season opens.
</P>
<P>
   Even if CSUN had plans for a football stadium, major issues
would remain, such as financing and location. Again, all this
remains in the discussion stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a general commitment to talk about what it
is we need,'' CSUN president Jolene Koester said. ``I don't have,
in my drawer, plans. I also want to affirm we have a commitment to
look at what it is we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, always the optimist, doesn't appear to be upset about
the stadium. He's operating under the assumption that Pierce will
be his team's new home, although he's heard talk the Matadors might
play at North Campus Stadium for another season.
</P>
<P>
   If Kearin's worried about anything, it's not where his team will
play on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy,'' Kearin said. ``We just want to play. Probably
the bigger question is where we're going to practice. People here
are working on that.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN practices on a field adjacent to the stadium that also is
on the site where the MiniMed biotechnology project is being
constructed.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty over stadium plans undoubtedly will scare away
some recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you where (the stadium) hurts us is recruiting,''
senior receiver Gil Rodriguez said. ``When you don't have a
stadium, you have to find guys who aren't interested in looks and
big money. When you see this stadium, you've gotta find players who
want to play football. Guys who play with heart.''
</P>
<P>
   And players who aren't scared off by ever-present rumors that
the athletic department will drop football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty difficult to respond to rumors,'' Koester said.
``A rumor is a rumor. And universities like all complex
organizations are filled with rumors. I respond to it substantively
by saying that we're playing football and we're setting up a
schedule for next year. I look at football in context of the entire
intercollegiate athletic program. We're playing football. What can
I say?''
</P>
<P>
   But the rumor of the program's demise persists. For example, a
couple of players said other schools made reference to it on
recruiting visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people ask me about it,'' fullback Crayton Milton
said. ``I try not to think about it. I hope (the program) doesn't
end. As long as the program is here, I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rodriguez: ``For the guys that have been here three or
four years - myself and others - we're used to it. Every year
there's talk about cutting football and demolishing the stadium.
This year it's another setback - not letting us go to the playoffs
(if they win the conference title because of probation).''
</P>
<P>
   As an independent, CSUN will not be required to offer 55
scholarships, as it is now in the Big Sky. University officials
haven't said whether they'll cut back for the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   That, along with the direction of the program, is something CSUN
will address this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there needs to be dialogue with interested
constituents about football, the level of football we want and
direction from the new president,'' Dull said. ``I'm not in a
position to drop sports and add them.... We haven't begun the
dialogue of football after 2001.''

NAVRATILOVA HAS FANS, BUT A TEST IS LOOMING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  By SOPHIA HOLLANDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martina Navratilova and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario
advanced to the second round in women's doubles Thursday with a
dramatic victory over Sabine Appelmans and Linda Wild, 5-7, 6-2,
7-6 (3), before an overflowed crowd on the Grandstand Court.
</P>
<P>
   Only organ music was missing as it seemed the spirit had seeped
across the boardwalk from Shea Stadium. The spectators became
rowdier and and more emphatic after each point, leaping to their
feet and four times bursting into rhythmic clapping that strongly
implied a ``Let's Go, Marty'' chant.
</P>
<P>
   Even the scoreboard was swept away. `Nice Work Guys!!!' it
blared after match point, as fans stood whistling and clapping
furiously, while Navratilova and Sanchez-Vicario embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova turned to the crowd, raising her hand, then patted
it over her heart. That was close.
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd so overwhelmingly against them, Appelmans and
Wild could only shake their heads and smile. But fan loyalties will
be sorely tested in the second round, when Navratilova and
Sanchez-Vicario take on the popular 14th-seeded team of Jennifer
Capriati and Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat Suits Her
</P>
<P>
   Lilia Osterloh used to stand in her back yard in Canal
Winchester, Ohio, and hit tennis ball after ball off the side of
her family's garage. Though her parents played recreationally and
her sister competed at DePaul, she was captivated by the images
playing across her television, by Chris Evert and Martina
Navratilova as they danced across courts and powered past
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   One day, she said to herself, that will be me.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is ranked 57th in the world and playing in her fifth
straight U.S. Open. Thursday, she upset 14th-seeded Dominique Van
Roost, who retired because of heat illness even though she had won
second set, 6-3. Osterloh won the tight first set, 7-6 (7).
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Osterloh advanced to the fourth round at
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my third year on the tour, and I really want to make the
jump to the top 50,'' said Osterloh, 22, who won the 1997
collegiate singles title in her one year at Stanford before turning
pro.
</P>
<P>
   She said that her victory against Van Roost was an important
step, but was clearly uncomfortable with the way she won.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the second set, I was like, `OK, let's battle it out,'''
Osterloh said, frowning slightly. ``I noticed her face was really
red. But it was really humid out. I didn't know it was that
severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunlight seared through haze in the Grandstand, as the smell of
sunscreen wafted onto the court. After the second set, a flushed
Van Roost disappeared down the ramp for what appeared to be a
bathroom break. She would not play again, withdrawing from the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat felt pretty brutal,'' Osterloh said. But, she added,
``I like the heat, even though I grew up in Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she will have a chance to play in it more.
</P>
<P>
   Hard Feelings
</P>
<P>
   An emotional and slightly defensive Billie Jean King spoke about
her decision to leave the No. 1 doubles player, Lisa Raymond, off
the Olympic team in favor of Serena Williams, who has no doubles
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning news conference regarding the U.S. Olympic teams,
King discussed the saga that began when she selected the top four
singles players for the U.S. team _ Lindsay Davenport, Monica
Seles, Venus Williams and Serena Williams _ instead of following
the recent Olympic tradition of picking the top doubles player for
the fourth position. Raymond challenged the decision but lost in
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have known Lisa since she was 12 years old,'' said King, who
seemed to be on the verge of crying several times. ``I absolutely
adore Lisa. This was probably the most difficult call I ever made,
definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning her singles match in the afternoon, Raymond
discussed the mentoring role King had played in her life. For
Raymond, King's decision was a personal and a professional
betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   The two have not had a conversation since King called Raymond
after Wimbledon to tell her she had been left off the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very frustrated, angry, very disappointed, both in Billie
and the USTA,'' said Raymond, who breezed through her second-round
match against Ruxandra Dragomir, 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   King said: ``It's been very painful. I think I went through a
lot of anxiety and pain about it, trying to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   But she defended her selection and insisted that she had fought
for Raymond, first by lobbying unsuccessfully to have the Women's
Tennis Association vote in favor of counting Olympic matches in
ranking, which would have allowed the women to take more than four
players, and then by approaching the International Tennis
Federation twice, asking the sport's international governing body
to make a special allowance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made an incredible effort to try to make it happen,'' King
said. ``We were unable to.''

CHENEY URGES RETHINKING USE OF U.S. GROUND FORCES IN BOSNIA,
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Dick Cheney, the Republican
vice-presidential candidate, called Thursday for a re-examination
of the nation's role in peacekeeping missions around the world and
said it was time to consider recalling U.S. ground troops from
Kosovo and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important that we make sometimes difficult
choices about when we're going to actually use military force, that
we need to avoid situations where we commit troops because we can't
think of anything else to do,'' said Cheney, who was the secretary
of defense during the Persian Gulf war. ``The difficult part is
deciding what's in our strategic interest, what's of sufficient
significance in terms of U.S. interests so its worth the commitment
of resources and the potential loss of U.S. lives. And not every
problem around the world is.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made the comments after being asked by reporters Thursday
to elaborate on a speech he delivered in Atlanta on Wednesday in
which he said that the military had been ``overused and
underresourced'' during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The speech drew an angry response from Vice President Al Gore's
campaign, which called Cheney's approach ``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was sharply questioned at the White House as well.
Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for President Clinton, said Cheney ``now
has an obligation to come forward and say which deployments he was
opposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was he against our action in Haiti?'' Lockhart asked. ``Was he
against our action of returning peace to Sarajevo and Bosnia? Was
he against reversing ethnic cleansing in Kosovo? Was he against
eight years of containment of Saddam Hussein and his weapons of
mass destruction? I think those are questions he should answer.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Bush and Gore campaigns continued to debate military
preparedness Thursday, the Pentagon released a quarterly report
that found most of the nation's combat forces ready to perform
their wartime missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's armed forces remain capable'' of achieving the
military goals of the Clinton administration, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   But the report supported Cheney's claims that the armed forces
face shortages in personnel, training problems and aging equipment.
It also warned that an inadequate capability to move, protect and
supply forces meant that higher casualties might occur should the
United States be forced to fight two major conflicts at the same
time, as called for in the national war plan.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney did not spell out a specific doctrine that he and Gov.
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, would follow
if they won the election. But he called for applying a more
rigorous standard of whether U.S. military intervention was
warranted before committing troops to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``I think we get into a situation where
we have, because of the publicity given to a particular event _ you
may have a real tragedy unfolding someplace in the world, but it
doesn't affect vital U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   And you have to make a decision that you'll do whatever you can
diplomatically, working through the international community or
perhaps providing sustenance and medical supplies and support for
humanitarian purposes, but you're not going to commit U.S. troops
to combat to deal with that particular situation. Those are choices
that presidents get paid to make. They are not easy choices. If
they were, they wouldn't land on his desk.''

   Without addressing the merits of the Clinton administration's
initial decision to send troops into Bosnia and Kosovo, Cheney said
Thursday that it was time to consider pulling the remaining U.S.
ground troops out of the Balkans, perhaps while still keeping a
small presence there to gather intelligence and help the remaining
international force with logistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might continue to do that,'' he said. ``But troops on the
ground, in Europe, in the Balkans in particular, now that the
crisis supposedly has passed in Bosnia and Kosovo, strikes me an
appropriate role for our European friends and allies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was quick to note that the United States has
already sharply scaled back the number of troops it has on the
ground in the Balkans. Kym Spell, a Gore campaign spokeswoman, said
U.S. troops accounted for 14 percent of the force in Kosovo and 18
percent of the force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Cheney's approach would be irresponsible,'' Spell said.
``It would leave our allies in the lurch, erase the progress we've
made toward peace, and only cost the United States in the long
run.''
</P>
<P>
   The one deployment that Cheney said he disagreed with was the
mission in Haiti in 1994, but he did not specify why. The Clinton
administration sent 20,000 troops into Haiti as part of an
international force that restored to power the country's
democratically elected president after he was ousted in a military
coup. About 75 U.S. troops remain in Haiti today, on a temporary
mission to provide humanitarian aide.
</P>
<P>
   Spell said the vice president stood by the administration's
decision to send troops to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into Haiti to begin the process of defeating a
dictator and restoring a democratically elected president,'' Spell
said. ``We inherited the situation and showed the resolve and took
the initiative to help the people of Haiti. Working to restore
democracy is never a bad decision.''
</P>
<P>
   And although Cheney has criticized cutbacks in the size of the
military repeatedly in recent days, culminating with his speech in
Atlanta, in his remarks Thursday he did not call for increasing the
size of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to say that yet,'' said Cheney, who began the
cutbacks as secretary of defense, reducing the military by a
quarter after the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd want to do a broad strategic review of our
overall posture with respect to the kind of defense planning
guidance that's out there now.'' he said. ``Then you'd have to size
the force to execute the strategy.''

LONG NOMADS, THE INUIT FIND A SETTLED LIFE UNSETTLING

<P>
   IQALUIT, Nunavut _ In this brand new territory, where new
government buildings rise on nameless muddy streets, people had
barely learned that the former speaker of the legislature had been
convicted of sexual assault when they heard Tuesday that their
education minister had been charged with beating up a woman.
</P>
<P>
   This dual attack on the pride of this 17-month-old territory
seemed to highlight the rocky cultural transition of the Inuit, who
compose 85 percent of Nunavut's 27,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Telescoping centuries of sociological change into two
generations, the Inuit, known as Eskimos in Alaska and Greenland,
have moved from the life of nomadic hunters who survived for
centuries in one of the world's harshest environments to a modern,
sedentary life marked by snowmobiles, heated homes and satellite
television.
</P>
<P>
   One price for this wrenching change has been Canada's highest
rate of violent crime, with one attack reported each year for every
19 residents. Last year Nunavut registered 204 sexual assaults,
about 10 times the national per-capita average, and 1,115 assaults,
nearly six times the national average.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when attacks on women were debated, callers to
radio stations sometimes criticized women's shelters for
interfering in traditional family life. Elders reminded listeners
that in traditional Inuit society, a man was allowed to beat his
wife if she lied to him, was unfaithful or talked too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men would call in and say, `The shelters are ruining my
marriage,''' said the wife of a territorial minister. ``Older women
would say: `I was beaten. If we talk too much, we are beaten.'''
</P>
<P>
   But now younger Inuit, separated by a generation or more from
the harsh life of surviving in a wilderness of snow and ice, are
saying Inuit should adapt their relations to their new lives in
houses and villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as an Inuit nation need to sit down and reflect,'' said
Simona Arnatsiaq, women's program coordinator of the Qikiqtani
Inuit Association. ``There has been so much change in 50 years. We
used to live as families in camps. Now we live in settled
communities. We have to discuss getting along in large groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Across this vast territory, three times the size of Texas,
alcoholism, high unemployment and crowded housing contribute to
high rates of sexual assault. Noting that there are two people per
room in the territory, twice the national average, Ann Roberts, the
chief medical officer, said, ``With the drinking, the ennui, the
crowded housing stock _ this is the recipe for sexual assault.''
</P>
<P>
   For territorial legislators, who have some of the highest-paying
jobs in the Arctic, the problem may stem from alcohol mixed with
domineering attitudes about women. But even with two members now
charged in cases of violence against women, there has been mostly
silence from the 19-member Legislative Assembly, 18 of whom are
men. Although women across Nunavut have started signing protest
petitions, there has been little public reaction from Peter
Kattuck, the minister responsible for the status of women.
</P>
<P>
   From Rankin Inlet, Nunavut's second-largest town, Evelyn
Thordarson, director of the women's shelter, said of members of the
Assembly, ``When you go, you take an oath to serve the people, not
to harm the people, not to break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, in the first blow to the Assembly, the police
arrested Levi Barnabas, the 36-year-old speaker, and charged him
with sexual assault. According to the police, Barnabas, after a
night of heavy drinking, tried to have sex with a friend's wife at
a house here. The woman resisted and woke up her husband, who
chased the legislator into the street, hitting him three times with
a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Barnabas was found guilty and received a one-year
jail sentence, which was suspended on the condition that he pay
$1,000 to the women's shelter here, perform 240 hours of community
service and stay out of Iqaluit's two bars for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the Assembly's leaders, Barnabas resigned
his seat. But the politician, who has represented Canada's
northernmost Arctic villages for the last five years, before and
after the creation of Nunavut, soon announced that constituents
were urging him to run in the special election for his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Levi Barnabas case, people are seeing this and
asking: `What is the point of bringing charges? He only got
community hours,''' Thordason said.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper editorialists say the Assembly, through its silence,
is sending out a message of male impunity. ``The male-dominated
Legislature has been strangely silent over the issue,'' News North
Nunavut, a weekly, wrote in an editorial Monday. ``The government
had a golden opportunity to take a stand against violence directed
at women. Their silence trivialized the severity of Barnabas'
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week's case may make addressing the issue of violence
against women unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers arrested
James Arvaluk, 52, the education minister, and charged him with
assault. The police say the victim was a woman at his home in Coral
Harbor, about 435 miles west of here.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Arvaluk represented that area in the legislature
of the Northwest Territories, he spent time in jail after being
convicted of two charges of sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were having trouble with him as minister of education
with the sexual assault conviction,'' said the wife of another
minister. ``Now this charge involves bringing booze into a dry
community.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Legislative Assembly resumes session in mid-October,
Arnatsiaq said, the first order of business should be to set an
example by adopting a code of ethics and a policy of zero tolerance
among members for assaults on women.

READY OR NOT, IT'S MILLER TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He's compared the hair piece of Titans owner Bud
Adams to ``artificial turf,'' warned that Dolphins kicker Olindo
Mare was going to be ``raising his leg more frequently this year
than a Chihuahua with a bad bladder'' and complained that the per
diem at ABC was less than what the people got on ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   He's made references to Beowulf, the Pope, the ``sequin mines''
in Nashville, the Tigris and Euphrates, Mesopotamia, genitalia,
NAFTA, Sylvia Plath, Godot, the Curse of the Bambino and, maybe
worst, the thought of USA Today columnist Rudy Martzke leaping off
his couch in his undies.
</P>
<P>
   From TV Guide to Time magazine, The Christian Science Monitor to
the Drudge Report, everyone's chimed in with reviews. All of which
probably helped him land an $800,000 book deal from the crush of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, the real show begins.
</P>
<P>
   Is Dennis Miller a ready-for-prime-time NFL broadcaster? Or will
America just not get it?
</P>
<P>
   Heck, do most of the TV critics who don't know whether Miller
just said ``loutish'' or ``loudish'' even get it?
</P>
<P>
   ``To define the perimeters, you gotta find out where the fence
line is, and that's what I've been doing,'' said the shiny-new
third wheel on the ``Monday Night Football'' telecast that begins
the regular season with Monday's sparkling Denver-St. Louis
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've gotten to a point where I can be judged in a
clear perspective. I have expectations of myself and I'll start
calibrating and dialing it in and put demands on myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not pleased with myself at this point, but I'm
infrequently pleased when I've done something only three times.
Hopefully, sometime this fall, I'll get to where I feel my bike is
balanced. I feel a few times I've been up for a few seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(By the end of the season), if I'm good, it'll be a nonstory;
if I'm bad, it'll be time to weigh in like a wildebeest on the
Serengeti and it'll be a fall feed.''
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the art of sportscasting can be so measured,
repetitive and free of personality, Miller's presence in the booth
jolts the profession's foundation. If he succeeds, he'll be copied.
If he doesn't, he'll be a footnote.
</P>
<P>
   This could easily be the beginning of a new era, almost like how
David Letterman shook up the way late-night TV talk was delivered
with an ironic twist against the establishment more than 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but Miller also went down this road once before. As a
syndicated talk-show host not long after he left ``Saturday Night
Live,'' Miller bombed. Of course, he made a comeback - on HBO,
where no language restrictions made a difference with his arcane
reference material.
</P>
<P>
   If anything this past month, Miller has quickly shown he's a
knowledgeable fan who, like anyone, can get bored watching bad
football - pretty much what any exhibition game turns into by
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Although that experience will come in handy when the
regular-season games become lopsided, they've been no real gauge of
how smoothly he'll fit in with Al Michaels and Dan Fouts once the
games become more important to the players and coaches - and
viewers, who have the final say with the remote controls.
</P>
<P>
   Critics opposed to the concept from the beginning watch with
baited notepads, ready to see if he slips up on a rule
interpretation or they think he mispronounces a name - especially
one like referee Phil Luckett.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who goes into the game with a list of one-liners on
notecards and says he preps about 30 hours a week, isn't apt to
change his ways. But he already says he's learned the art of
pulling back. He doesn't think it'll be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rehearsed a lot of different games - close games, blowouts,
times when a player was injured and we had 15 minutes to fill,''
said Michaels, entering his 15th year as the ``MNF'' play-by-play
caller. ``I can only go by what we did with (last season's) Super
Bowl in the fourth quarter - Dennis laid out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very smart, extremely observant and he gets it. If he has
something to say where the game develops its own frenzy, unless
it's something pertinent, he'll back off. I'm confident if we get
to that point in a game, he'll back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Don Ohlmeyer, supposedly never afraid to rock the
establishment, wants to somehow hold onto the concept that ``MNF''
isn't so much about being a freak show as it is delivering a game
in an entertaining fashion. Even with that fairly inaccurate
depiction, he continues to think Miller will be the right fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the publicity for Dennis has centered on his whimsical
lines, but he's had some real astute observations and generated
questions that have led to very interesting conversations,''
Ohlmeyer said. ``There's a lot more substance there than just
whimsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Fouts, the Hall of Fame quarterback whose father, Bob, was
a longtime play-by-play man for the San Francisco 49ers: ``I
appreciate the way he prepares. He knows what he's talking about.
He's like inviting a fan to your house to watch a game and finding
out he knows more than you thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of times, he slays me. One time, I had to take the
headset off I was laughing so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   TV numbers make no sense anyway, but particularly pay no
attention to the fact the three ``MNF'' exhibition telecasts
supposedly drew a 7.2 rating and 13 share, down 24 percent from
9.5/16 from a year ago. Two 4 p.m. West Coast starts because of
network convention coverage didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, people realize these ridiculous excuses for a contest
aren't worth watching, even for mindless athletic viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's rating will be the first measurement in TV Land, but
even then, it'll come with an asterisk. It's Labor Day, when many
are away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the digits will be dissected every which way. And
Miller will incorrectly either be given the credit or blame.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer continues to remind everyone that it's a work in
progress, not everyone will be pleased, but then, you can't please
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you really miss Boomer Esiason that much, he'll be
on the radio broadcast with Howard David and Matt Millen. Knock
yourself out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic this will be successful,'' said
Ohlmeyer.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if it's not, you can tune into the telecast where Miller
draws a big swooping circle on the Telestrator and puts a twist on
his classic ``Weekend Update'' sendoff: ``That's the game, and I am
outta here.''

SHEFFIELD CLOSE TO COMING BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The Los Angeles Dodgers leaned on left fielder Gary
Sheffield for most of the season and were one game over .500.
Illness and suspension cost Sheffield the past 11 games, but it
brought the Dodgers eight wins.
</P>
<P>
   The end of Sheffield's inactivity is close. But after his first
workout since becoming ill Aug. 22, he wasn't ready to say he would
return to the lineup today, when the Dodgers begin a three-game
series with Philadelphia at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm going to return, that's undetermined,'' Sheffield
said via telephone after working out at Dodger Stadium. ``It'll
probably be when I'm feeling like I can go score from first on a
hit and I can get in the outfield and chase two fly balls down. I'm
not that far away. About a day or two, though I should be fine
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield said he felt as good as can be expected after the
workout, though he added he's not yet 100 percent. He played catch
for five to 10 minutes and took batting practice for approximately
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little better,'' Sheffield said. ``Right now I'm just
getting over the aftermath to get right back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The viral infection has cost Sheffield a chance at the National
League home run crown, but he doesn't care about that. He cares
about winning, and in his absence the Dodgers played solid ball, at
one time winning eight of nine games.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dodgers lost their past two games and lost much of
the ground they had made up. They are seven games behind San
Francisco in the West with 28 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched all the games on TV,'' Sheffield said. ``It seemed
like they were playing with passion and with something on the line.
Unfortunately, we have a long ways to go to catch the other teams
ahead of us. Even with the way we were playing, other teams were
winning also.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sheffield's presence should give the Dodgers a jolt. When he
took ill, he was batting .331 and was one homer behind Chicago's
Sammy Sosa at 40 for the league lead. He entered Thursday trailing
Sosa by five and tied with Houston's Jeff Bagwell for second.
Sheffield's 96 RBI are one fewer than Eric Karros for the team
lead.
</P>
<P>
   It'll take time for Sheffield to return to full health - he's
lost about 10 pounds - but manager Davey Johnson said he'll use him
as much as possible. The Dodgers average 5.16 runs per game. They
went 8-3 without Sheffield, and scored 5.55 runs per game in his
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get him out of there in the eighth with a lead,'' Johnson
said. ``Sometimes you get guys in the lineup who will count on him,
and he's always doing it. But when he's not there, the other guys
are like, 'Well, I have to do it.' That's the way they have to feel
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's in left?: Want a quick synopsis of the Dodgers'
minor-league system? They have no maneuverability on their 40-man
roster and no outfielders ready to contribute at the major-league
level. So, with Sheffield ill and Devon White and Bruce Aven
injured, the Dodgers were left with a sizable gap in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Enter infielder Dave Hansen, who saw emergency action in left
field Friday in Chicago. He started in the outfield for the first
time in his eight-year major-league career Thursday and had three
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, who played outfield in rookie ball, has started three
games at first and eight games at third this season. With rosters
being expanded today, the Dodgers have no plans to recall an
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Center fielder Devon White pinch hit Wednesday,
but ran gingerly down the first-base line and said Thursday he
thought he was a few days from being able to play in center field
and handle the defensive load. ... The Dodgers are expected to
recall catcher Paul LoDuca and left-hander Onan Masaoka from
Triple-A Albuquerque and right-hander Luke Prokopec from Double-A
San Antonio as rosters expand to 40 today. Infielder Chris Donnels
is also slated to be activated from the disabled list.

ACLU WILL DEFEND GROUP BACKING SEX BETWEEN MEN AND BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By DON TERRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts has decided
to defend a group that advocates legalization of sex between men
and boys in a $200 million federal lawsuit brought by the family of
a murdered boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a real popular case,'' John Roberts, the executive
director of the Massachusetts ACLU, said Thursday. ``But the First
Amendment issues are clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the parents of the boy, 10-year-old Jeffrey Curley,
sued the North American Man/Boy Love Association in U.S. District
Court, charging that the group's Web site and literature had
incited the killing and attempted sexual assault of their son three
years ago in East Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The child, who was lured into a car by the promise of a new
bicycle, was missing for several days before his body was found in
a tub of concrete in a river. Two neighbors, Salvatore Sicari and
Charles Jaynes, were convicted of kidnapping and murder and are
serving life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Frisoli, the lawyer for the boy's parents, said Jaynes
was a member of the group, known as Nambla, and just before the
murder was emboldened by its Web site. ``This lawsuit isn't about
money,'' Frisoli said Thursday. ``Jeffrey's parents are doing this
to ensure that it never happens to someone else's child.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and other ACLU officials said Nambla did not advocate
the rape and murder of children. It advocates changing the law to
make sex between men and boys legal, and political advocacy,
Roberts said, is protected speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether people agree with or abhor Nambla's
views,'' the ACLU said in a statement Thursday, ``holding the
organization responsible for crimes committed by others who read
their material would gravely endanger our important First Amendment
freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU said, ``We join with all others in deploring the
heinous crimes committed against Jeffrey Curley,'' adding, ``those
who commit illegal acts can be punished for wrongful conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the expression of even offensive ideas is protected by the
Constitution,'' the ACLU said.
</P>
<P>
   Frisoli said Nambla's activities passed ``far beyond free
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We allege an ongoing criminal conspiracy for the rape of
children in America,'' he said. ``They've been hiding behind the
First Amendment for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week in a Massachusetts state court, in a suit against the
two men who were convicted of killing their son, the boy's parents
were awarded $328 million, one of the largest wrongful-death
verdicts in Massachusetts history, Frisoli said. Now, the family
hopes a federal jury will do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the ACLU, and on most occasions I agree with the
positions they take,'' he said. ``But we're not talking about gay
rights. We're not talking about consensual sex between adults. We
talking about the rape of children.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU office in Boston was deluged with phone calls Thursday,
mostly from the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threats haven't started yet,'' said Harvey Silverglate, a
board member. ``That usually comes a day later. But the phones
haven't stopped ringing. I find it extraordinary that people find
what we're doing extraordinary. You'd think by now that people
would know that we take the Supreme Court seriously when it says
that the First Amendment is there to protect unpopular speech.''

<P>
   Annie Devine, a no-nonsense Mississippi trailblazer for the
Voting Rights Act of 1965, died on Aug. 22 at a hospital in
Ridgeland, Miss. She was 88 and lived in nearby Canton.
</P>
<P>
   Devine, a soft-spoken woman with a ready smile, became deeply
involved in the civil rights movement of the early 1960s. She
helped organize voter registration drives in Canton and surrounding
Madison County, where fewer than 100 of the county's estimated
10,000 black adults were registered.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, blacks in the Deep South were kept from the ballot
boxes by legal chicanery and worse; in Mississippi 94 percent of
black adults were not registered. Largely due to Devine's efforts,
black residents began to show up at the county courthouse almost
daily, demanding to register.
</P>
<P>
   She attended the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic
City, N.J., along with Victoria Gray-Adams and Fannie Lou Hamer.
Their objective was to unseat their state's all-white delegation
and be recognized as delegates of the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party, of which Devine was a founder.
</P>
<P>
   After that failed, the three sought to run for the House of
Representatives, but were shunned by the white party establishment
and blocked from running as independents. When the new Congress was
sworn in January 1965, the three women, backed by hundreds of
protesters, demanded that the House deny membership to
Mississippi's representatives-elect because blacks had consistently
been prevented from registering and voting in the state. Their
effort, called the Mississippi Challenge, failed in the short run,
but led to a nationwide lobbying drive by the Mississippi Freedom
Democrats and calls for congressional investigations into voting in
Mississippi. Thus, the three women's resolve fed into the
groundswell that produced the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Devine was born in Mobile, Ala., and reared in Canton. She
graduated from Tougaloo Southern Christian College, now Tougaloo
College, and taught in the public schools. She was an executive for
a life-insurance company before she threw her energies into the
civil rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s she also helped found the Child Development Group
of Mississippi. Under its aegis she was a longtime volunteer in the
Head Start program, involving parents and marshaling community
support.
</P>
<P>
   Devine's husband, Andrew, died in 1973. She is survived by two
daughters, Monette Watts of Harvest, Ala., and Barbara Russell of
Canton; a son, Andrew, of Omaha; a brother, Garfield Heath of
Detroit; 8 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ralph Nader, running for president as the Green Party
nominee, railed against big business from the heart of corporate
America Thursday, crisscrossing Manhattan to condemn environmental
pollution, the exploitation of workers and the abuse of taxpayer
dollars through ``corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   He also dismissed his opponents, Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, as candidates whose similarities (favoring
businesses over workers, in Nader's view, and taking millions from
corporate donors) outweighed their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, the consumer advocate whose long-shot candidacy has
received comparatively little national media attention, began his
salvos from a prominent platform: a morning interview with Matt
Lauer on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are different in a few areas, but the rhetoric is more
different than the reality,'' Nader said of Bush and Gore on
``Today,'' as about 300 people milled about on a Rockefeller Center
sidewalk outside the studio. Some held signs demanding that the
major candidates open the presidential debates to Nader and one of
the Reform Party candidates, Pat Buchanan. Two men made the point
by wearing chicken suits to represent Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Today,'' Nader gave a separate interview on NBC's cable
cousin, MSNBC, then crossed the street to the headquarters of the
network's corporate parent, General Electric, where he criticized
the company for polluting the Hudson River. He also attacked Gore
and Bush for taking contributions from the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for General Electric to obey the law and pay for
its poisoning of the Hudson River and stop lying and deceiving the
public about the dangers,'' Nader said, referring to GE's legal
discharge of PCBs into the Hudson until 1977, when the chemicals
were banned by the federal government. He called for Bush and Gore
to give back the money their campaigns had received from GE.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Nader went to the Bowery, where he protested with
union workers at the New Silver Palace Restaurant, a 900-seat dim
sum parlor and banquet hall that once was the only unionized
restaurant in Chinatown. Former employees have waged a three-year
battle with the restaurant's management, which has been accused by
federal labor officials of antiunion hiring practices.
</P>
<P>
   Nader finished his campaign day on Wall Street, where he
criticized the city and state of New York for offering
multimillion-dollar tax breaks and other incentives to persuade
companies like the New York Stock Exchange to stay in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is this bastion of global capitalism on welfare,'' Nader
said, after taking a private tour of the Stock Exchange. ``Hundreds
of millions of taxpayer dollars in order to build them a new
building, at the same time hundreds of neighborhoods are suffering
from inadequate funding of their vital needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said that such ``corporate welfare'' was emblematic of the
problems of America's current two-party political system. Nader's
candidacy is widely seen less as an attempt to capture the White
House in November than an effort to influence the public debate.
</P>
<P>
   At various points since announcing his candidacy, it appeared
that Nader could garner a high enough percentage of the vote _
mostly from Gore _ in several key states, including California and
Michigan, to push Bush ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But recent polls have suggested that Nader's moment appears to
be fading, given Gore's surge in the polls after the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Field poll released last week showed that Nader
was supported by 4 percent of California voters, compared with 7
percent in a similar survey in June.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's swing through New York City Thursday followed a series
of fund-raisers and appearances on the East End of Long Island on
Wednesday. Earlier in the week, he and his running mate, Winona
LaDuke, staged a boisterous rally in Portland, Ore., that drew more
than 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   At his Manhattan appearances, Nader was trailed by small but
loyal bands of supporters: college and high school students,
environmentalists and those who said they were concerned about the
influence of large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how much of a threat he is to Bush and Gore,''
said David Joseph, 33, a graduate student in French at Hunter
College, outside the NBC studios Thursday morning. ``I want to see
something new, something fresh in the debates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Welfare reform, for example, would not be discussed in the
same fashion if Nader were not in the debates,'' said Joseph, a
registered Democrat who said he would vote for Nader in November.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rogovin, 59, of River Vale, N.J., who moved off the steps
of a building for Nader's Wall Street news conference, said he
would probably not vote for Nader, but was happy to see him in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is man for the people,'' Rogovin said. ``I don't believe he
will get elected or get a chance to debate the two power brokers.
Think, he would act as devil's advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why, Rogovin said, he answered, ``By all means'' when
Nader asked if he could use the steps.

MILLER LAID THE GROUNDWORK YEARS AGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Sidebar to media column) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dennis Miller's connection to ``MNF'' didn't just
start this season.
</P>
<P>
   The late Chet Forte, the Emmy Award-winning director for the
series during its magical run in the 1970s, became Miller's choice
to direct a season of his ``Dennis Miller Live'' show at HBO in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   That relationship began two years earlier when Miller started
his short-lived syndicated talk show. When he moved to Southern
California from New York, Miller dialed into the local radio
sports-talk jumble, particularly the ``Loose Cannons'' of XTRA-AM
(690), cohosted by Forte and Steve Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   Miller thought enough of Forte and Hartman to invite them on as
guests several times, though most of the nation didn't know who
they were. Miller just wanted to talk sports on his own show, and
in turn, he'd call in to the ``Cannons.'' That's where ``MNF''
producer Don Ohlmeyer first heard Miller's sports takes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in May, Miller phoned the ``Cannons'' show, which
Hartman cohosts with Bill Werndl. They somehow got into a
discussion about him being a candidate for the open ``MNF'' job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we planted a seed,'' Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   About six weeks later, ABC alerted the media to an afternoon
press conference where the new ``MNF'' team would be announced.
Hartman, who arrived at the San Diego station just before the start
of his 9 a.m. show, received word from a source that Miller was the
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Dennis at home, and he picks up the phone,'' said
Hartman. ``He says, 'What's up Stevie?' I'm thinking, 'What's he
doing home if he has to be at this big announcement?' But I said,
'I heard that in four hours, you're going to be named to the Monday
Night Football team.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, 'Really? You think they'd tell me, wouldn't ya?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was sworn to secrecy. He called Hartman back the next day
and apologized for having to lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't find out until the night before (Wednesday), and I
think he was really still in the state of shock,'' Hartman said.
``He really never thought he had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   While Miller says he's avoided reading the paper or listening to
sports talk reviews of his preseason performance, even turning down
Hartman for an appearance, he'll probably go back to being a
frequent ``Cannons'' contributor once the regular season begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a little gun shy at this point with some of the
criticism, although it's been pretty even,'' Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that he knows sports. He'll have to be himself and
everyone else is going to have to come up to speed. It's always
about chemistry. A lot of it has to do with them getting used to
Dennis.''

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN NEWS RELEASE FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Staff Writer Robert Monroe contributed to this story) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A former employee of an Internet news release
distributor was arrested Thursday, accused of fabricating a news
release that caused a technology company to lose $2.2 billion in
market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities identified the suspect as Mark Simeon Jakob,
23, of El Segundo, Calif., had been an employee of Internet Wire
until a week before the phony release about Emulex Corp. was sent
to Internet Wire for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob, who had left the Internet Wire on good terms a week
before the announcement, was arrested at his home about 7 a.m. The
investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said Jakob earned more than
$240,000 from his scheme and has been charged with securities and
wire fraud. If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In a simultaneous action Thursday morning, the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuit that seeks to freeze
Jakob's assets, including bank and brokerage accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob is believed to have used a computer at El Camino Community
College in Torrance, Calif., where he was a student, to send the
bogus news release.
</P>
<P>
   While an employee of the Los Angeles-based company, Jakob's job
was to receive press releases from companies and post them on the
Internet Wire Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used his knowledge of Internet Wire to get the release
circulated, not to get back at the company,'' Mayorkas said.
</P>
<P>
   The hoax started with an e-mail sent late last Aug. 24 to
Internet Wire. The notice was widely reported by Bloomberg News,
CBS MarketWatch and other news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The release appeared to be an Emulex announcement that Paul
Folino had resigned as chief executive officer, that the company's
recently reported fourth-quarter results were going to be restated
and that Emulex was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Caproni, the SEC's regional director, said Jakob
borrowed and sold 3,000 Emulex shares on Aug. 17 and 18 at about
$80 per share, hoping to profit by repurchasing the shares at a
lower price.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 24, the stock had risen to $113.063, leaving him with
$97,000 in losses. Later that evening, Caproni said Jakob used a
personal computer at the college library to issue the false press
release.
</P>
<P>
   When the Costa Mesa-based company's shares fell 62 percent the
next day based on the false information, Jakob covered his short
position, earning $55,000 and later purchasing 3,500 shares, which
he sold Monday after the stock had rebounded, earning $186,000.
</P>
<P>
   In approximately 16 minutes of trading, 2.3 million Emulex
shares were traded, and the price of the company's stock dropped to
$43 before Nasdaq officials halted trading.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which resumed trading about three hours later,
recovered to close at $105.75, down $7.313.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a significant increase in the trading volume of
Emulex stock, and many individual traders experienced significant
losses as they sold shares at prices significantly lower than their
purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators traced Jakob by following a trail of electronic
``footprints'' left by the e-mail he sent to Internet Wire. The
trail led FBI investigators to a personal computer at the library
that he had been using, Mayorkas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within several hours of the incident, he was identified,''
said Mayorkas. ``He created the bad news, causing the stock to fall
to cover his losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayorkas warned other investors looking to get rich quick that
they cannot count on the anonymity of the Internet to serve as a
shield for their illegal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of electronic terrorism cannot be tolerated,'' said
Paul Folino, president and chief executive officer of Emulex, in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quick results from this cooperative effort demonstrate to
others contemplating a similar hoax that the outcome to be expected
is immediate apprehension and prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have also seen their stock price manipulated by
false information released online.
</P>
<P>
   Caproni said there have been four such incidents, including this
one, in the last 18 months. They involved two Orange County firms,
PairGain Technologies and Bid.com, and Lucent Technologies of
Murray Hill, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a great tool for investors,'' she said. ``We
will not allow it to become a deadly weapon for those who want to
use it to harm the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet Wire, a 6-year-old distributor of press releases, says
on its Web site that it serves more than 2,500 clients and is
backed by two of the largest Silicon Valley venture capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   Sequoia Capital and Hummer Winblad Venture Partners are among
the investors in a first round of funding that closed in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet Wire is pleased that the investigation has progressed
so quickly and will continue to cooperate with with the
authorities,'' the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Competing press release distributors distanced themselves from
Internet Wire, stressing their source verification standards while
one academic marveled at what he called a high-tech story of
gullibility.
</P>
<P>
   Renu Aldrich, spokeswoman for PRNewswire, a 46-year-old wire
service, said the company has received numerous calls from clients
worried that they could be forced to endure such roller coaster
rides. She said that PRNewswire distributed an announcement to its
clients this week that outline its verification policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be stained by this incident,'' said Aldrich,
who called hers a ``completely different kind of company than
Internet Wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the standards and expertise to ensure that this
doesn't happen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A. Michael Noll, an Internet watcher and professor at the
University of Southern California's Annenberg School for
Communication, said Jakob's alleged fraud is merely the latest
instance of people irrationally believing sky-is-falling style
rumors.
</P>
<P>
   The difference now is how fast those rumors spread, causing
investors to dump Emulex stocks within minutes of the press
release's appearance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tendency to believe if the computer screen says two
plus two is five, it must be true,'' Noll said. ``It's very scary
the extent to which people fall for these kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Emulex gained $4.188, or 4.1 percent, to close
Thursday at $104.688 on moderate volume of 1,847,900 shares traded
on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

LOS ANGELES TRANSIT UNIONS MAY STRIKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contract talks with MTA bus and rail workers intensified as
officials prepared for the possibility of a strike that could
affect nearly 1.5 million commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for some 7,000 transportation employees in three
unions said Thursday they are ready to work through the weekend
with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in hopes of reaching
a new contract before Tuesday's strike deadline.
</P>
<P>
   A strike would cripple Los Angeles freeways, which after a
summer lull are expected to be strained as many students return to
school and workers come back from vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really not much we can do about the increased
traffic,'' said Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli. ``We have no
specific plan. We're encouraging people to get into car pools.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike would not affect the Metrolink commuter rail, which
is operated by a separate agency, the Southern California Rail
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Major sticking points in contract talks include wage increases,
a scaling back of workers' compensation costs, and the protection
of union benefits and work rules in the event a new bus transit
zone is created in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything possible to avoid a strike,'' said
Goldy Norton, a spokesman for the United Transportation Union,
which represents some 4,300 bus and rail operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want a strike, and we're not going to call one just
because there's a deadline _ only if it's absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis imposed a 60-day waiting period in July to delay
the possibility of a strike until after the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting period will end Tuesday and unions typically give at
least a 72-hour public advisory before calling a strike, meaning a
Tuesday strike would likely be announced at least by Saturday,
Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as talks continue with the UTU, negotiations with the other
two unions have produced demands that current contracts be kept in
force if the Valley transit zone is formed.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA has offered wage increases of about 2.7 percent, but the
unions want about 4.25 percent, according to MTA negotiator Tom
Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Webb said bus and rail operators already make an average of
$50,000 per year, not including up to $20,000 in overtime.
Mechanics average $56,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to lower our overhead so we can continue to grow and
be more competitive and increase job security,'' Webb said. ``We've
added routes and subway service over the past three years that have
created more than 1,000 new union jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton declined to comment on specific negotiating points.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts for the three unions expired June 30 without a renewal
agreement, but Davis imposed the 60-day ``cooling-off'' period that
will end at midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A strike would halt most public transit in the city and the
other two transportation unions would likely respect the picket
lines.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to avert a strike would be to reach a last-minute
agreement or temporarily extend the existing contract. The governor
does not have the authority to intervene again.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has gone without a major transportation stoppage for
two decades, with only a nine-day walkout in 1994 and a five-day
strike in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said tentative agreement was reached this week on some
key issues, but declined to discuss specifics or say whether those
included wages or workers' compensation practices.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue for the union is revamping the MTA's workers'
compensation program, which the agency claims costs $70 million a
year, more than six times that of New York City Transit. The MTA
also wants to add more part-time employees and expand on a
four-day, 40-hour workweek to save money on overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Webb said the unions are responsible for the talks dragging on
for so long, but Norton insisted the MTA didn't even have a wage
increase proposal on the table until after the governor called for
the 60-day intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The Amalgamated Transit Union, representing some 1,800 mechanics
and maintenance staffers, and the Transportation Communications
Union, representing roughly 650 clerical workers, are seeking
similar protection clauses in their contracts to those affecting
the UTU.

FIELD HAD EARLY TEST AT ALABAMA

   LOS ANGELES _ When Bob Field finished his senior season at
Arkansas in 1970, he walked into the office of coach Frank Broyles
and told him he wanted to become a coach. Broyles asked Field, now
the UCLA defensive coordinator, who he'd like to work for and the
young man didn't hesitate: Bear Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chuckled,'' Field said of Broyles. ``He said, 'I'll give
you credit for this: you set your goals high.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Broyles went to a national coaching convention the next week and
when he checked in, there was a message from Bryant asking whether
Broyles knew of any young assistants in his program who would be
interested in coaching at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like an answer to a prayer,'' said Field, who
spent the next two years as a graduate assistant under Bryant,
working with assistants like John David Crow, Pat Dye, Danny Ford
and Bill Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an amazing experience. Coach Bryant was extremely
knowledgeable and a great motivator of individuals and teams. He
expected the same of everybody who played for him or coached for
him, whether you were a walk-on or an All-American or a graduate
assistant or a coordinator.''
</P>
<P>
   Check the pompons at the door: At the start of most major
sporting events, a directive is usually given to the media: No
cheering in the press box.
</P>
<P>
   This could be difficult for ABC-TV analyst Tim Brant, who will
be working the UCLA-Alabama game Saturday with Keith Jackson. Brant
also happens to be the father of Kevin Brant, a UCLA freshman
strong safety who will be in on the Bruins' kickoff and punt return
units.
</P>
<P>
   This won't be Bob Griese choking up when his son Brian led
Michigan to a Rose Bowl win, but it's something father and son are
looking forward to since Tim's work schedule allowed him to see
only one of Kevin's high school games in their hometown of
Bethesda, Md. Tim could work as many as five UCLA games this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to block it out that he's out there,'' said Tim,
who was at practice Thursday. ``If I have to mention him, I'll
probably be harder on him than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he'll be professional,'' Kevin said. ``Hopefully,
I'll make a few plays and give him something to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   BYU Dreamin': Alabama quarterbacks coach Charlie Stubbs, a
former offensive coordinator at Oregon State in the late `80s, is
one in a long line of candidates for the BYU coaching job after
LaVell Edwards retires at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Bears offensive coordinator Gary Crowton is the
front-runner and Cal coach Tom Holmoe is a strong candidate, but if
Alabama contends for a national title, Stubbs knows it won't hurt
his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the school and I share the same (religion),'' said
Stubbs, a Mormon who graduated and coached at BYU. ``I know it's
something that's out there, but this is Coach Edwards' year to have
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Webbs tangled: Fifth-year senior Micah Webb, who was expected to
provide veteran depth in the offensive line, has quit the team
because of chronic shoulder problems. His twin brother Josh, also
an offensive lineman, still hasn't recovered from offseason surgery
on both shoulders and his playing status is in doubt.

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was the sound of camera shutters madly clicking
like a playing card in a bicycle spoke, but the zoom lenses
captured no hint of emotion in the dark brown eyes of Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   There were delicately worded questions about the recent
disclosure concerning the diagnosis of breast cancer in his mother
last year and in his sister last month, but the inquiries barely
caused a rumple in the deep creases of Agassi's forehead.
</P>
<P>
   He was understandably detached, unmoved and monotone in his
responses. Instead of a public catharsis, Agassi chose to keep what
he was feeling inside. It was the same way on the stage of Arthur
Ashe Stadium. When his opponent, Arnaud Clement, peered through his
wraparound shades, he could see an unfocused defending U.S. Open
champion across the net.
</P>
<P>
   He was not himself. Normally, Agassi's reflexes are quick, his
instincts have an edge and the crafty angles of his shots appear
choreographed by a pool shark. Normally, when he stands to return
serve, he shuffles his feet before pouncing on the ball. Normally,
he wouldn't go down like this.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the un-Agassi Thursday. In the end, the fast-acting
Clement aggressively seized upon Agassi's distracted performance on
his way to a straight-set upset of the Open's top-seeded player,
6-3, 6-2, 6-4. With second-seeded Gustavo Kuerten having been
undone on Tuesday, it will mark the first time in the Open Era,
which began in 1968, that the top two seeded players will not
advance to the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi was out, and the dream semifinal against Pete Sampras was
over. As Agassi exited from the stadium to sympathetic applause, he
waved, signed an autograph and briskly departed like a man with
more important issues to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a tennis player fueled by his heart, emotions, beliefs
and those he holds dearest to his heart,'' said Gil Reyes, Agassi's
friend and trainer for 10 years. ``When all is not well, you can
see it in his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is like every human being. We all have issues that we carry
deep within. Usually, it stays inside of Andre until he has it
sorted out. Right now, I think he's in the process of sorting it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, playing didn't seem at all therapeutic for Agassi. Not
that anyone could have helped pull him through, but the popular
player's support group was thin on size. While the suites were
filled, there was a vast ring of empty blue seats at the top of
Arthur Ashe Stadium. At the same time, there were lines filled with
Anna Kournikova fans forming to get into Louis Armstrong Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   They had to get their Kournikova fix. And the perpetually
sun-kissed Kournikova fed their addictions _ and ended their fears
of a second-round exit _ by cutting down her errors to erase a
series of early service breaks. The instant she dismissed Sandra
Kleinova, 6-4, 6-1, there was a sigh of relief on the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Although Serena Williams advanced to the third round in less
than an hour Thursday night, the afternoon was inundated with deep
exhales by a couple of top women. The fourth-seeded Mary Pierce had
to regroup after a series of careless forehands and mishandled
volleys caused her to drop the second set against the youngest of
the flying Maleeva sisters. But Magdalena, the sibling of Manuela
and Katerina, could not sustain her run of five second-set aces,
and Pierce went on to close her out, 7-5, 2-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Lindsay Davenport also had a scare. For the
entire first set, the nimble Kim Clijsters ran down Davenport's
heavy ground strokes, transferred that incoming power into
blistering passing shots and had her slower opponent on a futile
chase around the court. But as Clijsters' drop-shots began to sit
up too high, when she couldn't combat Davenport's rise in
intensity, she left worn and defeated, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Grand Slam,'' said Davenport, who fought off a break
point in the third game of the second set, then ran off five games
in a row. ``I mean, I wasn't ready to walk out yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi left almost eagerly. Moments after his match, he walked
into the interview room, listened to the questions and dispersed
short replies. When asked if his heart was in the match, he said
flatly, ``Yeah, very much.'' When asked if his recent back injury
hampered his movement, he said, ``No.'' After being asked at what
point he found out that his mother and sister were ill, he said,
``When it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, and for the first and only time, he did
discuss the health of his sister, Tammee, and his mother,
Elizabeth, during an interview with the CBS tennis analyst Mary
Carillo. At one point, he talked about how difficult it was to
maintain his concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, that was evident. An initial hit of adrenaline _ which
left him up 2-0 in the first set _ quickly petered out. On break
point in the eighth game of the first set, Agassi failed to get his
feet in position for a forehand that careened into the net. By the
end of the first set, Agassi had lost 14 of 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure he can't play a great match today,'' said Clement,
whom Agassi credited for his ability to finish off the big points.
``He did a lot of mistakes. Me, I don't think about him. I just
think about me.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded cold. But few could blame him. Agassi's issues were
his own. ``He'll work it out,'' Reyes said. ``He's a strong
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi is a soul-searcher by nature. Through his many
incarnations _ from the rock-star blond, to the Zen friend of
Barbra Streisand, from an everyman dealing with his failed marriage
to Brooke Shields, to a 30-year-old with perspective _ Agassi's
career has fluttered up and down according to his personal life.
When he's at peace, he's at his best.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, even if his remarks were unrevealing, his play gave a
transparent look into his soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to set aside everything and play,'' Reyes said.
``He's going through a lot right now.''

FEDERAL AGENCY FINDS WORKFARE CONTRACTOR VIOLATED WAGE LAW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)  By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nation's largest operator of welfare-to-work
programs violated federal law by paying lower wages to women than
to men placed in the same jobs in a Milwaukee warehouse, according
to a decision made public yesterday by the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Maximus Inc., has been under mounting criticism for
its business practices in recent months. A state judge in Manhattan
has held up the Giuliani administration's plans to award Maximus
more than $100 million in contracts to help welfare recipients find
work. And state auditors in Wisconsin recently found that the
company had billed the state for $466,000 in improper or
questionable expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The federal commission's ruling found that a woman placed in
warehouse jobs by MaxStaff, the company's temporary employment
agency, was paid $7.01 an hour while five male co-workers got
$8.13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously very disappointed with the determination,''
said Rachael Rowland, a spokeswoman for Maximus. ``We respectfully
disagree with it. We remain confident that no discrimination
occurred in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   She repeated an earlier explanation by Maximus executives that
the difference was based on the worker's being paid ``a training
wage'' in a program for people with little job history.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission ruled against the company. ``Examination of
the evidence indicates that female employees working in warehouse
positions had substantially equal qualifications to males working
in the same positions, but were paid lower wages even though
females were performing the same duties as males,'' the ruling
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Jones, the woman who filed the complaint, said she did
have job experience, including work as a machine operator, a
warehouse carton packer and a building maintenance worker. ``It was
my prior experience as a union steward that helped me recognize
this was wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Bravo, the director of 9to5, the National Association of
Working Women, an advocacy group, told Wisconsin legislators who
are auditing the company that the Jones case revealed a fundamental
flaw in the state's welfare-to-work program, designed in part by
Jason A. Turner, now New York City's welfare commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was not to remove women from poverty, but simply from
the welfare rolls,'' she said. ``Consequently, any job was good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, now 33, said she had asked a MaxStaff supervisor a year
ago why she, the only woman, was being paid less than all the men.
The supervisor told her that she was mistaken, and later warned
workers that they could be fired if they discussed wages. At that
point, the commission said in its ruling, the company began hiring
males at a lower rate of pay _ apparently in an effort to cover up
sex discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones privately challenged male employees to prove their
earnings and collected pay stubs that she took to the commission.
Eight days later, she was fired.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the commission to now try to eliminate the
unlawful employment practices with persuasion and conciliation. If
that fails, the commission can go to court.

DODGERS SLIP BACK AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ It's the first day of September, the day postseason
rosters are set. By all rights, it should be a meaningful day for a
team which has been revamped twice in the past two years at a cost
of $98 million - its payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after the Los Angeles Dodgers lost to Milwaukee 8-2
Thursday at County Stadium, they're faced with this grim reality:
Any headway they made by starting out a road trip with five wins in
six games was simply tossed away with a pair of losses to the
Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers turned a week of optimism that bred faint hope into
the fact they made up a half game in the standings and another week
has passed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bit of ugliness, or reality, was the wretched return
of Carlos Perez to the starting rotation. He then gave up six runs
on seven hits in two-plus innings and again made folks wonder just
why he's in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   And it could get worse today since the Dodgers send right-hander
Ismael Valdes, who's 0-2 with a 7.33 ERA since returning to the
Dodgers in late July, out to start against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as August turned into September and the Dodgers tried to
re-introduce themselves as playoff hopefuls, they sent Perez to the
mound one day and will send Valdes on the next. The two of them are
a combined 7-13 with a 5.61 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are looking for me to go to a four-man (rotation),''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``I'm looking to find who my
fourth man would be. I need them to stand up.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez was put back in the rotation partly because he pitched
well in relief, partly because the Dodgers need Matt Herges in the
bullpen, partly because Herges wasn't stellar in four starts, but
mostly because he has a contract that pays him $7.5 million next
season.
</P>
<P>
   For that money, the Dodgers have been willing to give Perez more
chances in the last two seasons than most players get in a career,
namely because they want a return on their investment at some
point.
</P>
<P>
   But after going 0-0 with a 1.78 ERA in relief, and after
allowing one run in 6 innings in a spot start last Friday in
Chicago, the crapshoot that is a Carlos Perez start continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt a little stiff,'' said Perez, who started last
Friday and relieved Sunday. ``I missed the location a lot of times,
and when you miss location some people are going to hit the ball. I
was, most of the time, behind in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed a solo homer to USC product Geoff Jenkins and an
RBI double to Jeromy Burnitz as Milwaukee went ahead 2-1 in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   After an uneventful second inning, Perez was knocked from the
game without recording an out in the third. Mark Loretta led off
with a walk, which was followed by four hits. Herges relieved and
yielded a one-out, two-run single to Luis Lopez as the Brewers took
a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes (Perez) goes out there and pitches great and other
times he goes out there and gets in trouble and can't get out,''
Johnson said. ``We didn't get much offense, but usually when you
fall behind like that it's tough to crank it up.''
</P>
<P>
   And while a mountain of pressure is being heaped upon Johnson's
shoulders, not only is he sending Perez and Valdes out on
back-to-back days to start, the minor-league system is also barren.
So much so that infielder Dave Hansen was asked to play left field
because Devon White and Bruce Aven are injured and Gary Sheffield
remained in Los Angeles, trying to kick a viral infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing pretty good (on the trip),'' Hansen said.
``Their guy (Paul Rigdon) kept us off balance and did a nice job.
Our energy was there at the beginning. That guy just got some big
outs. We'll take this time on the (flight) back to focus on where
we need to go.''

GIULIANI, BACKTRACKING, IS UNDECIDED   ON   TREATMENT FOR PROSTATE
CANCER
</HEADLINE>
  By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After saying definitively last week that he had
decided on a course of treatment for his prostate cancer, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani has said three times this week, including
Thursday, that he has not made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to express my leanings until I actually decide
it,'' Giuliani said Thursday in extensive remarks about his cancer
treatment during a news conference at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's public comments in the past month about his treatment
for his illness have sometimes been confusing.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, in a live television interview with Tom Brokaw on
MSNBC, the mayor said for the first time that he had been
undergoing preliminary hormone treatments for 2 1/2 months and that
the hormones had reduced the levels of prostate specific antigens
in his blood to ``minuscule'' amounts. He said he would decide on a
final treatment, either surgery or radiation, within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Giuliani said he had decided on a final treatment but
that he did not want to disclose it. Then on Tuesday, Giuliani told
Diane Sawyer on ``Good Morning America'' that he had not made a
final decision and reiterated that with David Letterman on
Letterman's talk show and Thursday to reporters at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also emphasized that the hormones, which he said had
reduced his prostate specific antigen, or PSA, level were only a
preliminary treatment and that he would definitely have either
surgery or radiation within a month or two.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have said that radiation treatments might well be an
out-patient procedure, while surgery could require him to take up
to three weeks off from work. Giuliani had earlier indicated that
he was leaning toward radiation, but his recent comments seemed to
have left the door open to the possibility of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery is the choice of most men of Giuliani's age, which is
56. It has a high cure rate, but it also can cause impotence and
incontinence. Doctors say that radiation, particularly in the form
of ``seeds'' inserted into the prostate, may affect sexual function
less, but its longterm cure rates are not known.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Thursday that his PSA level, which he said was
fallen to below one, indicated that the growth of his cancer had
been arrested but that ``it wouldn't necessarily last.'' Doctors
say that over time, cancer cells can become resistant to hormone
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael J. Droller, the chairman of urology at Mount Sinai
Medical Center, said Thursday that a PSA level of four was ``the
traditional threshold'' for more evaluation of a patient but that
many other factors determine whether someone has cancer. Droller is
not involved in Giuliani's case.
