<HEADLINE> Chemistry student accused of blackmailing Internet company  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A graduate student at Colorado State
University was arrested Wednesday and accused of trying to extort
money, a car and free downloads from a New Jersey company that sold
digital books over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Wayne-based company, which was not named by federal
authorities, received 10 threatening e-mails from an account of
Nelson Robert Holcomb from April 20 to May 1, according to court
papers filed by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail said the sender had discovered how to download the
books for free, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not reveal the weakness to the media and the company's
partners in return for a sum equal to the retail value of the
content on the victim's Web site, a 2001 Volvo T5 Wagon, two
Diamond Rio 500 Digital Audio Players, and unlimited free downloads
of the company's content, court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   The company responded on May 2 and agreed to provide everything
but the money.
</P>
<P>
   The company had probably already notified the FBI of the threat
and was cooperating with investigators, FBI Special Agent Sandra
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI, the company got an e-mail the next day
from someone who identified himself as Rob Holcomb and said he was
the person who had contacted the company. He gave a mailing address
and work phone number at the school's chemistry department in Fort
Collins, Colo., the FBI documents said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 8, an e-mail from Holcomb's school account said he would
be willing to sign a nondisclosure agreement, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Holcomb was arrested at his Fort Collins, Colo., home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Holcomb, 36, appeared in federal court in Denver on Wednesday,
where bail was set at $50,000. U.S. Magistrate Patricia A. Coan
barred Holcomb from any Internet access or from disseminating
information about the company, said Michael Drewniak, a spokesman
for the U.S. attorney's office in Newark, where the charges were
filed.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Holcomb for comment were not successful
Wednesday. A message left at his work number in the chemistry
department was not immediately returned, and the phone at his home
in Fort Collins rang unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Holcomb, who goes by ''Rob,'' has been a graduate student at
CSU's chemistry department since 1995, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on the single charge, using the Internet to send
extortion threats, Holcomb faces up to two years in prison and a
$100,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Lazio listens to farmers, promises support  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELBRIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Newly declared Republican Senate candidate
Rick Lazio pledged to be a vocal supporter on agricultural issues
after a morning down on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting a page from Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign playbook,
Lazio met with a group of 40 farmers in a pond-side forum Wednesday
and listened to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am here to keep my ears open and learn and not presume to
know all the answers ... and make sure I'm responsive to the things
that you are thinking about day in and day out,'' said Lazio, who
later headed off to Washington to vote in favor of normalizing
trade relations with China -- a development the farmers applauded
for the new markets it could open to them.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering at Bob Hill's dairy farm just west of Syracuse was
reminiscent of the forums the first lady has staged across the
state over the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lazio aides confirmed they were planning a Sen. John
McCain-style, three-day bus trip to carry the Long Island
congressman across the state in the wake of Tuesday's state GOP
nominating convention in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Media guru Mike Murphy, who helped engineer McCain's ''Straight
Talk Express'' presidential campaign bus tours, is now working on
the Lazio campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio was visiting the farm, Clinton was in Pittsburgh for
a morning speech to the Service Employees International Union's
convention. The union is backing her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   While not criticizing Lazio by name, the first lady attacked
Republicans who control Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time they had an opportunity to derail progress on
education or health care or economic opportunity, they stood in the
way,'' she told 1,200 union delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio entered New York's U.S. Senate race last week following
New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's decision to bow out because of
his prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman began the day touring Hill's 1,000-acre dairy
farm. Unlike Clinton, who generally has traveled around the state
in a customized van driven by Secret Service agents and an
entourage in tow, Lazio drove himself to Hill's farm, accompanied
by one aide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary stays with millionaires. Lazio thinks more like real
people, the people who struggle everyday to make a living,'' said
Dale Mussen, one of those who attended the pond-side forum on
Hill's property.
</P>
<P>
   As Lazio walked around the property, the seventh-generation
farmer described the hardships of modern-day farming, telling Lazio
he has already spent nearly $30,000 trying to comply with new
federal regulations governing farm waste and will spend more.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately, it's going to make this a better farm, but we need
financial help. It's quite a burden for farmers to bear,'' said
Hill, who milks 100 cows and also grows corn, soybeans and alfalfa.
</P>
<P>
   The two stopped in front of a $76,000 tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twenty years ago, that tractor cost $9,000. But I'm getting
the same price for milk now that I was back then. This is all
coming out of our hide. Farmers are in a tough spot,'' Hill told
the congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio told Hill and the other farmers he supported a dairy
compact that would provide stable milk prices. Clinton has also
come out in favor of allowing New York to join the Northeast
Interstate Dairy Compact.
</P>
<P>
   During Lazio's 20-minute meeting with the farmers, price
volatility for agricultural products was a frequent topic,
especially for milk which has varied by as much as 40 percent in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are working with a price support system that was designed
in the 1940s,'' said Thomas Trinder, a dairy farmer from nearby
Fabius. ''We are not in the 40s. This is not a 40s economy ...
something's out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Besides, this system was not designed to help farmers. It was
designed for housewives and consumers to ensure they had a supply
of good milk,'' added Jack Russin, a dairy farmer from Madison.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers cited high fuel and utility costs, farmland
preservation and commodity surpluses among their concerns.

<HEADLINE> Attorney general approves Empire Blue Cross plan  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which
insures many of the state's working poor among its 4.1 million
subscribers, has pledged no one will lose coverage or benefits if
it operates for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shouldn't affect rates at all,'' state Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer said. On Wednesday he announced his approval of a
negotiated agreement Empire needed to move toward for-profit
status.
</P>
<P>
   ''The modified conversion plan addresses the financial needs of
the company, while at the same time preserving the charitable
assets for the benefit of the public,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Empire, once notorious for high debt and high
executive perks and salaries, protects its subscribers, he said.
The agreement includes an independent nonprofit foundation that
would own the for-profit firm and hold its stock in trust for the
state's taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mandate of the foundation would be increased access to
health care,'' Spitzer said. Long term, ''the leaders of the
company have long believed that a conversion is a significant part
of the business model to secure the financial health of the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the effort, like Citizen Action of New York, have
said the national trend of insurers becoming for-profit companies
has led to more people without insurance while eroding the public's
faith in the health system.
</P>
<P>
   Empire, however, said that increasing access to health care has
been part of the company's foundation proposal for more than three
years, said spokeswoman Deborah Bohren. She said the company is
still resolving details with the national Blue Cross-Blue Shield
organization, which must approve any change to for-profit status.
She said she couldn't comment further because of those discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Sherzer, counsel for New Yorkers for Accessible Health
Coverage, said his activist group is hopeful Empire will maintain a
mission of providing more health coverage. He said many other
non-profit insurers are watching closely.
</P>
<P>
   The role of state taxpayers in Empire is considerable. For six
decades the company received tax breaks, discounted hospital rates
and other subsidies in exchange for insuring New Yorkers in need.
</P>
<P>
   The company now says it needs to covert to a more traditional
profit-making entity so it can compete for customers with other
insurance companies, Dr. Michael Stocker, Empire's chief executive
officer, has said. Empire needs its status changed to raise money
on Wall Street to buy other health care plans as well as new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Based in New York City, Empire has 5,000 subscribers in 28
eastern and southern New York counties. It is the same Blue hit in
the early 1990s with a string of debt, high rates, consumer
dissatisfaction and high management costs. Today, consumer
advocates agree the firm is operated better.
</P>
<P>
   Empire still needs approval by the Blue Cross-Blue Shield
Association and the state Legislature.

<HEADLINE> Dentists reach agreement with state on Medicaid fee increase  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York state and dentists have reached an
agreement that will mean higher fees for dentists when they treat
Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-court settlement signed Wednesday by a federal
magistrate should also result in dental care being more widely
available for Medicaid recipients, the state Dental Society said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will provide $573 million more in Medicaid dental fees
over the next four years and should reverse what the executive
director of the Dental Society, Roy Lasky, called the ''collapse''
of the state's dental Medicaid system.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some areas of the state, currently no dentists will accept
Medicaid reimbursement,'' said Dr. Bertram Bildner, president of
the Dental Society. ''Patients are relegated to seek emergency care
from hospitals or to travel to neighboring counties or out-of-state
for their dental treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13,000-member Dental Society filed suit in February 1999
claiming that dental Medicaid rates have not appreciably increased
in New York for three decades. That, in turn, had left more than 1
million low-income New York children without access to important
dental health care, the suit claimed.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to the two sides argue the case in court,
District Judge Norman Mordue in Syracuse had urged the parties to
try to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The new fee schedule, which goes into effect June 1, calls for
the current dentists' reimbursement for a basic examination or an
adult to go from $10 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   A typical four-picture set of X-rays will increase from $5 to
$20 and a common procedure where a fluoride sealant is applied to a
tooth will go up from $18 to $25.50.
</P>
<P>
   Reimbursement for a crown will increase from $300 to $400, the
same as for dentures.
</P>
<P>
   The old fee schedule only covered 30 percent or less of
dentists' costs for treating Medicaid patients, said Dental Society
spokeswoman Judi Schub.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, $132 million more will be available in
Medicaid funds to dentists for the period from June 1 to March 31,
2001. It also calls for Pataki to appoint a committee with members
from the Dental Society and the Health Department to study the new
fee structure, how it is affecting the availability of services to
Medicaid patients and to recommend further changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be an innovative and creative approach,'' Schub said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was signed Wednesday by U.S. Magistrate David
Homer in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The state Health Department could not provide any information
about the $573 million agreement Wednesday nor comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new 2000-01 state budget, the state also raised
fees for physicians and other medical professionals treating
Medicaid patients. Advocates for the poor said the old fee schedule
was deterring many doctors from opening their doors to Medicaid
patients.

<HEADLINE> Seminerio says he will not support McCall for governor  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A dissident Democrat in the failed attempt
to overthrow Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver says he will not
support H. Carl McCall for governor in 2002 because the state
comptroller was publicly silent during the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Anthony Seminerio of Queens said Wednesday he will
never ''forgive'' McCall for failing to openly support former
Majority Leader Michael Bragman in the coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Seminerio said he called the comptroller twice last week when
Bragman first aired his challenge to Silver's leadership and was
told by McCall that he would support Bragman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then I found out later on by Saturday and Sunday he changed
his mind. He went with the speaker,'' Seminerio told the Albany
radio station WROW-AM.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm Sicilian. I don't forgive,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman was an early backer of McCall -- the only black elected
to statewide office in New York -- for governor in 2002. Silver has
been thought to favor the other most likely candidate at this
point, federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Seminerio said McCall ''might have gotten a commitment from
Shelly that he'll back him as governor.'' but that McCall will
''never get'' Silver's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   In not publicly supporting Bragman, McCall has also lost
Seminerio's backing.
</P>
<P>
   ''No way will I ever get on board,'' said Seminerio, a maverick
legislator who in 1998 raised ire among fellow Democrats by
endorsing Republican George Pataki for governor over Democratic
Peter Vallone. He said Wednesday he supports U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio
over Hillary Rodham Clinton in the U.S. Senate race -- ''If Satan
ran against Hillary, I'd vote for Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall spokesman Dennis Tompkins denied Seminerio's charges that
the comptroller switched sides in the Bragman-Silver dispute and
said the assemblyman ''never said he was going to back us anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Tompkins said Seminerio called McCall just once, to urge him to
support Bragman and ''expressed concern'' that if the attempted
challenge fails, he would lose his $20,000-a-year stipend as
assistant majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wanted to get the comptroller to 'call the brothers,'''
Tompkins told the Associated Press. ''The comptroller felt it was
inappropriate to turn this into a racial issue. This is a matter
that should be resolved by the Assembly majority.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall is considered an influential voice among minority
legislators in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   McCall still considers Bragman ''a very good friend'' and has a
''very strong relationship'' with the ex-majority leader, Tompkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he spoke with McCall by telephone Tuesday and
assured the comptroller that ''I was his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In regard with his bid to be governor, we will talk'' he said.
''As far as me believing he has tremendous experience, that's just
not something you turn on and turn off.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's aides said he will attend Bragman's annual fund-raising
clambake in North Syracuse, being held tonight. The event regularly
attracts several thousand people and has become a must-attend event
in recent years for New York politicians.
</P>
<P>
   After initially saying he will not go to the clambake, state
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer revised his decision Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We endeavor not be drawn into this. However, the attorney
general had made a commitment to attend the event before and he
will honor that,'' Spitzer spokesman Darren Dopp said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom Bragman has worked
hard for, will also attend the clambake, spokesman Howard Wolfson
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer sent his regrets. Schumer spokeswoman
Cathie Levine said that ''as in years past, he can't make it
because of (Senate) votes'' scheduled for today.

<HEADLINE> Even a Little CPR May Help  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a surprising study released today, researchers found that
more victims of cardiac arrest may be saved when bystanders skip
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and perform only chest compressions
until help arrives.
</P>
<P>
   The finding also could lead to major changes in the CPR
instructions dispatchers give to ordinary people who call 911.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will probably catch on quickly,'' said Dr. Russell
Harris, past president of the New Jersey chapter of the American
College of Emergency Physicians and chief of emergency medicine at
Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an excellent recommendation that may actually increase
the number of people who receive bystander CPR'' by ending worries
of catching hepatitis, AIDS or other diseases from mouth-to-mouth
contact, he said.
</P>
<P>
   University of Washington researchers found that 40 percent of
Seattle-area cardiac arrest patients who were given only chest
compressions by bystanders survived to reach a hospital, compared
with 34 percent of those who also received mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 15 percent of the 241 patients receiving chest
compressions alone eventually made it home from the hospital,
compared with only about 10 percent of the 279 who received both
components of CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   That means that patients getting both seemed only three-quarters
as likely to make it out of the hospital alive.
</P>
<P>
   The study was published today in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Al Hallstrom, a professor of biostatistics who led the research,
said there were not enough patients in the study to say for certain
whether those getting only compressions really do fare better, but
''we are reasonably sure it's better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom said one explanation is that it takes longer for a
dispatcher to explain to someone with no medical training how to
perform both components of CPR -- 2.4 minutes vs. 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and other experts also said it is too complicated for
many untrained people during an emergency to correctly alternate
chest compressions with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, which
involves extending the person's neck, squeezing the nostrils shut
and blowing forcefully into the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The study focused on cases of cardiac arrest caused by
ventricular fibrillation, a quickly fatal condition in which the
heart's main pumping chambers quiver instead of delivering blood to
the rest of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom said giving chest compressions alone works because
when the heart goes into ventricular fibrillation, most of the
blood still contains oxygen. So compressions that keep the blood
circulating can supply the brain, heart and other organs with
enough oxygen for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Martin, executive director of the National Academy of
Emergency Medical Dispatch, which writes CPR instructions for
thousands of dispatchers nationwide, said that in August, the group
will debate whether untrained bystanders should be told to give
just chest compressions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's likely going to be accepted at some time in the near
future,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was done from 1992 to 1998 in the dispatch center in
Washington's King County.
</P>
<P>
   When someone witnessing an apparent cardiac arrest called 911, a
dispatcher would send help and ask if the caller knew CPR. If not,
the dispatcher would randomly instruct the caller either to give
just chest compressions, or to give mouth-to-mouth too.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers excluded cases where respiratory arrest, drug
overdose, stroke or something else was the primary problem.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Potts of the American Heart Association said the
compression-only strategy ''may be a preferred way for instructing
someone who has never had CPR training.''
</P>
<P>
   The association is drawing up new guidelines for release in
August. In the meantime, ''overall, we would still recommend that a
combination of chest compression and ventilation be used whenever
it's by a person who has had training in CPR,'' Potts said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Harris said medical personnel may end up scrapping
the term CPR because the ''pulmonary'' part -- the lungs -- would no
longer be involved.

<HEADLINE> Slain police remembered at annual memorial service  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDEN, Conn. (AP) -- It's been 50 years since Torrington police
officer Anthony Barbieri died on duty, but his son, Richard, still
has vivid memories.
</P>
<P>
   Barbieri recalled Wednesday how he would occasionally play hooky
from school so he could go fishing with his father, who worked six
days a week. Then one day when Richard Barbieri was 16, the police
chief came to his house to tell him his father had suffered a fatal
heart attack after subduing a violent young man.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's something you don't forget,'' Barbieri said, his eyes
watering.
</P>
<P>
   Barbieri joined hundreds of police officers, family members and
elected officials in remembering fallen police officers at the 12th
annual memorial ceremony at the Connecticut Police Academy.
</P>
<P>
   His father's name was one of two added to a monument honoring
123 officers from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies
who died in the line of duty in Connecticut since 1880.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what this monument is all about-- not forgetting,'' said
former Governor William A. O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Barbieri died 50 years ago, but his name was inadvertently left
off the monument. After his son noticed the oversight, the name was
added to the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm gratified,'' Barbieri said. ''It's just very heartwarming
that he gets recognized after all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Also honored at the ceremony Wednesday was Middletown Sgt.
George Dingwall, who was killed in January when his cruiser crashed
while chasing two robbery suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Dingwall was an exemplary police officer who loved his job and
family, Middletown Police Chief Ed Brymer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagpipes and the sound of taps punctuated the ceremony. Two red
roses were placed on a blue and yellow flower bed shaped as a badge
in honor of Barbieri and Dingwall, while police officers in white
gloves retired a flag of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Barbieri along with Dingwall's widow, Kim, and their two
children, were led from the indoor ceremony to the monument to
witness the unveiling of the two names.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker declared the 123 officers heroes. Their
names were read with a drum roll as officers saluted each one.
Officials urged the public to visit the monument, saying the
sacrifices and risks of police officers are often taken for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We forget the dangers they face,'' said Lt. Gov. M. Jodi Rell.
''We take for granted their courage, their strength and their
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   As he looked out at the sea of blue uniforms, Barbieri said any
of the officers could face the fate of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of sobering,'' Barbieri said. ''They put their lives
on the line day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the monument, Barbieri also has the bench his
father sat on in the police station where he died.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I look at that bench,'' he said, ''I think of my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Middletown held its own ceremony to honor Dingwall Wednesday,
naming a street in his memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sgt. Dingwall is in the hearts and souls of everyone of us and
will never be forgotten,'' Brymer said.

<HEADLINE> Disc Sales Hurt by Music Downloads  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The music industry has some fresh ammunition in
its effort to prove that Internet swapping of free music files has
cut into music sales.
</P>
<P>
   A study released Wednesday showed that sales of recorded music
near college campuses declined by 4 percent between the first three
months of 1998 and the same period this year. Sales at all stores
went up 12 percent during the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The findings come as no surprise and confirm our worst
fears,'' said Amy Weiss, spokeswoman for the Recording Industry
Association of America. ''This demonstrates the importance of
protecting artists' rights on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of colleges have banned the use of Napster, the leading
service that allows people to download music files for free from
the Internet, after heavy use clogged their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA and the rock band Metallica have both sued Napster,
alleging the company's software allows computer users to trade
copyrighted music online without permission.
</P>
<P>
   The study was commissioned by Reciprocal Inc., a digital rights
management company, and uses figures from Soundscan, the company
that measures music purchases. It is the most extensive attempt to
try to document whether downloading affects sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's clear that it has had an impact,'' said Michael
Fine, Soundscan's chief executive. He said it's hard to quantify
how much potential revenue music companies may have lost because of
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Napster and Scour.net, another company that
locates audio files on the Web, had no immediate comment on the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors may have cut into music sales near college
campuses, including the growing popularity of devices that make CD
copies, Fine said. The music business has been dominated in the
past two years by Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync,
artists who appeal to a younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Reciprocal found that the sales decline was even steeper --
more than 7 percent -- when it studied outlets within five miles of
the 67 colleges that had banned Napster by late February.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at stores near colleges jumped by 12 percent between 1997
and 1998, before beginning a slide that coincided with the booming
popularity of Napster, Reciprocal said.

<HEADLINE> Camera Can Record Your Insides  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have developed a tiny camera that patients would
swallow to yield a living-color tour of the digestive tract as it
passes painlessly through the body.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors of the camera-in-a-capsule hope it will someday
replace colonoscopies and other uncomfortable diagnostic exams in
which a flexible fiber-optic tube is inserted in the rectum or down
the throat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The capsule transmits images painlessly from areas we've never
been able to see before,'' said British gastroenterologist Dr. Paul
Swain of the Royal London Hospital, who directed the tests. ''With
endoscopy, you have to push wires and cables inside the patients,
and it actually hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan sounds like something out of the sci-fi movie
''Fantastic Voyage,'' the 1966 Oscar winner in which a microscopic
submarine with medical experts is injected into the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers agreed that wireless technology will be the
next leap in medical imaging and diagnostics. But they said the
capsule, at least in its current form, is too limited to replace
endoscopes, as the fiber-optic tubes are called.
</P>
<P>
   It could be several years before the camera wins approval. The
developers plan the first human trials in the United States this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's on the cutting edge. It's fascinating,'' said Col. Peter
McNally, who is at Evans Army Community Hospital at Fort Carson,
Colo., and is medical spokesman for the American College of
Gastroenterology. ''But you don't have the flexibility with this
camera to look around or go back. It's just whipping by.''
</P>
<P>
   The digestive tract is a 30-foot network of organs that follows
a coiled route through the body. Endoscopes can view much of the
system down through the throat and up through the colon.
</P>
<P>
   Endoscopy has become a routine hospital procedure to diagnose
and treat many digestive ailments, including colorectal cancer, the
second-leading cancer killer in the United States with more than
56,000 deaths in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In March, ''Today'' show host Katie Couric invited millions of
viewers to share in her colonoscopy. After she drank a purgative,
doctors snaked a fiber-optic camera into a sedated and woozy
Couric, examining several feet of her large intestine for
pre-cancerous growths.
</P>
<P>
   However, remote portions of the small intestine are difficult to
examine without very long and uncomfortable equipment or
exploratory surgery.
</P>
<P>
   That inspired the capsule's development by Swain and Given
Imaging, an Israeli company.
</P>
<P>
   The initial test results were published today in the journal
Nature. Ten healthy volunteers swallowed the high-tech capsules,
which are slightly larger than an antibiotic and covered with a
non-digestible coating.
</P>
<P>
   One end of the capsule is fitted with a window for a light and a
camera with a fixed, wide-angle lens. Both are powered by a tiny
battery. A transmitter sends digital images to a belt-mounted
receiver worn by the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from not eating before the exam, the patient can follow an
everyday schedule while the digestive tract's natural contractions
sweep the capsule on through within six hours. The capsule is not
retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the doctor downloads the images from the receiver and
views them on a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking for pathologies -- abnormal blood vessels, small
bowel tumors, ulcers, lymphomas, abnormalities of the mucous
lining,'' said Swain, who also swallowed a capsule and viewed his
own digestive tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''The images were pretty good,'' he said. ''The small intestine
is a tube, so it really doesn't matter which way the capsule is
pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were skeptical that the images would be sufficiently
detailed, and raised concerns that the camera's view might be
obscured by bubbly saliva or green bile.
</P>
<P>
   The capsule cannot be stopped or steered to collect close-up
details of the small intestine's millions of interior wrinkles
where ailments often occur.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the capsule fitted with surgical tools like a
conventional endoscope to take biopsies, treat bleeding lesions or
remove polyps.

<HEADLINE> House OKs China Trade Normalization  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of liberalizing trade ties with
China are optimistic for their chances in the Senate after the
hotly contested measure won a difficult vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But, while the bill enjoys wide bipartisan support there, Senate
rules also make it far easier for opponents to slow matters or
create parliamentary havoc.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to be voted on in the Senate next month.
</P>
<P>
   Even as supporters were celebrating Wednesday's 237-197 House
victory, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, asserted: ''I do not intend to allow the
Senate to rubber-stamp the president's plan to reward the Chinese
communists.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms has blocked or delayed key treaties or other foreign
relations matters in the past, and supporters were not taking
Helms' threats idly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delay is dangerous,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a leading
Senate sponsor of the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus estimated that no more than 20 of the Senate's 100
members were likely to oppose the bill once it gets to a floor
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give China the same low-tariff privileges that
the United States routinely accords its other trading partners. For
the past two decades, China has gotten these benefits -- previously
called ''most favored nation'' status -- annually.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would put in force a landmark market-opening pact
negotiated with China in November as part of its entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   That pact would reduce Chinese tariffs, abolish Chinese import
quotas and licenses and allow foreign businesses to invest in
Chinese banking, telecommunications and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike treaties and ambassadorial nominations, Helm's Foreign
Relations Committee does not have primary authority over trade
matters.
</P>
<P>
   That's up to the Senate Finance Committee, and it already has
voted 18-1 in support of the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to review what the House has sent us, but then I
expect us to take our turn at bat,'' said Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., the Finance Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   However, some changes made by the House -- including adding a
watchdog commission to monitor human rights and labor practices in
China -- could give Helms a chance to assert joint jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he didn't ''particularly relish raining on their
parade,'' Helms said in a statement that there would be Senate
votes ''perhaps uncomfortable votes -- on a range of issues relating
to China.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., is a strong supporter of the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote was a big foreign policy victory for Clinton,
congressional Republicans and corporate America -- and a defeat for
organized labor and their Democratic allies in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton welcomed the House vote as a ''historic step toward
continued prosperity in America, reform in China and peace in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would put as much effort into winning Senate approval
as he had in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Senate votes as the House has just done, to extend
permanent normal trade relations with China, it will open new doors
of trade for America and new hope for change in China,'' he said in
the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   China also welcomed the vote, but a spokesman for the Trade
Ministry called the bill's creation of commission to monitor human
rights in China an unacceptable interference with the country's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote was 19 more than the 218 votes needed for House
passage. Voting for the measure were 164 Republicans and 73
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Labor waged one of its most intense campaigns ever against the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton worked the phones throughout the afternoon to nail down
wavering Democrats, supporters said. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
likely GOP presidential nominee, also worked to win over wavering
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has not played a major role in the presidential race,
since it is supported by both Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But labor has threatened to make it an issue in the November
congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress has turned its back on the American manufacturing
base and America's working families,'' Teamsters President James P.
Hoffa said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are Teamster families in every congressional district in
America, and those families vote,'' Hoffa said in a statement.
''Those who would oppose these families have done so at their own
political peril.''
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said Americans ''will not judge
these members well,'' speaking of those who supported the bill.
''And I fear that history will not judge them well either.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Trade Fence-Sitters Pressured  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The final fencesitters on the China trade bill
took calls from the White House and intense lobbying from both
business and organized labor. Even actor Arnold Schwarzenegger
contacted undecided lawmakers to urge them to vote for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end it was often local interests that determined the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an issue of weighing the elements,'' said Rep. James
Maloney, D-Conn., who just hours before the vote to grant permanent
trade status to China decided he couldn't support it.
</P>
<P>
   For his state, he said, ''gains would occur in service
industries and losses in manufacturing, and for Connecticut that's
kind of our weak spot.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I evaluated the effects on employment in my district and it
was not favorable,'' said Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., saying it
finally came down to concerns about job losses in his district's
furniture and sewing factories.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., who is running
for governor of his state, said he decided to support the bill
after talking to companies exporting to China and considering a big
boost in agriculture exports. ''The best thing for Indiana was to
vote yes.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 lawmakers had yet to declare their intentions by
Wednesday morning, leaving in suspense the outcome of the bill. It
passed 237-197.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's calling,'' said Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., who
voted against the bill after careful study of the economic pros and
cons. ''You make more than half the people mad. Some because you
didn't vote their way and some because you didn't come out
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Some acknowledged that their vote might not be welcomed at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time since I've been in Congress that the
way I'm voting is not going to be understood by a lot of my
constituents,'' said Rep. Jim DeMint, a freshman Republican from
South Carolina who voted ''yes.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMint said up to three-fourths of people in his district may
oppose the China bill and ''a lot of my supporters in the textile
industry and the religious community don't understand'' his stance
that the legislation will encourage the opening of China's market
and not result in U.S. job losses.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said that while he had gotten calls from people saying
they would not support him if he voted against the bill, ''I don't
think it's an issue that cuts with voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People
and the Press, agreed that while a Pew poll taken earlier this
month showed about half of Americans opposed to the China trade
deal, feelings toward China don't run deep. ''Public opinion isn't
really in the game here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for many Democrats, a ''yes'' vote risked antagonizing labor
groups, who strongly opposed a bill they said would threaten
American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   For others, the final decision came down to the issue of whether
China deserved normal trade status. ''Free trade alone, without
consideration for human rights, basic labor standards and
environmental protection, will only encourage a race to the
bottom,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., ranking Democrat on the
International Relations Committee. He waited until Wednesday to
announce his ''no'' vote.
</P>
<P>
   To win supporters, President Clinton made personal calls and
business groups assigned a lobbyist to each undecided lawmaker.
Significant money was spent in the effort to win passage, said U.S.
Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue. ''This was done on
retail, one vote at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued a statement individually thanking Rep. Gregory
Meeks, D-N.Y., who voted for the bill after joining an
administration-sponsored trip to China, and attending a state
dinner for the South African president.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, George W. Bush, the likely GOP presidential nominee
who was campaigning Wednesday in Michigan, called Rep. Ernie
Fletcher, R-Ky., to urge him to vote for the bill. He did.

<HEADLINE> Clinton and Lazio disagree where Clinton and Giuliani didn't  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton
were New York's Senate candidates, the National Abortion Rights
Action League of New York refused to make an endorsement in the
race because both the first lady and the mayor were unequivocally
pro-choice.
</P>
<P>
   And NARAL-NY's director, Kelli Conlin, had been careful to
attend events supporting both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But with Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island replacing Giuliani as
the GOP candidate, voters passionate about abortion and a number of
other issues -- gun control, gay rights and the environment --
suddenly have a starker choice.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio -- who in just three days has made the environment a major
campaign theme -- is viewed as an important ally by groups like
Friends of the Earth for his votes against strip-mining and for
cleaning up Long Island Sound. But he does not share Clinton's
unequivocal support for gun licensing, a hate-crimes law that would
increase penalties for gay bias attacks, or Medicaid-funded
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on Rick Lazio's past votes, New Yorkers have to be wary
of his pro-choice proclamations,'' NARAL-NY's deputy director
Robert Jaffe said Wednesday. ''Rick Lazio, time and time again, has
voted to strip away women's right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Wednesday there were clear differences between the
two candidates and said she would raise them repeatedly in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Abortion rights will be an important issue in this race,'' she
said in an interview with The New York Times. The Times reported
today that NARAL's local and national chapters would endorse
Clinton at a news conference this morning.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Clinton asserted that she would not vote to
confirm Supreme Court judges who do not believe that Roe v. Wade,
the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, should be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio opposes late-term abortions (called partial-birth
abortions by critics) and federal funding for abortions for poor
women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not want to criminalize abortion,'' Lazio said in an
upstate campaign swing Monday. ''On the other hand, I want to make
it rarer and I don't think just because we have a right, that we
need to subsidize that right.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion groups like New Yorkers for Constitutional
Freedoms, which represents 2,000 evangelical churches, are cheered
by his position.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before, when there was just Giuliani and Clinton, our people
were having a hard time deciding what to do,'' said the Rev. Duane
Motley, founder of the group. ''But Lazio is a good possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, Lazio is a strong enough proponent to have
earned himself a ''D-minus'' from the National Rifle Association.
He supports the Brady Bill, assault-weapons ban and trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio calls licensing ''invasive'' and says he hasn't seen a
registration program that's ''workable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We had not taken a position on the New York Senate race prior
to this. We probably would have stayed out,'' said Joe Sudbay of
Handgun Control in Washington, which would have been thrilled to
have either Clinton or Giuliani win.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio's opposition to handgun licensing and registration --
which is the law in New York -- is ''troubling,'' Sudbay says. ''We
want people who are going to be with us on all the major issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, one of Lazio's most prominent
Republican supporters, rejects the notion that voters who care
about gun control or abortion will have a problem pulling the lever
for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's nitpicking,'' D'Amato said. ''His overall record is a
solid one. It's a middle-of-the-road, sensible, conservative one.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups are happy to hear Lazio making their
concerns a campaign priority. Clinton held one recent event on acid
rain in the Adirondacks, but has focused most of her campaign on
child welfare, education, health and job growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until now, this has been an absentee issue in this Senate
debate,'' said Deb Callahan, president of the League of
Conservation Voters. ''Rick Lazio has a strong record on
environmental issues and we're pleased to see someone like him in
the race. We consider him to be a good friend. He will absolutely
raise the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The group endorsed Lazio in his Congressional race, but like
other environmental groups, is waiting to interview both candidates
before deciding on a Senate endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, gay rights advocates are disappointed with Lazio. The
Human Rights Campaign, a gay advocacy group in Washington, gave
Lazio a rating of 18 out of 100 last year, down sharply from his 50
percent rating in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While neither Clinton nor Giuliani had a voting record to
compare, both had ''been supportive of some core issues on the
lesbian-gay agenda -- comprehensive civil rights protection,
domestic partnership, recognition of the rights of gays to serve
openly in the military, and support of hate-crimes legislation,''
said Tim Sweeney of the Empire State Pride Agenda. ''That is no
longer the case with the entrance of Rep. Lazio.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''If you can't be an advocate that will persuade the
Republican Party to modernize and update, then what's the rationale
for a gay person to vote for you?''

<HEADLINE> Talk show host to have bodyguard for son's first day at kindergarten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Talk show host Rosie O'Donnell has asked
that a bodyguard be allowed to accompany her son to kindergarten in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell told the Greenwich Time that she and her family need
protection because of threats made against her, arising from her
views favoring gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The bodyguard has applied for a concealed weapon permit, but
O'Donnell said he will not be bringing the gun with him to school.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Lulow, the town's school superintendent, on Wednesday
confirmed that the school's principal recently asked him whether an
armed guard for 4-year-old Parker O'Donnell would be welcome at the
school when he enters kindergarten in September.
</P>
<P>
   Lulow said the issue became moot when it was learned the guard
would not be armed.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, who helped organize the recent Million Mom March on
Washington to push for tougher gun laws, said she can reconcile her
support of gun control with the guard being armed on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't personally own a gun,'' she told The Time. ''But if
you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said she recently moved here from Nyack, N.Y., in part
because she was told it was a safe community. She said she likes
the town, but sometime finds that ''people here have too much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich is known as a haven for the rich and famous. Other
residents include Ron Howard, Mel Gibson, and Kathie Lee and Frank
Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said she hopes to be able to send all three of her
children to public school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come from a working-class background,'' she said. ''That's
always been the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Parker, O'Donnell has a daughter Chelsea, 2, and
a son Blake, 5 months.

<HEADLINE> EPA Aims To Limit Arsenic Water  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency wants to
reduce the limit for arsenic allowed in drinking water to one-tenth
the current standard in an effort to reduce cancer risks.
</P>
<P>
   The agency proposed on Wednesday to reduce the arsenic allowed
in drinking water from 50 parts per billion to 5 parts per billion.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 6,600 water systems nationwide serving at least
22.5 million people would need to upgrade their systems to meet the
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say the new standard could increase household
water costs up to $100 a year for customers largely in the rural
Southwest and pockets of New England where arsenic levels are
highest.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is asking for public comments for 90 days about lowering
the standard. After reviewing the comments, a final rule could be
put in place by early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If a lower standard is set, large water systems serving 10,000
people or more would have three years to make improvements and
smaller systems would have five years. About 95 percent of the
systems failing to meet the proposed standard are small systems.
</P>
<P>
   Water industry representatives, who agree that the current
arsenic standard is too high, are pushing for a standard of 10
parts per billion, which would match the World Health Organization
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reduce arsenic drinking water followed a National
Academy of Sciences report in 1999 that found arsenic in drinking
water causes bladder, lung and skin cancer, and might cause kidney
and liver cancer.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Memorabilia Auctioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A pair of ruby red slippers from ''The Wizard of
Oz'' has a new place to call home.
</P>
<P>
   The size 6B slippers made for Judy Garland -- one of four pairs
known to exist -- sold for $666,000 Wednesday at an auction of
Hollywood movie and TV memorabilia at Christie's East. They were
bought by David Elkouby of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The auction brought in more than $1.66 million, selling 104 of
190 lots, auction house officials said. The sale included several
other ''Wizard of Oz'' items, among them a Cowardly Lion original
paw-style shoe, which sold for $25,850.
</P>
<P>
   All prices included commission.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the block was a 1937 Phantom III Rolls-Royce used in the
1964 James Bond classic ''Goldfinger.'' The car sold for $402,000,
more than double the estimated sale price.
</P>
<P>
   Several items related to Marilyn Monroe were auctioned,
including a certificate of conversion to Judaism, which was signed
by Monroe and her third husband, playwright Arthur Miller. The
certificate sold for $49,350.
</P>
<P>
   A complete Superman costume worn by Christopher Reeve in
''Superman'' and ''Superman II'' sold for $56,400, while Helen
Slater's costume worn in ''Supergirl'' sold for $12,925.
</P>
<P>
   Among the television memorabilia offered for sale was a ''Howdy
Doody'' marionette used in the show's 1970s revival, which went for

<HEADLINE> FBI Boosts Security at Its Offices  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to suggestions from a House panel,
the FBI has boosted security at its headquarters here and other
locations.
</P>
<P>
   The steps were ''based on recommendations received yesterday
from the crime subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. ...
No specific threat gives rise to this announcement,'' the bureau
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Henceforth, at FBI headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, police
and law enforcement officers from outside the FBI will have to
surrender their weapons before entering unless they have been given
permanent building passes. Also, the guard post on the street will
verify visitors' picture identification and which FBI employee they
are visiting, rather than waiting to do that when they reach an
escort desk inside the J. Edgar Hoover Building.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the popular FBI Tour will not be required to have an
appointment with an FBI employee, but they will continue to pass
through a metal detector, have their packages searched and be
escorted inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   The tightened security was prompted by an investigation by the
General Accounting Office, whose investigators, posing as armed law
enforcement officers, carried unsearched briefcases past security
guards at Reagan National Airport and secure government buildings
including the State Department, the FBI and the Pentagon, several
newspapers reported Thursday. The reports appeared in the
Washington Post, the Dallas Morning News, the Washington Times, the
Miami Herald, the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators' findings were shared at a closed-door
briefing on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Posing as plainclothes officers of the FBI, Drug Enforcement
Administration and New York City Police Department and using
counterfeit identification obtained on the Internet, the
investigators were waved around metal detectors when they announced
they were carrying weapons, the Post said. Some investigators
roamed freely through buildings and easily located the office of
each agency's head -- only at the CIA were they unable to reach the
agency head's office.
</P>
<P>
   While they carried no actual weapons, the undercover
investigators were able to drive a rental van into the interior
courtyard of the Justice Department. The investigators made their
way up to Attorney General Janet Reno's office suite, although she
wasn't there, the newspaper said. At Reagan National and Orlando
International airports, the phony officers weren't searched and
received permits to carry weapons aboard airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the FBI's increased security precautions apply to other
bureau locations as well.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said these steps were in addition to others taken over
the past five years to increase security around the Hoover building
in response to terrorist bombings like those at the Oklahoma City
federal building and the World Trade Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau noted that all parking alongside the building has
been eliminated, the courtyard has been closed to the public,
concrete security barriers have been placed outside, and metal
detectors, X-ray machines, package searches and photo
identification requirements have been implemented during that time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for the security of building and of tourists
waiting on line for the tour, FBI police protection outside the
building has been increased. The tour was suspended for a couple
months last summer because of nonspecific threats while the bureau
decided how to protect people waiting outside to take the tour.
Tours resumed after extra police and dogs were posted outside.

<HEADLINE> City continues investigation into collapse  </HEADLINE>
By GINA CAPPELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- City officials would not comment on reports
that a man operating a nightclub on Pier 34 on the Delaware River
was warned that the pier was unstable the day before it collapsed
and killed three women.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a police investigation and we are staying away from
that,'' mayoral Chief of Staff Stephanie Franklin-Suber said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Construction Corp. president Terry Zettle said Tuesday
that his company gave the operator of the nightclub, Heat, a
written report stating that the foundation was slanting toward the
river and there were twisted metal supports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me put it this way, we were amazed that they had people on
that pier after we told them of what we found. We surely didn't
think they were going to have people on that pier,'' Zettle told
WPVI-TV.
</P>
<P>
   The Bridgeport, N.J., company was hired May 15 by club operator
Eli Karetny to look into cracks in the pier's concrete surface,
Zettle said, adding that he sent two divers and a supervisor on May
16 to examine the pier. He said his company reported its findings
to the nightclub management the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were killed and several dozen injured May 18 -- the
day after Zettle said his company gave the report to Karetny -- when
the pier supporting the new nightclub Heat crashed into the
Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   Zettle said a senior officer of his company was questioned by
homicide detectives Monday, but he declined to name the employee. A
copy of Commerce's report to Karetny has been given to homicide
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Police are attempting to determine whether criminal charges are
warranted in the case. They said that a final determination might
not be made for weeks, if not months.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Asbell, owner of the pier, said Wednesday his attorney
advised him not to comment on the report. Asbell's attorney, John
L. Jenkins, did not return phone calls Wednesday. Nightclub owner
Eli Karetny and Karetny's lawyer, Robert Lane, did not immediately
return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Ed McLaughlin, commissioner of the city's Department of Licenses
and Inspections, said during a press conference Wednesday that he
learned that an engineering study was completed in 1992 on Pier 34
before the structure was built.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen that report yet, but we do want to look at what
was done in the survey,'' McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin also said that the underwater surveys were completed
on Pier 34 by Urban Engineers Inc., the company investigating the
collapse for the city. McLaughlin expects to have a better idea of
what caused the pier to collapse by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Divers continue to take photos in the water,'' McLaughlin
said. ''The sonar and the hydrographic surveys have been completed.
Those surveys will tell us how the pier fell.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials also said Wednesday they are continuing to
investigate all the piers in the city as ordered by Mayor John
Street. There are about 180 piers along the city's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin-Suber said Pier 31 North, owned by Penn's Landing
Corp., and leased to the city's Streets and Fleets Department, was
investigated and found to be safe after a city employee noticed
cracks on the pier's surface.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason for alarm or concern,'' Franklin-Suber
said. ''There is no safety risk on this pier.''
</P>
<P>
   But, to ensure the safety of the city's employees who work on
the pier, Franklin-Suber said the city will conduct an underwater
investigation of Pier 31. She could not estimate how much the
survey would cost the city.

<HEADLINE> Tony Awards To Add Category  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Tony Awards next season will add a category
to honor ''special theatrical events,'' Broadway presentations that
don't fit into the existing 21 categories for musicals, plays and
revivals.
</P>
<P>
   The Tony Awards Administration Committee decided on the new
category Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''With many new forms of entertainment being produced on
Broadway, the committee felt the current categories were not
sufficient to address the changes we are seeing in the theater,''
said Roy A. Somlyo, president of the American Theater Wing.
</P>
<P>
   Had the award existed this season, Broadway offerings that might
have been considered in the category include the Irish dance
spectacle ''Riverdance'' or ''Dame Edna: The Royal Tour,'' which is
comedy -- the ''dame'' is Australian actor Barry Humphries in drag --
with audience participation.
</P>
<P>
   The American Theater Wing and League of American Theaters and
Producers present the Tony Awards, which this year will be given
June 4.
</P>
<P>
   PBS and CBS will televise the event from Radio City Music Hall
with host Rosie O'Donnell.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 41 points in the early

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 6; Nasdaq Up 80  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today as
jittery investors once again moved money from one sector to
another. Technology stocks rose, buoying the Nasdaq, but financial
shares stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq
composite index was up 80.86 to 3,351.47.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 6.17 at 10,529.18, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 8.87 at 1,407.92.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were continuing a rebound that began Wednesday
as investors started channeling money into stocks that have tumbled
in the past few weeks. Cisco Systems was up 2] at 57{, and Oracle
rose 3~ to 68[.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts fear the sector's recovery may be fragile, because the
interest rate worries that undermined technology stocks in the
first place are still haunting the market. Most market watchers
anticipate choppy trading for at least another week, with no clear
leadership from any one sector.
</P>
<P>
   Today, bank stocks that have thrived lately were mostly lower.
Citigroup fell 1 1/16 to 60 5/16 after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
cut its rating on the stock to ''outperform'' from ''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The market was little affected by the Commerce Department's
report that the U.S. economy, powered by brisk consumer and
government spending, grew at a robust 5.4 percent annual rate
during the first three months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation-wary investors were most interested in an inflation
gauge tied to the gross domestic product, which rose at an annual
rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter. The market had
anticipated a slightly bigger increase. Surging energy prices
accounted for most of the gain.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 130.66 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.36 to 469.10.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.3 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.9 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
2.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached for $15B in Farm Aid  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many of their crops are just coming out of the
ground, but farmers are already about to reap a harvest -- of
government cash.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional negotiators agreed Wednesday on a $15 billion,
election-year package of farm assistance that would compensate
growers for a third straight year of low commodity prices. The
money also would reduce the cost of buying crop insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was expected to receive final approval in both the
House and Senate. The House began debate on the legislation this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes $5.5 billion in direct payments that would
reach farmers by Sept. 30, in the midst of the congressional
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Some $8.2 billion would go toward reducing premiums on federally
subsidized crop insurance over the next five years, and the
legislation makes a series of changes in the insurance program
designed to get more farmers to buy the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said the aid ''is hugely important''
to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This economic package is a testament that a strong farm
economy is important for all Americans,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar,
an Indiana Republican who is chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Grain prices collapsed in 1998 in the wake of the Asian
financial crisis and have yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has given farmers $15 billion in extra income
assistance over the past two years, and the Agriculture Department
estimates that net farm income this year would drop $7.6 billion,
or 16 percent, without another round of aid.
</P>
<P>
   The latest package will meet ''a significant need out in farm
country'' but ''it hasn't addressed the long-term difficulties
facing American farmer and the long-term problems in the 1996 farm
bill,'' said Andy Solomon, a spokesman for the Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman objects to the way that the direct farm payments would
be distributed, contending the money is not targeted to producers
who need it the most, but he has stopped short of recommending
President Clinton veto the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman says the market-oriented 1996 law does not provide
enough of a safety net for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money for crop insurance could pay for itself by
making farmers less dependent on federal disaster assistance and
other government programs, USDA officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The government splits the cost of crop insurance with farmers.
Under the legislation, the federal share of the premium for the
most popular type of insurance would jump from 40 percent to 59
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would offer coverage for the first time to
livestock producers and expand coverage for fruit and vegetable
growers.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Texas
Republican Larry Combest, said the insurance system will give
farmers ''comprehensive protection to manage risk from low market
values and weather losses.''
</P>
<P>
   The $5.5 billion in direct farm payments would go to grain and
cotton producers who have annual ''market-transition'' contracts
with the government. That cash is in addition to $5.1 billion in
payments that those producers already were scheduled to get this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The extra payments would mean an additional $16,000 this year
for a 500-acre corn farm. A typical wheat grower would get about
$19,000 more. A farmer who grows 300 acres of cotton would receive
an additional $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $1.6 billion in the legislation is earmarked for a
variety of special commodities -- including soybeans, peanuts,
tobacco and various fruits and vegetables -- that are not covered by
the market-transition contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The House-Senate conference committee that crafted the final
version of the legislation attached to it another measure that
would authorize nearly $250 million in research over the next five
years on ways to make ethanol and other chemicals from crops, grass
and trees.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Condemns Attacks in East Timor  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- East Timor's U.N. administrators on
Thursday strongly condemned a series of attacks on the half island
nation's small Muslim community.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N.'s chief representative in the
newly independent territory, said East Timor's 265-member Muslim
community was being forced to ''live in a ghetto'' due to weeks of
stone throwing and intimidation by the Catholic majority.
</P>
<P>
   He said the attacks must be stopped immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reinforced the protection around the Mosque
compound,'' De Mello said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Renewed violence would be a bitter blow for the territory as it
struggles to rebuild after last year's wave of murder and
destruction that erupted following an overwhelming vote to break
away from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Dili's only Muslim place of worship, An-Nur mosque,
several heavily armed U.N. peacekeepers stood guard as an
American-made Humvee armored vehicle cruised around the block
looking for troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm scared to talk about the violence as it will only get
worse,'' said Muslim community leader, Tarikhat Al Mufarridiyyah.
''All day and night the Catholics in the neighborhood throw stones
at us and the mosque.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many East Timorese accuse them of siding with
pro-Jakarta militias, responsible for much of the violence last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Tarikhat criticized East Timor's U.N. administrators, accusing
them of turning their backs on the violence and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.N. is doing very little to help us,'' he said. ''There
are so many bosses and leaders in the U.N. here, but nothing
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   De Mello rejected the criticism, saying the conflict would soon
be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. human rights worker Sidney Jones said the attacks were
motivated more by political differences that religious ones. She
said nearly all of East Timor's Muslims had migrated from other
parts of Indonesia less than 10 years ago and were regarded by many
East Timorese as still being of Indonesian nationality.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's independence leader Jose ''Xanana'' Gusmao urged
his followers to accept the Muslims and allow them to become a part
of East Timorese society.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia May Probe U.S. Mining Co.  </HEADLINE>
By JAMIE TARABAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's government will ask a new
human rights commission to investigate possible abuses by a major
U.S. mining company, a government minister said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The independent commission will likely begin investigating
incidents of rights abuses in June, said Hasballah Saad, the
country's first human rights minister.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper &AMP; Gold Inc. -- long
shrouded in controversy due to perceived links with former
President Suharto -- will be included in the inquiry, Saad said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will ask the independent commission to prepare a formal
report of these abuses, including (actions by) Freeport,'' Saad
said. ''Based on that ... we will send the case to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Indonesia's army ran West Papua province with
an iron hand. Thousands of locals were killed and tortured during a
series of anti-insurgency operations.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists accuse Freeport, which runs the world's
largest copper and gold deposit mine in West Papua, of providing
vehicles and facilities to Indonesian security forces fighting
separatists from the Free Papua Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, company spokesman Bill Collier denied
allegations of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been five investigations of human rights violations
in our area in the past and not one of those determined that any
Freeport employee took part in any human rights violation,''
Collier said. ''As a company we've taken a very strong position in
support of basic human rights and we condemn human rights
violations wherever they occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier said that the company is prepared to cooperate in a new
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Freeport has been active in the region, about 2,500 miles east
of Jakarta, since the 1960s. It has long been dogged by controversy
and allegations of collusion with Suharto, who resigned in May 1998
after 32 years of autocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Saad said it would be impossible to bring to trial all recent
cases of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no real capabilities to follow all these problems of
human rights abuses through the courts,'' he said. ''So many places
in Indonesia have human rights abuses.''

<HEADLINE> 23 Million Kenyans Face Hunger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Kenya's president appealed to the United
States and the European Union for food aid, saying 23 million
Kenyans face hunger due to the lack of seasonal rain, newspapers
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel arap Moi announced the appeal Wednesday in a rally at his
rural home near the farming town of Nakuru, 90 miles northwest of
the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say when he made the request or how the government
reached the population figure, which equals almost 80 percent of
Kenya's 29 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The long rains usually come from March to May, the country's
main planting season. But despite overcast skies, there has been
little rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Program plans to appeal for food for about
2.3 to 2.7 million Kenyans this year, Brenda Barton, an agency
spokeswoman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we are working on figures of the needy people in the
whole of the Horn of Africa before making the appeal,'' Barton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The USAID Famine Early Warning System in Nairobi estimates this
year in Kenya there will be a shortage of 2.2 million bags of
maize, a staple for Kenyans. The government's estimate is 3 million
bags. A bag is 198 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya is suffering from a three-year drought that is threatening
16 million people in the Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia,
Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   The drought has also played havoc with Nairobi's supply of
hydroelectric power and drinking water, both of which will be
rationed.

<HEADLINE> Change Sought In Poor Kids Dental  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Calling it a neglected epidemic, health officials
say California's children suffer twice as much dental disease as
youngsters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to be released today recommends attacking the problem by
increasing use of fluoride in public water supplies, improving
access to dental care, expanding insurance coverage and educating
parents about keeping their kids' teeth healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Many childhood diseases such as measles, mumps and whooping
cough are well-managed or have been nearly wiped out by aggressive
prevention, according to the report by the nonprofit Dental Health
Foundation. Oral diseases, however, remain relatively forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the most common disease in children, and from a public
health point of view what makes it tragic is it's preventable,''
said Dr. Larry Platt, executive director of the Oakland-based
group.
</P>
<P>
   The group timed the report's release to coincide with the first
ever U.S. Surgeon General's report on oral health nationwide, also
due out today.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics presented by the foundation paint a grim picture of
dental health among the state's children:
</P>
<P>
   --Untreated tooth decay was found in 53 percent of children in
grades kindergarten through third, 54 percent of 10th graders and
27 percent of children ages 2 to 5.
</P>
<P>
   --Minority children fared worst, with 40 percent of preschoolers
and 75 percent of elementary-aged children needing dental care.
</P>
<P>
   --More than a quarter of preschool and elementary children and
more than 40 percent of high school students have no dental
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have to accept this as normal,'' said Dr. Jared Fine,
Alameda County's director of public dental health and chairman of a
committee that created the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fluoride to more municipal water supplies is one of the
key recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 state law required fluoridation in public water systems
with at least 10,000 connections. Since then Los Angeles and
Sacramento have been the only large cities to add it, said Dr.
David Nelson of the California Department of Health Services'
office of oral health.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to bring fluoride to the rest is close to $180 million,
he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> First Hurricane of Season in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Tropical Storm Aletta strengthened into the
first hurricane of the season off the Pacific coast of Mexico,
while moving further out to sea today.
</P>
<P>
   Aletta opened the hurricane season in the Pacific with wind
speeds of 99 miles per hour, and gusts as high as 120 miles per
hour in its first hours of life.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is rather unusual to have such a strong tropical cyclone in
the east Pacific during the month of May,'' the U.S. National
Hurricane Center in Miami, Fla., said in a report. Hurricanes
usually form as sea temperatures rise in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane whipped up rainstorms and high waves in the
Pacific Coast states of Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco, according to
Mexico's National Water Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the hurricane was located about 370 miles
southwest of the Pacific coast resort of Manzanillo, and was
traveling west -- out to sea -- at about 8 mph, according to the
hurricane center. It was expected to gradually weaken over the next
several days.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 79; Dow Down 44  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as jittery investors
once again moved money from one sector to another. Technology
stocks rose, buoying the Nasdaq, but financial shares stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was up 78.96 to 3,349.57.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 44.21 at 10,491.14, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 7.87 at 1,406.92.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were continuing a rebound that began Wednesday
as investors started channeling money into stocks that have tumbled
in the past few weeks. Cisco Systems was up 2{ at 57|, and Oracle
rose 4~ to 69[.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a better feel to the tech sector today,'' said Barry
Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New
York. ''Improved volume is an excellent sign, as is Cisco's ability
to hit a bottom and recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts fear the sector's recovery may be fragile,
because the interest rate worries that undermined technology stocks
in the first place are still haunting the market. Most market
watchers anticipate choppy trading for at least another week, with
no clear leadership from any one sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to follow through,'' Hyman said. ''If we don't, a
single up day is meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, bank stocks that have thrived lately were mostly lower.
Citigroup fell 11/16 to 60 11/16 after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
cut its rating on the stock to ''outperform'' from ''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Bank of New York fell 1 to 47.
</P>
<P>
   The market was little affected by the Commerce Department's
report that the U.S. economy, powered by brisk consumer and
government spending, grew at a robust 5.4 percent annual rate
during the first three months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation-wary investors were most interested in an inflation
gauge tied to the gross domestic product, which rose at an annual
rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter. The market had
anticipated a slightly bigger increase. Surging energy prices
accounted for most of the gain.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 307.66 million
shares, slightly behind Wednesday's brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.74 to 469.48.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Bill Heads for Senate  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate supporters of the China trade bill
sought today to build on momentum from a strong House vote to
schedule a quick vote, but they faced expected delaying tactics
from Sen. Jesse Helms and other opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the House voted 237-197 Wednesday for the bill
extending permanent normal trade relations to China, Helms, R-N.C.,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, served notice
that he planned to fight the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on
Helms' committee, said he hopes that opponents will not attempt to
slow down or block the measure but added ''anything's possible in
this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate rules are such that a small group of opponents can slow
legislation dramatically or create parliamentary havoc.
</P>
<P>
   And, unless the China trade bill is completed in June, the
Clinton administration will have to take steps to renew China's
trade status for just one year -- the very annual renewal that the
bill would abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Biden said he still believes the measure will pass and that it
is widely supported in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ''This is not an easy vote for Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders will try to schedule a floor vote on the trade
bill by the second week of June, leadership aides said today.
</P>
<P>
   Even as supporters were celebrating Wednesday's House victory,
Helms asserted: ''I do not intend to allow the Senate to
rubber-stamp the president's plan to reward the Chinese
communists.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms has blocked or delayed key treaties or other foreign
relations matters in the past, and supporters were not taking his
threats idly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delay is dangerous,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a leading
Senate sponsor of the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus estimated that no more than 20 of the Senate's 100
members were likely to oppose the bill once it gets to a floor
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give China the same low-tariff privileges that
the United States routinely accords its other trading partners. For
the past two decades, China has gotten these benefits -- previously
called ''most favored nation'' status -- annually.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would put in force a landmark market-opening pact
negotiated with China in November as part of its entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   That pact would reduce Chinese tariffs, abolish Chinese import
quotas and licenses and allow foreign businesses to invest in
Chinese banking, telecommunications and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike treaties and ambassadorial nominations, Helm's Foreign
Relations Committee does not have primary authority over trade
matters.
</P>
<P>
   That's up to the Senate Finance Committee, and it already has
voted 18-1 in support of the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to review what the House has sent us, but then I
expect us to take our turn at bat,'' said Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., the Finance Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   However, some changes made by the House -- including adding a
watchdog commission to monitor human rights and labor practices in
China -- could give Helms a chance to assert joint jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he didn't ''particularly relish raining on their
parade,'' Helms said in a statement that there would be Senate
votes ''perhaps uncomfortable votes -- on a range of issues relating
to China.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., is a strong supporter of the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote was a big foreign policy victory for Clinton,
congressional Republicans and corporate America -- and a defeat for
organized labor and their Democratic allies in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton welcomed the House vote as a ''historic step toward
continued prosperity in America, reform in China and peace in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would put as much effort into winning Senate approval
as he had in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Senate votes as the House has just done, to extend
permanent normal trade relations with China, it will open new doors
of trade for America and new hope for change in China,'' he said in
the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   China also welcomed the vote, but a spokesman for the Trade
Ministry called the bill's creation of commission to monitor human
rights in China an unacceptable interference with the country's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote was 19 more than the 218 votes needed for House
passage. Voting for the measure were 164 Republicans and 73
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Labor waged one of its most intense campaigns ever against the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton worked the phones throughout the afternoon to nail down
wavering Democrats, supporters said. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
likely GOP presidential nominee, also worked to win over wavering
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has not played a major role in the presidential race,
since it is supported by both Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But labor has threatened to make it an issue in the November
congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress has turned its back on the American manufacturing
base and America's working families,'' Teamsters President James P.
Hoffa said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are Teamster families in every congressional district in
America, and those families vote,'' Hoffa said in a statement.
''Those who would oppose these families have done so at their own
political peril.''
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said Americans ''will not judge
these members well,'' speaking of those who supported the bill.
''And I fear that history will not judge them well either.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> CNN Celebrates 20th Birthday  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thinking back on CNN's 20 years, we might recall
its live video of President Reagan walking into a hospital after
surviving a would-be assassin's assault; its shocking pictures of
the Challenger explosion; its scenes of the Berlin Wall coming
down; its hours devoted to the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Or we can leave such reminiscences to CNN, which will pat its
own back in a pair of anniversary specials. Next Thursday and
Friday (June 1 and 2) from 9 to 11 p.m. Eastern, the network will
present a sort of ''Greatest Hits -- 1980-2000,'' with Larry King as
host.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. With more than 175,000 hours under its belt (and that's
just counting the original cable network; by now there are six
bearing the CNN name), the Atlanta-based Cable News Network has
amassed a record worth crowing about since Ted Turner flicked the
switch at 6 p.m. on June 1, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's big, crazy dream came true. And then some.
</P>
<P>
   ''CNN has provided the world with news and information whenever
and wherever it occurs,'' says Tom Johnson, chairman of the CNN
News Group. ''And at a time that viewers and listeners wished to
get it, rather than when producers decided that it should be made
available.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that incontestable fact, what has CNN meant to the
information age it fostered? How, in a larger sense, has it
transformed television? Our lives? Us?
</P>
<P>
   Think back to 1980. There were three broadcast networks and PBS.
Nationally available cable channels were few. And on basic cable,
original programming, other than live sportscasts, was almost
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, TV news came to us in isolated helpings. We could
catch the headlines at dinner time with ''Uncle Walter'' Cronkite.
If that half-hour didn't satisfy us, we could skip Johnny Carson at
bedtime for a brand-new ABC program called ''Nightline.'' And back
in May 1980, there was a total of three weekly magazine shows: CBS'
''60 Minutes,'' ABC's ''20/20'' and, for a couple more months,
NBC's shortlived ''Prime Time Saturday'' with Tom Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   This didn't seem sufficient to Turner, a young Atlanta media
magnate and emerging Southern folk hero.
</P>
<P>
   Already he was enjoying success after turning his ragtag Channel
17 (with its ''Andy Griffith Show'' reruns and Atlanta Braves
games) into a national ''super station'' by beaming it from sea to
shining sea by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Now he meant to shower news on Americans by satellite around the
clock, and with his typical messianic bombast, he declared, ''We
won't sign off until the end of the world -- and we'll cover that
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Turner makes good on that pledge remains to be seen. But
20 years ago, everyone (or, at least, the 1.7 million viewers it
originally reached) could see that CNN had, against all odds,
signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, CNN was viewed with skepticism and bemusement as it flew
by the seat of its pants.
</P>
<P>
   How could this bargain-basement venture (originating from the
basement of a social organization's converted clubhouse) find
enough viewers, money or even news to keep going?
</P>
<P>
   Radically different from the broadcast networks' neatly
distilled newscasts, the nonstop CNN ''was widely castigated for
its lack of editing and lack of story selection,'' recalls Porter
Bibb, a media specialist for Technology Partners and author of a
book on Turner.
</P>
<P>
   But what CNN was doing, Bibb says, was nothing less than
reinventing TV news. ''It changed the definition of news from what
has happened to what is happening. CNN took the news out of the
newsroom and put the viewer in the middle of the event.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tom Johnson looks back at CNN's first 20 years (and his own
first decade running it), he can chart its penetration through the
United States, then, increasingly, the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''And now we're into the era of the World Wide Web and new
on-demand services,'' he says. ''We will be able to provide you
with live, real-time information in your home, in your office, in
your car; on your beeper and on your cell phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping drive these innovations is the imminent merger of
Internet provider America Online with Time Warner, CNN's owner
since it gobbled up Turner Broadcasting System in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly Ted Turner's baby anymore, the super-charged CNN
today competes in a TV universe that includes MSNBC, CNBC and Fox
News Channel -- all-news rivals that it made possible.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, CNN paved the way for channels as different
as the Weather Channel is from MTV. CNN gave us a new relationship
with our TV, transforming it from our living-room program dispenser
to a multi-channel window; a nonstop sensation device; an
intravenous media drip.
</P>
<P>
   And -- go figure! -- it fulfilled these musings of Marshall
McLuhan:
</P>
<P>
   '''Time' has ceased, 'space' has vanished,'' the famed
philosopher wrote in his book ''The Medium is the Message'' 13
years before CNN signed on. ''Instant communication insures that
all factors of the environment and of experience co-exist in a
state of active interplay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now live in a global village.''
</P>
<P>

   Elsewhere in television ...

   CELL OUT?: A number of leading scientists, including the
industry's former top research director, tell ABC's ''20/20'' that
cell phones can no longer be presumed safe. In addition, ''20/20''

levels of microwave radiation levels they emitted. ABC News

<HEADLINE> Polish Government in Crisis  </HEADLINE>
By BEATA PASEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- The embattled Solidarity bloc withdrew
support for Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek on Thursday to try to keep
the ruling coalition intact.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in the 2{-year Solidarity-led coalition was set off
Monday night when the tiny Freedom Union party threatened to leave
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom Union leaders, led by Finance Minister Leszek
Balcerowicz, say they lost confidence in the prime minister, who is
unable to control his deputies in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Union party's executive council must decide Sunday
whether to formally leave the government.
</P>
<P>
   But Solidarity leaders, fearing a government collapse could
return the ex-Communist Democratic Left Alliance to power, agreed
to negotiate with the Freedom Union and sacrifice every minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Solidarity board has agreed to negotiate with the Freedom
Union replacing the whole government,'' Solidarity leader Jan
Rokita told national radio Plus.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his tenuous position, Buzek continued his duties,
meeting with his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
   Buzek repeated to reporters he will resign ''if there is such a
need. It's important that this coalition lasts because it has done
lots of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The splintered Solidarity bloc formed the coalition government
with the business-oriented Freedom Union in 1997 to prepare Poland
for European Union membership, a task Solidarity alleges was
neglected by the previous post-communist government.
</P>
<P>
   Buzek, however, was unable to unify Solidarity deputies who
voted several times against government-backed reforms deemed
crucial for Poland's economic progress by Balcerowicz, the finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Balcerowicz has demanded concrete actions from Solidarity, such
as eliminating laws that hamper state finance and resolving the
crisis in Warsaw's local government.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published in Thursday's daily Rzeczpospolita said if
early elections were held, the post-communist opposition would get
more than 30 percent support to 15 percent for Solidarity. The poll
of 610 respondents has a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percent.

<HEADLINE> Russian Planes Bomb Chechen Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian planes bombed Chechen rebel
positions near a key mountain village Thursday, while militants
shelled Russian checkpoints in the capital, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces were trying to dislodge rebels who control part
of the road between the village of Zhani-Vedeno and the regional
administrative center Vedeno in the southern mountains, according
to military officials.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces, having taken lowland Chechnya, are chasing
guerrilla bands in the forests and ravines of the rugged southern
part of the rebellious region. Warplanes flew 20 combat missions
over the past 24 hours, the military said Thursday, mostly in the
south.
</P>
<P>
   Planes also bombed targets in the Nozhai-Yurt region, near the
border with Dagestan, where rebels have sometimes taken refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Russia claims to have crushed organized resistance, but rebel
attacks persist. Two Russian checkpoints were shelled overnight in
Grozny, the republic's capital, which Russian forces took about
four months ago, and several servicemen were wounded, military
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Official Russian losses have reached 2,304 killed and 6,728
wounded since fighting in the North Caucasus region of Russia began
in August, Gen. Valery Manilov, first deputy head of the general
staff, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, 10 servicemen have been killed and 83
wounded, Manilov said. Casualties continue even as the intensity of
fighting dwindles from the massive assaults of fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   Independent observers estimate that casualty figures are higher
than those given by officials. Both the Russian military and the
rebels tend to exaggerate the other side's losses while playing
down their own.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops, driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war, clashed
with Chechnya-based Islamic militants who invaded the neighboring
Russian region of Dagestan in August. Russian forces entered
Chechnya in September in the wake of those attacks, and after 300
people were killed in apartment bombings the government blamed on
Chechens.

'Religion capital' blessed with tourists
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- As the headquarters of some 80
religious organizations, Colorado Springs is attracting an
increasing numbers of visitors who spend millions of dollars to
attend spiritual conferences and seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's growing like wildfire,'' said Kathy Reak, national sales
manager for the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''It's a
market we are really going after because of the number of
headquarters ... here.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, religious visitors outnumbered corporate visitors,
accounting for about 30 percent of hotel nights booked by the
bureau compared with 21 percent by corporations.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Reak predicts religious visitors will account for 53
percent of hotel rooms booked by the bureau and will spend $173
million overall.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for religious visitors is strong because the city
usually has more rooms than visitors. Hotel occupancy averaged 65
percent of the 12,500 room nights last year, so many hotel managers
offer discounts to religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Springs is sometimes called ''the Vatican of
evangelical Christianity.'' Focus on the Family, a broadcast
ministry headed by James Dobson, is the largest religious group to
call the city home.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, those attending Focus on the Family conferences and
seminars accounted for about 3,000 room rentals, Paul Hetrick, a
ministry spokesman said. In addition, he said some 225,000 other
tourists visit the ministry each year.
</P>
<P>
   Other locally based religious groups range from Rock the Nations
ministry, expecting up to 3,000 visitors for a July meeting, to the
International Center for Biblical Counseling, which offers
Bible-based counseling to about 100 couples each year.

Divorce not a factor for Baptist pastor
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Rev. Charles Stanley will remain senior
pastor at First Baptist Church of Atlanta despite a divorce from
his wife of 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, 67, is former president of the Southern Baptist
Convention, and his ''In Touch'' television ministry is broadcast
worldwide. After he told the congregation of his divorce, the
church's administrative pastor announced that Stanley would
continue in the post he has had since 1972. The congregation stood
and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanleys' estrangement had caused strife in the church
because of a traditional but unwritten policy that no divorced men
could serve as deacons or ministers at First Baptist. Stanley had
said at a 1995 congregational meeting, ''If my wife divorces me, I
would resign immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Stanley filed for divorce on Feb. 16 on grounds that the
marriage was irretrievably broken. It was finalized May 11.

Pope honors Italian patron of the impossible
</P>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II joined tens of thousands
of faithful in paying tribute to St. Rita, the 14th century Italian
saint many believers pray to for a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50,000 people, many carrying red roses, gathered in St.
Peter's Square as the remains of the saint were borne into St.
Peter's Basilica for a Mass.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass said by the Vatican's secretary of state,
Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the pope greeted the faithful in the square
and praised the mother who became a nun after she was widowed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see the slender body of a woman small in stature but large
in holiness, who lived humbly and now is known in the entire world
for her heroic Christian existence as wife, mother, widow and
nun,'' John Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope added that in the winter before Rita's death, a red
rose bloomed in a garden in Roccaporena, her hometown in the Umbria
region.
</P>
<P>
   The remains, encased in glass, had been flown by police
helicopter for two days of public viewing before they were returned
to Umbria.

Reactions vary to image on church wall
</P>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- When an outer wall at Palma Sola
Presbyterian Church is wet, a 15-foot, Christ-like image
mysteriously appears.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials believe it's miraculous and regularly spray the
wall with a garden hose to accommodate the curious and believers
who come to gaze. When the wall dries, the image disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Others are calling the water police to complain. Much of
Florida's central Gulf Coast is under water use restrictions
because of a drought. But county officials say they find no
regulations governing water use at religious sites.
</P>
<P>
   The image resembles a traditional portrait of Jesus -- with
beard, long hair and a halo.
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterians say that such occurrences are more common with
Catholic churches.

Woman sentenced in church fund theft
</P>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A woman who admitted stealing hundreds of
thousands of dollars from the Roman Catholic Church has been
sentenced to 3{ years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Sampson, 48, of Saco, pleaded guilty in March to the
thefts and was sentenced May 19. She was accused of writing about
200 checks to herself between 1992 and last June. At the time she
was an employee of an insurance agency that managed a health-care
fund for active and retired priests.
</P>
<P>
   At her sentencing in Superior Court, Sampson also was ordered to
make partial restitution.

Effort at world record fails
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An attempt to set a Guinness world record for
the largest group to say the rosary fell far short in what is
possibly the largest Catholic city in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10,000 worshippers showed up on the plaza at the Basilica
de Guadalupe; 100,000 are required for the Guinness Book of World
Records, according to the government agency Notimex.
</P>

   The attempt, organized by the Rev. Pedro Sanchez Acosta,
apparently was thwarted by rain.

Pakistani government helps fund religious schools
</P>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- The army-led government has rejected
criticism that religious schools, or madrassas, foster terrorism
and announced an annual grant worth $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand religious schools operate in Pakistan, many of
them supplying education to the poorest children.
</P>
<P>
   The military's religious affairs ministry said no religious
schools in Pakistan have been involved in terrorism, despite
charges to the contrary by international and Pakistani human rights
groups and former cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools have been accused of inspiring young men to fight
in holy wars in the Kashmir region and elsewhere. One of the
largest schools in northwest Pakistan suspended classes to allow
students to fight with the ruling Taliban in neighboring
Afghanistan. Many Taliban leaders graduated from Pakistani
religious schools.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Helga Newmark was 11 when she first heard the
23rd Psalm at the Theresienstadt concentration camp in
Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. Each evening as she lay on her bunk,
she listened to a woman's voice from the bed below.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil; for thou art with me. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Then she added, ''Go to sleep, my beloved child.''
</P>
<P>
   The psalm brought her comfort then, Helga Newmark, now 67,
recalls. But by the time she was liberated she had no use for a God
that could allow a Holocaust, and no use for being a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Now, half a century later, at an age when others retire, Newmark
has become the first woman Holocaust survivor to be ordained a
rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   Soft-spoken and elegant in the blue denim dress of a matron
turned student, she tells how she reached this point by a long and
indirect route.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors can recall the details of 1940s European Jewish
life, she says. ''I remember bits and pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers, for example, that she didn't like to play with
Anne Frank when they were growing up in Amsterdam. ''She was very
bossy.'' And she didn't think much about being Jewish until her
mother told her she'd have to wear a yellow star.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some kids couldn't play with me anymore because I wore the
star,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Soon her family was told to board a freight train for
Westerbork, a holding camp in Holland. There her father was put on
another train, presumably headed for a labor camp. Later, when
Newmark's mother was told she could sign up for a transport to join
her husband, she doubted officials and refused, infuriating her
young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's wrong with you?'' Newmark recalls saying. ''I'm going
to go myself.'' It would be years before she learned that her
father had already been killed at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   She would live in three camps, separated from her mother for
long stretches, making friends she couldn't keep. She lost her
friend Beatte, a pregnant woman, when guards forced her to have an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved her and she disappeared. Then she came back and was
never the same, and she died.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Newmark was 11, a guard raped her. ''I didn't even
know what was happening to me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many traumas she and her mother would not discuss
after they were liberated from Theresienstadt in 1945 and moved to
Amsterdam and then New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''I needed to talk about it, but my mother didn't want to hear
or ever talk about it again,'' says Newmark.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't go to temple in New York or observe the Jewish
holidays. ''My mother said, 'There is no God, and I don't
particularly want to be a Jew.' I said it, too. What good was being
a Jew? I was in a camp for being a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   At 17, Newmark married another survivor, but they tried to put
the experience behind them. Not until she had children did she
begin having flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   One of them came when she was stopped at a railroad crossing and
saw a freight train. ''It scared the living daylights out of me. I
was in the train smelling the smells and screaming. That's when I
went into therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't talk about the ''whys'' in therapy. ''I could not
face those questions. They were too painful.'' But she began to
wonder what she would say to her three children if they asked
whether there was a God and if they had a religion.
</P>
<P>
   After exploring Buddhism and Catholicism, Newmark decided to try
her own religion, joining a small synagogue in Ridgefield Park,
N.J. Gradually, she became more interested in the Jewish rituals
and she began to enjoy the communal prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something very magnificent and awesome about sometimes
listening to a community, a congregation pray,'' she says. ''The
sound of it, as corny as it sounds, nourishes my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   In time she began saying her own prayers. ''I pray under the
shower and thank God for letting me be able to get into the shower
and feel clean and move around.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would be years before she would approach the question:
Where was God in the camps?
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, after the death of her grandchild, ''the question of
why surfaced all over again,'' forcing her to confront the issues
she'd avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't suddenly discover the meaning of suffering,'' she
says, though the child's death forced her to accept that some
tragedies were beyond her control.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she came to believe that the God she thought
was absent in the camps is always present, but that people have the
free will to inflict suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are responsible for what is happening in our world,'' she
says. ''God is not in control of whether a bomb drops on
Hiroshima.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not agree with Anne Frank's famous statement that all
people are ''really good at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is good and evil in all of us,'' Newmark says. ''If we
can accept that then we can accept it in ourselves and then we can
accept it in others and take the necessary precautions against
evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Newmark continued to find sustenance in Judaism, and the
knowledge that she ''came from a people that had survived for
centuries.'' She began teaching Sunday School at the synagogue and
later accepted a job as principal of a religious school.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to continue her education, she applied to rabbinical
school but was rejected. Instead, she studied for a master's degree
in social work from Yeshiva University.
</P>
<P>
   At age 58, she reapplied to the Hebrew Union College-Jewish
Institute of Religion in New York. This time she was accepted by
the Reform movement college and ''entered the world of the
Talmud.''
</P>
<P>
   She was ordained on May 21 to two standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   For her thesis topic, she chose, ''Hope and Destruction in
Selected Psalms,'' recalling how the 23rd Psalm had soothed her in
Theresienstadt. For thousands of years, she says, ''the psalms have
shown people crying out to God.''
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to become a congregational rabbi and that her
experience as a survivor will help her reach people recovering from
the kind of trauma it took her years to speak about.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a long time I lived in a narrow room and I didn't know how
to get out,'' she says. ''A number of people also live in rooms and
prisons. And I think I can encourage them to look out a window.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many times people say to me, 'This is nothing compared to what
you went through.' I disagree.'' To single out the suffering of
survivors of war and genocide, she says, isolates them.
''Everyone's suffering is very personal and there are many
similarities,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She rarely mentions her own experience when talking to
congregants in crisis. A shared pain, she says, can be communicated
without words.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be sufficient to get up from my chair and simply hold
the person,'' she says. ''Sometimes that's all that's needed to let
a person know they're not alone and it's possible to survive.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs $15 Billion in Farm Aid  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House today approved a $15 billion package
of election-year farm assistance to compensate growers for a third
straight year of low commodity prices and to make it much cheaper
for growers to buy crop insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The package, which was approved Wednesday by a House-Senate
conference committee, includes $5.5 billion in direct payments that
would reach farmers by Sept. 30, in the midst of the congressional
campaigns. The Senate was expected to give final approval to the
legislation later today and send it to President Clinton for his
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Some $8.2 billion would go toward reducing premiums on federally
subsidized crop insurance over the next five years, and the
legislation makes a series of changes in the insurance program
designed to get more farmers to buy the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the economy as a whole has been booming, farmers have
faced low prices for nearly three long years,'' Rep. Bill Barrett,
R-Neb., said before the House approved the measure on a voice vote.
''Agriculture is vital to every American and every congressional
district.''
</P>
<P>
   Grain prices collapsed in 1998 in the wake of the Asian
financial crisis and have yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has given farmers $15 billion in extra income
assistance over the past two years, and the Agriculture Department
estimates that net farm income this year would drop $7.6 billion,
or 16 percent, without another round of aid.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman praised the insurance
overhaul, saying it would ''improve our farmers' ability to manage
the risk that is inescapable in their line of work.'' But he
criticized Congress for refusing to alter the 1996 farm law, which
was designed to wean farmers from government support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stopgap, quick-fix emergency assistance is not the most
effective or efficient way to help struggling farmers,'' Glickman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman also objects to the way that the direct farm payments
would be distributed, contending the money is not targeted to
producers who need it the most, but he has stopped short of
recommending that Clinton veto the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money for crop insurance could pay for itself by
making farmers less dependent on federal disaster assistance and
other government programs, USDA officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The government splits the cost of crop insurance with farmers.
Under the legislation, the federal share of the premium for the
most popular type of insurance would jump from 40 percent to 59
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would offer coverage for the first time to
livestock producers and expand coverage for fruit and vegetable
growers.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Texas
Republican Larry Combest, said the insurance system will give
farmers ''comprehensive protection to manage risk from low market
values and weather losses.''
</P>
<P>
   The $5.5 billion in direct farm payments would go to grain and
cotton producers who have annual ''market-transition'' contracts
with the government. That cash is in addition to $5.1 billion in
payments that those producers already were scheduled to get this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The extra payments would mean an additional $16,000 this year
for a 500-acre corn farm. A typical wheat grower would get about
$19,000 more. A farmer who grows 300 acres of cotton would receive
an additional $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $1.6 billion in the legislation is earmarked for a
variety of special commodities -- including soybeans, peanuts,
tobacco and various fruits and vegetables -- that are not covered by
the market-transition contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The House-Senate conference committee that crafted the final
version of the legislation attached to it another measure that
would authorize nearly $250 million in research over the next five
years on ways to make ethanol and other chemicals from crops, grass
and trees.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 56; Dow Down 50  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as jittery investors
once again moved money from one sector to another. Technology
stocks rose, buoying the Nasdaq, but financial shares stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
up 55.63 to 3,326.24.
</P>
<P>
   Other stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 49.69 at 10,485.66, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 2.61 at 1,401.66.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks continued a rebound that began Wednesday as
investors started channeling money into stocks that have tumbled in
the past few weeks. Cisco Systems was up 1} at 56~, and Oracle rose
5 to 69\.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a better feel to the tech sector today,'' said Barry
Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New
York. ''Improved volume is an excellent sign, as is Cisco's ability
to hit a bottom and recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were also heartened by the Nasdaq's ability to bounce
back even without Microsoft. Its shares fell 2~ to 62 11/16 a day
after a federal judge ordered the Justice Department to revise its
plan to break up the world's leading computer software maker and
submit the new version by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The order renewed expectations that Microsoft will be split into
two, or even three, parts. Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund told
clients a broken-up Microsoft would undoubtedly would be worth less
than a whole one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts fear the sector's recovery may be fragile,
because the interest rate worries that undermined technology stocks
in the first place are still haunting the market. Most market
watchers anticipate choppy trading for at least another week, with
no clear leadership from any one sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to follow through,'' Hyman said. ''If we don't, a
single up day is meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, bank stocks that have thrived lately were mostly lower.
Citigroup fell 1 7/16 to 59 15/16 after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
cut its rating on the stock to ''outperform'' from ''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Bank of New York fell 1[ to 46~.
</P>
<P>
   The market was little affected by the Commerce Department's
report that the U.S. economy, powered by brisk consumer and
government spending, grew at a robust 5.4 percent annual rate
during the first three months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation-wary investors were most interested in an inflation
gauge tied to the gross domestic product, which rose at an annual
rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter. The market had
anticipated a slightly bigger increase. Surging energy prices
accounted for most of the gain.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 431.57 million
shares, slightly behind Wednesday's brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.16 to 467.90.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Elections May Be Put Off  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez said today that
elections later this week in Venezuela will probably be postponed
because of technical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans are set to elect a president, legislature,
governors, and other positions in balloting Sunday. However,
election officials have been unable to fix the computers used for
vote tabulation.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the delay, Chavez said: ''I hope this doesn't
happen but it is probable that it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez cannot postpone the vote. However, the Supreme Court was
expected to rule today on whether to move back the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Election authorities said Wednesday they expected to correct the
problems and begin testing the computer system. But international
observers said today that glitches remained.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this hour I do not believe the conditions are appropriate
to hold elections,'' Patricio Lombardi, a spokesman for the
Organization of American States mission in Venezuela, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a Venezuelan air force jet flew from the United
States to Caracas with equipment authorities said could salvage
this weekend's vote.
</P>
<P>
   The elections are required by a new constitution pushed through
by President Hugo Chavez last year that calls for many public
positions to be ''re-legitimized.''
</P>
<P>
   The electoral process has also come under fire because the
electoral council was hand-picked by Chavez's leftist coalition in
an exercise widely criticized as undemocratic.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tackles Prescription Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed Thursday for
Republicans in Congress to build on the momentum of the China trade
vote and take up his proposal for prescription drug coverage under
Medicare. ''I'm here asking for cooperation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gathered Democratic congressional leaders in the White
House Rose Garden for ''a show of unity and a demonstration of
resolve'' on the prescription drug plan. The president rejected as
unfair a GOP alternative that limits the benefit according to
income, but held open the prospect of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some people in their party who really would like to
work with us,'' Clinton said. ''Look, for the last five years, we
surprised everybody -- including ourselves -- a time or two and
really had breakthroughs and (have) gotten stuff done.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here asking for cooperation, and I think I speak for our
leaders and our members,'' Clinton continued. ''We're interested in
doing something, so we're willing to do what we can to do our part
on that.''
</P>
<P>
   His appeal came a day after the House -- thanks to strong
Republican support -- approved a major trade deal with China that he
has made a top priority of his final year in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined in the Rose Garden by his secretaries of
treasury and health and human services, House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and
about a dozen other Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason that Congress cannot take the necessary
steps,'' Clinton said. ''We know we can afford it and we think the
time to act is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been pressing Congress to add drug coverage to
Medicare that any senior citizen could get for about $25 a month.
An alternative being developed by House Republicans would help
senior citizens get private drug insurance and provide subsidies
for those with the lowest incomes and highest bills.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed legislation extending prescription drug
benefits to 1.4 million Medicare-eligible retirees and family
members. The Democrats said that proposal was good but
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said the prescription drug proposal is ''stuck in the
quagmire of Republican resistance.'' He described Democrats as
frustrated over the lack of progress on their health proposals with
only 23 legislative days remaining before this summer's political
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their prescription drug plan is neither responsible nor
real,'' Gephardt said. ''They continue to advocate massive tax cuts
(that would) plunge us back into deficit spending. Their approach
simply won't help the millions of seniors who need help.''

<HEADLINE> Phony Cops Breach Federal Security  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators carrying fake law
enforcement credentials penetrated the security of 19 government
installations and two commercial airports, a congressional audit
reported today. In many cases they were waved by metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were able to enter 18 of the 21 sites on the first attempt.
The remaining three required a second visit before we were able to
penetrate the sites,'' said the report from the General Accounting
Office.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators penetrated security at Reagan National Airport
outside Washington, at the Orlando, Fla., international airport and
at government offices including the FBI, CIA, State Department,
Justice Department and Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, prepared the report
for the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee had asked that the GAO to investigate the
potential security risk posed by the use of stolen or counterfeit
law enforcement badges and credentials. Lawmakers had expressed
concern that such badges and credentials are readily available on
the Internet and from other public sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''At no time during the undercover visits were our agents' bogus
credentials or badges challenged by anyone,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report brought an immediate reaction from Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., who chairs the House Judiciary Committee. ''I hope this
startling report will focus new attention on enhancing our security
of the public buildings housing our governmental agencies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At all 21 sites, the agents who took part in the operation
''could have carried weapons. listening devices, explosives,
chemical/biological agents, devices and/or other such
items/materials,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   At each site, the agents declared themselves as armed law
enforcement officers and gained entry by avoiding screening, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate result of the investigation was a tightening of
security at FBI headquarters, the Justice Department and at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was surprised that there were so many'' places they could
get into, Attorney General Janet Reno told her weekly news
conference. But she added, ''Anytime you expose vulnerabilities,
it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said 16 of the sites housed the offices of cabinet
secretaries or agency heads. At 15, ''our undercover agents were
able to stand immediately outside the suites of the Cabinet
secretary or agency head,'' GAO said, adding that in five
instances, the agents were able to gain entry into the suites.
</P>
<P>
   ''At 15 of the sites, our agents entered a restroom in the
vicinity of these offices and could have left a valise containing
weapons,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Justice security had been revised but declined to
describe the changes. She said Justice officials were looking at
the availability of false credentials on the Internet to see how
the investigators were able to get credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators were sent out at the request of Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., who has introduced legislation to increase the
penalty for using fake law enforcement credentials.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Justice official, who requested anonymity, said GAO
investigators using fake New York City police sergeants'
credentials tried twice to get into the main Justice building and
were turned away once when no appointment for them could be
verified.
</P>
<P>
   But they came back to the automobile gate with a van, showed the
fake New York credentials and said they were armed and were waived
inside and allowed to park in the courtyard, this official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always want to treat other law enforcement officers with
absolute courtesy,'' this official said, ''but this was a wake-up
call that we have a problem with professional courtesy for other
law enforcement personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Henceforth, state and local officers will be required to check
their guns before entering Justice and go through metal detectors
and have their bags X-rayed. If they are coming to make an arrest,
they will be able to keep their guns but will be escorted, this
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said Wednesday its new security steps were ''based on
recommendations received yesterday from the crime subcommittee of
the House Judiciary Committee. ... No specific threat gives rise to
this announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Henceforth, at FBI headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, police
and law enforcement officers from outside the FBI will have to
surrender their weapons before entering unless they have been given
permanent building passes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the guard post on the street will verify visitors' picture
identification and which FBI employee they are visiting, rather
than waiting to do that when they reach an escort desk inside the
J. Edgar Hoover Building.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the popular FBI Tour will not be required to have an
appointment with an FBI employee, but they will continue to pass
through a metal detector, have their packages searched and be
escorted inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood said today the Pentagon
has long followed a practice of allowing federal law enforcement
officers -- but not state or local officers -- to enter the building
without question simply by showing their badges. This policy is now
under review as a result of the GAO investigation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Kill AP, Reuters Journalists  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- A cameraman for Associated Press
Television News and a Reuters correspondent, both renowned for
covering the world's most dangerous conflicts, and four Sierra
Leone soldiers were killed when suspected rebels ambushed their
vehicles, U.N. officials and local reporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Spaniard Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora, 32, of APTN and Washington
native Kurt Schork, 53, of Reuters, died Wednesday after they were
hit near Rogberi Junction, an area hotly contested in recent days
by pro-government forces and rebels of the Revolutionary United
Front, journalists said.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Reuters journalists, South African cameraman Mark
Chisholm and Greek photographer Yannis Behrakis, suffered slight
injuries in the same attack.
</P>
<P>
   Escorted by at least 10 pro-government soldiers, Gil Moreno de
Mora and Schork were traveling in two vehicles when the group was
ambushed about 50 miles east of the capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   In his account of the ambush carried by Reuters, Behrakis
described a chaotic series of events, seeing Schork hit by gunfire
and Gil Moreno de Mora's car attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of shooting and for a second I saw Miguel's
car behind getting hit,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Behrakis said he scrambled out the window of his moving car.
With bullets flying between rebels and soldiers, Behrakis ran to a
stretch of thick bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one point, the rebels walked 15 feet away but didn't see
me,'' he said, adding he waited there for three hours before
fleeing on foot back to Rogberi Junction.
</P>
<P>
   Behrakis, other journalists on the scene and a U.N. official
said four soldiers were killed at the scene as well.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora's mother, Maria de Patrocinio Macian Blaya
said from her home in Barcelona, Spain that her son was a ''truly
extraordinary person.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am filled with overwhelming sadness and grief, but in the
end I find solace in the fact that Miguel was doing the job he
loved and died doing the work he felt ordained for,'' she said.
''He felt his mission was to give voice to those who did not have
one.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton today offered condolences to
the families of the slain journalists. Clinton and Schork were both
Rhodes scholars and studied together in England.
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all, I knew that journalist over 30 years ago. We
were at Oxford together. And I am very sad today. He was a good man
and if you look at all the many posts that he occupied he was a
brave man,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the United States would support U.N. peace efforts
by helping deploy additional Nigerian troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aggressively committed to providing the support
necessary to take the Nigerians and other troops into Sierra Leone
and to support the United Nations mission in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora was the 25th AP journalist to die in the line
of duty since the organization was founded in 1848. Previously,
APTN producer Myles Tierney was fatally shot in Sierra Leone a year
ago and AP West Africa bureau chief Ian Stewart was also seriously
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora began his professional life as a corporate
lawyer but was drawn to the challenge of news reporting, which
began with his coverage of the Bosnian war in the early 1990s. He
went on to cover conflicts in Kosovo, Chechnya, Iraq, Congo and
other parts of the world for APTN.
</P>
<P>
   Of reporting from Chechnya, Gil Moreno de Mora said in a recent
first-person account: ''Every minute of every day you think you are
going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis D. Boccardi, AP's president and chief executive officer,
said in a statement that ''Miguel's death leaves us with an
indescribable sense of loss. Our pain is not eased by the certainty
that he was doing work he loved when tragedy struck.
</P>
<P>
   ''Professional accolades fade to the background at tragic
moments like this but at least he lived to accept the honor, just
last month, of being hailed as the Royal Television Society's
cameraman of the year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Baker, head of news for APTN, said ''Miguel was intuitive,
bold and one of the most intelligent cameraman of his generation.
... He went to the world's most dangerous places but didn't make a
move without weighing up the reasons for doing it and his options.
He had immense respect from all who knew him not just for his work
but because he was a deeply modest man who would help anybody he
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Schork had reported for Reuters for the last decade, and covered
many of the same conflicts that Gil Moreno de Mora had. The two had
been good friends since reporting from Bosnia, when they often
worked closely together.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kurt Schork was a courageous reporter, a courageous man who
perhaps more than any other journalist highlighted the plight of
the Kurds during the Gulf War and later those victims of the
Balkans conflicts,'' said Reuters Editor-in-Chief Geert Linnebank.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said from New York that ''the world doesn't always understand how
much it owes'' to journalists like Gil Moreno de Mora and Schork.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the public that watches these pictures and doesn't really
realize is the compulsion to tell the story, which differentiates
people like Kurt and Miguel from the rest of us -- the risks they
take to make sure the world knows what's happening in what
otherwise would be the dark recesses of people behaving at their
absolute worst,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in New York that he was
saddened to hear of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were professionals, seeking to report on a bloody
conflict that has already taken too many lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International
USA, said the organization condemned the killings and extended
condolences to Gil Moreno de Mora and Schork's families.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government forces in the West African nation have been
fighting the rebel Revolutionary United Front, which took hundreds
of U.N. peacekeepers hostage early in May and then launched an
advance toward Freetown. Government forces have been slowly pushing
the rebels away from the capital since then.

<HEADLINE> Slain AP Journalist Knew of Dangers  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora had no
illusions about the danger involved as his work as an Associated
Press Television News cameraman took him from one war zone to
another.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every minute of every day you think you are going to die,'' he
wrote last December while reporting from Chechnya's capital,
Grozny, during intense, round-the-clock bombardments by Russian
planes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day ... I met, filmed or gave cigarettes to people who
were dead by the next morning. This is the horrific reality of life
in Grozny at the dawn of the new millennium,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora survived Chechnya and other brutal conflicts
from Kosovo to Iraq to Congo. On Wednesday, he was killed in an
ambush in war-ravaged Sierra Leone. He was 32.
</P>
<P>
   Maria de Patrocinio Macian Blaya, Gil Moreno de Mora's mother,
said from her home in Barcelona, Spain that her son was a ''truly
extraordinary person.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am filled with overwhelming sadness and grief, but in the
end I find solace in the fact that Miguel was doing the job he
loved and died doing the work he felt ordained for,'' she said.
''He felt his mission was to give voice to those who did not have
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora provided news dispatches from war zones where
he often was the only journalist to witness dramatic events.
</P>
<P>
   He had been in Sierra Leone for the past two weeks, spending
much of that time on or near the shifting front lines. On Monday,
in one of his last stories, he was among the first journalists to
see several mutilated corpses that appeared to be the bodies of
U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome find was just outside Rogberi Junction, not far
from the spot where he and Reuters correspondent Kurt Schork were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora, who was from Barcelona, Spain, was a
corporate lawyer who practiced briefly before becoming a cameraman.
He got his first break as a free-lancer in Bosnia. Needing press
accreditation, but struggling to find an employer to back him, he
eventually managed to wangle a press card on behalf of a motorcycle
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miguel told me once that he felt he was contributing more to
the world as a journalist than as a lawyer,'' said Aida
Cerkez-Robinson, an Associated Press reporter who worked with Gil
Moreno de Mora in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he was helping the innocent people trapped in a war
more by telling the world about their destiny. This was his motive.
I think it carried him from one war to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Before and during NATO's war against Yugoslavia last year, Gil
Moreno de Mora spent months with members of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, often living in the woods with the fighters for weeks at a
time. He was the only Western cameraman to remain in Kosovo's
capital, Pristina, when NATO bombed the region last year.
</P>
<P>
   His work in Kosovo earned him the 1999 Royal Television
Society's cameraman of the year award in Britain, an honor he
received just last month.
</P>
<P>
   The previous year, Gil Moreno de Mora won an award given in
memory of another cameraman -- the Rory Peck Award -- for his
coverage in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora was the 25th AP journalist to die in the line
of duty since the organization was founded in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora, who was based in London, was the second APTN
staffer killed in Sierra Leone in the past 16 months. Producer
Myles Tierney was fatally shot at a checkpoint in Freetown on Jan.
10, 1999, an attack that also seriously injured Associated Press
West Africa bureau chief Ian Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora, who worked with Tierney in Africa for two
years, paid tribute to his colleague shortly after his death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Myles understood people in pain,'' he said. ''He cared for
them because each was an individual to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Baker, head of news for APTN, said the same could be said

   ''Miguel was intuitive, bold and one of the most intelligent
cameramen of his generation,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He went to the world's most dangerous places but didn't make a
move without weighing up the reasons for doing it and his options.
He had immense respect from all who knew him not just for his work
but because he was a deeply modest man who would help anybody he
could.''

<HEADLINE> China Bans Pop Star's Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's new president expressed regret
Thursday that China has banned advertisements featuring a pop star
who sang the national anthem at his inauguration last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   China's decision to pull Taiwanese singer Chang Huei-mei's
Sprite soft drink ads from billboards, newspapers and TV broadcasts
was ''incomprehensible,'' President Chen Shui-bian said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That a citizen of the Republic of China singing the anthem in
her own country should receive such a reaction is regrettable,''
Chen said, referring to Taiwan by its official name.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like treating your own compatriot, your own brother or
sister as an enemy,'' Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan split amid civil war 51 years ago. However,
cultural exchanges have flourished in recent years, and Chang --
known as A-mei -- has a big following on the mainland. Her tour of
China last year was a huge success.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's ads ran for at least a month on China Central Television
before being pulled Saturday just after her appearance at the
inauguration, an event that was carefully watched by Beijing
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The anthem Chang sang was composed on the mainland before the
two sides separated. It is seen as a symbol of Taiwan's link to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between China and Taiwan have grown strained following
Chen's election victory in March. China distrusts Chen because he
was once a vocal supporter of Taiwan independence. Beijing has
repeatedly threatened to attack if the island seeks a permanent
break.
</P>
<P>
   Coca Cola, which manufactures Sprite, confirmed the ban of the
30-second TV spots by Chinese television and said the company would
not contest the decision.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Miami Relatives Moving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez are moving
out of the Little Havana home made famous by the media hordes and
protesters who camped out in front of the bungalow during the five
months the 6-year-old Cuban boy was living there.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are moving,'' family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   The family could move from the rented home next month if
renovations on their new home in West Miami and the sale of the
property are completed by then.
</P>
<P>
   The family has lived in the modest 1952 two-bedroom,
one-bathroom home for more than a decade, but say they have felt
uncomfortable there since the April 22 federal raid that removed
Elian from the home and reunited him with his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his Cuban family have been living in a secluded
Maryland retreat for the last month, but are expected to soon move
to a Washington, D.C., estate, an American supporter said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The family is awaiting a decision from the 11th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals in Atlanta on the Miami relatives' request for
asylum for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's swing set already has been moved to the back yard of his
relatives' new home. Posts have been dug for a fence because the
family says it wants privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''People I don't know wave to me if I'm standing outside'' the
Little Havana home, said Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great uncle.
</P>
<P>
   The West Miami residence, a 1948 two-bedroom, two-bathroom home
that previously was in foreclosure, was bought at an auction in
February for $112,500 by a real estate investor and friend of the
Gonzalez family.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are to sell the renovated home to Delfin Gonzalez,
Lazaro's brother, who will in turn lease it, with an option to buy,
to Lazaro, his wife, Angela, and daughter, Marisleysis.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is necessary because Delfin qualifies for a
mortgage and Lazaro is not currently employed, The Miami Herald
said in Thursday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   In related developments:
</P>
<P>
   -- At her weekly news conference, Attorney General Janet Reno
said she had no plans to meet with members of Miami's exiled Cuban
community during a trip to Florida Thursday evening. Reno said she
would prefer to wait until tensions over the Gonzalez case subside
before meeting with the community, adding that she has not been
invited to meet with any of its representatives. ''I want to do it
in a reasonable, thoughtful way that respects feelings and tensions
and gives people time to talk out issues,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cuban American groups plan to protest Reno's speech Thursday
evening in the Bal Harbor section of Miami. Brothers to the Rescue,
a volunteer group that flies over the Florida Straits looking for
Cubans leaving their homeland by sea, planned a street protest as
well as a fly-over by their small planes. The Democracy Movement,
an anti-Castro group that helped stage protests outside the
Gonzalez home, said it will have protesters in the street and
aboard a flotilla in the Atlantic Ocean, across the beach from the
hotel where Reno is set to speak.
</P>
<P>
   -- Newly released U.S. Coast Guard records show that a doctor who
examined Elian shortly after the boy was rescued at sea told
immigration authorities he probably had been in the water less than
24 hours. Elian was rescued Thanksgiving Day after his boat
capsized, killing his mother and several others fleeing Cuba for
the United States. He was believed to have spent more than 50 hours
in the water, but a log entry by an unidentified Coast Guard
official said, ''Doctor said the boy wasn't in the water 24 hrs.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Hostages' Morale Low  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- After more than a month in the hands of
Muslim rebels in the jungle, hostages' hopes are dimming and
frustrations are rising even though formal negotiations could begin
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is fed up,'' South African hostage Callie Strydom
told reporters who were allowed to visit the Abu Sayyaf rebels'
hide-out Thursday. ''We are being used as pawns between the
political side and this group.''
</P>
<P>
   Captive Risto Vahanen the hostages' mood ''has been going down
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, today, we have actually lost our hope in the
proceedings, in the negotiations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf's Commander Robot said that the length of the
hostages' confinement was up to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still waiting for the results of the negotiations,''
Robot said. ''We also want to release the hostages as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado had high hopes for
the talks set to open Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the conditions are right. The Abu Sayyaf trusts that
the military will not attack, and the military is cooperating,''
Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   Skirmishes between the rebels and troops, changes in the
government negotiating team, and the need for security arrangements
on the island of Jolo have delayed formal talks, although the
rebels have discussed their goals informally with government
envoys.
</P>
<P>
   Three Germans, two French, two Finns, two South Africans, a
Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos were kidnapped from a
Malaysian diving resort April 23 and taken to the island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf, the smaller and more radical of two guerrilla
groups fighting for an independent Islamic state in the
impoverished southern Philippines, brought world attention to a
rebellion that has simmered for decades when they kidnapped the 21
tourists and resort employees.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a wave of recent violence in the southern
Philippines triggered by fighting between Muslim rebels and
government troops that has displaced more than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has been limited to the southern Mindanao region,
home of the mostly Roman Catholic Philippines' Muslim minority, but
several bombs have struck the capital of Manila since the rebels
threatened to target cities.
</P>
<P>
   While the Abu Sayyaf espouse political ideals, many say they are
bandits who survive by kidnapping and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   Informally, the Abu Sayyaf have asked for as much as $2 million
just to free an ill German hostage, Renate Wallert.
</P>
<P>
   Their formal demands so far include creation of an independent
Islamic state -- something President Joseph Estrada has repeatedly
refused to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's talks are likely to open in the township of Patikul
with the Abu Sayyaf's political demands, negotiator Farouk Hussein
said Thursday. There have been no demands for money in the last two
informal meetings with rebel leaders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A government doctor, along with envoys from the negotiators and
several journalists, visited the camp of about 150 guerrillas
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese hostage Marie Moarbes sent a message to her family
through the TV journalists: ''Thanks Mom, I love you. Please pray
for our quick release. It's been very hard. Please tell Papa I hope
I'll see him very soon. Everybody is suffering here.''

<HEADLINE> TV Shows Adding Minority Characters  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- There's a doctor who teaches medical students,
and a Secret Service agent who guards the first lady. One manages a
Wall Street firm, one's an anchorman, one's a high school principal
and another chases a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   All are roles filled by black actors in new TV series on the
networks' fall schedules.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the NAACP made an issue of the absence of
minorities in prominent roles on new TV shows, things have changed
in Hollywood. The networks have at least shown that they know their
efforts at promoting diversity are being watched.
</P>
<P>
   Former ''Homicide'' actor Andre Braugher has the starring role
as a doctor in ''Gideon's Crossing,'' the only new drama on ABC's
schedule. And CBS cited the NAACP's concerns in renewing ''City of
Angels,'' a drama with a predominantly black cast, despite mediocre
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP, which negotiated agreements with the major networks
to increase minority participation both on and off screen, said it
needs to study the schedules before commenting extensively.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the surface, things look a little better,'' spokesman John
White said. ''But when you come from zero, one looks better.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives said they believe the network has made progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I imagine at any time there might be some groups that will
feel unrepresented,'' said Scott Sassa, NBC West Coast president.
''It's going to be a fact of life on an ongoing basis, no matter
how far we move the ball in terms of diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   David Alan Grier landed the lead role in NBC's ''Dag,'' playing
a Secret Service agent assigned to guard the first lady as
punishment for diving in the wrong direction during a failed
assassination attempt. Wendell Pierce plays Steven Weber's best
friend in ''The Steven Weber Show.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS President Leslie Moonves said 16 of the 21 shows on the
network's fall schedule, including newsmagazines, feature
minorities prominently.
</P>
<P>
   The network's new comedy ''Welcome to New York'' has actor Rocky
Carroll playing an anchorman. Mykelti Williamson is one of the two
lead actors in CBS's remake of ''The Fugitive.'' Black actors are
also featured in ''The District,'' a drama about a Washington
police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we are a leader in this area,'' Moonves said. ''We
think we are ahead of the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   After two seasons, ABC canceled ''The Hughleys,'' a comedy about
a black family moving into a mostly white suburb, but the series
was picked up by UPN. Damon Wayans is a family man in one of ABC's
most promising comedies, ''My Wife and Kids,'' though it has been
kept off the schedule until midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, with a drama-heavy new schedule, has included minorities in
ensemble casts: two of the eight leads in ''The Street,'' including
a financial firm's manager; two of five in ''Fearsum''; and two of
eight in David E. Kelley's new ''Boston Public'' -- a high school
principal and a literature professor.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy team on the WB's new ''Hype'' is multiracial. The WB
and UPN, as they have in the past, set aside one night a week for
comedies with overwhelmingly black casts. The rest of the week,
their schedules are aimed largely at young whites -- a reality that
comedian Steve Harvey, who is black, lampooned last week when the
WB introduced a series of rail-thin white actors from its casts to
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm Steve Harvey,'' he deadpanned. ''I'm a white teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   He made a serious point, though, about the industry's tendency
to assume only blacks would be interested in his show. Harvey said
he wants to appeal to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wish the media would get on board with this and stop
labeling us,'' he said. ''We don't want to be a 'black show.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although CBS touted its diversity record, it was criticized by
the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, which said the
broadcast networks in general did a poor job in casting Latinos.
The group singled out CBS for not scheduling ''American Family,'' a
pilot drama about a middle-class Hispanic family.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said ''American Family'' simply didn't fit in CBS'
schedule in a year the network developed strong dramas. He said he
took the unusual step of allowing the show's producers to pitch the
CBS-developed series to other networks, but none of them included
it on their schedules, either.
</P>
<P>
   CBS hasn't decided whether ''American Family'' has a future
there, Moonves said.

<HEADLINE> Decade Later, No Myanmar Democracy  </HEADLINE>
By GRANT PECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Old people here may someday tell their
disbelieving grandchildren of the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
they had May 27, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   That was the day they voted.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, barely 10 years past, it seems no more than myth. They
elected a new parliament, but the army never allowed it to convene.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the same grim men in the same green uniforms rule the
country -- as they have since the army overthrew the last democratic
government in a 1962 coup.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had already enjoyed parliamentary democracy ... but the
younger generation doesn't know about the value of parliamentary
democracy,'' laments Tin Oo, vice chairman of the National League
for Democracy, the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar, also called Burma, hasn't had a freely elected
government since the military coup, and no one is promising one
soon. But a decade ago, things looked different.
</P>
<P>
   On election day 1990, more than 72 percent of the country's
eligible voters cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly, they voted for the NLD, born out of a
pro-democracy movement that had taken root two years earlier in
weeks of street protests the army crushed.
</P>
<P>
   The election was a rare moment for Myanmar, a nation with a
history of troubled politics. The pattern had been set with the
assassination by political rivals of independence leader Gen. Aung
San, just six months before Burma won freedom from Britain in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Without Aung San's strong leadership, the fledgling democracy
foundered. Political schisms were exacerbated by ethnic separatist
movements that flared into full-blown border insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
   Using the excuses of a deteriorating economy and a secession
threat by the Shan minority, army Gen. Ne Win led a coup March 2,
1962.
</P>
<P>
   But his socialist military regime failed to reconcile with the
minorities and turned what had been one of the region's richest
countries -- with onshore oil deposits and rich rice-growing areas --
into an economic backwater.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody street unrest of 1988 shattered his government, but a
new generation of generals took its place.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to gain international legitimacy, the junta held
elections in 1990. The NLD took 392 of the 485 parliamentary seats.
The military-backed National United Party took 10.
</P>
<P>
   The NLD won even though its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi -- Aung
San's daughter -- was then under house arrest and her deputy, former
army brigadier Tin Oo, was in prison.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the generals seemed to take their loss in stride. Kyaw
Sann, a government spokesman, said then: ''Any government that is
formed according to the constitution will be strong and stable. It
is totally up to the elected members. They can move as quickly as
they like and take power.''
</P>
<P>
   But two months later, when the NLD moved to form a government,
the military rulers decreed they would retain power under martial
law, which would continue until a strong constitution was in place.
Furthermore, they said, the newly elected representatives' sole
duty was to draft that constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1993, the military convened a National Convention to
draw up a new constitution -- and hand-picked 603 of the 702
convention delegates. The NLD's 88 representatives withdrew three
years later after it was clear they were supposed to rubber-stamp
the military's edicts to prolong its power.
</P>
<P>
   The National Convention has done little since its early sessions
and has no deadline to produce a constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the military foiled the new parliament, it began
arresting and harassing NLD members, including the elected
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, it's been a political war of attrition. Just 169 of
the original 485 representatives remain valid members of the
would-be parliament, government spokesman Col. Than Tun said last
week -- 110 from the NLD, 20 from other parties and 39 independents.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four members died, 185 were disqualified and 97
''voluntarily resigned from elected membership,'' the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, the NLD set up a 10-member surrogate
parliament. Infuriated, the military rounded up more than 850 party
members; it still holds 69 of the 110 valid NLD legislators at
government ''guest houses,'' a lighter form of detention than
prison.
</P>
<P>
   More representatives have been arrested in recent weeks. The
government suggests the arrestees have links to banned ethnic
insurgents, but the NLD says this is just another heavy-handed
effort to disrupt its activities.
</P>
<P>
   The government refuses to speak with Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize, who was released from six years of house arrest
in 1995 but remains under tight restriction. The generals consider
her a traitor for supporting international economic sanctions
intended to force democratic changes in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions, by the United States and the European Union, have
done little but increase the generals' stubbornness.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar belongs to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, an organization more sympathetic to the military's
nationalistic line, but even that relationship has failed to ease
the junta's sense of isolation and its belief it is warding off
U.S.-led neocolonialism disguised as democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Tin Oo told The Associated Press the NLD would try to celebrate
Saturday's election anniversary but expected the authorities to
step in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ten years is a very auspicious occasion,'' Tin Oo said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Lets Syria Know of New Rules  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The bulldozed earth and jagged half-built
fences of Israel's northern frontier mark the battlefront in a
high-stakes new war of nerves -- with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's precipitous pullout from a swath of south Lebanon it
had occupied for nearly two decades has altered the strategic
landscape as well as the physical one, placing Syria, the power
broker in Lebanon, squarely in Israel's gun sights if there is
trouble along the raw new Lebanese frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down Israel's political and military chain of command,
the warnings to Syria are being repeated: Now that Israeli troops
are out of Lebanon, the ground rules have changed.
</P>
<P>
   From here on out, the message goes, if Syria is seen as
inspiring attacks against Israel -- whether by Shiite Muslim
guerrillas, or rejectionist Palestinians in Lebanon, or others -- it
will pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel's presence in Lebanon tied its hands to some extent,''
Prime Minister Ehud Barak told a special parliamentary session in
the border town of Kiryat Shemona on Thursday. ''But from now on,
there are no limits on a tough Israeli response to all aggression
against it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the event of any attack, the 30,000 Syrian troops stationed
in Lebanon -- enforcers of Syria's near-total power there -- would be
a prime target for Israeli reprisals, said Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz,
Israel's army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''The planes are ready, and the pilots are on call,'' he said,
hours after Israel's Lebanon pullout was completed at daybreak
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told lawmakers Thursday that any cross-border attacks
would be viewed as an act of war, and no ''target or player in
Lebanon'' -- taken to mean Syria -- would be immune from retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Such rhetoric might seem like an about-face for Barak, the
Israeli leader who has most fervently sought peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister spent his first five months in office wooing
Syrian President Hafez Assad to the bargaining table, sometimes
startling Israelis with his warm words about the Syrian leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak clearly believes that a drastic deterrent is the only
certain way to stave off confrontation in this volatile
post-pullout phase -- and thus keep alive hopes for restarting the
talks with Syria, which broke down in January.
</P>
<P>
   Preemptively, however, Israel has sought to diplomatically
justify strikes against Syrian targets in retaliation for any
attacks launched from Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the pullout from Lebanon, Barak wrote to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other world leaders, accusing
Syria of fomenting violence by using Hezbollah and Palestinian
radicals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides trying to marshal world support, Barak made an unusual
direct appeal to Lebanon not to let Syria or others use it as a
springboard for attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do not allow again terror organizations and extremists ... to
kindle a fire on Lebanon's back for the sake of interests that are
not yours,'' he said in his speech to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, Syria is expressing delight over Israel's pullout,
with its state-run media proclaiming a great victory for the
Lebanese guerrillas. But the withdrawal casts an uncomfortable
spotlight on Syria's own occupation of Lebanon, which is deeply
resented by most Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   The last Israeli tanks had barely rolled back across the border
when the Clinton administration repeated its assertion -- now aimed
solely at Syria -- that foreign forces should leave Lebanon, and
U.N. peacekeepers should help the Lebanese government keep order in
the border zone.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is Israel's most implacable foe, Syria has kept its
own border with Israel calm since the 1973 war. Few in Israel
believe, however, that such quiet can be taken for granted any time
soon along the Lebanese frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers patrolling the border have been told to hold their fire
unless their lives are in danger, because any flare-up could
quickly become a larger conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is well aware that whatever international approval it
enjoys for having gotten out of Lebanon would quickly evaporate if
it is seen as overreacting to a cross-border clash.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, failing to respond to provocation could cost
it crucial credibility, opening the way to an endless succession of
Syrian-sponsored guerrilla strikes against Israel's northern
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''You must simply understand that we are facing a new reality,''
Mofaz told his troops. ''It has changed overnight.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as jittery investors
once again moved money from one sector to another. Technology
stocks rose, buoying the Nasdaq, but financial shares stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite
index was up 57.62 to 3,328.23.
</P>
<P>
   Other stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 91.50 at 10,443.85, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 1.04 at 1,400.09.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks continued a rebound that began Wednesday as
investors started channeling money into stocks that have tumbled in
the past few weeks. Cisco Systems was up 2 5/16 at 57 7/16, and
Oracle rose 5[ to 69].
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a better feel to the tech sector today,'' said Barry
Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New
York. ''Improved volume is an excellent sign, as is Cisco's ability
to hit a bottom and recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were also heartened by the Nasdaq's ability to bounce
back even without Microsoft. Its shares fell 3\ to 62 5/16 a day
after a federal judge ordered the Justice Department to revise its
plan to break up the world's leading computer software maker and
submit the new version by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The order renewed expectations that Microsoft will be split into
two, or even three, parts. Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund told
clients a broken-up Microsoft would undoubtedly would be worth less
than a whole one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts fear the sector's recovery may be fragile,
because the interest rate worries that undermined technology stocks
in the first place are still haunting the market. Most market
watchers anticipate choppy trading for at least another week, with
no clear leadership from any one sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to follow through,'' Hyman said. ''If we don't, a
single up day is meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, bank stocks that have thrived lately were mostly lower.
Citigroup fell 1~ to 59{ after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its
rating on the stock to ''outperform'' from ''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Bank of New York fell 1 to 47.
</P>
<P>
   The market was little affected by the Commerce Department's
report that the U.S. economy, powered by brisk consumer and
government spending, grew at a robust 5.4 percent annual rate
during the first three months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation-wary investors were most interested in an inflation
gauge tied to the gross domestic product, which rose at an annual
rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter. The market had
anticipated a slightly bigger increase. Surging energy prices
accounted for most of the gain.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues were marginally ahead of decliners on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 625.51 million shares,
well behind Wednesday's brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.69 to 467.43.

<HEADLINE> Russia Announces Tax Reform Plan  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW -- In its first major economic policy move, President
Vladimir Putin's government on Thursday unveiled a sweeping plan to
revive Russia's anemic economy by lowering the tax burden and
imposing a flat 13 percent income tax.
</P>
<P>
   The plan -- which is expected to win parliamentary approval this
summer -- would also boost taxes on gasoline and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The flat tax would replace the current progressive income tax,
which now ranges from 12 percent to 30 percent. The plan would also
remove a widely criticized tax on business transactions and allow a
range of tax deductions for business expenses, such as advertising
and property insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come for the government to make a decision to
lower the tax burden,'' Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said at a
Cabinet meeting. ''This will stimulate production, broaden the tax
base and encourage economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also plans to streamline the convoluted tax
system, abolishing some taxes that have proven ineffective and
combining others into a single flat charge.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by parliament, the changes will take effect next
year. Last year's parliamentary elections ended the legislative
dominance of the Communists, who had blocked many reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals were greeted favorably by analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that this reform offers something to everybody,'' said
Niina Pautola, chief economist at the European Center for Economic
Reform in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as a vehicle to promote investment, it's a very nice
symbol of things to come,'' said American Chamber of Commerce
President Scott Blacklin.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the current system say the high tax rates and
confusing system have stifled investment and encouraged widespread
tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Economic Development and Trade Minister German Gref, a key
author of the tax reform plan, cited the current business
transactions tax as a particular problem. It effectively equals a
44 percent tax on the profits of an enterprise, and when added to
the existing 30 percent profit tax, it forces a company to pay
taxes of more than 70 percent on profits, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Russia has had difficulty collecting taxes;
proponents of the reforms say lowering the income tax would help
increase tax revenues by encouraging individuals and companies to
declare their real wages.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know that yet,'' Pautola warned. ''It is definitely a
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Gref dismissed allegations that a flat income tax rate would
only benefit wealthy taxpayers, saying that only 0.1 percent of tax
revenues comes from those in the highest income bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not collecting taxes from the wealthy,'' Gref said.
''The rich have a huge number of opportunities to leave and not pay
their taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also plans to compensate for the cut in tax rates
by canceling many exemptions and privileges granted to companies.
Economic experts have long urged the Cabinet to make the move,
saying that such privileges sap the government's revenues and
encourage corruption.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government proposes to increase some taxes
which have proved easier to collect, such as levies on gasoline,
which would increase six-fold, and the excise tax on tobacco, which
would double. The gas tax increase would cause a nearly 30 percent
hike in prices at the pump, said First Deputy Finance Minister
Sergei Shatalov.
</P>
<P>
   The budget committee of the State Duma, or lower house, began
discussing the government proposals Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan faces good prospects in the Duma, dominated by
pro-Kremlin parties which have already voiced their support for the
proposed reforms. Putin sent a letter to parliament earlier this
week outlining the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma is expected to approve the changes before adjourning
for summer recess in July.

<HEADLINE> Sheldon Silver is not out of the woods yet  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Sheldon Silver's speakership in the New York
state Assembly survived a frontal assault this week.
</P>
<P>
   But his victory over Democratic dissidents led by his former
majority leader, Michael Bragman, does not mean Silver has
necessarily won the war.
</P>
<P>
   Silver rallied 77 other Democrats around him to stave off the
challenge for his job. Bragman, who needed 50 votes among the 98
Democrats in the Assembly to take over as speaker, got only 18
other Democrats to vote with him on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Silver criticized people who would focus on the
one-fifth or so of the Democratic delegation willing to stand
publicly against him. What about the four-fifths who were with him,
he asked?
</P>
<P>
   ''Eighty percent said they were happy,'' he declared. ''That's
what happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been that a great many of the 80 percent were merely
saying they were not unhappy enough with Silver to change speakers.
At this time.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is crucial to Silver's future as speaker, and it
is one that will not become better defined until -- or if -- he is
formally re-elected to a new two-year term as speaker prior to the
start of the 2001 legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said that assuming he wins re-election to another term in
the Assembly from his Manhattan district, he wants to continue
being speaker. In this job he is the most powerful Democrat in New
York state government, with great influence on a $78 billion state
budget and virtual veto power over bills in the New York state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''The past six years have been the greatest six years of my
life,'' Silver said of his speakership.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing against Silver's removal as speaker, many Democrats
praised the job he has done negotiating for health care, public
schools, higher education and other social programs with a
sometimes-hostile Republican Gov. George Pataki and state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But many also argued that late May, in the last month of a
legislative session and in the middle of an election year, is a
lousy time to change speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why now?'' asked Assemblyman Herman Farrell, a Manhattan
Democrat close to Silver. ''Why at this time? Why in this manner?''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell added, ''The speaker issue is an issue that should be in
December this year -- if it's a real issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the time,'' Assemblyman Roger Green of Brooklyn
said on the floor of the Assembly. ''You know it's not the place.
Our place is in a Democratic conference.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the words of praise Silver heard as Democrats beat back
Bragman's uprising, there was also the lingering sentiment that
timing -- not Silver's own performance -- was a key consideration in
many people's minds as to why he should be retained.
</P>
<P>
   But what about November? December? That question was not
answered this week, and it will continue to hang over Silver and
his regime through the rest of this legislative session and the
fall presidential, U.S. senatorial and legislative elections. It
will not be resolved for sure until Democrats elect a speaker for a
new two-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The other unanswerable question was how many of Silver's
Democrats were really dissatisfied enough with his leadership to
cast him aside.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he counted 53 at one point last week and another
eight or nine who would have been on his side had he demonstrated
enough support to topple Silver. But they evaporated as Silver
twisted arms and threatened members' political existences, Bragman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver scoffed at those numbers and denied coercing anyone to
stay in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that once the smoke cleared, Bragman did get 18
other Democrats to stand up publicly and criticize a sitting
speaker who holds the power of their political life or death over
their heads. That alone was remarkable in the memories of anyone
now at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The ball is undoubtedly now in Silver's court.
</P>
<P>
   While saying little about addressing calls for reform raised by
Bragman's dissidents as well as some of the members who stayed with
him, Silver did announce plans to form a committee to recommend
changes in how the Democrats run the house. Whether the complaints
by both dissidents and some members standing by Silver -- excessive
staff influence on the affairs of the Assembly, the extreme
difficulty in seeing Silver personally -- would be addressed
substantively was an open question.
</P>
<P>
   Silver was also said to be trying hard to put a face on his
sincerity to mend fences by meeting face-to-face with Democratic
members.
</P>
<P>
   Silver stamped out what ended up being a brush fire. The bonfire
is what he is now concerned with.

<HEADLINE> Clinton says she understands skepticism about her run  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday she
understands why some people are skeptical about her intentions in
running for the U.S. Senate, but would not use the seat as a
stepping stone to run for president in 2004, even if party leaders
ask her to.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging ''Voice of the Voter'' forum in which she
faced questions about everything from where she expected to spend
eternity to the appropriateness of linking new Senate rival Rick
Lazio to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the first lady said,
''I feel I owe it to the people of New York to serve a six-year
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, for the first time, Clinton said she understood
''there are skeptics. I don't blame people for being skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People will have to judge me and draw whatever conclusions
they want ... I'm committed to serving my six-year term,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on what she would do if Democrats pleaded with her to
run in 2004 if they lost the White House this year, she said:
''That is not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have repeatedly charged that the first lady wants to
use the Senate as a stepping stone for a presidential run, if not
in 2004, then in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   During the forum, attended by about 85 Rochester-area residents,
Clinton said that while she wouldn't personally try to link Lazio
to Gingrich, ''I cannot speak for all my supporters because
certainly the facts are that he was closely allied during those
years ... with that leadership in the Congress, and I think New
Yorkers need to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, campaign aides to the first lady have already been
bashing the Long Island congressman as a Gingrich lieutenant who
embraced the former speaker's ''Contract with America.'' Lazio, who
stepped into the race last Friday after New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani bowed out, has said he supported only those parts of the
contract he felt were good for New York such as lower taxes and a
balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by one self-described conservative at the forum about how
she could work in the Senate given that she is such a polarizing
figure, Clinton said she has already shown she can work with people
in Congress who don't particularly like her. She cited her work
last year with Texas' Tom Delay -- ''someone who has never said a
good word in public about me or my husband'' -- on legislation
dealing with children aging out of foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing in the Senate is not ever to be insulted
by whatever anybody says about you ... (and) after what I've been
through for the last seven years, nothing they can say can possibly
hurt my feelings,'' she said to laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The questioners in the 1{-hour forum were part of a voter
awareness project sponsored by Rochester's WXXI Public
Broadcasting, WOKR-TV and the Rochester Democrat &AMP; Chronicle. The
questions were selected at random.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the first lady was asked by a Republican: ''If you
were to die tonight, would you know if you would spend eternity in
heaven or hell?''
</P>
<P>
   Momentarily taken aback, Clinton finally responded: ''I consider
myself a person of faith. I consider myself like any person of
faith to be doing the very best I can.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that I will be someone who will live a life that is
worthy of my strong Methodism and my Christian faith and my
commitment to doing the very best I can as a human being to live up
to the example of our Lord and savior,'' she added. ''But I cannot
tell you where I will be. I can only hope and pray that I will find
favor in God's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   With the audience in silence, the first lady went on to say she
did not believe ''that we should be, in public life, be putting
people in a position of responding to questions that really focus
more on one's personal faith.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Putin Summit Tempered  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House dampened expectations Thursday
for President Clinton's first summit with Russian President
Vladimir Putin, saying it was not the occasion to resolve major
differences over nuclear arsenals or U.S. plans to build a national
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   However, the United States raised the prospect of a summit
agreement to destroy 34 tons of military grade plutonium on each
side. ''That's enough plutonium literally to make tens of thousands
of nuclear weapons,'' National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   With eight months to go in Clinton's presidency, Berger said
Clinton would not heed Republican calls to tread water and avoid
commitments that might bind his successor. Berger said presidents
are elected to serve four years, and ''the United States cannot
afford to do business only three years out of four.''
</P>
<P>
   The president leaves Monday, Memorial Day, for a weeklong visit
to Europe. He will visit Portugal for a summit with European Union
leaders, stop in Germany for a conference of 17 world leaders and
travel to Russia for talks June 3-4 with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   On June 5, Clinton will address the State Duma, the first
American president to address the lower chamber of Russia's
parliament. Later that day, he will travel to Kiev, Ukraine, where
he will meet with President Leonid Kuchma and make a speech before
departing for Washington that night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will leave Washington again on June 7 on a quick trip to
Japan for a memorial service for Keizo Obuchi, the former prime
minister who died from a stroke. Afterward, Clinton will return
immediately to Washington, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Arms control issues traditionally are a centerpiece of
U.S.-Russian summits. Clinton and former President Boris Yeltsin
agreed in 1997 to seek deeper arms reductions after Russia ratified
the START II agreement, which would reduce nuclear arsenals to
between 3,000 and 3,500 strategic nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma approved START II on April 14. The United States is
looking at reductions to 2,000 to 2,500 warheads, while the
Russians have expressed interest in going further.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is further complicated by U.S. hopes to amend the 1972
Antiballistic Missile Treaty between the United States and Russia
to allow the deployment of a U.S. national missile defense system.
Moscow opposes any changes.
</P>
<P>
   Berger dashed hopes of a breakthrough on either front. ''With
respect to ABM and START, I don't expect any resolution of this
issue during this visit,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never expected an issue as complex as this to be resolved
in this summit,'' Berger said. ''This is the first time that
President Putin and President Clinton will have an opportunity to
discuss this. These are serious issues. And they involve both
whether we can agree to modifications in the ABM Treaty, whether we
can further progress on the START III process that President
Yeltsin and President Clinton set as an objective in Helsinki in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully we will have some greater degree of understanding of
each other's position,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   He left open the prospect of progress later in the year when
Clinton meets Putin on other occasions, at the summit of
industrialized nations in Okinawa, Japan, in July, at a United
Nations meeting in September and at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, to be held in Brunei in November.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will decide this summer whether to deploy a missile
defense system, now projected to cost $30 billion.

<HEADLINE> China Applauds Congress Trade Vote  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- American and Chinese businesses looked forward to
more stable trade, China's government expressed hope for closer
ties with Washington and China's neighbors spoke of better
prospects for peace after the U.S. Congress approved permanent
trade ties with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Support came from a wide spectrum. China's government called the
U.S. House vote ''wise.'' Shares in companies expected to profit
from boosted trade led modest rises on Chinese stock markets. For
Chinese and American businesses, the end of annual divisive
congressional debates on China's trade status promised greater
stability.
</P>
<P>
   But while welcoming Wednesday's vote, the Beijing leadership
assailed a provision in the House legislation to establish a
commission to monitor China's human and labor rights. The U.S.
Senate still must approve the measure for it to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   China protested to the U.S. government and ''we reserve the
right to take further actions,'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang
Qiyue said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the anger, Zhang indicated Beijing would honor its
agreement with the United States in November to open China's
markets, which helped pave the way for expected Chinese entry this
year into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Noting U.S. concerns about Beijing's trustworthiness, chief
Chinese WTO negotiator Long Yongtu also said ''China will
undoubtedly carry out all its promises made in the WTO
negotiations,'' state media reported.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's anger over the human rights commission had been
expected. For weeks, China had urged Congress to extend
unconditional permanent normal trade relations, but U.S. officials
said the monitoring commission was necessary to win over wavering
legislators to ensure the vote succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Although not essential to China's entry to WTO, permanent
trading rights will give Beijing secure access to its biggest
export market and continue the momentum of its march into the
Geneva-based rule-making body for world trade.
</P>
<P>
   It also will end 20 years of annual congressional reviews of
China's trade status that had become forums for criticizing Chinese
human rights abuses, threats to Taiwan, suspected espionage and
other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have a stable trade relationship between China and the
United States just makes you feel more comfortable, instead of
worrying every year about whether China is going to retaliate or
America is going to play good cop, bad cop,'' said Tara Lucas, CEO
of a Chinese women's Web site, Gaogenxie.com.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO's director, Mike Moore, said he was ''delighted.'' In
Hong Kong, the former British colony that thrives on China trade
and investments, leader Tung Chee-hwa cited economists as saying
China's foreign trade should double within eight years of joining
the WTO. Hong Kong must get ''fully prepared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore's trade minister, George Yeo, said the vote ''greatly
improves the prospect for peace and prosperity in the Pacific for
many years to come.'' But he also warned that China's WTO entry
would bring competition for Southeast Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of heightened tensions and a rivalry dating back
to its split from China 51 years ago, Taiwan also welcomed the
vote, saying it could eventually promote openness and democracy on
the communist-ruled Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the long run, it shall have a positive effect on Taiwan's
security,'' said government spokeswoman Chung Ching.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said permanent
trade rights would help ''create conditions for healthy and steady
development of China-U.S. relations,'' which she added would be
good for the whole region.
</P>
<P>
   The business community in China cheered the House vote as
heralding a new phase of reform. They predicted that under WTO,
China will need to revamp protected state industries to compete
with foreign firms and that, ultimately, needed legal reforms will
bring change to the communist government.
</P>
<P>
   ''For China, first of all, this will create more opportunities
to equally take part in the global economy. Even more importantly,
this will advance economic and political reforms in China,'' said
Mao Yushi, an economist with the private think-tank and consulting
firm Unirule.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 189; Nasdaq Down 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Weakness in blue-chip stocks threatened to
deflate the Nasdaq's budding recovery today. Jittery investors once
again moved money from one sector to another, fleeing the financial
sector after an analyst raised concerns about profits.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 188.82 at 10,346.53, its low
point for the session.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 5.50 to 3,265.11. In earlier
trading, the index had risen as much as 115.23 as investors snapped
up stocks that have fallen steeply in recent sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Other stock indicators had also turned lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 12.20 at 1,386.85.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in financial stocks undermined the market. Goldman
Sachs led a number of brokerage stocks lower after a Merrill Lynch
analyst said Goldman is likely to miss second-quarter earnings
estimates of $1.47 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerages have thrived in the past few quarters, pumped up by
heavy trading volume and a robust climate for initial public
offerings. But since the Nasdaq first tumbled from its March 10
peak, volume has slipped and the market for IPOs has dried up.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 5 11/16 to 74 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Dow component J.P. Morgan fell 4[ to 128{. Citigroup fell
2 9/16 to 58 13/16 after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its rating
on the stock to ''outperform'' from ''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was also hurt by Microsoft, which fell 3~ to 61 11/16.
On Wednesday, a day after a federal judge ordered the Justice
Department to revise its plan to break up the world's leading
computer software maker and submit the new version by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The order renewed expectations that Microsoft will be split into
two, or even three, parts. Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund told
clients a broken-up Microsoft would undoubtedly would be worth less
than a whole one.
</P>
<P>
   Without Microsoft, technology stocks proved unable to continue a
rebound that began Wednesday as investors started channeling money
into stocks that have tumbled in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were warning that any attempts to rally may be fragile,
because the interest rate worries that undermined technology stocks
in the first place are still haunting the market. Most market
watchers anticipate choppy trading for at least another week, with
no clear leadership from any one sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to follow through (on rallies),'' said Barry Hyman,
senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New York.
''If we don't, a single up day is meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   The market was little affected by the Commerce Department's
report that the U.S. economy, powered by brisk consumer and
government spending, grew at a robust 5.4 percent annual rate
during the first three months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation-wary investors were most interested in an inflation
gauge tied to the gross domestic product, which rose at an annual
rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter. The market had
anticipated a slightly bigger increase. Surging energy prices
accounted for most of the gain.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues overtook advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 752.26 million
shares, well behind Wednesday's brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.60 to 462.34.

<HEADLINE> Hijacking Suspect Parachutes Out  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A crying man tried to hijack a
Philippine Airlines jet carrying 291 people Thursday, then robbed
everyone and jumped out of the plane wearing a parachute.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacker moved from bathroom to bathroom toward the front of
the Airbus 330, complaining of a stomachache, finally reaching the
cockpit, where he announced the hijacking minutes before the
scheduled landing, passengers said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a grenade and a pistol, the man ordered the pilot of
PAL Flight PR812 to return to Davao City in the southern
Philippines. The pilot responded that he did not have enough fuel,
Manila airport general manager Antonio Gana said. Davao City is
about 600 miles from the capital, Manila.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the weeping and distraught hijacker fired a shot
inside the cockpit, perhaps accidentally, said Emmanuel Generoso,
one of the three pilots aboard, as tired-looking passengers
streamed off the plane behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very tense,'' Generoso said. ''I don't think there's
any political implications there. He had family problems, he needed
the money, so that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane was depressurized to permit the hijacker to jump with
a homemade parachute while it circled 28 miles from Manila at 6,000
feet, PAL spokesman Rolando Estabillo said. Police searched the
hilly area after he jumped.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking recalled the case of the legendary D.B. Cooper,
who took over a Northwest Orient Airlines flight on Nov. 24, 1971,
demanding $200,000. After getting the money, he parachuted from the
plane over Washington state. He hasn't been heard from since,
although $5,880 of his loot was found on the banks of the Columbia
River in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A rash of similar skyjackings followed, but the culprits were
caught.
</P>
<P>
   ''D.B. Cooper was the only one who was ever successful hijacking
and we don't even know if he survived,'' said Dan Poynter, author
of ''Parachuting: The Skydiver's Handbook.'' ''For somebody to go
out the side door of that aircraft, I just think he's probably a
skydiver and there aren't that many skydivers in the Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said the man collected all the money he could from
passengers before jumping.
</P>
<P>
   ''D.B. Cooper extorted money and this guy robbed the passengers,
which is an interesting twist,'' Poynter said. ''You can get the
money and get out quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   A flight attendant said she opened the door and even had to push
the man out. Mike Turoff, a commercial pilot in Houston and
co-author with Poynter, said the Airbus can slow down to below 200
mph but that is still more than twice the recommended speed for
skydiving.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you try to get out on your own, you really need a running
start,'' Turoff said. ''Pity this flight attendant that helped him.
Talk about being in mortal danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Generosa, said he doubted the man could have survived
the jump. Turoff said it's possible, even if the man used a
homemade parachute as reported. But Turoff added, ''whoever this
guy is, God, talk about dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet landed -- with the side door still open -- at the Manila
airport about 2{ hours after starting what should have been a
90-minute trip, and all 277 passengers and 13 crew left the plane
safely, PAL said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Selected for Lee Trial  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A veteran federal prosecutor of organized
crime and public corruption cases was selected Thursday to lead the
government's trial team against fired Los Alamos National
Laboratory scientist Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department announced that George A. Stamboulidis,
now in the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York's borough of
Brooklyn, will take over as chief prosecutor Tuesday. The trial is
set to begin Nov. 6 in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Last Dec. 10, Lee was charged with 59 counts of breaching lab
security. The prosecution contends Lee transferred 19 files from
secure to unsecured computers and downloaded some material to
computer tapes. Prosecutors have said the material included the top
secret ''crown jewels'' of American nuclear science.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee, who was a nuclear physicist in the weapons section
of the lab, has not been charged with espionage, prosecutors
contend he intended to aid a foreign government.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, requesting anonymity, have said he may have
planned to use the material to get a job in China or Taiwan if he
were laid off at Los Alamos, which was considering staff reductions
at the time he acted.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, could get life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Stamboulidis, now chief of Long Island offices for the U.S.
Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, won convictions
during the 1990s against notorious crime figures, including Vincent
Gigante, boss of the Genovese crime family, and more than two dozen
members of the Luchese, Colombo and Gambino crime families. He won
Justice Department awards in 1994, 1995 and 1999 for these
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   He also won convictions in prosecutions of public officials on
Long Island. Earlier this month, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh
commended him for convicting more than two dozen people in a
racketeering enterprise involving truck theft rings and extortion
by political party officials.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Justice Department in 1988 after clerking for U.S.
District Judge Louis Bechtle in Philadelphia. Born in Alabama,
Stamboulidis was graduated with honors from the State University of
New York-Stony Brook and Temple University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces Bob Gorence, the assistant U.S. attorney who
directed the high-profile investigation. Gorence remains on the
trial team.
</P>
<P>
   Until March, Gorence had been the top-ranking career prosecutor
in the Albuquerque U.S. attorney's office. He took charge of the
Lee case in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for the Justice Department to bring in a
veteran outside prosecutor for high-profile cases.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget Madonna, Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston.
Britney Spears has beaten them all.
</P>
<P>
   The teen pop star set a one-week sales record for a female
artist with her second album, ''Oops!...I Did It Again.'' In its
first week on the market, it sold 1.3 million copies, according to
Soundscan.
</P>
<P>
   It will make its debut at No. 1 on the Billboard charts, just
like her first album, ''...Baby One More Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears' ''Oops!'' is the second fastest-selling album ever. 'N
Snyc's ''No Strings Attached'' set a sales record of 2.4 million
copies in its first week on the market earlier this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The sales figures prove the utter dominance of teen pop in the
music marketplace. The disc with the third-highest one-week sales
was the Backstreet Boys' ''Millennium,'' which sold 1.1 million
copies.
</P>
<P>
   All three artists -- Spears, 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys --
are on the Jive Records label.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Carlos Santana has a hit album and a boatload
of Grammy awards. Now he's getting his own line of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis-based Brown Shoe Co., the maker of Buster Browns and
Naturalizers, announced Thursday it will produce the Carlos label

</P>
<P>
   The Carlos collection will feature multicultural influences and
will be sold in stores nationwide starting in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Meeting with Brown Shoe I realized they could connect with my

   NORVELT, Pa. (AP) -- The Red Hot Chili Peppers may have to find

</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Rock Town Fair -- sponsored by the maker of Rolling
Rock beer -- is scheduled at the Westmoreland County Fairgrounds
near Norvelt, about 40 miles east of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Hot Chili Peppers, whose songs include ''Higher

</P>
<P>
   But William Ober, a judge who owns 131 acres near the

court that he intends to sue.

<HEADLINE> Albright Satisfied With Explanation  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Thursday that she is ''satisfied'' with Russia's
explanation for the warm welcome Moscow gave a Yugoslav general
indicted for war crimes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov's sharp criticism of the
U.N. tribunal that indicted the general was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is doing what it has to do in a very difficult situation,''
Albright said at the end of a two-day NATO foreign ministers
meeting. ''I disagree with the foreign minister's assessment. I
very much support what the war crimes tribunal is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, Russia voted
to create the tribunal, based in The Hague, Netherlands, Albright
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is doing what we asked it to do,'' she said of the
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. resolutions require Russia to arrest war crimes suspects on
its soil. Instead, the Yugoslav defense minister, Gen. Dragoljub
Ojdanic, was a guest of the Russian Defense Ministry for five days
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   When the NATO foreign ministers demanded an explanation, Ivanov
blamed a ''technical hitch'' and said Wednesday that ''measures''
were being taken to see that it wouldn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm satisfied with his explanation,'' Albright said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ojdanic, like Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, has been
indicted by the war crimes tribunal on charges of war crimes in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov's presence at the Florence meeting, which included a
session of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council, marked Russia's
return to the NATO table after a yearlong hiatus provoked by the
alliance's air war against Yugoslavia over Kosovo. Moscow, which
bitterly opposed the NATO campaign, had suspended relations with
NATO on all but Balkans-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Permanent Joint Council was created in 1997 to provide a
forum for NATO-Russia consultations and ease their concerns about
enlargement of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, NATO also welcomed Croatia as the 27th member of
the Partnership for Peace program, which allows the Zagreb
government to participate in many of NATO's activities without
being a member of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big step on the road to democracy for the former
Yugoslav republic, which is just emerging from nine years under the
rule of the late President Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Croatia's new leaders deserve enormous credit for the steps
they have taken to bring their land closer to Europe's democratic
mainstream, and away from the extreme nationalism that has
sometimes plagued southeastern Europe,'' Albright said.

<HEADLINE> Oral Diseases Epidemic Among Poor  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Americans have healthier teeth than their
grandparents thanks to better dental care, but a ''silent
epidemic'' of oral diseases, from cavities to cancer, afflicts the
poor and minorities because of economic and social barriers to
getting care, the surgeon general says.
</P>
<P>
   David Satcher, the nation's top doctor, said Thursday that a new
report -- the government's first-ever comprehensive look at oral
health in America -- shows that Americans' teeth and mouths are in
the best shape ever. Yet ''profound disparities'' in oral health
exist, with many poor people and racial groups having untreated
oral diseases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have a problem,'' Satcher said at a news conference.
''Not all Americans are achieving better oral health.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans middle-aged or younger can expect to keep their
teeth for life, thanks to regular visits to the dentists, treating
cavities with fillings, drinking fluoridated water, smoking less
and having a better diet, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   But many poor people and minorities cannot afford to see
dentists and either cannot or do not make lifestyle changes that
would lower their risk of having oral diseases and tooth loss.
</P>
<P>
   While problems like tooth decay and cavities affect nearly
everyone, poor minorities are hit harder, said the report, an
amalgamation of clinical and epidemiological studies.
</P>
<P>
   One study cited in the report showed that nearly half of all
poor blacks and Hispanics had untreated tooth decay. By contrast,
about one-third of all Americans have untreated decay.
</P>
<P>
   Oral problems begin early: More than a third of low-income
children have at least one untreated decayed tooth by the time they
are 9 years old, compared with 17 percent of children living above
the poverty line, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity grows as children get older. Over 43 percent of
poor children have tooth decay by age 17 compared with 23 percent
of youngsters who are better off, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   Tooth problems often go unchecked because children lack
insurance coverage. Uninsured children are 2{ times less likely to
get dental checkups compared with children who have insurance,
Satcher noted.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 108 million Americans, including 26 million
children, have no insurance coverage for dental care.
</P>
<P>
   Even poor children who have dental insurance are not getting the
care they need, the report said. The government estimates that 80
percent of Medicaid eligible youngsters do not receive dental care
because few dentists take Medicaid patients and dental care is not
a priority for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a card but no care,'' said Burton Edelstein, a
pediatric dentist and director of the Children's' Dental Health
Project in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   American Dental Association officials said dentists have a good
track record for providing free and discounted care to needy
people, but said government needs to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ''State and federal agencies must step up to the plate to help
the dental profession deliver care to the maximum number of
Americans, in a sense by putting their money where the nation's
mouth is,'' said Richard F. Mascola, ADA president.
</P>
<P>
   The report also faulted communities for not having fluoridated
water -- which can prevent tooth decay. Some 144 million people
receive fluoridated water from public supplies. But with several
cities lacking fluoridated water -- the report cites San Diego,
Portland, Ore., Tucson, Ariz., and San Jose, Calif., among them --
over 100 million Americans do not benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The report calls for more screening for oral cancers and more
studies of dental health disparities, as well as anti-smoking and
water fluoridation projects in communities that don't have them.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it urges Americans to brush and floss daily.

<HEADLINE> Annan Blasts Senator's Fund Block  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sharply
criticized a U.S. senator Thursday for single-handedly blocking
funds for U.N. peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, challenged Sen.
Judd Gregg, R-N.H., to come up with peace plans of his own if he
disagrees with U.N. efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gregg placed a hold on $368 million owed by the
United States for U.N. peacekeeping in Congo, Kosovo, East Timor
and Sierra Leone. ''Let me say it is not helpful,'' Annan said of
Gregg's actions. Annan said he had no plans to meet with Gregg
during his visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg's spokesman, Edmund Amorosi, said the senator was issuing
no immediate statement in response to Annan's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Amorosi said the senator already had agreed to release $40
million for Kosovo and was discussing the other operations with
administration officials, Amorosi said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Senate subcommittee overseeing State
Department expenditures, Gregg used his power to block the funds
even though it was money already appropriated by Congress. Gregg
and other members of Congress heading foreign affairs committees
have the power to block any changes in State Department
expenditures, including foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Amorosi said Gregg has supported past funding for U.N.
peacekeeping but disagrees with how some U.N. policies are being
implemented, particularly in Sierra Leone where peacekeepers have
been taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg has said he would withhold the money at least until the
situation in Sierra Leone has changed. About 260 U.N. peacekeepers
are still being held hostage by rebels in the country, which has
been torn apart by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the U.N. is ''not in good financial shape,'' owing
hundreds of millions of dollars to member states that have provided
peacekeeping troops, and added that Gregg's move ''is only going to
make matters worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he feared Gregg's action also would block funds
intended to double the number of peacekeepers in Lebanon to 8,000.
The Clinton administration has said it would support U.N. efforts
to keep peace after Israel abruptly withdrew from Lebanon but will
not contribute American troops.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he expects to make a formal recommendation to send
additional peacekeepers to Lebanon ''within days'' and expects the
troops to be in the region ''within weeks.'' He said he is awaiting
formal confirmation of a complete Israeli withdrawal from U.N.
emissaries in the region.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. Interim Force of about 4,500 has been in southern Lebanon
since 1978, just north of the border security zone Israel gave up
in the pullout. Annan indicated plans to increase the force after
Israel announced plans to withdraw by July. The withdrawal was
accelerated this week when pro-Israel Lebanese rebels surrendered
and fled, and Israeli soldiers departed the region ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a commencement address at Johns Hopkins University's
international studies school, Annan proposed a tougher approach to
U.N. peacekeeping in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where a peace agreement is signed but one or more of the
parties are tempted to violate it, the U.N. needs a credible and
robust presence in order to deter and discourage potential
violators,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers cannot be expected only to ''keep peace
between angels,'' he said, saying combatants in modern wars are
often ''warlords and militia leaders whose only aim is power and
personal enrichment.'' He said the threat of international
isolation may have no meaning for people like Sierra Leone rebel
leader Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to consider some of the most basic assumptions about
neutrality, the good faith of the parties and the non-use of force
that were the basis of the successful operations of the Cold War
era,'' Annan said. He said future U.N. peacekeepers need ''robust
mandates'' and the willingness of richer countries to provide
first-rate military and logistical support.

<HEADLINE> Without comment Senate unanimously approves Supreme Court nominee  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The Senate Thursday unanimously approved a
former attorney general to become Gov. Christie Whitman's sixth
nominee to the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat James R. Zazzali of Rumson was confirmed in a 25-0
vote. He replaces Associate Justice Daniel O'Hern, who reached the
mandatory retirement age of 70 on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali will join Chief Justice Deborah Poritz and Associate
Justice Peter G. Verniero, all former attorneys general nominated
by Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant prosecutor when former Gov. Brendan Byrne was the
Essex County prosecutor, Byrne later named Zazzali his attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali was not present Thursday for the Senate vote. Lawmakers
approved the nomination without a word of comment from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali faced only brief questioning from senators earlier this
week at a committee hearing on issues, including the role of the
judiciary and the needs of the court system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I keenly believe the Legislature is the voice of the people,
and the judges and the justices should recognize that,'' Zazzali
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali served as attorney general for 10 months at the end of
former Gov. Byrne's term in 1981 and 1982. He also served as
general counsel to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority
under Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali, who turns 63 on June 17, is the oldest person Whitman
has nominated. Although all Supreme Court justices must be
confirmed for lifetime tenure by the Senate after seven years, this
will not be an issue for Zazzali since he will hit mandatory
retirement in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the chief justice, the six associate justices are
supposed to be evenly split, three Republicans and three Democrats.
Because O'Hern is a Democrat, tradition holds that he be replaced
with someone from the same party.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali was a commissioner on the State Commission of
Investigation from 1984 to 1994, including a period as chairman.
The SCI is an independent office created by the Legislature to
examine and issue written reports on corruption and policy
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman last year named Zazzali to a search committee to find
candidates for state police superintendent. He also headed a
coalition of six former state attorneys general who supported
former Attorney General Peter Verniero's hotly contested nomination
to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali, of Rumson, is a partner in the Newark law firm Zazzali,
Zazzali, Fagella &AMP; Nowak with his brother, Andrew Zazzali. He
graduated from Georgetown University in 1958 and earned a law
degree there in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's other appointments to the high court are associate
justices Virginia Long, Jaynee LaVecchia and James Coleman.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Cracks Down on Students  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Fearing a student uprising,
Yugoslavia ordered all universities Thursday to end the spring
semester a week early and banned campus gatherings across Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The students had called a major rally for Friday to protest a
government crackdown against critics, opponents and the independent
media.
</P>
<P>
   In an order signed by the Serbian education minister, all
universities in the dominant Yugoslav republic were ordered to
finish classes on Friday, a week early, the independent Beta news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be no gatherings or manifestations'' on university
campuses after Friday, the decree said.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown came after weeks of daily opposition protests
heavily supported by university students in Serbia's largest cities
against the government of President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Marija Bogdanovic, a former dean of Belgrade University and
dissident philosophy professor, said the move aimed at ''thwarting
the planned strike'' at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Although the order ended classes Friday, it allowed final exams
to be held as scheduled in June, but banned students from campus
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this decision, the Serbian universities have become
forbidden zones,'' said a statement by the opposition Democratic
Party of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''This draconian decision has destroyed the autonomy of the
universities, and their deans were given a role to defend the
regime, instead of defending classes, students and the science,''
it said.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred university students held a brief protest in the
center of Belgrade, blocking traffic and pledging a massive turnout
for the protest on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Nis, Serbia's third largest city, about 2,000 university
students marched toward the police station before being stopped by
police, who ordered them to disband.
</P>
<P>
   Later in Belgrade, about 2,000 people gathered for a rally for
the ninth straight day to protest the government takeover of the
capital's independent radio and television stations.
</P>
<P>
   With daily street protests continuing in Serbia's largest
cities, the government has accused the student group Otpor, or
Resistance, of treason and links with the Western powers that
bombed Yugoslavia for 78 days last spring.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, masked men attacked Belgrade University students in
a downtown building and broke up a sit-in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Protesting the attack, 15 professors of the Drama Arts faculty
announced Thursday they were going on strike and won't hold classes
or exams.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are serious indications that those who beat up students
are under the patronage of certain political parties,'' the
professors said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Home Might Be Where Reno's Heart Is  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After seven stormy years here, Janet Reno
would rather return home to Florida than take a seat on the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a news conference
he would like to see Reno on the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that at her weekly news conference Thursday, Reno
replied, ''I was touched that Senator Schumer said that, but I
think I want to go home.'' Reno, who will turn 62 on July 21, has
joked for some time that she would like to travel cross-country in
a camper after leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   The second-longest-serving attorney general in U.S. history,
Reno took office in 1993 after 15 years as an elected state
prosecutor in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a deadly FBI tear gas assault on a religious
compound near Waco, Texas, during her first month, Reno has been
immersed for almost her entire tenure in controversial cases,
including the long-running campaign finance investigation and, most
recently, the Elian Gonzalez affair.
</P>

served from 1817 into 1829 under Presidents James Monroe and John
Q. Adams.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Identify Killer Virus  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A virus that killed 106 people in outbreaks
during 1998 and 1999 in Malaysia and Singapore has been identified
as a new viral species capable of infecting both animals and
humans.
</P>
<P>
   A study appearing Friday in the journal Science said the virus
has been named Nipah and researchers said it is closely related to
another new virus called Hendra.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two viruses represent a new genus within the
family of viruses known as Paramyxoviridae, said co-author Dr.
William J. Bellini of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other members of the virus family, which generally infect
only one type of animal, Nipah and Hendra are capable of infecting
a variety of animals -- dogs, cats, pigs, bats, horses and humans.
Most animals recover from the virus, but it is lethal to about 40
percent of human patients, causing severe encephalitis, said
Bellini.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the virus can be spread to humans from the
urine and mucus of infected animals. It causes respiratory symptoms
in pigs and the animals can expel the virus in their cough. Bellini
said that tropical fruit bats appear to be unharmed by the virus,
but they are carriers and may possibly spread it.
</P>
<P>
   Medical sleuths started investigating the virus after patients
developed illnesses in Malaysia in 1998 and later, in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The illness was first diagnosed as Japanese encephalitis, but
further study showed it was not linked to mosquitos and that most
patients were adults workers who handled pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The Singapore outbreak ended when pig imports from Malaysia were
halted. The disease was stopped in Malaysia after more than a
million pigs in the infected area were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   There were 11 cases in Singapore and one death, and 265 cases in
Malaysia and 105 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Bellini said that health care workers are now alerted to the
risks of the virus, but he said it does not represent a major
worldwide health threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far as global risk is concerned,'' he said, ''it is a minor
player.''

<HEADLINE> House Repeals Phone Tax  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted overwhelmingly Thursday to
repeal a federal telephone tax originally passed to finance the
Spanish-American War, when telephones were a newfangled luxury
enjoyed by fewer than 1,500 wealthy households.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling another vintage tax Thursday, the House Ways and Means
Committee approved a bill to gradually phase out inheritance taxes,
which date to 1916. That bill is expected to reach the House floor
in early June.
</P>
<P>
   With the 3 percent telephone excise tax now affecting an
estimated 252 million telephone lines -- including those connected
to cellular phones, fax machines and computer modems -- Democrats
and Republicans jockeying to be viewed as technology-friendly
agreed it was time to use a portion of the projected budget surplus
to scrap it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Spanish-American War is history,'' said House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ''The Spanish-American War tax ought to be
history as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 420-2 to do away with the telephone tax in three
equal steps, with full repeal coming Oct. 1, 2002. Reps. Fortney
''Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., and John Murtha, D-Pa., voted against the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would reduce government revenue by about $20
billion over five years, next moves to the Senate, where Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., and other sponsors said they were encouraged by the
strong House vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''This telephone tax serves no specific purpose,'' Breaux said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supports the concept of repeal but
has expressed reservations about its cost. President Clinton,
however, has stopped short of threatening a veto.
</P>
<P>
   A person who spends $69 a month on both local and long-distance
calls -- the average for residential service according to one
consumer survey -- pays $24 a year to the Treasury under this tax.
If that person also has a $30 monthly wireless bill, the total tax
is $34 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The original 1-cent telephone tax imposed in 1898 was repealed
in 1902, brought back to pay for World War I, repealed again in
1924 and then resurrected during the Depression in 1932. The tax
rate has gone up and down over the years, been targeted for
phase-out and then made permanent in 1990 to help reduce the budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a classic example of a tax in Washington that just won't
go away,'' said Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republican-led Congress has made tax cuts of all
kinds a priority this election year, the phone tax repeal gained
bipartisan popularity because it was seen as a modest way to
overcome part of the ''digital divide'' that hinders lower-income
people from gaining access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't finance any war, but it could be an impediment in
our battle to provide universal access to the Internet,'' said
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote was the latest in a series of tax cuts pushed by
House Republican leaders, who are pursuing a piecemeal approach
that frequently puts Democrats in a difficult political position.
It was easier for Clinton and the Democrats to oppose last year's
huge $792 billion tax cut, which the president vetoed, because
opponents were able to hammer away at the high cost.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of this year's major tax cuts have passed the
Senate, but House Republicans say they're accomplishing their main
election-year purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have a lot of good things to talk to our
constituents about,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax bill would gradually repeal inheritance taxes by
2010. The bill has 240 co-sponsors including 45 Democrats, but
Clinton is promising a veto because it would cost $104 billion over
the phase-out period and some $50 billion a year after that.
Estates under $675,000 are already exempt this year.
</P>
<P>
   That high cost would jeopardize critical government spending and
threaten efforts to ensure that Social Security and Medicare gain
sound financial footing, opponents said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't just disregard our obligations,'' said Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors said estate taxes frequently force family farms and
small businesses to be sold or split up by heirs,
disproportionately affecting minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what we're talking about when we talk about liquidating
small farms and businesses,'' said Rep. John Tanner, D-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said small businesses and farms already get
special treatment under estate tax law. They pointed out that half
of the $27 billion in estate taxes projected for this year will be
paid by estates above $5 million, the wealthiest 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The telephone tax repeal bill is H.R. 3916.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax repeal bill is H.R. 8.

<HEADLINE> Workers Inhaled Uranium for Years  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Workers at a government uranium-processing
plant in southern Ohio routinely inhaled uranium dust, arsenic and
other poisons for decades because supervisors did not require them
to wear respirators, the Energy Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the second of a series of reports on worker exposure both now
and during the Cold War years, when safety standards were lower,
the department documented worker exposure to plutonium-laced
uranium, asbestos and an array of chemicals at the Portsmouth
Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we may have a huge national problem on our hands,''
said Rep. Ted Strickland, a Democrat whose district includes the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   He and other lawmakers said the report would buttress efforts to
get Congress to approve compensation for workers whose health was
ruined by exposure to contamination at Piketon and other government
weapons plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gives us ammunition to go to our colleagues and say the
federal government messed up. The federal government was negligent.
The federal government hurt people,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine,
R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson wants to give lifetime health
coverage or $100,000 to every weapons-plant worker who contracted
beryllium disease or radiation-caused cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers representing the stricken workers want to make that at
least $200,000 and also include workers harmed by chemical
contamination. But they've had little luck convincing their
colleagues to authorize what essentially would be a blank check for
an unknown number of victims.	   In the first investigation of its type, at the
Paducah Gaseous
Diffusion Plant in Kentucky, the department found workers were
exposed to high levels of radiation and chemical contamination, and
found the potential for a serious accident involving radioactive
materials.
</P>
<P>
   There was no similar finding of a potential ''criticality
accident'' at Paducah's sister plant in Ohio, said Assistant Energy
Secretary David Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also documented significant lingering
contamination of the water and ground outside the Paducah plant but
only onsite contamination at Portsmouth, Michaels said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigative team already is at work on its third probe, at
the nation's only other gaseous diffusion plant, in Oak Ridge,
Tenn. Michaels said no similar examinations of past practices were
planned for other segments of the nuclear weapons complex.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited shortcomings with Portsmouth's current safety
program but said there was no immediate risk to workers or the
public.

<HEADLINE> Ex-INS Espionage Case Goes to Jury  </HEADLINE>
By MEG RICHARDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A jury began deliberating Thursday in the case of a
senior U.S. immigration official accused of espionage for passing
secret information to a friend who had contacts in the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Mariano Faget, 54, went to the jury after a
federal prosecutor called Mariano ''a government employee willing
to betray the trust of people he was sworn to serve,'' while the
defense called him ''an honest government servant who made a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Faget, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Cuba, could get 10 years
in prison if convicted of charges including violating the Espionage
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Curtis Miner told the jury that investigators set a
trap for Faget to see what he would do with classified information:
They planted a phony story that a certain Cuban offficial planned
to defect.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was almost immediately caught on tape telling his friend
and business partner Pedro Font over the phone about the impending
defection. At the time, Font was about to meet with a Cuban
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Faget testified that he tipped off his friend because he feared
Font would be harmed if Cuban officials thought Font was involved
with the defection.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Edward O'Donnell told the jury: ''This is an
honest government servant who made a mistake, but he did not
violate the law. ''It was never his intent to hurt this country ...
his intent was to warn his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor ridiculed Faget's assertion that he didn't
think telling Font about the defection would hurt national
security.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took it out of the realm of control of the United States
government and gave it to someone else, to use however they
wanted,'' Miner said.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was close to retirement after 34 years with the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.

<HEADLINE> Critics Say Snowmobile Ban 'Crazy'  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional critics attacked the National
Park Service plan to ban snowmobiles from most parks, calling the
move an unjustified attempt to please environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is crazy what they're trying to do here,'' Rep.
Collin Peterson, D-Minn., said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The park service announced last month it was banning nearly all
snowmobile traffic in 25 national parks, recreation areas and other
agency lands. Conservationists estimated about 180,000 snowmobilers
used park service land last year.
</P>
<P>
   Separate hearings before House Resources and Senate Natural
Resources subcommittees gave snowmobilers a chance to vent their
anger and lawmakers a chance to grill the Interior Department
official who announced the ban.
</P>
<P>
   That official, Assistant Interior Secretary Donald Barry, stood
his ground. Barry said the ban merely enforces regulations the Park
Service had not been following and will protect federal land from
pollution and other damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about closure of national parks to the American
public. This is about restricting a form of access to national
parks,'' Barry said. He compared the ban to rules preventing
motorcyclists from riding up the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Twomey, president of snowmobile-maker Arctic Cat, said
Barry maligned the industry last month when he called snowmobiles
''noisy, antiquated machines that are no longer welcome in our
national parks.'' Twomey said manufacturers have been making
cleaner, quieter machines in response to customer demands.
</P>
<P>
   Twomey said the snowmobile business generates $6 billion a year
and is responsible for 65,000 jobs, including 10,000 in snowmobile
manufacturing. Surveys show snowmobilers are mostly middle-class
families who enjoy the outdoors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're mad because our access has now been denied to our
national parks,'' added Bill Manson of the American Council of
Snowmobile Associations. ''Mr. Barry has painted us to be an
antiquated bunch of wild people.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban does not apply to parks in Alaska and Voyageurs National
Park in Minnesota because Congress specifically allowed snowmobile
use in those parks. It also does not apply to the Yellowstone and
Grand Teton parks in northwestern Wyoming because the park service
is considering a separate ban for them.
</P>
<P>
   The snowmobile ban is one of a series of moves by federal land
management agencies to restrict motorized traffic in national
parks. In March, new restrictions were outlined to limit the use of

are under way to limit private automobile traffic to reduce

<HEADLINE> Former E. German Police Chief Dies  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Erich Mielke, who headed former communist East
Germany's dreaded secret police and spy agency for three decades,
has died at 92, a Berlin city official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Berliner Kurier, in a report to appear in its
Friday edition, said Mielke died Monday at a Berlin home for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the Berlin registrar's office confirmed that
Mielke's death had been reported to the agency, but he could not
say when he died. The official, who spoke by telephone, refused to
give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Mielke, one of the most hated men in East Germany, headed the
Ministry of State Security, known as the Stasi, that snooped on
citizens to suppress dissent against the communist regime and
placed thousands of agents abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The all-pervasive network included 85,000 full-time domestic
spies and 170,000 voluntary informers. The Stasi archive kept tabs
on several million people.
</P>
<P>
   Once the regime's No. 2 man, the ailing Mielke had recently
lived a secluded life in eastern Berlin, reportedly on a monthly
pension of about $465.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong communist who fled Germany in the 1930s to escape the
Nazis, Mielke was jailed shortly after the collapse of East Germany
and unification in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A Berlin court convicted him in 1993 for involvement as a young
communist street fighter in the murders of two Berlin policemen on
Aug. 9, 1931. He was released in 1995 after serving two-thirds of
his six-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But he escaped prosecution for his 1957-89 leadership of the
Stasi, including charges related to shooting deaths at the Berlin
Wall, because of poor health and senility.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Berlin on Dec. 28, 1907, Mielke joined a communist youth
group in 1921. He became a full member in 1925 and worked as a
reporter for the party's newspaper, ''Red Flag.''
</P>
<P>
   He became a member of the party's paramilitary force, leading to
his participation in the August 1931 demonstration in Berlin during
which the two policemen were shot and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Wanted for the killings, Mielke escaped to Belgium using
identification from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Mielke went on to the Soviet Union and attended the elite
International Lenin School in Moscow in the mid-1930s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, he served in the International Brigade that fought in
the Spanish Civil War against Gen. Francisco Franco, whose forces
triumphed and set up a fascist dictatorship. Mielke was interned
for a time in France, along with other brigade members.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, Mielke returned to the Soviet Union and then to
Soviet-occupied eastern Germany in 1945. He helped organize police
in the Soviet-occupied zone and became deputy chief of state
security when East Germany was founded in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   He took over as minister in 1957, a post he held until the
Stalinist regime collapsed at the time the Berlin Wall fell in
November 1989. Stasi offices across East Germany were stormed by
citizens during the peaceful democratic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mielke went on trial for shootings at the Wall along with East
Germany's last Stalinist leader, Erich Honecker, in 1992. But he
was dropped from the case because he was also on trial for the
police slayings, and was later declared too senile to follow the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Honecker was also dropped for reasons of health and died in
exile in Chile of liver cancer in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mielke resided with his wife in eastern Berlin until March, when
he was admitted to a home for the elderly where his son works as a
medic. His wife, Gertrude, reportedly could no longer care for her
badly disabled husband.
</P>
<P>
   Berliner Kurier reported that Mielke was to be buried June 10 at
an eastern Berlin cemetery.

<HEADLINE> Defense begins presenting its case in Peeler trial  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Lawyers for the man accused of ordering
the murder of 8-year-old Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother
began his defense Thursday by attempting to cast doubt on the
prosecution's timeline for the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler is charged with capital felony. He's accused of
having his brother Adrian kill B.J. and Karen Clarke, to stop the
boy from testifying against Russell in a 1998 murder. B.J. was
expected to be a key witness in Peeler's trial in the barber shop
slaying of Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The boy and his mother were gunned down in their Bridgeport home
on Jan. 7, 1999, several months before Peeler's trial in the Snead
killing was to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that they were killed at or just before 6
p.m. as they returned home from grocery shopping.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, Peeler's defense lawyers called a neighbor who
said he heard gunshots between 6:20 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Riley, a retired Norwalk police officer who lived around
the corner from Clarke and her son, said he was walking down his
driveway when he heard five or six gunshots. The first two shots,
he said, were very loud and clear, and sounded like they were
outside. Riley said after a four or five-second pause, he heard
three more shots. These shots were muffled and sounded like they
came from inside a house or car, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he did not call the police to report the shots. The
next day, after the bodies were discovered, Riley said he relayed
what he had heard to a female police officer he saw near the crime
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Jonathan Benedict tried to show that Riley was not
sure of the time he heard the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would it be fair to say you can't give us an exact time?''
Benedict asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' replied Riley.
</P>
<P>
   A precise timeline is important to prosecutors because they
claim Adrian Peeler left the murder scene and arrived at the
Comfort Inn in Milford sometime between 6:15 p.m. and 6:35 p.m. A
police officer testified earlier that it takes about 15 minutes to
drive from the murder scene to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   If the murders were committed later, as the defense maintains,
that would mean Adrian Peeler would not have had time to do the
killings, then drive to the hotel and arrive by 6:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to resume Tuesday. The defense plans to
call at least another four witnesses before wrapping up its case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge G. Sarsfield Ford said he expects the lawyers to give
closing arguments Wednesday. Deliberations are expected to begin
Friday after the judge instructs the jury on the law.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Peeler is to be tried once his brother's trial is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers face the possibility of the death penalty if
convicted.

<HEADLINE> Bill on using census data to draw legislative districts delayed  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- After a plea for more time by Democrats,
the Assembly's ranking Republican postponed voting on a bill that
would force the state to use only the actual head count when
drawing legislative districts after the census this year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans back the measure, but Democrats and other opponents
contend that method leaves out minorities, recent immigrants and
city residents from census figures.
</P>
<P>
   The bill cleared the Assembly's State Government Committee
Monday by a 3-2 vote along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Assembly Democratic Leader Joseph V. Doria Jr.,
D-Hudson, asked for more time.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the minority leader speaks, I listen. That bill will not
be voted on today,'' said Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he agreed with Doria that residents and legislators
need time to digest the census data when it is produced.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're willing to do that for a while,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   In asking for the delay, Doria said the public is just becoming
aware of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shouldn't we let this process of public opinion fully unfold
before rushing this bill on the Assembly floor? Shouldn't this be a
time to slow down the process,'' Doria said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker would not say when a vote would be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure it will be done soon, but not today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Apportionment Commission is required to use the
numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau to draw district boundaries for
state and federal representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Census Bureau will give the state two results. One will
be the actual head count of residents who answered the census. The
other is an estimate based on that data and statistical models.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that sampling-enhanced numbers
cannot be used in deciding the number of congressional
representatives from each state. Left unspecified was whether
sample-adjusted numbers could be used to allocate federal funds or
to draw boundaries for congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   States will have the option of using either adjusted or raw
census data to redraw the congressional and state legislative
district boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bill sponsor, Assemblyman Michael P. Carroll, R-Morris, says New
Jersey's small towns and cities make it easier for census workers
to actually count residents. Using estimates would force the
redistricting commission to guess where people are living, Carroll
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll and other supporters said the state would be free to use
estimates when applying for federal funding.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 211; Nasdaq Off 65  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nervous investors turned against the financial
sector Thursday, sending shares in Wall Street's largest investment
firms sharply lower on fears that the stock market's continuing
weakness will hurt their profits.
</P>
<P>
   The decline ended a nascent recovery in the technology sector
and stifled hopes that Wednesday's rally signaled a reversal of the
pessimism that has driven the market lower in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 211.43 to close at
10,323.92.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 65.26 to 3,205.35. In earlier
trading, the index rose as much as 115.23 as investors went on a
brief bargain-hunting spree.
</P>
<P>
   Other stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
dropped 17.53 to 1,381.52.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks plummeted after a Merrill Lynch analyst said
Goldman Sachs is likely to miss second-quarter earnings estimates
of $1.47 per share. Merrill's Judah Kraushaar, who has long held
the less optimistic view of $1.36 a share, said guidance from
Goldman officials has convinced him that the firm will miss the
$1.47 target.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerages have thrived in the past few quarters, pumped up by
heavy trading volume and a robust climate for initial public
offerings. But since the Nasdaq first tumbled from its March 10
peak, volume has slipped and the market for IPOs has dried up.
</P>
<P>
   Kraushaar's warning reminded investors that the market's recent
weakness will indeed affect the profits of investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 7 to 73. Dow component J.P. Morgan
fell 3| to 129. Merrill Lynch fell 5 13/16 to 94 5/16 and Lehman
Brothers fell 5 3/16 to 72{.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shouldn't come as a surprise, especially in light of the
anemic volume we've been seeing,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market
analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ''But it's always someone's turn to go
to the woodshed, and the financials are the sector du jour.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was also hurt by Microsoft, which fell 4 1/16 to 61{. On
Wednesday, a federal judge ordered the Justice Department to revise
its plan to break up the world's leading computer software maker
and submit the new version by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The order renewed expectations that Microsoft will be split into
two, or even three, parts. Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund told
clients a broken-up Microsoft would undoubtedly would be worth less
than the company as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Without Microsoft, technology stocks proved unable to continue a
rebound that began Wednesday as investors started channeling money
into stocks that have tumbled in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks like Cisco, which were higher for much of the session,
ended modestly lower. Cisco fell | to 54{
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe that attempts to rally in the coming weeks may
be fragile, because the interest rate worries that undermined
technology stocks in the first place are still haunting the market.
Most market watchers anticipate choppy trading for at least another
week, with no clear leadership from any one sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to follow through (on rallies),'' said Barry Hyman,
senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New York.
''If we don't, a single up day is meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   The market was little affected by the Commerce Department's
report that the U.S. economy, powered by brisk consumer and
government spending, grew at a robust 5.4 percent annual rate
during the first three months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation-wary investors were most interested in an inflation
gauge tied to the gross domestic product, which rose at an annual
rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter. The market had
anticipated a slightly bigger increase.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report convinced no one on Wall Street that the
Federal Reserve has reached the end of its cycle of interest rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first quarter is old news and will have no bearing on the
Fed's next move,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill
Lynch. Steinberg expects the Fed to raise interest rates at its
June meeting, and possibly once more after that.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.17
billion shares, compared with 1.37 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Volume is expected to taper off on Friday in advance of the
Memorial Day long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.58 to 456.17.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.3 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 2.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
gained 1.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> CIA Scolds 6 in Security Breach   </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three current and three former senior CIA
officials, including former general counsel Michael O'Neill, have
been reprimanded or otherwise rebuked for their roles in an
investigation into former CIA Director John Deutch's home computer
security breaches, the CIA said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The actions against the six, administered this week by Air Force
Gen. John A. Gordon, the agency's deputy director, followed a
sharply critical report of the CIA's behavior by a presidential
advisory panel.
</P>
<P>
   The actions did not include a reprimand of CIA Director George
Tenet, who has also come under criticism, said CIA spokesman Bill
Harlow.
</P>
<P>
   However, Harlow said that Tenet recently met with President
Clinton on the matter. ''During that conversation, the director
acknowledged that he shared in the responsibility for shortcomings
identified in the report,'' Harlow said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch has admitted violating security rules by processing
classified documents on several home computers that had Internet
access through an America Online account, one that was also used by
other family members.
</P>
<P>
   His laxness was discovered after he left the CIA in December
1996. However, no action was taken against him until last August
when Tenet stripped him of his security clearances.
</P>
<P>
   Both Deutch's conduct and the CIA's follow-up probe are being
reviewed by the Justice Department's Criminal Division.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's statement, the agency conceded that the Justice
Department and congressional oversight panels should have been
notified sooner, and that ''more aggressive damage control efforts,
such as the immediate removal of the unclassified computers used by
Mr. Deutch, should have been initiated.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA statement said that three officials involved in the
follow-up investigation, including one still at the agency, were
''formally reprimanded in writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon ''formally admonished in writing'' two others, one of
them still at the agency; and ''orally admonished'' still another
who is still at the agency, the CIA said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA declined to identify any of the six, citing ''reasons of
personal privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But intelligence and congressional officials familiar with the
case who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that O'Neil, the
former general counsel, and former Executive Director Nora Slatkin
were among those receiving formal written reprimands -- the sharpest
category of criticism of the six individuals involved.
</P>
<P>
   Also among those to receive either reprimands or admonishments,
the officials said, were the agency's former inspector general,
Frederick Hitz, and Richard Calder, currently the deputy director
for administration.
</P>
<P>
   The other two names could not be immediately determined.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Spaeder, O'Neil's lawyer, confirmed that his client had
received a written reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sincerely regret and vigorously disagree with General
Gordon's decision to reprimand Mr. O'Neil in connection with the
Deutch matter,'' Spaeder said. ''While working at the CIA, Mr.
O'Neil at all times conducted himself with the best interests of
the agency in mind and in complete good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil declined to testify before the Senate Intelligence
Committee, citing Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil, a Washington lawyer, left the CIA in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential advisory panel chaired by former Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., this month criticized the CIA's internal
investigation of security violations by Deutch, faulting Tenet in
particular as well as other high-ranking officials for failing to
aggressively pursue the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Rudman report was classified, but those familiar with it
said it followed conclusions of a CIA inspector general's report,
later declassified, which accused O'Neil and Slatkin of fumbling
and delaying the CIA's initial investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports criticized the CIA for not reporting the home
computer security violations to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet removed himself from any further handling of the inquiry,
because of his own involvement, and turned matters over to Gordon,
the No. 2 man at the agency, to determine whether disciplinary
actions were warranted.
</P>
<P>
   The six reprimands-admonishments follow Gordon's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
who got a private briefing from Gordon this week, called the
reprimands ''a mild, if not weak, gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ''if anybody else had done this besides senior CIA
officials, they would have received much harsher punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his panel continues to investigate the matter, as does
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of us on the committee are still troubled by the whole
episode, especially the large volume mishandled classified
documents,'' Shelby said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Harlow, the CIA spokesman, said the agency planned no further
disciplinary actions, although it had taken ''steps to strengthen
and clarify agency procedures'' to better safeguard computer files
and to make sure suspected violations are reported more quickly.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Fed Prober Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former Commerce Department inspector general
pleaded guilty Thursday to a criminal conflict of interest over his
supervision of a government contract held by a company he was
negotiating to go to work for.
</P>
<P>
   In a plea bargain with the Justice Department, Francis DeGeorge
pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count before U.S. Magistrate
Judge Alan Kay. No date was set for sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   DeGeorge served as Commerce inspector general from April 1988 to
January 1998, with responsibility for ferreting out waste and
corruption within the department.
</P>
<P>
   The government said that as part of his job, he oversaw and made
recommendations about a contract held by Litton-PRC Inc., a
Virginia-based information technology company. The contract called
for updating the automated systems of the National Weather Service,
which is part of the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government said, DeGeorge met with the
president of the company and other company employees to negotiate
his prospective employment there. DeGeorge's negotiations with the
company over a job occurred between November 1995 and July 1996,
the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not say that DeGeorge's conduct influenced
any Commerce decisions about the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum penalty under federal conflict-of-interest law would
be up to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine. The government
agreed to recommend some leniency based upon his acceptance of
responsibility. It also agreed not to oppose DeGeorge's request
that he be sentenced to up to five years probation. The government
said it would take no position on a fine for him.

<HEADLINE> Whitman wants full power to control Camden  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman wants the power to
assume absolute control of Camden city government in her ''hip
pocket'' if the state's strict supervision of municipal finances
fails.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman administration would need special legislation to
allow the full takeover. Officials have been preparing for that
since before the supervision began May 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason that we're moving forward is not because I want the
state takeover, but because I'm afraid because of the past track
record, that without that authority in our hip pocket, that we
won't get that kind of cooperation we need out of some of the local
officials,'' Whitman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference, Whitman said she needs to have
the power available now instead of waiting to see if the state
management team says it is needed later.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really to have as a final tool to put this city on the
right track,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Camden residents need to know that the state will do everything
it can to revitalize the city, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's also a level of expectation that I'm concerned about,
that the people of Camden have, that supervision allows them to do
more than it does allow them to do,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials contend that Camden Mayor Milton Milan's
administration repeatedly ignored warnings to correct faulty
financial practices. The city does not keep proper records,
including a general ledger and an account of city payouts as
required by law, according to the state.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10, the state Local Finance Board gave state officials
the ability to approve all city spending, contracts and collective
bargaining agreements. State supervisors can limit debt, authorize
any refinancing and hire and fire non-Civil Service employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Division of Community Affairs started developing the
legislation as it began supervising city financial operations, said
Tom Damm, a spokesman for Commissioner Jane Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   ''Supervision is largely confined to financial matters. We are
pursuing legislation that would give us the tools to rehabilitate
the actual operations of government,'' Damm said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, said he would probably
support a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the administration comes to me with a plan, then I think we
have to strongly consider it,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union, wants to review
what the governor is proposing before making any comment, said
spokeswoman Rae Hutton.
</P>
<P>
   Officials announced Tuesday that Sylvester Murray, a director at
Cleveland State University's urban public management program, will
act as an adviser to the state management team.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, a former city manager in San Diego, Ann Arbor, Mich.,
and Cincinnati, is an elected fellow with the National Academy of
Public Administrators, a Washington D.C., nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   The state will pay the organization up to $500,000 for six
months of advice.
</P>
<P>
   The first public step in the state's control of Camden came the
day after Milan was charged in an indictment with extortion, money
laundering and mail fraud. Federal authorities said Milan accepted
payoffs and gifts from city contractors and took bribes from
organized crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   The state gave Milan two weeks to correct long-standing
problems. The state finance board said he didn't and on April 14
voted to place the city under supervision. That prompted the state
Attorney General's Office to file a lawsuit that asked a judge to
approve the control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Milan threatened to place the city in bankruptcy last year
before he accepted a deal to allow a state financial review board
some oversight of operations. But despite that monitoring, the
state alleges, Camden officials continued to ignore the problems.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the state said Camden filed annual audits more
than two years after they were due. When the audits were filed,
some contained a notice from the auditor that the examinations
could not be done because Camden kept no records of its
expenditures. Camden also overspent its budget by nearly $500,000
in 1998, according to the state's legal brief.

<HEADLINE> Group says state could save $96 million on prisons  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state spends $96 million a year on
''unnecessary and sometimes counterproductive'' imprisonment, a
fiscal watchdog group reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By expanding shock camps, drug treatment, electronically
monitored house arrests and an agency to evaluate prison policies,
the Department of Correctional Services could trim 4 percent from
its $2.3 billion on prisons, the Citizens Budget Commission said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to say you can run the prison system smarter by
offering alternatives,'' said spokesman Charles Brecher.
</P>
<P>
   The group estimated that savings could come from the following
areas:
</P>
<P>
   --$65 million if nonviolent drug offenders were eligible for
prison alternatives like drug treatment or shock camp after one
year. Many are in prisons at least two years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   --$20 million if electronically monitored house arrests were
substituted for prison for the last six months of sentencing for
nonviolent property crimes like trespassing, burglary without
intent to harm and cemetery desecration.
</P>
<P>
   --$11 million by releasing violent offenders who are paroled two
months earlier and employing electronically monitored house arrest
and stricter parole supervision. Citizens Budget Commission also
said this could improve public safety.
</P>
<P>
   The group also said inmates 50 years or older may be good
candidates for alternate sanctions like home confinement or
intensive parole since studies suggest criminal activity declines
with age.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Budget Commission admitted its cost calculations
are ''necessarily highly speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   Correctional Services spokesman James Flateau noted that 26,000
inmates are already in shock or alternate treatment programs or
have had their sentences shortened for participating in them. He
said corrections officials believe trustworthy nonviolent inmates
in the system are already taking advantage of programs to shorten
sentences and that the Citizens Budget Commission is advocating
that prisoners who would pose a risk to the public inappropriately
now be included.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who are the inmates they are talking about?'' he asked.
''Violent inmates ... people who already flunked out (of
treatment)?''
</P>
<P>
   He denied that there is $20 million available in savings
involving the nonviolent property crimes described by the group
because virtually all of those offenders are sent to local jails,
not state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Flateau also said that the department itself does not have the
authority to make some of the changes the group called for but
would need to be directed to do so by Gov. George Pataki and the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''There certainly is some expansion (Corrections) can do without
authority,'' Brecher said. ''But it certainly would be better to
have everybody on board.''
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Budget Commission also recommended expanding what
it said was a 19-person agency in Corrections to come up with new
alternatives to imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Flateau, however, said the Division of Program Planning,
Research and Development is sufficient, though he could not confirm
how many people work there.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the 68-year-old Citizens Budget
Commission, which has criticized the state budget process in the
past, has analyzed criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   The report adds a new argument -- cost -- to the growing
complaints about the Rockefeller Drug Laws. Often those laws have
been called too harsh on moral or philosophical grounds by groups
as diverse as the state's Roman Catholic bishops to the top judges
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Budget Commission blamed a rise in imprisonment on
policies like Jenna's Law, which effectively eliminated parole for
a person who committed one violent crime, and the Rockefeller Drug
Laws. An official with the group suggested those laws are based on
emotional or political reasoning instead of deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Grieshaber, whose daughter's murder by a parolee spurred
Jenna's Law, was not impressed with the Citizens Budget
Commission's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to weigh dollars and people, in my opinion people
win,'' she said. ''Nicholas Pryor saw his parole officer at 3 and
murdered my daughter at 6 p.m. so I don't know how you can use cost
in this particular case.''

<HEADLINE> Senators To Comb China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration-backed bill to
expand trade with China ran into problems in the Senate on
Thursday, a day after it won solid approval in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents from both the political right and left served notice
they would use potentially time-consuming tactics to hold the bill
up to scrutiny and amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to make sure there are votes to deal with serious human
rights questions, the rights of workers to organize, trade
compliance,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ''It's something
that I can do and should do and I'll be out there. I don't intend
to be shut out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone was expected to team up with Sen. Russ Feingold,
D-Wis., in pushing a raft of labor-supported amendments. Organized
labor has waged a fierce campaign against the bill, which it sees
as a threat to U.S. workers' jobs.
</P>
<P>
   From the other end of the political spectrum, Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., pledged not to let the Senate ''rubber stamp'' the
House-passed measure and advised China-trade supporters to hold off
on ''popping the champagne corks.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms promised ''votes -- perhaps uncomfortable votes -- on a
range of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
announced Thursday that they, too, would seek to modify the China
trade bill. They want to set up a mechanism to monitor Chinese
weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Still others were expected to try to attach a provision to
increase U.S. military ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the exhaustive battle that led up to Wednesday's
237-197 vote in the House, neither side paid much attention to the
Senate -- until now.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is ultimately expected to win overwhelming support in
the Senate, where the Finance Committee has approved it 18-1.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., for a
''clean'' bill -- one without amendments like the one that passed
the Finance Committee -- were complicated by House-added amendments,
including one to establish a commission to monitor human rights in
China.
</P>
<P>
   The House also adopted amendments to protect U.S. companies
against surges in Chinese imports and to increase funds for Radio
Free Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Lott called the House amendments ''substantial'' and said,
''We'll have to decide how to deal with their add-ons.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the additional language goes beyond trade issues, other
committee chairmen might seek to assert jurisdiction, including
Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Time could be an important factor, with the summer political
convention and campaign season fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, a lengthy delay in the Senate could cause the
administration to have to revert to the old practice of extending
China's trade benefits on an annual basis -- the exact process the
permanent normal trade relations bill would end. The necessary
paperwork for such an annual renewal was being prepared as a
backup, administration officials said. President Clinton would send
it to Congress next week, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The old law, followed for the past 20 years, calls for the
president to certify China's eligibility for trade benefits by June
3 each year. Congress has until the end of August to block it.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate makes any changes to the House-passed bill, a
House-Senate conference committee would have to resolve the
differences, followed by new votes in both chambers on the finished
product. All that is potentially time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary Richard Daley visited Lott and key senators
on trade issues Thursday to map strategy for moving the legislation
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Daley later said in an interview that the meetings went well but
that ''we still have a lot of work to do'' and that ''we're just
going to have to work through'' the flurry of proposed amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's any surprise that a lot of members are
going to have an interest about different pieces of the
legislation,'' he said, adding: ''From everything we seem to hear,
the vast majority of the Senate feels that (permanent normal trade
relations for China) is the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters had hoped to build on momentum from Wednesday's
larger-than-expected House vote.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Senate about to begin a weeklong Memorial Day
recess and with the flurry of proposed amendments, it could be
weeks before a Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on Helms'
committee, said he hopes Helms and other opponents will not attempt
to slow or block the measure but added, ''Anything's possible in
this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden said he believes the measure will pass and that it is
widely supported in the Senate. Still, he said, ''This is not an
easy vote for Democrats.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Border Crossings Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will create a computer database
of information collected from foreigners as they enter and leave
the country under legislation that gained final approval Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, passed on a voice vote in the Senate, would
eliminate Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act, set to go into effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   The law would require border agents to question and track each
foreigner who travels in and out of the country. It was meant to
catch visitors who overstay their visas.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers from states along the Canadian border opposed the
law, saying it would hold up traffic, hurting commerce and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure does not call for the government to elicit any
more information from foreigners than currently is collected by
agents, such as name, country of origin and date of birth.
</P>
<P>
   But the information would have to be consolidated into a
database that could be connected with law enforcement computers and
used to alert authorities when a known criminal tries to enter or
leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill recognizes that the citizens along the northern
border have a special relationship that should not be harmed by
new, heavy-handed paperwork,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who
sponsored the bill with Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was approved by the House on Tuesday and now goes to
President Clinton for his signature. Leahy said the president will
sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4489.

<HEADLINE> Cop Courtesies Raise Safety Issues  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators posing as law
enforcement officers with fake IDs were waved unchallenged through
the entrances of Washington's most secure government buildings and
even into some Cabinet secretaries' offices, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three months, the General Accounting Office
investigators faked their way into 19 federal agencies and two
airports -- including the FBI, the Pentagon, the CIA, the Justice
Department and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise, conducted at the request of Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., chairman of the House Judiciary crime subcommittee, exposed
how age-old cop-to-cop courtesies could be a security breach.
</P>
<P>
   Federal security guards never challenged any of the badges of
the men they thought were fellow officers and the agents'
briefcases were never checked, GAO Assistant Controller General
Robert Hast said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've just never looked at this possibility,'' Hast said.
''I think what we found was a unique hole in the system that can be
plugged up.''
</P>
<P>
   The agents were even able to videotape their penetration of
several of the agencies without the guards noticing, said Ronald
Malfi, one of the GAO agents who got inside eight federal buildings
in one day using fake badges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could have caused a lot of damage,'' he said before showing
the videotape to a House subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Red-faced agencies scrambled to prove they had plugged their
security up. At the Pentagon, federal officers will no longer be
allowed to walk around unescorted and will have to check in their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, officials plan to reissue a department
notice to remind personnel of visitor access and escort policies,
including a section on escorting armed visitors.
</P>
<P>
   At FBI headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, police and law
enforcement officers from outside the FBI will have to surrender
their weapons before entering unless they have been given permanent
building passes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way to wake people up was to shock them and this is
pretty shocking,'' said House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Hast, a former Secret Service agent, cautioned that the test was
not an indictment of federal security in general but of guards'
lackadaisical attitude toward people who they think are fellow law
enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe that the White House would have been
penetrated by this kind of scam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that there are so many different types of
federal and state law enforcement badges that it's hard to tell the
real ones from the fake ones, Malfi said. ''There are too many law
enforcement credentials to be able to recognize them all,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hast admitted his investigators, also former Secret Service
agents, looked, talked and walked like cops, something most average
people would not be able to do. ''A trained intelligence officer,
someone who has had training, would be able to do that, however,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was surprised that there were so many'' places they could
get into, Attorney General Janet Reno admitted. But she added,
''Anytime you expose vulnerabilities, it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen of the 21 sites were penetrated on the first attempt.
The other three sites required a second visit before guards let
them inside, Hast said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said 16 of the sites housed the offices of Cabinet
secretaries or agency heads. At 15, undercover investigators were
able to stand immediately outside the suites of the Cabinet
secretary or agency head. Five agencies even let the GAO
investigators into the suites, Hast said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At 15 of the sites, our agents entered a restroom in the
vicinity of these offices and could have left a valise containing
weapons,'' Hast said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also penetrated security at Reagan National
Airport outside Washington and at the Orlando, Fla., international
airports. The Washington airport's security was worse than the
Florida airport's, they said.

<HEADLINE> Quinnipiac poll gives Corzine substantial lead in Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A Quinnipiac College poll released Thursday
gives U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine an overwhelming lead over
former Gov. Jim Florio in the Democratic primary race.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six percent of the registered Democrats who said they were
likely to vote June 6 said they would vote for Corzine, with 30
percent saying they would support Florio. Fourteen percent said
they were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns questioned the result and said their information
shows the race to be tighter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not taking this poll seriously,'' said Florio adviser
Walter Fields.
</P>
<P>
   The money race was even more lopsided as federal campaign
finance reports filed Thursday showed Corzine had spent $23.5
million in the primary contest as of May 17 compared with Florio's
spending of $1.4 million. Corzine himself said he expected to spend
$2 million a week on TV commercials in the final 20 days between
the May 17 report to the June 6 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac College of Hamden, Conn., questioned 371 likely
Democratic voters from May 17-23. The poll has a margin of error of
5.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac College political analyst Scott McLean said Florio
may still gain some support as his TV ads begin, but he said there
do not appear to be many minds left to be made up.
</P>
<P>
   While questioning the margin, Corzine spokesman Steve Goldstein
said the poll result is consistent with his camp's sense of the
campaign's direction. In a poll released in March, Corzine trailed
Florio by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both Corzine and Florio (internal) polls show this race to be
substantially closer, and either side can win, but the trend is
unmistakable toward Jon Corzine, and it proves that the voters of
New Jersey find Jim Florio to be as repellent as a can of bug spray
on the hot summer night,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Fields said the Florio campaign also anticipates a much tighter
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have never put any credence in a Quinnipiac Poll, even when
they had us up by a ridiculous margin. We have always believed this
is going to be a close race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac released a poll May 10 giving Corzine a 48-33 lead
over Florio, but both campaigns and many political analysts
discounted the numbers because the polling institute had not
screened respondents to see if they intended to vote. The survey
dealt only with registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   The poll released Thursday copied that question, asking 944
registered Democrats their opinion, and they gave Corzine a 47-28
lead, close to the May 10 result.
</P>
<P>
   But the new poll also took the next step, breaking out responses
from the 371 Democrats who said they intended to vote June 6, which
yielded the more lopsided 56-30 margin.
</P>
<P>
   After releasing its May 10 poll, Quinnipiac had said it did not
intend to release any before June 6.
</P>
<P>
   ''We changed our minds because we ended up getting enough likely
voters to do something with it,'' McLean said. ''Our previous poll
was criticized for not including likely Democratic primary voters,
and we came right back with a poll that did include those voters,
and the trends still hold from two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fields said Quinnipiac's credibility was compromised by the
last poll. ''We don't believe the poll should be trusted, and we
think the only reason they commissioned another poll is they are
trying to save face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, a retired Wall Street executive who has spent lavishly
on television advertising, and Florio are running for the seat
being vacated by Democrat Frank Lautenberg, who is retiring at the
end of his term.

<HEADLINE> Astros Blowing Big Leads  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine blowing a seven-run lead to lose a game, then turning
around and doing the same thing all over again a couple of days
later. Right about now, the reeling Houston Astros may be thinking
that nothing like this has ever happened to anybody twice in a week
before.
</P>
<P>
   They'd be wrong about that.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros blew a 9-2 lead in the ninth inning at Milwaukee on
Monday, then saw a 7-0 lead evaporate at home against Philadelphia
on Wednesday. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was the
third time in major league history that a team has been embarrassed
that way.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the seven-run jinx. Every 50 years, it happens to some
team.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals twice let that big a lead get away
during a series in Boston in June 1900. First, they blew a 9-2 lead
to lose 17-16 on June 2, then they frittered away a 7-0 lead in a
15-11 loss in June 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians did the same thing half a century later,
in August 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell those guys in Houston not to get excited,'' former
Indians star Bob Feller said. ''They didn't break any records.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd certainly know.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in Fenway Park, the Indians blew two seven-run leads in
consecutive games. And Feller was right in the middle of the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Al Lopez had Feller and Bob Lemon, two pitchers on their
way to the Hall of Fame, set to start for Cleveland against the Red
Sox on Aug. 27-28. Lemon was already a 20-game winner and Feller
had led the league in strikeouts in seven of the previous nine
seasons. ''We were both in our prime,'' Feller said.
</P>
<P>
   That meant nothing to the Red Sox. Even with Ted Williams
injured, their lineup included sluggers like Vern Stephens and Walt
Dropo, and they led the league with a .302 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything can happen in Fenway Park,'' Feller said ruefully.
''I pitched good there and I pitched bad there. The bad thing about
being knocked out of a game in Fenway Park was it took 15 minutes
to get hot water in the shower.''
</P>
<P>
   Feller was Cleveland's starter on Aug. 27, 1950 and the Indians
staked him to a big lead, scoring seven runs in the third inning
when Ray Boone hit a grand slam. But Feller was knocked out in the
bottom half of the inning when he gave up three hits, walked three
batters and surrendered a three-run homer by Dropo.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored five runs that inning and six more in the
seventh inning when Cleveland made three errors and Clyde Vollmer
hit a pinch-hit grand slam for an 11-9 victory.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Feller was in the bullpen when Lemon started for
the Indians. And this time, Cleveland built a 12-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Boston recovered. Lemon was knocked out in the fourth
when the Red Sox scored eight runs, three of them on a bases-loaded
double by Billy Goodman. In the sixth, they scored twice and had
the bases loaded with none out when Lopez summoned Feller.
</P>
<P>
   ''I struck out the side on 10 pitches,'' Feller remembered.
</P>
<P>
   The success was only temporary. He pitched into the eighth, when
the Red Sox rallied again to take the lead in a game they won
15-14. The loser was Feller, who pitched 2 1-3 innings in each of
the Boston games and gave up eight runs on seven hits and eight
walks over those two days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pitchers ask me for advice all the time,'' Feller said. ''I
tell them never start on a day when your team is going to be shut
out and remember, they can hit it back at you faster than you can
throw it at them.''
</P>
<P>
   He found that out 50 years ago in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the St. Louis losses a century ago are sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, 1900, the Cardinals led 9-2 in the fifth inning.
Boston scored three in the fifth, six in the sixth, one in the
seventh and four in the ninth and won 17-16.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, St. Louis led 7-0 in the second inning but
Boston scored three in the second, three in the third, two in the
fifth, one in the sixth and six in the eighth to win 15-11.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Looking for New Coach  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KELLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- Just after Lon Kruger was introduced as
the coach of the Atlanta Hawks, Illinois athletic director Ron
Guenther promised the school's players he would find a replacement
capable of leading them to an NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone might be looking at this as having a new coach and
being in a reconstruction year, but I can't look at it that way,''
forward Sergio McClain said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my senior year. I was looking forward to winning a
national championship next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Guenther promised a speedy and expansive search for a coach. He
said he wants someone who has head coaching experience.
</P>
<P>
   Players said they weren't expecting Kruger to leave before a
season when the Illini would return all five starters from a squad
that went 22-10 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very scary situation, playing under coach Kruger ...
and then turning it over to a different system,'' McClain said.
''That's a delicate situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruger said he called as many of his Illinois players as he
could to tell them, adding that they were all supportive of his
decision. He planned to meet with his players Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were great,'' said Kruger, who choked up a little when
asked about his Illinois players during his news conference in
Atlanta. ''They made it easier than it could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   McClain and teammate Cory Bradford said no Illini are talking
about transferring because of Kruger's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Guenther felt he had to take the rare step of addressing the
players as a group. None expressed ill will toward Kruger, who took
what is believed to be a five-year, $10 million deal from the
Hawks. Kruger earned $750,000 a year at Illinois, where he was
81-48 in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Players said they hope to get a coach who will stick with the
up-tempo, defensive-style that Kruger employed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just going to leave that in Mr. Guenther's hands,''
Bradford said.

<HEADLINE> Suerfund Might Exempt Small Cos.  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under legislation introduced Thursday, small
companies could skirt the Environmental Protection Agency's
Superfund program, which currently requires them to pay to clean up
toxic sites they created or added to.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., wants to exempt companies with
fewer than 100 workers from liability unless they are guilty of
gross negligence or significantly contributed to a site.
</P>
<P>
   The Superfund program never was intended to punish restaurant
owners or other mom-and-pop businesses that legally hauled garbage
to Superfund sites, Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Innocent Main Street small business owners across the nation
continue to be unfairly pulled into Superfund's legal quagmire,''
said Bond, who chairs the Small Business Committee.
</P>
<P>
   EPA Administrator Carol Browner and other agency officials have
repeatedly expressed support for reforms along those lines.
</P>
<P>
   But it already has upset the environmental lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to leave the taxpayers footing the bill for
cleanup of toxic waste sites, whether they're left by little guys
or big guys,'' the Sierra Club's Kathryn Hohman said. ''Small
parties can make big messes.''
</P>
<P>
   Exempting small businesses from the Superfund's tough
regulations would remove a powerful incentive to behave
responsibly, said Deb Callahan, executive director of the League of
Conservation Voters. ''This undermines some of the fundamental
concepts of the Superfund program,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said Bond, a frequent target of her group, ''isn't the
kind of senator we would trust to rewrite toxic waste law in the
public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond aide Tracy Henke said the measure doesn't let polluters off
the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who have violated the law are still required to pay,''
Henke said. ''It's just that while Senator Bond believes small
business owners are innocent, groups like the Sierra Club would
rather insist they're guilty until proven innocent.''
</P>
<P>

</P>

<HEADLINE> Chris Mihm Signs With Agent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas center Chris Mihm signed with an
agent Thursday, insuring the 7-footer will not return for his
senior season.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm signed with Octagon, which also represents David Robinson,
Jerry Stackhouse and Sheryl Swoopes. Jeff Austin, Octagon senior
vice president of basketball, will be the lead negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Considered the best pure center in college basketball last
season, Mihm is projected as a top-five pick in the June 28 NBA
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm averaged nearly 18 points and 10.5 rebounds in leading the
Longhorns to a 24-9 record. He holds the school record with 264
career blocks and ranks second with 945 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Underclassmen have until June 21 to pull out of the draft if
they have not signed with an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm is just the second Longhorn to leave school early for the
NBA. LaSalle Thompson left after his junior season in 1982 and was
drafted by the Kansas City Kings with the No. 5 pick, which remains
the highest draft selection of a Texas player.

<HEADLINE> State Supreme Court affirms 100 percent funding for poor schools  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Supreme Court Thursday
affirmed its earlier order that the state must pay full funding for
construction projects in 30 poor school districts.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is a defeat for Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, who
last month asked the justices to clarify a 1998 ruling that most
interpreted as ordering 100 percent state funding for the so-called
''special-needs'' schools.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, R-Salem, whose original school construction legislation
fell short of that mandate, argued that the 1998 decision was not
clear. He also argued that the court should have granted the
Legislature some leeway in portioning funds to the districts, which
are not uniformly poor.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices, in an unanimous nine-page decision, said their
1998 order stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state is required to fund all of the costs of necessary
facilities, remediation and construction in the Abbott districts,''
the decision said, referring to the special-needs districts' name
in the Abbott vs. Burke court case.
</P>
<P>
   David Sciarra of the Education Law Center, which sued the state
on behalf of the poor schools, said Thursday he was not surprised
at the justices' ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always thought that the court's (1998) decision was clear,
now it's crystal clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Thursday he will abide by the court ruling, and
change his school construction bill to reflect full funding. His
original legislation provided the poor schools 100 percent funding
only for emergency repairs and projects designed to ease classroom
overcrowding, but fewer dollars for extra items such as cafeterias
and media centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is 100 percent really 100 percent? Now we have the answer,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   On the constitutional issue, the speaker said the Legislature
deserved more input in determining state funding levels for the
poor schools. It was the executive branch, not lawmakers, who
recommended full funding when the school funding case was before
the Supreme Court in 1997 and 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm troubled by that,'' he said. ''We're the appropriating
body. But the court has spoken so our bill will comply with 100
percent funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins' decision to change his bill brings him in accord with
Gov. Christie Whitman and Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, who
have backed a competing bill supplying 100 percent funding for poor
schools.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco, who like Collins is a possible gubernatorial
candidate in 2001, issued a statement applauding the court for
clarifying its intent. He said Thursday's ruling clears the way for
final passage of the school construction bill, which has languished
during months of gridlock between the legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But DiFrancesco also sounded a cautionary note.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, pending revisions will not throw further roadblocks
in the way of enacting this important property tax relief
initiative this spring,'' his statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already passed a $15 billion school construction
bill. Collins' version is pending in the lower house. The speaker
said it is scheduled for consideration by the Assembly
Appropriations Committee on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman Thursday said she was pleased the court affirmed its
early ruling, but warned that the pending legislation is growing
too expensive. The bill also provides partial funding for more
affluent suburban schools. Annual payments totaling $15 billion are
expected to rise over its 30-year term.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the out years, this won't be a problem with my budget as a
governor, but a problem with my budget as a homeowner in the state
of New Jersey,'' said Whitman, who has less than two years
remaining in office.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, back from a trade mission to the Far East, raised
red flags about Senate plans to provide retroactive aid to some
school districts that started construction projects before the 1998
court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started out with what I thought was the most fiscally
manageable proposal,'' she said. ''My concern is going way back.
When do you say stop?''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he also was worried about the pricetag, and said he
may amend his version of the bill to include a cap on annual
spending. He would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The state education commissioner will have the final say over
what kinds of projects fit the court's criteria as educationally
''necessary'' to prevent state funding of such projects as
''Olympic size athletic complexes,'' Whitman said.

<HEADLINE> Drug Helps Maintain Weight Loss  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTWERP, Belgium (AP) -- Obese people who continued using the
drug sibutramine 18 months after they lost weight were able to keep
it off, but those who stopped taking the pills regained the pounds,
new research shows.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the experiment with the drug, which is used as a
weight-loss aid by 2 million people worldwide -- 1.6 million of them
in the United States -- were presented this week at the European
Congress on Obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very important finding because it changes the
philosophy of how to use the drug,'' said Michel Carruba, professor
of pharmacology at the University of Milan, who was not involved
with the study. ''Doctors use the drug to obtain weight loss, but
the main job the drug does is ... (to help) control behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Dieters have had little in the way of drugs to rely on since the
recall in 1997 of half the popular anti-obesity cocktail
fenfleuramine-phentermine, or fen-phen, after it was linked with
potentially fatal heart-valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Sibutramine, known as Meridia in the United States and as
Reductil elsewhere, acts on the brain chemicals which regulate food
intake and energy burning.
</P>
<P>
   Sibutramine's side effects include increased heart rate and
blood pressure, along with insomnia, but Carruba said those effects
do not cause significant trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Carruba said it was safer that fen-phen because ''you can use it
long-term.'' He also praised the study as being well-conducted and
''one of the best studies that's ever been done on obesity drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two-year study, 400 Europeans were given a typical 10 mg
dose of sibutramine daily for six months, were told to exercise
regularly and were offered intensive diet counseling
</P>
<P>
   After the six months, 100 were given a fake pill and the rest
continued to take the drug, at doses tailored to each person.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months later, weight loss was sustained in those taking
sibutramine, but for those who had stopped, the weight gradually
came back.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a progressive difference between the two groups as
the study went on,'' said Dr. Arne Astrup, a professor of nutrition
at the University of Copenhagen who was involved in the study.''
</P>
<P>
   Cholesterol dropped in the drug group by the same amount that it
normally does with standard cholesterol-lowering drugs, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''This individual obesity-management program can achieve and
maintain metabolically significant weight loss in 77 percent of
obese patients who continue for two years,'' the study said.

<HEADLINE> House Delays Doctor Bill Vote  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rising opposition in the Republican ranks has
sidetracked a promise by House Speaker Dennis Hastert to take up a
bill that would give self-employed doctors new rights to bargain
collectively with HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The House Rules Committee, which sets procedure and acts as a
gateway for bills moving to the floor, decided Wednesday to put off
action on the bill, at least until after the House returns from its
weeklong Memorial Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was late at night and the votes weren't there to move it,''
Hastert, R-Ill., said Thursday. ''And we didn't want to lose it.''
He said he still intends to bring it up at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association expressed outrage over the
committee's inaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is hard to imagine a more outrageous subversion of the
American democratic process,'' said Dr. D. Ted Lewers, chairman of
the AMA board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has promised Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., the chief
sponsor and a challenger for Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's
Senate seat, that he would get a vote on his legislation. Campbell
reportedly has said the House must move now to allow time for
Senate action this year.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, at their closed-door weekly meeting, a
majority of House Republicans voted for a resolution, proposed by
Rep. Anne Northup of Kentucky, to delay a vote on the doctor bill
until Congress dispenses with a larger HMO patient bill of rights
that has been stalled in a House-Senate conference.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't get the two-thirds vote they needed to approve the
resolution, but found a sympathetic ear with Republicans on the
Rules Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The members of the committee were all in agreement that the
bill was not ready,'' said Richard Mills, spokesman for the
committee chairman, Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif. ''There wasn't a
comfort level in the conference to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to throw the bill overboard, it seems,'' said
Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the leading Democratic sponsor of the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is backed by the American Medical Association,
would amend antitrust laws to give health care professionals the
right to bargain collectively with health plans over fees and other
contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell says the bill is pro-consumer because it would allow
health care professionals to join together to fight gag rules,
limits on testing and other restrictions imposed by health
maintenance organizations. But the new bargaining power, already
enjoyed by doctors employed by a hospital or municipality, does not
give doctors the right to strike.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is facing fierce opposition from a coalition of health
insurance, HMO, hospital and business groups that say it could
drive up health costs and private health insurance premiums and
disrupt patient care.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to delay a vote, said Karen Ignagni, president of
the American Association of Health Plans, ''is definitely a sign
that members of Congress want to slow down and look at the
implications of this.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her organization of HMOs and preferred provider
organizations, which is leading the drive against the bill, regards
it as ''the most significant piece of anti-consumer legislation in
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 1304.

   Speaking a day after the last Israeli soldier left Lebanon,
ending 18 years of occupation, Barak also told Lebanon that Israel
no longer occupies any of its territory, a reference to the
dismantling of border outposts that had jutted out into Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The special parliamentary session in Kiryat Shemona -- a town hit
by 4,000 rockets fired from Lebanon over the last two decades -- was
a message of solidarity with residents who fear Israel's pullout
endangers their security.
</P>
<P>
   The border has been quiet since the withdrawal, but Barak warned
he would hit back if guerrillas on the border attacked Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel would see this as an act of war, and no target or
source of power in Lebanon would be immune from a harsh response,''
he said, in a veiled reference to Syria, which has 30,000 troops in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   He followed the threat, however, with a call for neighborly
relations, acknowledging Syria's influence in Lebanon, but seeking
to bypass it with a direct appeal to Lebanon's president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call on you, President Emile Lahoud, Israel extends its hand
in peace,'' Barak said. ''Israel is not Lebanon's enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak praised Lebanon's economic recovery and expressed hope
that it would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Barak spokesman David Ziso said work dismantling border outposts
technically located in Lebanon had been completed. But Israel is
still building its new fence along the international border and the
old one which juts out into Lebanon in some places has not been
taken down.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers cleared land for the new fence Thursday, and soldiers
set up checkpoints blocking civilian access to the border.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's withdrawal of all its soldiers and outposts allows the
United Nations to verify the withdrawal, a precondition for sending
peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, speaking Thursday to
reporters in Washington, said after formal confirmation of the
pullout he hopes to announce ''within days'' plans to boost the
interim force of 4,500 troops, who have been in Lebanon since 1978,
to about 8,000. The new troops, to be used to ensure peace along
the Israeli-Lebanon border, should be in the region ''within
weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conscious of the security fears of northern residents, Barak
left the parliament session for a campaign-style tour, popping into
a local falafel stand for a snack and shaking hands with
demonstrators applauding the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in a counter-demonstration accused him of
abandoning front-line communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We respect that the Knesset (parliament) has come here,''
Kiryat Shemona Mayor Haim Barbivai said. ''But we know they can't
give us the security we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiryat Shemona residents spent the beginning of this week in
shelters, fearful of rocket attacks in retaliation for civilian
deaths in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak praised frontier residents as heroes and called upon
Israelis to visit northern resorts, which have been badly hit
economically by the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Albright Receives Security Advice  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An internal report on improving State
Department security recommends limiting traffic in surrounding
streets to people with proper clearance, screening all cars using
the basement parking garage and bolstering the building's
400-member security detail, a senior official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, security checks of all employees and visitors should take
place outside the two-square block building instead of inside -- one
of the 43 recommendations made by the department's top security
adviser, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright received the report May 19
from Assistant Secretary of State David Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   One of the streets that runs next to the department is expected
to be closed because of street construction. Security concerns may
keep the street closed after that work is done.
</P>
<P>
   Security has become a high priority for Albright following
several embarrassing violations in recent months. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --In February, a laptop computer containing highly classified
information disappeared from the department's Bureau of
Intelligence and Research.
</P>
<P>
   --Last fall, the department uncovered a Russian spy operation
involving a bug planted in a seventh floor conference room. A
Russian agent involved in the operation was expelled from the
country in December.
</P>
<P>
   --Earlier this month, two General Accounting Office guards posing
as New York City police officers wandered the building unescorted
for 15 minutes, officials disclosed Thursday. Under department
rules, the two should have been under escort at all times.
</P>
<P>
   The two were testing State Department security arrangements as
part of a congressionally mandated investigation to review security
at 19 government installations and two commercial airports. In each
case, the GAO agents used fake credentials to get past security
guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that they were not escorted out of here was a
mistake,'' Carpenter said. Another official said the agents, on
entering the building, said they were armed but conceded days later
that they were unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   The episode produced an immediate policy change -- no one can
enter the State Department armed except for federal law enforcers
on official business, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Angels' Shortstop Out for Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, an Anaheim
Angels' leader both on the field and in the clubhouse, is expected
to miss the rest of the season after undergoing surgery on his
right shoulder Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina is in the final year of a four-year, $11.7 million
contract that includes a $3.45 million option for 2001 -- which
becomes guaranteed if he makes 1,200 plate appearances in the last
three seasons of the contract. He now has only 900 at-bats in that
span.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Angels could decline the option, which would make
him eligible for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Team medical director Dr. Lewis Yocum repaired a small tear to
DiSarcina's rotator cuff and trimmed the outer layer of the labrum,
part of the shoulder joint, during the operation at University of
California-Irvine Medical Center in Orange.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, 32, was batting .395 with one home runs and 11 RBIs
in 12 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   He initially was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 9
with a bruised left thumb. He was activated April 24, but went back
on the DL because of stiffness in his right shoulder on May 8.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina has played in 1,086 games for the Angels, most among
their active players and is tied for fourth all-time with Dick
Schofield.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina has a career mark of .258, with 28 homers and 355
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Benji Gil, who has made nine errors and is hitting .225, has
filled in at short for the Angels. Justin Baughman, a former second
baseman now playing shortstop at Triple-A Edmonton, could
eventually move into the position for Anaheim.

<HEADLINE> Munich Memorial Stirs Protests  </HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Middle East politics overshadowed
an Olympic meeting Thursday, as delegates from Israel and Palestine
clashed over a tribute in Sydney to the 11 Israelis slain at the
1972 Munich Games.
</P>
<P>
   Palestine's Rabie Al Turk protested over a plaque recently
unveiled near the main Olympic stadium to honor the Israeli dead,
and over reported plans to observe a moment of silence during the
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not want to do anything against the great work Sydney has
done,'' Al Turk told the general assembly of the Association of
National Olympic Committees. ''But if somebody does something about
politics, Arabs will do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want peace destroyed,'' added Al Turk, vice
president of the Palestine Olympic Committee. ''But if they insist
on doing so, we are ready. We can do lots of things against
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Efram Zinger, secretary general of the Israeli national Olympic
committee, replied that it was important to remember the only
political killings in the history of the modern Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must remember not only the festivities and the Olympic
medal winners, but the victims,'' Zinger said. ''We want to bring
the memory of the 11 athletes and officials to the Israeli public,
and the younger generation and the Olympic community.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would be satisfied with a moment of silence.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute arose just weeks before International Olympic
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch is to visit Israel and
Palestine on June 14-15.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 5, 1972, Palestinian militants invaded the Olympic
village in Munich and took over a dormitory housing Israeli
athletes and coaches. Two Israelis were killed in the village.
After a 20-hour standoff, nine Israelis died in a bungled rescue
attempt by German police at a local airport. Five Palestinians and
a German policeman also were killed.
</P>
<P>
   John Coates, head of the Australian Olympic Committee, said
members of Sydney's Jewish community approached the group to
propose a moment of silence during the closing ceremony. But the
request was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are lot of causes that should not be perpetuated in
ceremonies,'' Coates said. ''We said there would be no
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a plaque honoring the Munich dead was unveiled last
September in Sydney. The plaque was funded by four members of
Sydney's Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Coates said the plaque was not located in an official Olympic
site.
</P>
<P>
   That appeased the Palestinian, who was more concerned that the
plaque would be installed in a stadium or the Olympic village.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it is in a garden outside the Olympic village, there is
nothing to do,'' Al Turk said. ''It was a great answer. I am
satisfied now.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of conciliation, the Palestinian and Israeli delegates
stood side by side, smiling, as they answered reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   But Al Turk wasn't smiling for long.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when told that the plaque was located at the base of a
light tower about 70 feet from the main Olympic stadium in the
Homebush precinct, Al Turk said Palestinians wanted equal
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they are going to have a plaque in a prominent place, then
I want a plaque,'' he said. ''If they ask for a minute of silence,
I ask one for me.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Israelis want to recall their victims, Palestinians will
bring photos of young Arabs killed by Israelis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have lots of victims,'' he said. ''If they are going to
fight like this, we're going to fight, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois Carrard, the IOC's general director, confirmed there
were no plans for an official ceremony during the games and that
the plaque was ''an entirely private affair.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not involved in this,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Sign Guard Diaz-Infante  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos on Thursday signed free agent
guard and former team member David Diaz-Infante to their active
roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos acquired the 6-foot-3, 298-pound Diaz-Infante as a
free agent in 1995 after he had spent nine seasons in various
football organizations, including the World League and the Canadian
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his first year with the Broncos on their practice squad
and saw his first playing time in 1996 when he filled in for an
injured Mark Schlereth. He started two games, and his start at
Minnesota at age 33 is believed to have made him the oldest
first-time starter in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Infante played in all 16 games in Denver's 1997 season,
starting in the season's final five games.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a knee injury during a preseason game in 1998 that
kept him out of the first six games of the season, and was released
the following year. He signed a one-year contract with
Philadelphia, acting as their deep snapper on punts and placekicks.

<HEADLINE> New Laws Sought on Web Pharmacies  </HEADLINE>
By G. STEPHEN BIERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New laws are needed for regulating online
pharmacies that are writing prescriptions and selling drugs over
the Internet, often illegally, the Clinton administration told
Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A House subcommittee taking it first look at the
administration's proposal submitted earlier this month was told how
the spiraling growth in sales of prescription drugs over the
Internet is overwhelming drug safety regulators and law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a 16-year-old boy bought Viagra and two other
controlled substances from a doctor's Web site after only filling
out a diagnostic questionnaire. The physician was prosecuted under
a state law, but only because he sold the drugs to a minor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Online pharmacy sites often circumvent the traditional
protections built into the doctor-patient relationship, such as
diagnosis based on a physical examination,'' Deputy Associate
Attorney General Ethan Posner told the House Commerce
investigations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Posner said, the government has largely relied on
health professionals -- physicians and pharmacists -- to protect
patients from knowingly or accidentally misusing prescribed
medicines that could cause them harm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to need some legislation that will better define
the law and provide more tools to enforce it, particularly where
folk are getting access to prescriptions without a doctor's
prescription itself,'' said Fred Upton, R-Mich., the subcommittee's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Attorney General Carla J. Stovall said differing state
laws and evasive practices have made regulating Internet pharmacies
and prosecuting illegal prescription sales both difficult and
time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all had to sort through multiple shell corporations,
addresses that turned out to be mail drops, and overlapping
physical and Internet addresses shared by different entities,'' she
said. ''Companies selling dangerous drugs across state lines should
be required to maintain current, accurate, accessible information
about their principals, their physical addresses and their
identities.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that would be required under legislation that the Food
and Drug Administration submitted to Congress earlier this month.
The FDA-sought law also would require online pharmacies to be
licensed in each state in which they operate or deliver
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Posner said the Justice Department has opened about 30
investigations in the past year in online pharmaceutical sales and
has indicted at least one person for selling Viagra over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Internet access to European, Asian and Central American
pharmacies that sell drugs without prescriptions also has put
pressure on the U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Durant, director of trade programs for the Customs
Service, said the number of pharmaceuticals seized entering the
United States jumped 450 percent from 1998 to 1999, an increase of
7,586 seizures.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Head to Portland  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The last time the Los Angeles Lakers came
to Portland, it was billed as the biggest game of the NBA season.
This one's bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers finally headed to the Northwest on Thursday for the
resumption of the Western Conference finals Friday night with Game
3 in what is bound to be a rockin' and rollin' Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After splitting two games in Los Angeles, the Trail Blazers,
backed by their loud, loyal fans, have the homecourt advantage, for
the rest of this series and in the finals, too, if they make it
that far.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we defend our homecourt from here in, we're crowned the
champion,'' Portland's Scottie Pippen said. ''That's how we look at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an observation that has to irritate coach Phil Jackson and
his Lakers, who won 67 regular-season games to earn the homecourt
edge throughout the playoffs, only to see it slip away in an
embarrassing 106-77 loss in Game 2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   When the two teams last met in Portland, on Feb. 29, both were
45-11 and both were on 11-game winning streaks. Los Angeles won
90-87, and the Blazers, who later lost Arvydas Sabonis and Brian
Grant to injuries, never could pull even again.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers need another Rose Garden triumph, either Friday or in
Game 4 Sunday, or they will return to Los Angeles for Game 5 in big
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that we come here and really push them farther
into a corner,'' Pippen said. ''Right now we've got a great
opportunity to really put their backs against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, just 1-3 on the road in the playoffs, have mentioned
that February victory often as they try to regroup from their worst
loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Lakers left Los Angeles on Thursday, Jackson talked
about that makes a good road team.
</P>
<P>
   ''That they're able to sustain adversity on the road, stay with
their game plan, play solid defense, don't turn the ball over a
lot,'' Jackson said. ''Winning on the road is one of the great
pleasures of NBA basketball, especially in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal scored 41 points in Game 1, a memorable
afternoon in which Portland coach Mike Dunleavy took the
Hack-a-Shaq tactics to record highs, or lows, depending on your
opinion of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal scored only 23 in Game 2, 14 of them in what
essentially was a meaningless final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He was persistently double-teamed, often unable to find a clear
passing route through the long arms of Pippen or Rasheed Wallace.
But his path will be easier, Jackson said, if the Lakers can hit
from the outside, as they did in Game 1, and Kobe Bryant, averaging
just nine shots and 12.5 points in the series, can get his offense
going.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think Shaq had that bad a game Monday night,''
Jackson said. ''He got in foul trouble, just didn't have that much
roaming space, took a few bad shots. I think Shaq's always
aggressive. I think Kobe's got to shoot the basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who played on six NBA championship teams, has emerged as
the Blazers' unquestioned leader, something the Portland teams of
the recent past have sorely lacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd say the thing that puts him in the lead are those six
things,'' Wallace said. ''I would say he's the premier leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, and his teammates, seemed amused but not unruffled by
Jackson's between-game remarks. Jackson said the Blazers behaved
like jackals on the bench in their celebration after Game 2, and he
accused Pippen of playing zone defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''My response is that he should concentrate on being a coach and
stop trying to referee,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday night's game, Pippen will move ahead of Danny Ainge
into the No. 2 spot for NBA playoff appearances with 194.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the playoffs began, he's done a 360 in his role as a
leader,'' Grant said. ''During the season, he was trying to make
other guys better. Not that he's not doing that now, but it seems
as soon as the playoffs started, he took on a whole new role
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whereas he was more swinging it to get other guys open, now
he'll look to swing it and if nobody's there, he's going to go. We
know he's going to go, and that's what we need him to do.''

<HEADLINE> Corzine spending at $27 million, closing in on California record  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine has spent
more than $27 million so far in his quest to beat former Gov. Jim
Florio in the race for the Democratic primary nomination, and he
could spend another $5 million through Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's report to the Federal Elections Commission filed
Thursday showed he had spent $25 million as of May 17 and had
obligated his campaign to another $2.2 million in debts, contracts
and bills yet to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Florio's FEC report showed he had spent $1.9 million by the same
date. Both figures include spending for 1999, $3.7 million by
Corzine, $466,000 by Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said Monday he spend at least another $2 million per
week on TV commercials for the final two weeks of the campaign,
although a portion of that could have been contracted by May 17. He
is also expected to deploy large sums on Primary Day in
get-out-the-vote efforts like phone banks and van shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   The historic pace of spending is unprecedented in any race for a
seat in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The May 17 report brings the self-financing Wall Street
millionaire to within a few big checks of shattering the national
record set in 1994 by another self-financing candidate, Republican
Senate candidate Michael Huffington in California, a state with
four times New Jersey's population. Huffington spent $30 million
that year, less than a third of that in his primary contest. He
ended up losing to U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided money tally in the New Jersey Democratic primary
comes along with a Quinnipiac College poll released Thursday giving
Corzine an overwhelming lead over Florio. Fifty-six percent of the
registered Democrats who said they were likely to vote backed
Corzine compared to 30 percent for Florio; 14 percent were
undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 5.1 percentage points,
which even when skewed to Florio's advantage gives Corzine a 16
point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns denounced the poll, saying their research shows
the race to be closer, although Corzine spokesman Steve Goldstein
said the Quinnipiac result did comport with their findings that
Corzine has been rising steadily in voter support.
</P>
<P>
   While Corzine has largely been funding his campaign himself, the
reports to the FEC show he has raised $2.5 million in individual
contributions, $1.1 million of it since Jan. 1. The reports show
Florio has raised $1.6 million, $557,000 of it from Jan. 1 to May.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog
group, showed that in March, Florio was getting 79 percent of his
donations from within New Jersey while Corzine was getting 63
percent of his donations from outside the state.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Debate About Debate  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A conservative opposition party has reined in
its brash presidential candidate, Vicente Fox, getting him to agree
to the debate that critics say he wanted to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who has the best chance in seven decades to unseat the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate, has had his
image tarnished by the controversy over the three-way debate.
</P>
<P>
   Because Fox, a plainspoken farm owner and businessman, feared
the ruling party's nominee and a left-center rival would gang up on
him in Friday's televised debate, he stalled on agreeing to
conditions for the debate. Then, on television Tuesday, he suddenly
reversed course and demanded a debate that same day, over the
objections of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the ruling party's Francisco Labastida and
left-center candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas stuck to the Friday
format.
</P>
<P>
   Diego Fernandez, a top leader of Fox's National Action Party,
called the television spectacle a ''pre-planned ambush.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying Fox's strategy ''needed to be adjusted,'' National Action
Party president Luis Felipe Bravo met with Fox Wednesday and
persuaded him to participate in Friday's debate, local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Though expressing his usual confidence, Fox said he was going
into the debate with some trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will confront the alliance of Cardenas with Labastida which
is trying to preserve the authoritarian system of corruption and
privileges imposed on Mexican society for the past 70 years,'' Fox
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's reluctance to agree to debate terms was widely seen as a
bid to preserve the momentum he gained in the first TV encounter
between the candidates in April. After that debate, Fox pulled
roughly even with Labastida in polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the disagreement goes to the heart of the July 2 elections.
It illustrates how little hope remains of an alliance between
Cardenas and Fox -- a step many see as the only hope of beating the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has held Mexico's
presidency since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, the two parties had tried to form a wide,
anti-ruling party coalition, but it collapsed because of procedural
and ideological wrangling and that fact that Fox and Cardenas
dislike each other.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Cardenas has focused his fire almost
exclusively on Fox, rather than the left's traditional target, the
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be foolishness, it would be stubbornness that would
be governing if he (Fox) is not headed off in time,'' Cardenas said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the debate also points up some weaknesses in
Fox's otherwise winning personality.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fox did everything humanly possible to sink the debate,''
columnist Julio Hernandez wrote in the newspaper La Jornada. ''Fox
parked himself on Stubborn Street, and then put on the emergency
brake.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Orders New Plane Insulation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration ordered
the operators of 719 Boeing aircraft Thursday to replace insulation
blankets covered with a form of Mylar that could increase the risk
of a fire spreading.
</P>
<P>
   The agency directive applies to MD-80, MD-88, MD-90, DC-10 and
MD-11 aircraft designed by McDonnell Douglas, which Boeing bought
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk of fire aboard these aircraft is very low, but this
is a prudent action to take to raise the bar on safety,'' FAA
Administrator Jane F. Garvey said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman John Thom said the company will work with
aircraft operators to help them comply with the FAA order.
</P>
<P>
   The order affects 719 U.S.-registered aircraft operated by
Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Boeing, Continental Airlines,
Delta Air Lines, Federal Express, Frontier Airlines, Midwest
Express, Northwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Trans World Airlines,
US Airways and World Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The operators have five years to replace the insulation
blankets, a process that will cost about $368 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 of the planes operate worldwide, but the FAA can
only require changes by U.S. carriers. Other countries normally
follow the U.S. lead in such orders.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the FAA ordered U.S. airlines to conduct emergency
inspections of 120 Boeing 767 aircraft after mechanics found
damaged bolts in one plane's engine pylons.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Release Dwight Gooden  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Dwight Gooden's return home was a
short one.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Devil Rays released Gooden and shortstop Kevin
Stocker Thursday and recalled infielder Felix Martinez and selected
pitcher Doug Creek from Triple-A Durham.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a situation like this, you build from the situations in the
past,'' Gooden said. ''I've been in worst before. It's just a bump
in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, 35, indicated he is not yet ready to retire, saying the
''the fire still burns.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay general manager Chuck LaMar asked Gooden to retire
before releasing him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a warrior and has been through a lot of ups and downs,''
LaMar said. ''I felt like that his playing days were coming to an
end and I wanted him to go out the right way. I thought it was time
to make a move with Dwight and I gave him that opportunity to
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   LaMar has offered Gooden a roving minor league pitching position
within the Devil Rays' organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gave us everything he had,'' Tampa Bay manager Larry
Rothschild said. ''I think we're going to try and go younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was acquired from the Houston Astros on April 13 for cash
considerations, giving the former Cy Young Award winner an
opportunity to pitch at home.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Petersburg resident went 2-3 with 6.63 ERA in eight
starts for the Devil Rays. He won his first two decisions, then
went 0-3 and allowed 10 homers, 25 runs and 34 hits in 21 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was struggling ... it always tough to see a pitcher of his
caliber get released,'' Tampa Bay pitching coach Bill Fischer said.
''He made a lot good pitches and a lot of bad. He would run out of
gas a little sooner than he normally would.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden made one start for the Astros this season and was not
involved in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden is 190-110 in a major league career that began in 1984
with the New York Mets. He also pitched for the Yankees and
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a thrill in my career to catch a guy like Doc,'' Tampa
Bay catcher John Flaherty said. ''His best days are probably behind
him, but the way we went about his business, I just feel honored to
say that I was able to work with him. It's a sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   A four-time All-Star, Gooden was NL Rookie of the Year in 1984,
won the NL Cy Young Award at age 20 the following year and pitched
a no-hitter for the Yankees against Seattle on May 14, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Stocker has committed 11 errors in 40 games this season,
including two in the Devil Rays' 9-2 loss to Oakland on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no secret I'm here for my defense,'' Stocker said. ''I've
made 11 errors in six weeks. There's something wrong. I have to get
my head straight. I feel bad I didn't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocker was acquired from the Philadelphia Phillies for
outfielder Bobby Abreu on Nov. 18, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   LaMar did not rule out additional moves should the Devil Rays,
who started Thursday with a major league-worst record of 15-29,
continue struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a message, then so be it,'' LaMar said. ''Are
there going to be more moves? The players will dictate that. If we
start lacking in effort, if we start lacking in competitiveness on
nightly basis, then this will not be the last move.''

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays' Alvarez Has Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Devil Rays pitcher Wilson
Alvarez underwent season-ending arthroscopic shoulder surgery
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, who signed a five-year, $35 million free agent deal in
December 1997 had a partially torn left rotator cuff repaired by
Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez has not pitched his season. He has a 15-23 record with
Tampa Bay in 53 starts.
</P>
<P>
   A team spokesman said Alvarez should be ready by next spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   Another injured Tampa Bay starting pitcher, Juan Guzman, threw
four innings Thursday in an extended spring training game. Guzman,
on the 15-day disabled list with right shoulder tendinitis, could
return next month.

<HEADLINE> Gay Republicans Criticize Party  </HEADLINE>
By KELLY SHANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN (AP) -- The Log Cabin Republicans of Texas criticized the
state Republican party Thursday for not reaching out to gay and
lesbian voters. They pledged to set up an exhibit booth outside the
party's upcoming state convention.
</P>
<P>
   The group said Texas Gov. George W. Bush is not involved in the
convention planning because he is involved in his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently met with national gay leaders and the Log Cabin
Republicans national organization, which represents gay and lesbian
Republicans, is considering whether to endorse Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said the
specific issue of the booths should be settled by the state party.
But, he said: ''Governor Bush believes in treating all individuals
with dignity and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas group urged the state party to respond to its
requests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our group's message is simple -- one can be a Republican and
oppose discrimination,'' said Steve Labinski, president of the Log
Cabin Republicans of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The group contends the Republican Party of Texas has refused to
respond to its request to operate an information booth at the state
political convention June 15-17 at the George R. Brown Convention
Center in Houston. State party officials deny the group requested a
convention booth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of setting up inside the convention center, the group
will establish an information booth outside, Labinski said, adding
that more than 50 members of the gay Republican group are among the
8,700 delegates to the party's state convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans asked for booth space at the 1996
state convention in San Antonio but were turned down. The
organization sued the state party, but the Texas Supreme Court
ultimately sided with the GOP.

<HEADLINE> Public Funeral Set for Sealy Friday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Malik Sealy's family, teammates and friends
planned to gather Friday for the funeral of the Minnesota
Timberwolves player killed last weekend in a head-on crash in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The public service was scheduled for 10 a.m. at Riverside
Church, an interdenominational Christian church in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The man charged with three counts of vehicular homicide in
Sealy's death had his first court appearance postponed Thursday
because he was still hospitalized. It was rescheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said Souksangouane Phengsene, 43, of
Minneapolis, was driving the wrong way on Minnesota Highway 100
early Saturday morning when his pickup smashed into Sealy's sport
utility truck.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old player who helped the Timberwolves post their
best season in franchise history this year was returning from a
birthday celebration for teammate Kevin Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Phengsene had a blood-alcohol level of nearly
twice the legal limit. Sealy also had been drinking before the
crash, but his blood alcohol level was .08 percent, within the
legal limit of .10.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Urged To Give Up  </HEADLINE>
By LAURINDA KEYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Separatist rebels in Sri Lanka warned
the thousands of government troops defending the island's northern
city of Jaffna -- surrender by Friday or face a ''blood bath.''
</P>
<P>
   As the rebels pressed their offensive against Jaffna, their
clandestine radio station broadcast the ultimatum, saying soldiers
who laid down their arms by Friday at 6 p.m. would be handed over
to the International Red Cross within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you do not surrender, you will be responsible for your
fate. There will be a blood bath,'' said the Voice of Tigers radio,
monitored in the northern Sri Lankan town of Vavuniya. ''This is
your last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Friday deadline came soon after the rebels opened a new
front in the east, forcing the military to spread its soldiers to
guard areas where fighting had previously been sporadic.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels -- who have fought a 17-year war to establish an
independent homeland in the island's north and east for minority
Tamils -- are trying to recapture the city they used as a capital
from 1990-95.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the Sri Lankan government on
the rebel threat. But President Chandrika Kumaratunga has said in
newspaper interviews that her troops are in control of two-thirds
of the Jaffna peninsula and there was no question of a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring India and the United States support a Norwegian
effort to bring warring sides into peace talks in an effort to
avoid a bloody Jaffna siege, a top American diplomat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one that I know of has an answer'' to whether that will
happen, U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering told
journalists in New Delhi. ''I know that Norway is continuing its
contacts in an effort to try to avoid that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Washington and New Delhi were supporting the Norwegian
initiative of staying in touch with both parties to encourage them
to hold discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel broadcast is part of the ''psychological warfare''
against the soldiers, said H.K. Dua, an aide to Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   India has offered to help evacuate Sri Lankan troops if asked,
but has said it will not commit its own troops to the fight.
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi committed forces to Sri Lanka in 1987 to help enforce
a peace accord between the government and the rebels, but withdrew
its troops after more than 1,000 deaths at the hand of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The government's chief spokesman, Ariya Rubasinghe, said in a
faxed statement that troops backed by artillery and air cover
repulsed a rebel attack near Jaffna on Wednesday. He said 10 rebels
were killed, while eight soldiers died and 47 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting continued Thursday but was not as intense as on
Wednesday, when the rebels fired mortars on an army camp and an air
force base, according to the Sri Lankan government and TamilNet, a
Web site that provides the rebels' perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the military and the rebels cannot be verified
because neither side allows journalists into the war zone. The Sri
Lankan government also censors all news about the war and the
security situation.
</P>
<P>
   A land mine exploded Thursday in Vavuniya, killing two Tamil
politicians, local police said.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack. But similar
killings in the past have been blamed on the rebels.

<HEADLINE> CIA Scolds Six in Security Breach  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three current and three former senior CIA
officials, including former general counsel Michael O'Neil, have
been reprimanded or otherwise rebuked for their roles in an
investigation into former CIA Director John Deutch's home computer
security breaches, the CIA said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The actions against the six, administered this week by Air Force
Gen. John A. Gordon, the agency's deputy director, followed a
sharply critical report of the CIA's behavior by a presidential
advisory panel.
</P>
<P>
   The actions did not include a reprimand of CIA Director George
Tenet, who has also come under criticism, said CIA spokesman Bill
Harlow.
</P>
<P>
   However, Harlow said that Tenet recently met with President
Clinton on the matter. ''During that conversation, the director
acknowledged that he shared in the responsibility for shortcomings
identified in the report,'' Harlow said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch has admitted violating security rules by processing
classified documents on several home computers that had Internet
access through an America Online account, one that was also used by
other family members.
</P>
<P>
   His laxness was discovered after he left the CIA in December
1996. However, no action was taken against him until last August
when Tenet stripped him of his security clearances.
</P>
<P>
   Both Deutch's conduct and the CIA's follow-up probe are being
reviewed by the Justice Department's Criminal Division.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's statement, the agency conceded that the Justice
Department and congressional oversight panels should have been
notified sooner, and that ''more aggressive damage control efforts,
such as the immediate removal of the unclassified computers used by
Mr. Deutch, should have been initiated.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA statement said that three officials involved in the
follow-up investigation, including one still at the agency, were
''formally reprimanded in writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon ''formally admonished in writing'' two others, one of
them still at the agency; and ''orally admonished'' still another
who is still at the agency, the CIA said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA declined to identify any of the six, citing ''reasons of
personal privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But intelligence and congressional officials familiar with the
case who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that O'Neil, the
former general counsel, and former Executive Director Nora Slatkin
were among those receiving formal written reprimands -- the sharpest
category of criticism of the six individuals involved.
</P>
<P>
   Also among those to receive either reprimands or admonishments,
the officials said, were the agency's former inspector general,
Frederick Hitz, and Richard Calder, currently the deputy director
for administration.
</P>
<P>
   The other two names could not be immediately determined.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Spaeder, O'Neil's lawyer, confirmed that his client had
received a written reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sincerely regret and vigorously disagree with General
Gordon's decision to reprimand Mr. O'Neil in connection with the
Deutch matter,'' Spaeder said. ''While working at the CIA, Mr.
O'Neil at all times conducted himself with the best interests of
the agency in mind and in complete good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil declined to testify before the Senate Intelligence
Committee, citing Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil, a Washington lawyer, left the CIA in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential advisory panel chaired by former Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., this month criticized the CIA's internal
investigation of security violations by Deutch, faulting Tenet in
particular as well as other high-ranking officials for failing to
aggressively pursue the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Rudman report was classified, but those familiar with it
said it followed conclusions of a CIA inspector general's report,
later declassified, which accused O'Neil and Slatkin of fumbling
and delaying the CIA's initial investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports criticized the CIA for not reporting the home
computer security violations to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet removed himself from any further handling of the inquiry,
because of his own involvement, and turned matters over to Gordon,
the No. 2 man at the agency, to determine whether disciplinary
actions were warranted.
</P>
<P>
   The six reprimands-admonishments follow Gordon's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
who got a private briefing from Gordon this week, called the
reprimands ''a mild, if not weak, gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ''if anybody else had done this besides senior CIA
officials, they would have received much harsher punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his panel continues to investigate the matter, as does
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of us on the committee are still troubled by the whole
episode, especially the large volume mishandled classified
documents,'' Shelby said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Harlow, the CIA spokesman, said the agency planned no further
disciplinary actions, although it had taken ''steps to strengthen
and clarify agency procedures'' to better safeguard computer files
and to make sure suspected violations are reported more quickly.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: I'm Not Job Hunting Yet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) -- President Clinton says he's not
trying very hard to line up a new job to launch his post-White
House career.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters aboard his presidential jet Thursday,
Clinton said he is more focused on building his library, museum and
policy center in Little Rock, Ark., than on getting his next job.
</P>
<P>
   He said he tells those who approach him, ''Come see me in
January.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've really not done very much,'' Clinton said. He said his
library plans are a higher priority ''because you don't want it to
take forever and a day to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not say how many offers he has entertained. But he
brushed aside rumors that he might go to work for DreamWorks SKG,
run by his friends Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David
Geffen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Literally, the only thing I heard about that was in the
newspaper,'' Clinton said. ''Nobody has ever talked to me about it.
I've certainly never talked to anybody about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that, one month later, he still hears about
the short film he did last month lampooning his lame duck days in
the White House. ''I've had more comments about that than anything
I've done,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke as his jet was taking off from Providence,
R.I., where he attended a memorial service for the son of Derek
Shearer, a longtime friend who advised his 1992 campaign on
economic policy. Clinton lingered in the press cabin during
takeoff, perched on a tabletop with no seat belt.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Jeter To Play in Rehab Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter
reported no problems after his second full-scale workout Thursday
and is likely to play in minor league games Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, currently on the 15-day disabled list with a strained
abdominal muscle, is eligible to come off the DL on Saturday.
Manager Joe Torre hopes to have Jeter activated for Sunday night's
game against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter took approximately 10 minutes each of ground balls and
live batting practice, and also ran the bases Thursday at the
Yankees' player development center in Tampa Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going very well,'' Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is expected to play for Class A Tampa in a Florida State
League game Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter was hitless (0-for-13) in his last four games before being
pulled in the third inning May 11 game against Tampa Bay. This is
the second time Jeter, the AL's Rookie of the Year in 1996, has
gone on the DL. He was sidelined with an abdominal strain in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, meanwhile, met with his
high-ranking baseball officials for the fourth consecutive day
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are thought to be interested in a number of strong
offensive players, including Detroit's Juan Gonzalez. Others
reportedly include Kansas City's Johnny Damon, the Chicago Cubs'
Sammy Sosa, Tampa Bay's Jose Canseco and Baltimore's B.J. Surhoff.

<HEADLINE> 29 Freed U.N. Peacekeepers Return  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Freed U.N. peacekeepers complained
Thursday of harsh treatment at the hands of their rebel captors and
said injured peacekeepers still being held are not being given
medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   The 29 U.N. peacekeepers, who were freed earlier this week on
the border with neighboring Liberia, were flown back to Sierra
Leone on Thursday to rejoin their units. Some 260 peacekeepers are
still being held by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The freed peacekeepers, all from Zambia, said their captive
colleagues are not receiving proper medical treatment at the rebel
camps and villages in eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   One peacekeeper, who declined to give his name, said the injured
were becoming weaker by the day due to a lack of care.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials have put the number of wounded at 30 to 40. The
freed peacekeepers said they could not give any figures because the
captives are being held in several different places.
</P>
<P>
   When the peacekeepers were captured, a group of 50 was crammed
into a 15-seat bus and driven to a tiny village where they were
kept for three weeks, the soldiers said.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers released earlier have spoken of being tied up, and
receiving as little as one banana or one mango a day for food.
</P>
<P>
   The 29 peacekeepers are the most recent group of U.N. captives
to be freed by Revolutionary United Front rebels, who seized nearly
500 U.N. hostages more than three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have released 233 peacekeepers. Most of the remaining
hostages are also from Zambia, according to U.N. spokesman David
Wimhurst.
</P>
<P>
   Liberian President Charles Taylor, who has close ties to the
rebels, has been helping negotiate the freedom of the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst expressed hope that more releases would take place in
advance of a regional summit this weekend in Nigeria, which is
expected to focus on the turmoil in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. spokesman also expressed condolences for two
journalists killed in an ambush by the rebels on Wednesday, Miguel
Gil Moreno de Mora, a cameramen for Associated Press Television
News, and Kurt Schork, a correspondent for Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deaths have shocked and saddened us all,'' Wimhurst said.
''These two men were both very fine journalists and experienced war
correspondents and their loss is being felt far beyond this
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Reuters journalists were also injured in Wednesday's attack
near Rogberi Junction, 50 miles northeast of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government troops and the rebels have clashed repeatedly in
recent weeks, but no other shooting incidents were reported over
the past 24 hours, Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   About 11,000 U.N. peacekeepers are now in Sierra Leone, seeking
to stabilize a country devastated by a civil war that began in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the British government said Thursday that Sierra
Leone has pledged to stop using child soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The use of fighters under 18 was widespread during the civil
war, with both rebels and the government forces including children
their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Office said Britain's High Commissioner to Sierra
Leone, Alan Jones, had won assurances from Sierra Leonean president
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah that all soldiers aged under 18 would be
demobilized from pro-government forces and sent home.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Protest Election in Peru  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Hundreds of protesters attacked Peru's
election headquarters Thursday, breaking windows with rocks and
sledge hammers and burning tires at the front door, to demand
postponement of the presidential runoff.
</P>
<P>
   President Alberto Fujimori is pushing ahead with Sunday's vote
despite threats of international isolation, violent protests and a
foe who refuses to take part. Challenger Alejandro Toledo again
demanded a delay so international monitors can guarantee a fair
election.
</P>
<P>
   If the voting takes places, ''Alberto Fujimori's government will
be illegitimate, a source of permanent instability, and I don't
think it can last more than six to 12 months,'' Toledo said
Thursday prior to a huge rally in the northern fishing port of
Chimbote.
</P>
<P>
   The National Election Board confirmed Thursday that the runoff
would take place Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the joint delegation from the U.S.-based National
Democratic Institute and Carter Center canceled plans to monitor
the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''The election on May 28 will not meet minimal international
standards for a credible, democratic election,'' said Barry Levitt,
a senior political analyst with the delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Police used tear gas and water cannons to clear out tens of
thousands of workers and university students who clogged Lima's
colonial downtown in response to a call from leftist-led unions.
Protests also took place in Arequipa, Peru's second-largest city
and a bastion of anti-Fujimori sentiment, and Cuzco, a tourist
mecca high in the Andes.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the offices of the National Election Board came
after officials said software for tabulating votes successfully
passed a second test Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Monitors from the Organization of American States agreed that
test results indicated the new software was capable of eliminating
the problems presented in the first test over the weekend. But they
insisted the elections be postponed at least 10 days to give their
own experts time to evaluate the software.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's running mate, Francisco Tudela, said that any
decision rests with the National Election Board, not the
government. Fujimori's appointees control the board. He blamed
Toledo for creating the conditions that have put in doubt the
legitimacy of Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union added its voice to those of foreign
governments and international organizations calling for a
postponement.
</P>
<P>
   A victory on Sunday would bring the iron-fisted Fujimori a third
five-year term in power.
</P>
<P>
   ''The victory would be viewed as illegitimate,'' said Arturo
Porzecanski, chief economist for the Americas at the New York
financial firm ING Barings. ''I think the U.S. government, European
governments and many Latin American governments will distance
themselves from Peru in various ways -- diplomatically, in trade, in
financial support. I see isolation descending on Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   He said international sentiment is far different from 1992 when
Fujimori temporarily shut down Congress and the Supreme Court,
accusing them of blocking his efforts to battle leftist guerillas
and undertake economic reforms. At the time, Porzecanski said, many
governments were sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Three new polls released Thursday gave Fujimori a lead of 8 to
10 percentage points over Toledo, who insists he remains a
candidate but won't take part in Sunday's vote. Pollsters said
Toledo had lost support because he was focusing on denouncing fraud
instead of dealing with issues viewed as more important by voters
such as creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Within Fujimori's government, hard-liners linked to the armed
forces appeared to be edging out moderates who were pushing to
postpone the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government doesn't seem to be trying to find a way to
justify the postponement, but instead is beginning the job of
damage control,'' said political analyst Mirko Lauer.

<HEADLINE> Indians 4, Tigers 1  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- David Justice and Jim Thome homered and Dave
Burba continued his mastery over Detroit as the Cleveland Indians
snapped the Tigers' four-game winning streak with a 4-1 victory
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Burba (4-1), seeking his first decision in five starts since
April 28, held the Tigers to four hits with five walks and seven
strikeouts in 7 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Burba, who was 3-0 against Detroit last season, improved to 6-0
lifetime against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moehler (1-3), making his second start since an emergency
appendectomy April 22, gave up three runs on eight hits with no
walks in 7 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The well-pitched contest followed free-swinging 10-4 and 10-9
Detroit wins in the first two games of the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   After Omar Vizquel grounded into a first-inning double play,
Justice -- moved from sixth to third in the order in a lineup change
just before the game -- homered into the right-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The game settled into a nice pitching duel between Burba and
Moehler, who had allowed only seven hits between them until the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, the Tigers had runners on first and second with
one out after Burba walked two. But the threat fizzled when Bobby
Higginson struck out and Gregg Jefferies was caught trying to steal
third for an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez started the two-run Cleveland seventh with a
double and Thome followed with a long homer, his 13th, over the
wall near the flagpole in left-center on a 3-0 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez tripled and scored on Richie Sexson's sacrifice fly in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Burba gave up a single and a walk in the Detroit eighth and
reliever Steve Karsay was greeted by Gregg Jefferies' RBI single.
Karsay finished for his ninth save.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Cleveland's lineup changes were necessary because Kenny
Lofton, who was leading off in the original lineup, was scratched
shortly before the game with a sore left elbow. ... Indians RHP
Jaret Wright, who went on the 15-day disabled list May 18, will
return to start Saturday against the Chicago White Sox. ... Roberto
Alomar extended his hitting streak to 17 straight games. ... The
Indians have homered in 16 straight games, two shy of the club
record set in 1959 and matched in 1996.

Fed Probers Breach Security
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Posing as law enforcement officers, congressional
investigators with fake IDs were waved unchallenged through the entrances of
Washington's most secure government buildings and even into some Cabinet
secretaries' offices, officials said today. Over the past three months, the
General Accounting Office investigators faked their way into 19 federal agencies
and two airports -- including the FBI, the Pentagon, the CIA, the Justice
Department and the State Department. The exercise exposed how age-old cop-to-cop
courtesies could be a security breach.

Five Die From E. Coli in Canada

   WALKERTON, Ontario (AP) -- A fifth victim died today in one of the worst E.
coli outbreaks in North America as residents angrily questioned officials on how
the bacteria entered their water supply. Hundreds of people in the southern
Ontario town of Walkerton have been sickened by the potentially deadly germ,
which was first detected in municipal well water last week. More than 50 people
showed up for treatment or follow-up visits for E coli infection today, and six
patients remained hospitalized here. Ten others, including three in critical
condition, have been transferred to other hospitals. Doctors from around the
region were converging on South Bruce-Grey Health Center to help the beleaguered
staff deal with the most severe E. coil outbreak known in Canada.

Researchers Identify Killer Virus

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A virus that killed 106 people in outbreaks during 1998
and 1999 in Malaysia and Singapore has been identified as a new viral species
capable of infecting both animals and humans. A study appearing tomorrow in the
journal Science said the virus has been named Nipah and researchers said it is
closely related to another new virus called Hendra. Unlike other members of the
virus family, which generally infect only one type of animal, Nipah and Hendra
are capable of infecting a variety of animals -- dogs, cats, pigs, bats, horses
and humans. Most animals recover from the virus, but it is lethal to about 40
percent of human patients.

Cuba, along with their adult family members. Elian was wearing a red shirt and
blue jeans. Gregory Craig, the lawyer for Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,

States Want To Limit Calif. Water

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For decades, Southern California has used more than its
share of Colorado River water to fill swimming pools and grow crops, but now its
upstream neighbors are threatening to turn off the tap. Representatives of
California and six other states, meeting behind closed doors in Phoenix, were on
the verge of a historic agreement today that would give California a 15-year
deadline to cut its use of water -- the West's most prized natural resource. If
California failed to follow through with a series of interim water-saving steps,
the 15-year grace period would end immediately and upriver states could start
withholding water.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 6, Devil Rays 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Gil Heredia pitched seven effective
innings and Olmedo Saenz homered and drove in three runs as the
Oakland Athletics beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 6-3 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, who improved to a major league-leading 14-8 on the
road, took two of three from Tampa Bay to open a nine-game road
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia (6-3) has won five of his past six starts. The
right-hander, who entered with the AL's second-lowest road ERA
(1.03), gave up five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Over 33 1-3 innings away from the Coliseum, Heredia has allowed
four earned runs and 29 hits, winning all five of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   Saenz hit a second-inning solo homer and added a two-run triple
during a four-run fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Isringhausen got three outs for his ninth save.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn went 3-for-4, including a two-run homer in the
eighth inning for Tampa Bay. The Devil Rays have dropped seven
straight series and are 2-9 in their past 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Yan (2-2) gave up six runs and eight hits over 4 1-3
innings. It was the fourth straight game and 19th time this season
the Tampa Bay starter failed to go five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Saenz got his 11th start at first base so Jason Giambi could
have a partial day off as the designated hitter. His third homer
put the Athletics up 1-0 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Saenz caught a break when Tampa Bay left fielder
Quinton McCracken and center fielder Gerald Williams collided,
resulting in a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada hit an RBI single and Ramon Hernandez knocked in
run with a groundout as Oakland went up 5-0 after four innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Devil Rays released RHP Dwight Gooden and SS Kevin
Stocker. RHP Albie Lopez will replace Gooden in the rotation. Ozzie
Guillen and Felix Martinez, who was recalled from Triple-A Durham,
will share time at short. ... Tampa Bay also brought up LHP Doug
Creek from Durham. ... The Athletics are the only major league team
with a winning road record (14-8) and losing mark at home (10-16).
... Heredia has won all three career starts against Tampa Bay.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Military Accepts Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile's top military commander on
Thursday said the country's armed forces laments but accepts a
court ruling that stripped Gen. Augusto Pinochet of his immunity
from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Army chief Gen. Ricardo Izurieta's remarks appeared likely to
ease tensions stemming from the Pinochet case, as the military
retains considerable political clout in a country it ruled
uncontested under Pinochet for 17 years until 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Izurieta said the military also fully supports civilian
President Ricardo Lagos, a socialist who was jailed for a time
under Pinochet's dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos' government has refused to interfere in legal actions
against Pinochet, saying they are matters for the courts. Pinochet
followers insist Lagos can and should protect the retired general.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's older son, also named Augusto, insisted Thursday that
Lagos should help his embattled father -- or face a crisis similar
to the one in which Pinochet toppled elected Marxist President
Salvador Allende in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   His father's situation ''is planting the seed of a deep division
among Chileans, and when this happens, the result may be a
situation like the one in September 1973,'' Pinochet's son said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of coup, Chile faced a major political and economic
crisis, marked by strong and often violent political clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Santiago Court of Appeals voted behind closed doors Tuesday,
and although it did not immediately disclose its decision, it was
quickly leaked: the vote was 13-9 to strip Pinochet of his
congressional immunity, paving the way for his prosecution on human
rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the decision was leaked, Gen. Izurieta visited the
ailing 84-year-old former ruler in his heavily guarded Santiago
residence, a visit he described today as a show of ''institutional
support'' for Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official report, 3,191 people died or
disappeared under Pinochet's 1973-90 regime. More than 100 lawsuits
have been filed against him stemming from that era.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Supreme Court uphold the ruling against Pinochet, he
would face prosecution for the disappearance of 19 of 75 victims of
the so-called ''Caravan of Death,'' a military group that toured
several cities soon after the coup, dragging prisoners from jail
and executing them.

<HEADLINE> Judge Throws Out USDA Meat Testing  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge struck down the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's testing program to detect salmonella contamination in
ground beef processing plants, saying it does not fairly evaluate
whether a plant is sanitary.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joe Fish agreed Thursday with arguments from
Supreme Beef Inc. that the USDA exceeded its authority by pulling
inspectors from the Dallas plant, effectively shutting it down,
after the plant failed tougher salmonella inspection standards.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials said that the testing program ensures raw ground
beef is safe for consumers and that they the ruling would be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the ruling ''threatens
to turn back the clock on the significant progress this
administration and many in industry have made to improve food
safety for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his ruling, the judge wrote: ''Because the USDA
performance standards and salmonella tests do not necessarily
evaluate the conditions of a meat processor's establishment, they
cannot serve as the basis for finding a plant's meat adulterated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indeed, a plant could, in theory, be completely sanitized from
top to bottom, but if the meat in it tests positive for salmonella,
the USDA could withdraw its inspectors, effectively closing a plant
that is sanitary.''
</P>
<P>
   The USDA withdrew its inspectors from the Supreme Beef plant
Nov. 30, but was forced to send them back later in the day when
Fish granted a temporary restraining order. The plant had failed
three salmonella tests.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Beef, a supplier of meat to the federal school lunch
program, said the rules were arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   ''With today's victory, we look forward to continuing to focus
on providing our customers with the safe, wholesome, high quality
meat products that they have enjoyed for the past 30 years,'' said
company president Steven Spiritas.
</P>
<P>
   James Ratchford, spokesman for the American Meat Institute, said
the group is recommending the USDA bring together representatives
of the industry and scientific experts to determine how a
scientifically based standard could be designed.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella kills an estimated 550 people and causes 1.4 million
illnesses annually in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Tucker Foreman, director of the Consumer Federation of
America's Food Policy Institute, urged the USDA to halt all
purchases of ground beef for federal feeding programs.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 5, Mariners 1  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mike Mussina pitched seven strong innings to
earn his first win since April 29, and the Baltimore Orioles
completed a three-game sweep of the Seattle Mariners with a 5-1
victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle starter Paul Abbott left in the fourth inning after
being struck in the face by the broken bat of Harold Baines. As
Abbott bent over to pick up Baines' grounder, the upper part of the
severed bat struck the right-hander below the right eye.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott lay on the mound for several minutes before rising and
leaving the field on a stretcher. He was treated for a cut on the
bridge of his nose and taken to a hospital for precautionary
X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields and Jeff Conine drove in two runs apiece for
the Orioles, whose three-game winning streak is their longest since
a six-game run April 15-22.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina (2-6) struck out a season-best nine in ending a
career-high four-game losing streak. He allowed five hits, walked
two and did not allow an earned run.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second victory by a Baltimore starter in 22
games since Mussina beat Texas on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez drove in the lone run for the Mariners, who have
lost seven straight to Baltimore. Martinez has at least one RBI in
nine of his last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Rodriguez (2-1) took his place and gave up three runs in
2 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore went up 5-1 with a three-run seventh. After B.J.
Surhoff drove in a run with a two-out single off Arthur Rhodes,
Conine hit for Baines and grounded a two-run double to left on the
first pitch from Jose Paniagua.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, who entered the game in a 4-for-45 skid, went 2-for-3
with a walk. It was his first multihit game since May 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles got a run in the third when Mike Bordick walked,
Brady Anderson doubled and DeShields hit a run-scoring groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle pulled even in the fourth when Martinez drove in an
unearned run with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore used a familiar formula to regain the lead in the
fifth. Bordick walked, took third on a single by Anderson and
scored on DeShields' grounder to second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mussina is 11-3 lifetime against Seattle. ... Mariners
pinch-hitters are 3-for-22 with no RBIs this year. ... Martinez has
hit safely in 21 of his last 22 games. ... Anderson has eight
multihit games in his last 11 starts.

<HEADLINE> Gore Meets Party Leaders  </HEADLINE>
By DARLENE SUPERVILLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- It's time to work, not panic, despite
lagging poll figures for Al Gore, Democratic officials from around
the country said Thursday. The likely Democratic presidential
nominee told supporters he faces ''a good, healthy, hard fight''
that he will win.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made the comments after meeting the Democratic officials
for a combination strategy session and pep rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody said it is terrible. Everybody understands that this is
going to be a long campaign,'' said Mark Brewer, Michigan
Democratic chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged the tough campaign, but reassured supporters
he will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a real good healthy hard fight ahead of us and we're
going to win it and we're going to win it solidly,'' Gore told
several hundred at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser
Thursday night expected to bring in $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gore privately addressed 72 Democratic leaders from 34
states, and took questions and answers about everything from health
care to George W. Bush's $460 billion tax-cut plan, according to
Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer described the gathering as relaxed, and others said there
was little concern that Gore's ''message'' might not be reaching
voters, while his Republican rival appears to be doing well among
Americans on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter whether he gets (his message) across or not
now, it will matter after the convention, it will matter after
Labor Day,'' said Paul Berendt, Washington state Democratic
chairman. ''You don't fight the battle in May that you fight in
October.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at a YMCA, the vice president added to his plans for
working families by proposing a tax credit to help them enroll
young people in after-school programs. Bush, too, has been
emphasizing education.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trouble doesn't stop when a child becomes a teen-ager,'' said
Gore, who has raised four.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential contender also said he wants every
school to stay open late and for the government to ''dramatically''
increase funding for the school-based 21st Century Learning Centers
that help communities provide programs after school and during
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Schools shouldn't close their doors when children need them
the most,'' Gore told about 100 parents, children and employees
gathered in a gym at the Donelson-Hermitage YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the proposals would help up to 10 million young
people.
</P>
<P>
   He previously had promised to invest $115 billion in education
over 10 years on various proposals, including universal preschool,
expanded Head Start, new schools and teacher bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's address to the party leaders came during a long-planned
meeting as recent polls show him 5 to 10 points behind Bush
nationally and down in some key states, and as some party officials
have questioned the low-key campaign he has run since sealing the
nomination in March.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the chairmen were at least outwardly unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   Putting it in folksy terms, Molly Beth Malcolm, Democratic
chairwoman from Bush's home state of Texas, said, ''Bush is so new
and he's a nice guy, but he's one of those guys you want to go out
and date in college. You know you'll have a good time, but he's not
who anybody wants to marry.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said Gore's poll numbers were reminiscent of President
Clinton's at various points in the 1992 and 1996 campaigns, as well
as President Bush's against Michael Dukakis in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   And Barbara Kay Allen, North Carolina chairwoman, said she
thinks Gore is in good shape. ''He shouldn't peak too early. He
shouldn't spend money too totally upfront, and he's been wise about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said it is a good idea for a national campaign to
involve state party chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''You shouldn't send teams from Washington into rural areas of a
state and tell people what to do. This campaign gets that,'' Allen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the YMCA address, delivered in a gym decorated with the
water-colored rainbows and tissue-paper flowers of the children who
play there, a smiling Gore spent a few minutes watching 10 kids
play basketball before he joined them on the hard court.
</P>
<P>
   He asked them what they would be doing if they didn't come to
the center. ''Stupid stuff,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks on education -- an issue that Bush also is
focusing on -- Gore ran though a list of statistics to bolster his
case for improving and expanding after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   In seven of 10 households, he said, both parents work all day.
The number of single-parent families has quadrupled in the past
three decades and at least 5 million children are left unsupervised
at home after school each week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also repeated a Justice Department finding
that youngsters are most at risk of being victimized by crime or
drugs after school -- between the hours of 3 p.m. and 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''Government doesn't raise children, families do,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''No policy proposal can teach a child right from wrong ... but
we can make it easier, not harder, to be a strong family.''

<HEADLINE> Elian Is Moved to Washington  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez and his family left their rural
retreat on Maryland's Eastern Shore Thursday and relocated at a
historic house in Washington near the home of Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Four vans pulled up at the house at 7:40 p.m. EDT carrying the
Gonzalez family, his teacher and four playmates from Cuba, along
with their adult family members. Elian was wearing a red shirt and
blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the lawyer for Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, said the family was moving to the capital so that the
father can have more immediate access to Craig. The lawyer lives in
the same Cleveland Park neighborhood of northwest Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The family had lived at the Maryland retreat for a month.
</P>
<P>
   The first concrete sign that the Gonzalez family was moving to a
house in the capital occurred Thursday evening when the head of
Cuba's diplomatic mission, Fernando Remirez, drove up to the
residence.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-century farmhouse is the headquarters of Youth for
Understanding, International Exchange, which promotes exchanges
involving high school students from the United States and foreign
countries. It is just blocks away from the vice president's mansion
on the grounds of the Naval Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden fence surrounds the two-story house, which boasts a
large yard. The house is called Rosedale Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Margery Landry, 46, who lives a half-block away, said she
considered having Elian and his entourage in her neighborhood
''part of the things that make city living interesting. But when
you come home and see the television towers (on news vans) and the
people shouting, it brings it a little too close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Terry Blackwelder, 52, was somewhat concerned
when she returned home from her job as a school librarian Thursday
and saw helicopters circling in the sky. At first, she said, she
thought a crime had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's very disruptive in the neighborhood,'' she said,
citing the media crowd outside Rosedale Farm. ''We have a nice,
quite family neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Len Doran, an official at the location, said Thursday afternoon
the group was approached by Craig about allowing the Gonzalez
family to remain there but that no commitment was made.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Youth for Understanding, Sally Grooms Cowal,
said her group has no position on the legal issues surrounding
Elian's case. ''Those questions are for the courts to decide,'' she
said in a statement distributed to reporters at the house Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell of the National
Council of Churches, who has supported Juan Miguel Gonzalez's
desire for Elian's return to Cuba, said the family needed to get
away from the Maryland retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're just ready to do something different,''
Campbell said. ''It's a very beautiful, but very isolated, place.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said the stay of the Gonzalez family in Maryland enabled
them to ''recover from the tragedy and trauma of recent months.''
</P>
<P>
   The family is awaiting a court decision on whether Elian can
return to Cuba, as his father wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Washington was characterized by the Cuban government
Thursday as a step toward the 6-year-old's ''liberation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All that is lacking now is the definite liberation: the return
of all of them to Cuba,'' according to a statement read on state
television Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was the victim of a shipwreck off the Florida coast
during a crossing from Cuba that claimed the life of his mother
last November. He was rescued and spent five months with relatives
in Miami before federal agents seized him in a gunpoint raid on
April 22 and delivered him to his father.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 7, White Sox 0  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Ramiro Mendoza pitched a four-hitter and Ricky
Ledee drove in three runs Thursday night as the New York Yankees
ended James Baldwin's nine-game winning streak, beating the Chicago
White Sox 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   In their second straight offensive outburst -- they'd scored 12
runs Wednesday night with 18 hits -- the Yankees scored all of their
runs with two outs. They finished with 12 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza (5-2) allowed two singles to Ray Durham and one each to
Herbert Perry and Chris Singleton in pitching the second complete
game and shutout of his career. The first was against Minnesota on
May 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their slump -- they had lost eight of 11 before the
consecutive wins -- the Yankees headed home tied with Boston for the
AL East lead. The Yankees and Red Sox start a three-game series
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago heads into a weekend series against visiting Cleveland
atop the AL Central, a half-game in front of the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin (7-1) gave up three runs in both the second and third
innings, losing for the first time in 10 starts since the Yankees
beat him last Sept. 21. He gave up seven runs and 10 hits in 5 2-3
innings, dropping to 1-5 against New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee hit a two-out RBI double in the second and Scott Brosius
followed with his second homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added three in the third, loading the bases with two
outs on Paul O'Neill's single, Tino Martinez's double and an
intentional walk to Jorge Posada. Shane Spencer hit an RBI single
and Ledee followed with another single for a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson Delgado hit his first major league homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Baldwin has allowed 12 homers, all solo except for Brosius'
two-run shot in the second. ... White Sox 1B Paul Konerko left in
the fourth inning, two innings after fouling a pitch off his left
foot. When the Yankees scored three times in the third, Konerko was
slow to react to grounders by O'Neill and Martinez that went for
hits. ... A man clad only in his underpants and white socks went
racing across the outfield in the top of the eighth before security
took him away. ... Delgado had three hits to tie a career high.

<HEADLINE> UN OKs Bill To Halt Child Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In an effort to halt the use of child
soldiers, the General Assembly Thursday approved an amendment
calling for governments to take ''all feasible measures'' to
prevent troops under the age of 18 from taking part in combat.
</P>
<P>
   The new language in the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
Child would bar all forced recruitment of minors, whether by
regular armies or by rebel forces, and calls on governments to
raise the minimum age for voluntary recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   For those governments that do allow people under 18 years old to
join the armed forces, the General Assembly urged they at least
ensure recruitment is truly voluntary and conducted with parental
consent.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.N. figures, more than 300,000 minors -- and some
as young as 7 years old -- are reportedly fighting in wars around
the world, including in such places as Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Colombia, Angola, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly adopted a resolution adopting the changes
without a vote on Thursday. The consensus decision paves the way
for governments to start signing the protocol beginning June 5 at
the start of a major U.N. women's conference.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. agencies and rights campaigners have been trying for years
to raise the age limit on military recruits from 15 to 18. The
United States, which allows voluntary enlistment at 17, has been
opposed to that limit.
</P>
<P>
   Only the United States and Somalia have yet to ratify the child
rights convention.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was among the countries that in January
blocked the endorsement of a total ban on recruitment of people
under age 18.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, children are routinely used by both rebels and
pro-government forces -- as evidenced by a photo published Wednesday
in a British newspaper of a boy soldier, who said he was 14,
holding what appeared to be a British-supplied rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which has sent some 800 troops to Sierra Leone, has
committed itself to supplying the country with weapons, ammunition
and training as it battles rebels of the Revolutionary United
Front. After the photo was published, the Foreign Office announced
it had won assurances from the Sierra Leonean government to not use
child soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Ross Shelves Medical School Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASPER, Wyo. (AP) -- Blaming opposition from the medical
profession, Caribbean-based Ross University has shelved plans to
build a two-year medical school in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The decision closes a nearly two-year-long chapter in local
economic development that sparked local, state and national debates
over foreign medical schools opening branches on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision to delay the project for the foreseeable future
was based on the simple fact that the university cannot afford to
invest in Wyoming when the object of the investment, new students,
will not be given the same opportunities as our students in
Dominica,'' Ross University President Neal Simon said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ross University School of Medicine is accredited in the
Commonwealth of Dominica.
</P>
<P>
   Ross faced opposition from some in the medical profession who
questioned the school's standards and chances of winning
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming Medical Society last year asked the American Medical
Association to oppose the plan. It would have meant the first
for-profit medical school to be built in the U.S. in nearly 90
years.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hard-Liner Withdraws  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
resigned Thursday from the incoming parliament, state radio
announced, depriving hard-liners of a leading figure in the power
struggle between conservatives and reformists.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani was expected to be nominated by hard-line legislators
for the influential post of parliamentary speaker. The new
parliament convenes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   His decision came a day after reformists -- who have aligned
themselves behind President Mohammad Khatami -- shouted slogans
against him at a Tehran University demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter from the ex-president, broadcast on Thursday, he
announced his withdrawal from the slate of legislators elected to
parliament on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''I appreciate those who voted for me and I respect those who
did not,'' the letter quoted Rafsanjani as saying. ''I entered the
election race to try to protect national unity and I withdraw now
for the same reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Later the radio quoted Rafsanjani as blaming his withdrawal on
''a heavy volume of negative and false propaganda'' against him in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani was the most prominent hard-liner to win a seat in
the 290-seat parliament, or Majlis. However, reformist candidates
won the most votes in the polls, taking control of the parliament
for the first time since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The election's initial vote count showed reformist candidates
winning 29 of the 30 seats in the capital, Tehran. The 30th-ranked
seat was won by Rafsanjani, a result widely seen as humiliating for
a former president and influential member of the ruling hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Guardian Council, a hard-line body that supervised
the polls, alleged widespread fraud in Tehran and began a recount.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the council announced the final results for
the capital city, giving only 26 seats to reformists. Two seats
went to hard-liners, including one to Rafsanjani, and two
reformists' victories annulled.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed Rafsanjani had jumped to No. 20 in the list
of successful candidates in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani was president from 1989-97 and served two terms
previously as speaker of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He remains a powerful figure as the head of the Expediency
Council, a policy-making body, and as a key adviser to Iran's
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

<HEADLINE> GOP Files Complaint Over Ads  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- The Republican Party has filed a complaint
with the Federal Election Commission over advertisements being
aired by an attorney running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The ads don't directly mention Democrat Ed Bernstein's
candidacy, they instead focus on the lawyer and his practice, but
state GOP leaders say Bernstein's intention is to gain an unfair
advantage over his opponent, Rep. John Ensign.
</P>
<P>
   An addendum filed Wednesday to their complaint argues that the
television and billboard ads amount to illegal corporate campaign
contributions from his law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bernstein has officially filed with the Secretary of State and
the FEC, however, his face remains on corporate-financed billboards
across Nevada and his law firm commercials continue to air touting
him as a caring person,'' said Ryan Erwin, executive director of
Nevada's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The latest billboard, with a legal assistant saying ''Ed
Bernstein cares,'' was posted this week.

   Bernstein maintains he should be able to run his business as he
always has. He says the ads have no connection to the campaign and
don't carry any campaign themes.

<HEADLINE> Rams' Warner Honored by Arena Team  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Kurt Warner's sudden rise to fame has
brought him endorsement deals, appearances with Jay Leno and Billy
Graham and more speaking engagements than he can count.
</P>
<P>
   It also saved him from a speeding ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who came out of nowhere to quarterback the St. Louis
Rams to the Super Bowl championship, returned to his home state to
have his jersey number retired by his former Arena League team, the
Iowa Barnstormers, during Thursday night's game with Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in a police car with his wife, Brenda, and their
oldest children, son Zach and daughter Jesse. It reminded Warner of
an earlier incident with a police officer in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   En route to a Red Cross benefit, Warner said he was pulled over
shortly after entering the state for going 19 mph over the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ''He comes up and recognizes me and says, 'Hey, it's a pleasure
to meet you,''' Warner said. ''I'm thinking 'All right, I'm in good
shape.'''
</P>
<P>
   Warner, the Super Bowl and NFL MVP, got off with a warning -- and
a favor.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'There's one thing you could do for me.' I'm
thinking, 'Yeah, sure, you just saved me a couple of hundred
bucks,''' Warner said. ''He asked if I would get out of my truck
and go back in front of the squad car and wave into his camera so
that his son would really believe that he pulled over Kurt
Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   Life certainly has become more interesting -- and hectic -- for
Warner, who only a few years ago was bagging groceries and stocking
shelves in a supermarket. Just last week, he made national news
when his appendix was removed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so many good things that come out of it, but it is
hard, especially as a mother,'' Brenda said. ''I want to protect my
children. And that gets harder. Jesse and I try to have girls'
night and go shopping and I have to stop and give autographs. How
goofy is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has not thrown a football since his May 16
appendectomy, Warner said he began working out again Monday and
will be ready for minicamp next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great,'' Warner said. ''I think I could suit up and
play tonight if coach needed me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You'd have to play in a different number, though,''
Barnstormers coach John Gregory said.
</P>
<P>
   As flashbulbs popped throughout the stands and the crowd
cheered, Warner and his family stood in a spotlight at halftime and
watched as a larger-than-life replica of his No. 13 Barnstormers'
jersey was raised above the scoreboard at one end of the arena.
</P>
<P>
   The team also presented Warner a regular-sized jersey in a
picture frame.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was back bagging groceries, nobody knew I was going to
do this,'' Warner said. ''Thanks to the Iowa Barnstormers, I got an
opportunity. I'm proud to be a part of Arena Football and hope I
can be a great spokesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner still does not have a contract for next season. He said
the negotiations were still ''up in the air'' and he was leaving
everything to his agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to get involved in any way, shape or form,''
Warner said. ''I'm going to worry about playing football. I'm very
confident that something will get done, that hopefully it will be a
long-term deal and we won't have to move around any more.
</P>
<P>
   ''But a lot of it is in their hands. They know where we stand,
that I want to be there. It's up to them to see what level they
want to come to me and whether they want to make that commitment to
me as their starting quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who's from Cedar Rapids in eastern Iowa, played three
seasons with the Barnstormers, throwing 186 touchdown passes and
twice leading them to the Arena League championship game.

Fed Probers Breach Security
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials said today that congressional investigators,
posing as law enforcement officers with fake IDs, were waved unchallenged
through the entrances of Washington's most secure government buildings and even
into some Cabinet secretaries' offices. Over the past three months, the General
Accounting Office investigators faked their way into 19 federal agencies and two
airports -- including the FBI, the Pentagon, the CIA, the Justice Department and
the State Department. The exercise exposed how age-old cop-to-cop courtesies
could be a security breach.

New Plan To Protect Fragile Water

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration plans broad new protections for
fragile stretches of sea, beach and reef -- a system of ocean preserves that
could eventually mirror the system of protected forest and parks on land,
environmental groups said today. On Friday, President Clinton plans to direct
federal agencies to come up with a quick plan for protecting Hawaiian coral
reefs and a longer-term plan for addressing threats to other marine areas,
private organizations involved in the effort said. His plans do not require
action by Congress, but could be undone by the next president.

   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ethiopia's capital erupted in a singing,
dancing, horn-honking celebration Thursday at word the military had broken
Eritrea's army in a border showdown that could prove the most pivotal battle of
the 2-year-old Horn of Africa war. But what Ethiopia called a rout, Eritrea
called a withdrawal -- not a surrender, and probably not yet an end to the
fighting that is consuming lives and resources of two of the world's most

   WALKERTON, Ontario (AP) -- A fifth victim died today in one of the worst E.
coli outbreaks in North America as residents angrily questioned officials on how
the bacteria entered their water supply. Hundreds of people in the southern
Ontario town of Walkerton have been sickened by the potentially deadly germ,
which was first detected in municipal well water last week. More than 50 people
showed up for treatment or follow-up visits for E coli infection today, and six
patients remained hospitalized here. Ten others, including three in critical
condition, have been transferred to other hospitals. Doctors from around the
region were converging on South Bruce-Grey Health Center to help the beleaguered

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Atlantis' astronauts wrapped up
their maintenance work inside the international space station today and got
ready to seal the complex back up for the next visitors. One of four newly
installed batteries exhibited irregular readings while being charged, but NASA
said that the trouble appeared to be a bad communication link and that the
battery was fine. All 10 new smoke detectors also were declared to be in good
working order, despite earlier concerns. The only handyman job remaining before
the closing of the hatches between the spacecraft, planned for early Friday, was
the replacement of a broken fan. Atlantis and its crew of seven are due to
undock from the space station Friday evening after nearly a week of linked

Officials Warn Of Contaminated Public Pools
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- With the summer swimming season approaching, government
health officials today began a campaign to warn of the rise in illnesses caused
by contaminated public pools. The outbreaks generally led to stomach problems
and diarrhea caused by bacteria and parasites and were mostly caused by children
having fecal accidents in the water, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said. Rachel Barwick, an epidemiologist in the division of parasitic
diseases at the CDC, said swimming water should never be swallowed because
chlorine does not kill all germs. And anyone with diarrhea should not swim.

<HEADLINE> Greene County twins accused of sexually abusing, filming young boys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, N.Y.(AP) -- Twenty-two-year-old twin brothers from were
indicted Thursday on charges they sodomized and sexually abused 2-
and 5-year-old young boys, then put the acts on film.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster County District Attorney Donald A. Williams said the
investigation against Jason and Mark Vogt of Ancram, 20 miles east
of Kingston, was continuing and that a grand jury would continue to
review evidence against them during next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Vogt faces charges including sodomy, sexual abuse, using a
child in a sexual performance and possessing a sexual performance
by a child, all felonies involving a 2-year-old child. Jason Vogt
faces charges including sodomy involving sexual intercourse with a
5-year-old child, sodomy involving a 2-year-old child, sexual abuse
involving both a 5-year-old child and 2-year-old child and
possessing a sexual performance by a child, all felonies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its incomprehensible ... to have two twin brothers allegedly
engage in these acts,'' Williams told the Kingston Daily Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   One of the defense attorneys, William R.S. Myers of Woodstock
said ''it's not often you see someone at college level being
charged with these types of offenses. Unfortunately, it happens
more often than we realize, but not by this type of a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers were recently enrolled at New Paltz state college.
</P>
<P>
   Searches of the Vogts' parents' home, a residence in Kingston,
and Jason Vogt's car turned up videotapes, photographs, and
numerous downloaded computer images depicting deviant sexual
intercourse with adults and children, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The sodomy charges that they currently face carry a maximum
sentence of 25 years in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said four children were involved in the alleged acts
but that the evidence points to sexual contact with only two of
them and that Jason Vogt faces similar charges in a neighboring
county and in a neighboring state.

<HEADLINE> Astros 10, Phillies 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Jeff Bagwell, Ken Caminiti and Mitch Meluskey
each hit two-run homers, and Richard Hidalgo had a solo shot as the
Houston Astros rallied twice Thursday night to beat the
Philadelphia Phillies 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burrell, who made his major league debut a night earlier,
hit his first career homer, and Bobby Abreu and Desi Relaford also
connected for the Phillies. Burrell, the No. 1 pick in the 1998
amateur draft, went 1-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 84 home runs have been hit in 22 games at Enron
Field, 42 by the Astros. Last year, 118 were hit all season in the
Astrodome, 65 by Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton (3-1) won despite allowing six runs and seven hits
-- three of them homers -- in six innings. Joe Slusarki finished with
one-hit relief for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ashby (2-5) was tagged for eight runs, seven earned, and
nine hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies manager Terry Francona was ejected in the third for
arguing balls and strikes with plate umpire Doug Eddings, the first
ejection of a Phillie this season. Coach Chuck Cottier was ejected
in the ninth inning for arguing a call at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which wasted 2-0 and 4-3 leads, went ahead in the
first on Abreu's two-run homer, his third home run in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Houston took a 3-2 lead in the bottom half on Bagwell's two-run
shot and Hidalgo's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Relaford's two-run triple gave Philadelphia a 4-3 lead in the
fourth, but the Astros went ahead for good in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo's 15th homer tied it, Roger Cedeno hit a run-scoring
infield single to third, and another run scored on Burrell's
throwing error at first.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti homered in the fifth to make it 8-4. Burrell and
Relaford hit solo shots in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey homered in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Burrell is 3-for-9 with a home run, a triple and three RBIs
in two games. ... Cedeno injured his hand sliding into first on a
close play in the fourth and left the game.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Abbott Struck in Face  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Seattle Mariners pitcher Paul Abbott fractured
his nose when he was struck in the face by a broken bat in the
fourth inning of Thursday night's game against Baltimore and needed
eight stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott's 0-1 pitch to Baltimore's Harold Baines was grounded
back to the mound, breaking the head of Baines' bat. As Abbott
lowered his hands to field the grounder, the broken piece of the
bat struck him on the right side of the face.
</P>
<P>
   The ball caromed off Abbott's left leg and rolled to Mariners'
first baseman John Olerud, who tagged Baines for the out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen it happen to a third baseman, when the bat goes out
and keeps the third baseman from fielding the ball,'' Olerud said.
''I know bats can come real close to the pitcher. But it's real
scary -- a jagged piece coming at you with some force.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott lay on the mound for several minutes before rising on his
own power. He left the field on a stretcher while much of the crowd
at Camden Yards cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, who was replaced by Frankie Rodriguez, allowed three
hits and one run in 3 1-3 innings and left with the score 1-1.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Fan Files Suit After Brawl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A Chicago Cubs fan arrested in last week's brawl
with the Los Angeles Dodgers at Wrigley Field filed a lawsuit
Thursday against Dodgers' players and both teams, claiming that he
sustained neck and shoulder strains.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Camacho, a 32-year-old construction supervisor, was one
of three men arrested on disorderly conduct charges following the
May 16 melee that was sparked when a fan allegedly struck Dodgers
catcher Chad Kreuter in the back of his head and snatched his cap
as Kreuter sat in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho said Kreuter choked him while other Dodgers struck him.
Camacho said he was then carted off by security guards, held for
three hours at the park and turned over to police. He noted no
criminal charges were filed against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed late Thursday in Cook County Circuit Court,
names all 19 suspended Dodgers players and coaches. It also accuses
the Cubs organization of failing to provide adequate security, of
falsely imprisoning Camacho and of failing to provide him with
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unprecedented for major league baseball players to go
into the stands of a baseball park, acting in concert and with the
intent to injure spectators,'' the suit said. The players ''acted
as if they were common thugs and goons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers said they would have no comment on pending
litigation. Calls made to Camacho's lawyer, Karen Conti, and the
Cubs were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have sent a letter to season ticket holders announcing
that beer sales at Wrigley will be curtailed and security increased
in response to the fight.

<HEADLINE> Hijacker Killed After Plane Robbery  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A crying man tried to hijack a
Philippine Airlines jet carrying 291 people Thursday, then robbed
everyone and jumped out of the plane wearing a homemade parachute.
His body was found later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacker moved from bathroom to bathroom toward the front of
the Airbus 330, complaining of a stomachache, finally reaching the
cockpit, where he announced the hijacking minutes before the
scheduled landing, passengers said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a grenade and a pistol, the man -- who had donned a
ski mask and swimming goggles -- ordered the pilot of PAL Flight
PR812 to return to Davao City in the southern Philippines. The
pilot responded that he did not have enough fuel, Manila airport
general manager Antonio Gana said. Davao City is about 600 miles
from the capital, Manila.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the weeping and distraught hijacker fired a shot
inside the cockpit, perhaps accidentally, said Emmanuel Generoso,
one of the three pilots aboard, as tired-looking passengers
streamed off the plane behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very tense,'' Generoso said. ''I don't think there's
any political implications there. He had family problems, he needed
the money, so that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane was depressurized to permit the hijacker to jump with
a homemade parachute while it circled 28 miles from Manila at 6,000
feet, PAL spokesman Rolando Estabillo said. Police searched the
hilly area after he jumped.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers recovered the body of hijacker, identified as Augusto
Lakandula, in a heavily forested area after residents reported
seeing a man in a parachute landing on Thursday afternoon, Gen.
Jose Lachica said.
</P>
<P>
   His body was found in the town of Real, Quezon province, about
40 miles east of Manila, radio reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The improvised parachute was with him but not the bag of money
he took from the others aboard the plane, Lachica said.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking recalled the case of the legendary D.B. Cooper,
who took over a Northwest Orient Airlines flight on Nov. 24, 1971,
demanding $200,000. After getting the money, he parachuted from the
plane over Washington state. He hasn't been heard from since,
although $5,880 of his loot was found on the banks of the Columbia
River in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A rash of similar skyjackings followed, but the culprits were
caught.
</P>
<P>
   ''D.B. Cooper was the only one who was ever successful hijacking
and we don't even know if he survived,'' said Dan Poynter, author
of ''Parachuting: The Skydiver's Handbook.'' ''For somebody to go
out the side door of that aircraft, I just think he's probably a
skydiver and there aren't that many skydivers in the Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said the man collected all the money he could from
passengers before jumping.
</P>
<P>
   ''D.B. Cooper extorted money and this guy robbed the passengers,
which is an interesting twist,'' Poynter said. ''You can get the
money and get out quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   A flight attendant said he opened the door and even had to push
the man out. Mike Turoff, a commercial pilot in Houston and
co-author with Poynter, said the Airbus can slow down to below 200
mph but that is still more than twice the recommended speed for
skydiving.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you try to get out on your own, you really need a running
start,'' Turoff said. ''Pity this flight attendant that helped him.
Talk about being in mortal danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the body was found, the pilot Generosa said he doubted
the man could have survived the jump. Turoff said it's possible but
very risky.
</P>
<P>
   The jet landed -- with the side door still open -- at the Manila
airport about 2{ hours after starting what should have been a
90-minute trip, and all 277 passengers and 13 crew left the plane
safely, PAL said.

<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ethiopia's capital erupted in a
singing, dancing, horn-honking celebration Thursday at word the
military had broken Eritrea's army in a border showdown that could
prove the most pivotal battle of the 2-year-old Horn of Africa war.
</P>
<P>
   But what Ethiopia called a rout, Eritrea called a withdrawal --
not a surrender -- and probably not yet an end to the fighting that
is consuming lives and resources of two of the world's most
impoverished nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eritrea has decided, for the sake of peace, to accept the
appeal ... for de-escalation,'' Eritrea announced early Thursday
after a punishing 2-day Ethiopian attack on its central front. The
government declared it had begun a full withdrawal from all seized
territory in compliance with an African diplomatic appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things are not what they appear on the ground,'' Eritrean
presidential spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel insisted, as Eritrean
troops spilled out of their strongholds at the front. ''Ethiopia is
gaining territory, but losing the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopians awoke Thursday to state radio playing martial music,
announcing that the nation's flag was flying once again over
Zalambessa, a heavily fortified border town seized by Eritrea when
the war broke out in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Eritrean army was demolished,'' the Ethiopian government
declared. ''Those few troops that managed to survive the thrashing
are being chased and destroyed by the heroic Ethiopian forces as
they run for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The news sent Ethiopians spilling into the streets of their
capital, Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
   Students skipped school for an impromptu rally in the city
center, where exultant drivers drove in circles, pounding on their
car horns. Civilians sang and chanted and cheered passing army
vehicles, waving the country's tricolor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The war will continue until every inch of Ethiopian territory
is liberated,'' declared a city administrator, Ali Abdo, addressing
the crowd from atop a police cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasts carried messages of congratulations from mothers and
fathers to sons at the front.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia launched an artillery, aircraft and infantry drive into
Eritrea on May 12 that it said would end only when it had destroyed
Eritrea's army and retaken all disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, it opened an assault to retake land in the area of the
mountaintop town of Zalambessa -- saying it was the key to a quick
victory in its offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after letting reporters visit Zalambessa, Eritrea began
what it insisted was a voluntary withdrawal. But Ethiopia scoffed
at the announcement, saying the retreat was a rout and claiming the
withdrawal from the other areas was a sham.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman Haile Kiros Gessesse said late Thursday
that Ethiopia was pressing the fight and would keep doing so until
Eritrea gave up its last stretch of disputed land.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council on Thursday welcomed Eritrea's
announcement of withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   After cheering young men and boys headed to the fighting
Wednesday, Eritreans gathered around cafe televisions Thursday to
watch cable news footage of the jubilation in Ethiopia's capital,
then turned away glumly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Eritrea's withdrawal from Zalambessa, a woman in
Asmara began berating Ethiopia for killing Eritrean women and
children, her voice rising until she bolted away in tears, her
child in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea, which achieved independence from Ethiopia seven years
ago, seized the disputed land along the 620-mile border in 1998
claiming sovereignty under old colonial-era boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting since then has cost tens of thousands of lives and
hundreds of millions of dollars, with Eritrea -- a country of 4
million and Ethiopia -- a country of 60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both nations have been widely accused of pursuing the war at the
expense of the needs of their people, including millions threatened
by a 3-year-old drought.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of African Unity said this month's fighting
alone killed thousands. The offensive uprooted an estimated
half-million Eritreans, and brought the country's economy to its
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Envoys from the OAU and European Union flew back and forth
between capitals this week to press for a cease-fire and talks.
Eritrea said its withdrawal came under an OAU framework peace plan
to which both sides have agreed but neither has signed.
</P>
<P>
   Before the most recent fighting, both sides were at odds over
terms for implementing the accord. Efforts to stop the fighting
continued late Thursday, with Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika traveling from Addis Ababa to Asmara to confer with
Eritrean leader Isaias Afewerki.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in Insider Trading Case  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An X-rated movie actress who allegedly got
inside stock tips from the chief executive of a respected Wall
Street company has been arrested in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn B. Gannon, known as ''Marylin Star'' in X-rated movies
and publications, was arrested on insider trading charges Wednesday
at her Vancouver, British Columbia, residence, according to U.S.
Attorney Mary Jo White.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon appeared in a Canadian court Thursday and was released on
$50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, 31, had been a fugitive since she was charged in
December along with James McDermott Jr., the former chief executive
officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, a firm that specialized in bank
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott was convicted last month of securities fraud for
giving Gannon inside information, prompting her to allegedly buy
six stocks illegally. She was accused of then giving the
information to a third defendant, Anthony Pomponio, who also was
convicted in the conspiracy. Both men were having extramarital
affairs with Gannon at the time, lawyers in the case have said.
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio and Gannon allegedly made $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Shapiro, Gannon's lawyer, did not immediately return a
telephone message for comment.
</P>
<P>
   He said after McDermott's conviction that the verdict did not
mean his client is guilty of the conspiracy and securities fraud
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indeed, she is not and she intends to contest them
vigorously,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Attack Russian peacekeepers  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Gunmen attacked Russian peacekeepers
in Kosovo for a second straight day, following a scuffle between
Moscow's soldiers and a former commander of ethnic Albanian rebels,
NATO spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers fired about 30 machine gun rounds into the Russian
camp at Kijevo, about 20 miles south of the capital, Pristina, NATO
said. No one was injured in the early evening attack Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A German mechanized infantry platoon equipped with armored
reconnaissance vehicles has moved in to reinforce the Russians,
NATO reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks were apparent retaliation for a scuffle Tuesday
between Ramush Haradinaj, a former regional commander with the
Kosovo Liberation Army, and peacekeepers at a checkpoint in central
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-led peacekeepers have staunchly defended the behavior of
the Russians and German military police who stopped Haradinaj in
the town of Lozica, 30 miles from Pristina and detained him because
the two guns in his car did not have the proper paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers have said Haradinaj tried to escape and take
the weapon of one of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The machine gun attack at the camp followed a series of other
incidents late Tuesday in which two Russian soldiers were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a fledgling rebel movement in southern Serbia claimed
that Yugoslav police and army units were launching fresh attacks on
ethnic Albanians in the area just outside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel commander who insisted on being identified only by his
alias, ''Bajram,'' told Associated Press Television News that
Yugoslav forces attacked four villages in the Presevo Valley during
the last week. The area is located just across the boundary from
the part of Kosovo patrolled by U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Army spokesman confirmed sporadic reports of mortar and
machine-gun fire Wednesday, but could not say whether an offensive
was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials have repeatedly expressed alarm over the
volatile situation in the Presevo Valley, which has a substantial
ethnic Albanian population. The militants say they have been forced
to defend themselves and their villages from Serb police, who have
stepped up operations within the area.

<HEADLINE> Monitoring at Los Alamos Lab Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Environmentalists are demanding an
independent analysis and regular monitoring of radiation levels on
the fire-ravaged land around Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   A federal air-monitoring team last week reported elevated
background radiation levels, which it said would be normal when
vegetation burns. But the levels, in some cases 2 to 10 times
higher than normal, triggered concern among some New Mexico
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're calling for an independent citizens review board to
assess the monitoring data and risks, and we want a long-term
health study of people exposed to the smoke,'' Suzanne Westerly,
director of Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety in Santa Fe, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian nuclear and atmospheric scientist Sergei Pashchenko, a
consultant to a non-governmental group which works to ban weapons
containing depleted uranium, said he analyzed the limited data
available on the lab's Internet site and determined it could not be
discounted as naturally occurring effects of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Lab spokesman Kevin Roark had no comment on the claims but said
he wasn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time we put out data, the activist groups dispute it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfires burned more than 48,000 acres and destroyed more
than 200 homes near the labs in northern New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Assassin Demands New Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lawyers for convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan
demanded a new trial in federal court Thursday, one day after the
California Supreme Court rejected a similar request.
</P>
<P>
   In a petition nearly 300 pages long, Sirhan's attorney said his
client was innocent of the 1968 slaying of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy,
who was fatally shot moments after declaring victory in the
California presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prosecution's entire case was based upon fraudulent
evidence, said attorney Lawrence Teeter. ''Overwhelming physical
evidence of multiple shooter, extra bullets and extra guns was
systematically destroyed by the police. Witnesses were intimidated.
Physical evidence was altered or substituted.''
</P>
<P>
   The petition, filed in U.S. District Court, seeks a new
evidentiary hearing and ultimately a new trial. It contends police
substituted another bullet for the one recovered from Kennedy's
neck.
</P>
<P>
   It also claims prosecutors covered up evidence that as many as
three weapons were used and a second gunman was involved in the
killing of Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department had no comment on the action,
said Officer Jason Lee, a police spokesman. A message left Thursday
night with the District Attorney's office was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Sirhan, who is serving a life sentence for killing the New York
Democrat, has been denied parole 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   He has repeatedly asserted his innocence, claiming he was in a
hypnotic state at the time of the shooting and that a second gunman
might have actually killed Kennedy. The second gunman theory was
rejected in 1975 when a Superior Court judge presided over a
re-examination of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the state Supreme Court decided on a 6-0 vote not
to re-examine Sirhan's case, saying his 1997 state court petition
was untimely and without merit.
